Ethiopia, Eritrea Open Talks
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) -- Ethiopia opened talks with Eritrea on Tuesday,
saying it had already won most of its aims through war and boasting that its
18-day offensive had forced its humbled neighbor to seek peace. Ethiopia
announced hours before the talks started in Algiers that it was withdrawing from
one front seized in the latest flare-up of the Horn of Africa countries'
2-year-old border war. But a rumble of artillery in the jagged mountains of
southern Eritrea indicated the conflict may not yet be over.

   HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Former Gov. Robert P. Casey, the strong-willed
Scranton Irishman who spoke passionately against abortion and overcame 20 years
of dashed hopes to become governor, died Tuesday. He was 68. Casey suffered from
a genetic condition called familial amyloidosis, which forced him to undergo a
rare heart-liver transplant in 1993. In 1997, Casey was diagnosed with prostate
cancer and underwent radiation treatments.

Alaska Air Plans To Fire Two Pilots
</SUBHEAD>

   SEATTLE (AP) -- Alaska Airlines said Tuesday it will fire two pilots for
continuing a flight after they failed to properly pressurize the cabin. The
action by the pilots left about half the passengers without an emergency oxygen
source and could have caused death or brain damage if the aircraft had lost
pressure during the high-altitude portion of the March 25 flight, a Federal
Aviation Administration inspector has said. The airline notified the pilots,
Capt. Michael Alan Reese, 56, and First Officer Vincent Emile Danet, 38, of its
intent to fire them, Alaska Airlines spokesman Jack Evans said.

Fiji Military Tosses Constitution

   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Fiji's new military leaders threw out the nation's
constitution Tuesday and began negotiating with armed rebels whose seizure of
the prime minister and other hostages has sparked ethnic and political turmoil
in this Pacific nation. Rebel supporters hurled rocks at cars as military
officials met with the rebels in Suva, the capital. Meanwhile, the 11-day-old
hostage standoff continued among the lush, tropical gardens and swaying palm
trees of Fiji's nearby parliament complex. The rebels want Prime Minister
Mahendra Chaudhry, Fiji's first prime minister from the ethnic Indian minority,
removed from power and Fijians of Indian ancestry barred from leading the
country again.

<HEADLINE> Hershiser Works Out Glitches  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) -- Orel Hershiser, intent on making a
contribution to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the second half of the
season, made his first appearance in a minor league game in nine
years Tuesday night for Class-A San Bernardino.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser pitched six innings against Lancaster, allowing one
unearned run and four hits. He threw 71 pitches -- 49 for strikes --
while allowing a walk and striking out two.
</P>
<P>
   He left the game trailing 1-0, but the Stampede tied it in the
bottom of the sixth with a home run. Hershiser's next scheduled
start for San Bernardino will be on June 5 at Rancho Cucamonga.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser, who was demoted to the bullpen last month and hasn't
pitched for the Dodgers since May 9, asked general manager Kevin
Malone on more than one occasion to option him to the minors. His
desire was to get in some competitive work and correct the flaws
that led to a 10.70 ERA and a 1-2 record in seven appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Under baseball's collective bargaining agreement, the 18-year
major league veteran could have refused to be sent to the minors.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser, 41, has not pitched in a game since May 9, and
struggled with control problems -- tying a modern major league
record by hitting four batters in just 1 1-3 innings on April 19
against Houston at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser was the 1988 Cy Young winner and World Series MVP
after pitching a major league record 59 consecutive scoreless
innings that season. He has a career record of 204-147, including a
career-high 23 wins in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's outing marked Hershiser's first appearance in the
minors since 1991, when he made four starts for three Dodgers' farm
teams in his rehabilitation from reconstructive shoulder surgery.
Other than that, he hasn't pitched in the minors in 17 years, since
he first came up to the Dodgers.

<HEADLINE> Lazio campaign maps strategy for beating Hillary Clinton  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- New York Republicans say if Rick Lazio
wants a shot at being the state's next United States senator, he's
going to have to be a regular visitor to upstate New York
</P>
<P>
   ''I think upstate wants to support him, they want to know more
about him,'' said Jim Mumpton of Rome. ''I think the anti-Hillary
vote is out there ... and now with just a little more oomph, I
think he can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In accepting his party's nomination to run against Democrat
Hillary Rodham Clinton on Tuesday, Lazio emphasized his home-town
boy image while painting his opponent as an outsider.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have one advantage she will never have: I can be myself,''
Lazio told Republicans at the state Republican Party nominating
convention. ''I am a New Yorker.''
</P>
<P>
   The little-known four-term congressman from Long Island also
sought to deflect criticism from the Clinton camp, which has
portrayed him as a radical right-winger.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some in the opposition camp think they have a winning strategy
to repeat Newt Gingrich's name a thousand times between now and
November,'' he said. ''Well, let me share with you my winning
strategy: Let the other side pursue the politics of discord and
division.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean Kosty, the Schuyler County chairwoman and Watkins Glen
village clerk and treasurer, said she was enthusiastic about Lazio,
but that he needs to get himself known.
</P>
<P>
   ''His past record certainly speaks for itself,'' said Kosty. ''I
think he needs a little more name recognition. He has to come out
and visit everyone upstate, so they get to know him. Most people in
our area will be very impressed with his family values.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Donald, chimed in: ''And he's from New York
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean Kosty said she is actually happier with Lazio than
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that Mayor Giuliani did a lot for the city, there's no
question about that,'' she said. ''But I think there is more than
the city to New York and I think Lazio will get the downstate
people, where he's from, and will have a better chance of getting
the upstate vote because he's gonna take the time and come and
visit us. I don't know if Rudy would have done that.''

<HEADLINE> Bausch &AMP; Lomb loses out as CIBA Vision buys Wesley Jessen for $785 million </HEADLINE>
By BEN DOBBIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Bausch &AMP; Lomb Inc. abandoned its pursuit
of Wesley Jessen VisionCare Inc. after the Des Plaines, Ill.-based
cosmetic contact lens maker revealed it had accepted a $785 million
buyout offer from CIBA Vision.
</P>
<P>
   The deal announced Tuesday with Atlanta-based CIBA, the eye-care
unit of Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis, tops a sweetened but
hostile bid valued at about $725 million that Bausch &AMP; Lomb Inc.
made for Wesley Jessen on May 8.
</P>
<P>
   Novartis said the combined CIBA-Wesley Jessen would be the
world's second largest contact lens company, with combined annual
sales of $1.4 billion and a work force of 8,900.
</P>
<P>
   In approving CIBA's cash offer of $38.50 a share in cash, Wesley
Jessen's board broke off its proposed merger with Ocular Sciences
Inc. and paid the contact lens company in South San Francisco a $25
million termination fee.
</P>
<P>
   Bausch &AMP; Lomb's ''best and final'' bid of $35.55 a share in cash
had been set to expire today. But the eye-care company, which has
strength in premium disposable lenses, cited the definitive
agreement between Wesley Jessen and CIBA in withdrawing its offer.
</P>
<P>
   Chief executive William Carpenter said ''we considered the
acquisition of Wesley Jessen to be strategically appropriate ...
but only at a price that is attractive to the Bausch &AMP; Lomb
shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Wesley Jessen controls about two-thirds of the highly profitable
cosmetic color-lens market. It had $311.7 million in sales last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The CIBA offer represents a 55 percent premium over Wesley
Jessen's closing price March 22, the last trading day before Bausch
&AMP; Lomb announced its original, $34-a-share bid.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is expected to be completed in the third quarter and is
subject to 51 percent of the Wesley Jessen shares being tendered to
Novartis as well as other regulatory and customary conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley Jessen has postponed indefinitely its annual shareholder
meeting, which was scheduled for June 23.

<HEADLINE> Lazio fills day to get name, message out  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Rick Lazio talked economics with supporters
over breakfast, laid out his platform for Republican women at lunch
and blew kisses at a baseball park in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio is determined to raise his recognition level while
accepting his party's U.S. Senate nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Standing amid supporters at a meet-the-candidate lunch Tuesday
he declared ''we have 150 days ... to prove who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidate who promised to go ''block by block, house by
house'' to earn the support of New Yorkers could have started with
the little dry cleaning store next door to the luncheon site.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't heard of him,'' said Suzanna Mancuso, who was
vacuuming the store while the Long Island congressman geared up to
accept his party's nomination later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio had the support of passer-by Chris Weinert -- not for who
he is, but for who he isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll vote against Hillary Rodham Clinton,'' Weinert said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a start.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio filled his day with a handful of campaign stops in hopes
of wooing crucial upstate voters, the majority of whom had not
heard his name until he stepped into the race 11 days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   He started by talking policy over cherry danish with Erie County
Executive Joel Giambra and about a dozen Buffalo-area residents at
a Greek restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   He finished with by boarding his shiny new ''Mainstream
Express'' bus -- unveiled in a sea of red, white and blue confetti,
streamers and fireworks -- and setting out on a three-day tour of
the state.
</P>
<P>
   To several potential voters yet unfamiliar with Lazio's
politics, his strongest attribute appeared to be his status as a
New York native, a point he stressed often.
</P>
<P>
   ''The main thing is the fact that he's a New Yorker. He wants to
keep a New Yorker in office. So do I,'' said Sam Filippone, who was
among those who had breakfast with Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hillary Clinton was probably all right when she was in
Arkansas,'' Filippone said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a good place for her,'' chimed his brother, Robert.
</P>
<P>
   ''But this is New York,'' Sam Filippone finished.
</P>
<P>
   After breakfast, it was on to lunch with the ''Women for
Lazio,'' where he shook hands and traded small talk at the
$25-a-plate luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Nickola hadn't heard much about Lazio before he replaced
Giuliani, but she liked what she saw so far.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's come out swinging,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Lazio hits the trail in the ''Mainstream Express''  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Riding his ''Mainstream Express'' campaign
bus, newly nominated Republican Senate candidate Rick Lazio has set
off across New York in search of votes for his battle against
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Pledging to take ''our message of hope, opportunity and
responsibility'' on the road, the Long Island congressman was the
unanimous pick Tuesday of his party's state convention to take on
the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   With the ''Rocky'' theme blaring from loudspeakers and sporting
a fat lip courtesy of a tumble during a Memorial Day parade on
Monday, Lazio took the convention stage at a Buffalo hotel to
declare: ''I am the underdog in this race.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My opponent is better financed and better known. She comes to
New York with the support of every left-wing special interest, from
Washington insiders to the Hollywood elite,'' Lazio told more than
400 cheering delegates and over 1,000 more in attendance in a more
than 25-minute speech.
</P>
<P>
   And, pressing a favorite Republican theme -- that Clinton is a
carpetbagger -- Lazio said, ''I have one advantage she'll never have
-- I can be myself. I am a New Yorker.''
</P>
<P>
   While not criticizing Clinton by name, Lazio accused ''the
opposition camp'' of practicing the ''politics of division ... It
is a bleak, angry place, built of fear. And I will not go there.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said the congressman
had ''offered the people of New York recycled insults and rhetoric
that doesn't match his record. Time and time again Rick Lazio has
voted against New York's working families in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hillary Clinton has been running an inclusive campaign since
day one and fighting for children and families for thirty years,''
Wolfson added. ''New Yorkers will always be able to count on
Hillary to stand up for them in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Emulating Bill Clinton's successful 1992 presidential campaign
and Sen. John McCain's failed run for the White House this year,
Lazio left the convention for a three-day bus trip across the state
on his customized cruiser dubbed ''The Mainstream Express'' by
campaign aides who used to work on the McCain campaign. The
senator's bus was called ''The Straight Talk Express.''
</P>
<P>
   After a stop at a Buffalo baseball park for a rally Tuesday
evening, Lazio headed for Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the congressman planned to visit a Syracuse-area milk
plant before heading to the Finger Lakes for a stop at a winery and
a walk through the village of Wartkins Glen. Also scheduled was a
visit to the Corning Glass Museum and rallies in Elmira and
Binghamton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, meanwhile, planned a rally with supporters today in New
York City and a visit to a school in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   For Lazio, 42, the GOP nomination marked the culmination of a
dream that seemed dashed just nine months ago when Gov. George
Pataki convinced the congressman to suspend his fledgling Senate
campaign in favor of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's expected run.
</P>
<P>
   The dream was reborn on May 19 when the New York City mayor
announced he was leaving the Senate race because of prostate
cancer. Pataki and other Republican leaders quickly rallied around
the little-known Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Since entering the race, Lazio has been stressing his New York
roots, a none-too-subtle reminder that Clinton only moved into the
state in January. And, he has pointed to his record as a four-term
congressman who helped overhaul the nation's public housing system,
worked to protect the environment and voted to raise the minimum
wage.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton camp, on the other hand, portrays Lazio as a
conservative out of step with mainstream New Yorkers. Clinton aides
have repeatedly pointed to Lazio's support for eight out of 10
proposals from former House Speaker Newt Gingrich's ''Contract with
America.'' She has also taken her rival to task for saying he's a
supporter of abortion rights, noting he has regularly voted to cut
federal Medicaid funding for poor women's abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Clinton and Giuliani, Lazio has also come out in favor of
banning the late-term abortion procedure that critics called
''partial-birth abortion.'' That has cleared the way for him to
pick up the endorsement of the state's Conservative Party. No
Republican has won statewide office in New York since 1974 without
Conservative Party backing.

<HEADLINE> Boeing, Sikorsky Get Copter Contract  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOLSOM, Pa. (AP) -- The Army's next generation of armed
reconnaissance helicopter will be made by Boeing Co.'s helicopter
division in this Philadelphia suburb and at United Technologies
Corp.'s Sikorsky aircraft unit in Stratford, Conn., a Boeing
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The contract to make 13 RAH-66 Comanche helicopters is worth
$3.1 billion, Boeing spokeswoman Madelyn Bush said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a big deal for us because it helps us maintain our
employment base and gives us opportunity for future growth,'' Bush
told The Philadelphia Inquirer for Wednesday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing employs about 500 people at its helicopter plant to work
on the Comanche, and about 70 more people should be hired for it
over the next year, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing employees could be transferred from other areas of the
5,300-employee helicopter operations to the new Comanche jobs, Bush
said. If the new helicopter reaches full production by 2008, as
planned, about 1,200 Boeing workers are expected to be assigned to
the Comanche, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The contract is part of a helicopter modernization plan the Army
unveiled last month that affirmed a commitment to buy 1,213
new-generation Comanche reconnaissance helicopters for $38 billion
over the next 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopters will be assembled in at Boeing's helicopter
operations here and at Sikorsky's operations in Stratford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing and Sikorsky have been working together on the two-seat
helicopter for more than 10 years. It is designed to circumvent
radar and manage the flow of data among military personnel,
vehicles on the ground and aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Company and Army officials plan to sign the contract in
Huntsville, Ala., on Thursday, Bush said. The Army manages the
contract from Huntsville.

Court Expands Clean-Air Study
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court drew gasps from environmentalists and
praise from industry representatives Tuesday by expanding its review of a major
clean-air dispute. The justices said they will decide whether anti-pollution
regulations must take the costs of compliance -- not just health effects -- into
account. At stake is air quality nationwide. ''It's been a bedrock principle of
the Clean Air Act that the amount of pollution allowed in the air should depend
on how it affects the health of our children and the elderly,'' said Vickie
Patton, a lawyer with the group Environmental Defense. She said a change in the
clean air policy would ''tip the scales'' away from health and toward economic
concerns.

3,459.48 points -- the largest percentage gain ever for the index and the
second-largest point gain ever. Also on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average gained 227.89 points to close at 10,527.13 on Tuesday.

   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Petr Sykora scored twice in a four-point night
and Ken Daneyko, who has played every postseason game in Devils history, scored
his first playoff goal in five seasons as New Jersey defeated the Dallas Stars
7-3 Tuesday night. Sykora also assisted on Jason Arnott's two goals as the
Devils, attempting to become the first Eastern Conference team to win the
Stanley Cup since they did it five years ago, badly outplayed the defending
champions at their own game.

<HEADLINE> Devils' Daneyko Hits Surprise Goal  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Scott Niedermayer has a feeling
roommate Ken Daneyko isn't going to shut up for a while -- not after
scoring a goal.
</P>
<P>
   Daneyko ended a 48-game playoff scoring drought with probably
the biggest goal of his career by breaking a second-period tie and
helping the Devils to a surprisingly easy 7-3 victory over the
Dallas Stars in Game 1 of the Stanley Cup finals Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I kept telling the guys all season I was going to score, but I
was just saving it for a big occasion,'' said Daneyko, whose last
goal of any sort was 475 days ago against Vancouver on Feb. 9,
1999. ''I think their patience was running out with me.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal was only the fifth in 126 playoff games for Daneyko, a
15-year veteran who had scored only 34 in 1,070 career
regular-season games, but only 11 since the 1991-92 season.
</P>
<P>
   However, this one was as huge as any the Devils scored against
Ed Belfour and Manny Fernandez in the opener of the best-of-seven
series.
</P>
<P>
   It broke a 1-1 tie and ignited a three-goal second period that
helped New Jersey build a 7-1 lead early in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie center John Madden, who is playing despite problems with
his right knee, beat Guy Carbonneau on a faceoff in the left
circle.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Brylin got the puck on the left edge of the circle and
sent it back to Daneyko, who hesitated a split second and then
wound up and fired. His shot went right between the legs of Belfour
on what seemed like a soft goal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was surprised, any time I score I'm surprised,'' said
Daneyko, who jumped up and down like a little kid scoring his first
goal in pee-wees. ''Tonight the puck came to me a lot and
fortunately one went in. I'm not going to get too crazy. For a guy
like me, it's always nice to score, especially on a big occasion
like this.''
</P>
<P>
   His teammates loved it and they high-fived the 36-year-old as he
got to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kenny's goal was great,'' said captain Scott Stevens, who also
scored, possibly marking the first time he and ''Dano'' got goals
in the same game. ''When he shot I was on the bench. I was hoping
no one else touched it. I wanted to see him score.''
</P>
<P>
   Daneyko even laughed about his own reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ''I usually don't get too excited about goals, but I was pretty
excited after that one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So was goaltender Martin Brodeur. He has been teasing Daneyko
about his lack of scoring since being credited with a goal earlier
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was emotional for everyone to see him score,'' Brodeur
said. ''A big goal like this and the way he reacted. He deserves
what happens to him. He has been working hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Daneyko's last playoff goal had been in the opening game of the
Eastern Conference finals against the Philadelphia Flyers in 1995,
the only time the Devils won the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ''To tell you the truth I don't remember my goals because they
are so few and far between,'' Daneyko said.
</P>
<P>
   While Daneyko got a rare goal, the Devils' top line of Jason
Arnott, Petr Sykora and Patrik Elias continued to produce, with
Arnott and Sykora scoring two each. Brylin also scored in the
Devils' second biggest night in their playoff history.
</P>
<P>
   In the last four playoff games, Arnott, Sykora and Elias have
accounted for nine of the Devils' 15 goals.
</P>
<P>
   Elias' two in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals got the
Devils to the best-of-seven finals against the defending champion
Stars.
</P>
<P>
   However, Daneyko's goal at 2:53 of the second period ignited New
Jersey's explosion against the Stars, who only allowed six goals in
the final three games of the Western Conference finals against
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kenny's playing good defensively and it's really a bonus when
Kenny scores a goal,'' Sykora said.
</P>
<P>
   Not for Niedermayer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll definitely hear about it for a while,'' Niedermayer
said. ''He loves to talk about it and I'm sure I'll be hearing
about it for a while as his roommate.''

<HEADLINE> Stars Sluggish and Slow in Opener  </HEADLINE>
By IRA PODELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- If Ed Belfour's ears are as stuffed
up as his nose and head, maybe he didn't hear the taunts from the
New Jersey fans.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour, who is fighting a cold with decongestants and
antibiotics, was shelled Tuesday night in the opener of the Stanley
Cup finals -- allowing six goals on 18 shots as the Devils beat the
Dallas Stars 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll try to get over it and feel better for the next game,''
Belfour said. ''I think we're all hoping to get that game over as
soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The goalie said the medication affected his judgment. At what
point did he realize it might not be his night?
</P>
<P>
   ''After six goals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour, who excelled in his battle against Colorado's Patrick
Roy in the Western Conference finals, looked no better than
ordinary in the rout. In beating the Avalanche, Belfour stopped all
but 13 of Colorado's 204 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they played a pretty good offensive game and I
definitely wasn't on my game, making the stops I should be
making,'' Belfour said of his night against New Jersey. ''I didn't
have much energy out there for myself and I don't think our team
played with a lot of energy either.''
</P>
<P>
   As the bombardment got worse, Devils fans serenaded him with
derisive chants of ''Bel-four, Bel-four.'' When he finally left
with 16:58 remaining, in favor of backup Manny Fernandez, the crowd
chanted ''Ed-die, Ed-die'' and ''Marty's Better,'' saluting New
Jersey goalie Martin Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Stars' fans who made Roy's life unpleasant by
creating a ''Belfour's Better'' chant.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour had gone eight straight games allowing two goals or
fewer, just two games shy of his own NHL playoff record set in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Not only didn't the Stars start the series at home, they didn't
really start at all.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas, looking tired and slow, began a playoff series on the
road for the first time since the 1995 conference quarterfinals
against Detroit. The Stars, who lost to the Red Wings in five
games, held home-ice advantage for their next 11 series.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour allowed three goals in the second period on just nine
shots as New Jersey broke open a 1-1 game. Two of the goals can be
pinned on Belfour, who was beaten twice on long shots by
defensemen.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think Eddie has bad games,'' Stars right wing Mike
Keane said. ''We didn't help him very much. Ed Belfour is not due
for a bad game. We have to play better in front of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Daneyko, who had not scored in the regular season or
playoffs, got a slap shot from the left point to trickle between
Belfour's pads and give the Devils a 3-1 lead 2:52 into the middle
period.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour, who had a sparkling 1.82 goals-against-average versus
Colorado, looked even worse when Scott Stevens made it 4-1 with
3:56 left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Pandolfo carried the puck into the Dallas zone and dropped
it to Stevens, who skated in just above the left circle and fired a
shot that got under Belfour's left pad.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm definitely going to come to the rink with the attitude to
play a lot better and make those saves, and try and play the best
game I can,'' Belfour said.
</P>
<P>
   Things didn't get any better in the third, but Belfour didn't
stick around too long. Sergei Brylin scored at 2:21 and Petr Sykora
got his second of the game to chase Belfour at 3:02.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, it was 6-1 and things weren't going my way,'' Belfour
said of his removal. ''I think Hitch (coach Ken Hitchcock) realized
it was time to get me out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez allowed his only goal 2:10 later when Jason Arnott got
his second of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas defenseman Darryl Sydor got the Stars even at 1 at 13:13
of the first. Jon Sim, playing in place of injured forward Jamie
Langenbrunner, made it 7-2 at 7:43 of the third. Kirk Muller, a
former New Jersey first-round draft pick, scored his second goal
just 12 seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   But by then the damage had long been done.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's pretty simple, we got outplayed in every area,'' Stars
center Joe Nieuwendyk said. ''They just took it to us and we didn't
respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars defenseman Derian Hatcher left the game in the third
period with a leg injury. The Stars said their captain had a slight
hyperextension of his right knee and he is expected to play in Game
2.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars don't have the time or the need to hang their heads.
Last year Dallas became the 13th team to rally from losing the
opener to win the Cup. Game 2 is Thursday night back at the
Continental Airlines Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just one game and definitely a wake-up call for all of
us,'' Belfour said. ''We have to play a lot better.''

<HEADLINE> Trail Blazers 96, Lakers 88  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- There will be no celebration in Los Angeles.
Not yet, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen and the rest of the Portland Trail Blazers
stunned the Lakers with a 96-88 victory Tuesday night to stay alive
in the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   With Los Angeles up 3-2, the series shifts back to Portland for
Game 6 on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to have to take a little more time to win this
series,'' Lakers coach Phil Jackson said. ''I think that's good for
us as a basketball team. This team hasn't grown enough to
understand the subtleties'' of these situations.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers lost two in a row at home for the first time all
season. A team so poised and confident in their weekend sweep in
Portland might have been a safe bet to clinch its first trip to the
NBA Finals since 1991 with a homecourt victory.
</P>
<P>
   But Portland never trailed. Despite dislocating two fingers on
his left hand late in the first quarter when he was called for an
offensive foul against Robert Horry, Pippen had 22 points, six
steals and four blocked shots. In the process, Pippen broke Michael
Jordan's record for career playoff steals with 380. Jordan's record
was 376.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's just Pip being a warrior. This is no time to sit out,''
Portland's Rasheed Wallace said. ''Like the other night when I hurt
my ankle. That team is just too tough for us to sit out.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he told Pippen he shouldn't even have been playing
in the game after what the coach called a ''cheap-shot elbow''
thrown at John Salley late in Portland's homecourt loss in Game 4
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a presence who shouldn't have been there,'' Jackson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, fined $10,000 for the incident, was unimpressed by
Jackson's opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Phil is not my coach. I'm not listening to nothing you tell me
about Phil. Have a good day,'' said Pippen, who then left the
postgame news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace was just 7-for-21 from the field, but scored 22 points,
including seven of eight free throws, and grabbed 10 rebounds.
Steve Smith added 13 points, and Arvydas Sabonis 12. Two reserves
who barely caused a ripple in the series, Brian Grant and Detlef
Schrempf, added nine each.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal did his best to make it the big night everyone
expected with 31 points and 21 rebounds. Ron Harper added 14
points.
</P>
<P>
   But Kobe Bryant made only four of 13 shots, scored 17 points and
committed six turnovers before fouling out with 4:45 to play. Glen
Rice was 1-for-8 from the field and 0-for-5 from 3-point range,
finishing with four points.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers were just 6-for-27 from 3-point range and shot 38
percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mike Dunleavy's defensive tactic of double- and
triple-teaming O'Neal and leaving others open worked to near
perfection.
</P>
<P>
   ''This game validates what we've been trying to do,'' Dunleavy
said. ''This is a high-risk business. We're leaving a lot of guys
open.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though they never led, the Lakers were just a short run
away from taking the lead through most of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 80-67 entering the fourth quarter, the Lakers mounted
one challenge. Bryant sank two free throws with 10:02 to play, then
scored on a layup and was fouled, making it 82-74 with 9:33
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal waved his arms to get the crowd roaring, but after a
timeout, Bryant missed the free throw. Grant scored inside and was
fouled by Robert Horry for a three-point play to boost the lead
back to 87-76, and the Lakers were finished.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles closed to 72-67 on Harper's reverse layup with 1:52
left in the third. But the Lakers followed with three consecutive
turnovers, and the Blazers scored the final eight points of the
period.
</P>
<P>
   Smith sank a 13-footer from the baseline, Wallace made two free
throws and Schrempf scored inside on a pass from Wallace to make it
78-67 with 59 seconds to go in the quarter. The Blazers got the
ball again and missed twice, but got the rebound both times.
Schrempf's two free throws with 1.2 seconds left made it 80-67.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are 43-7 at home this season, but three of those
losses came against Portland.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers led 52-45 at the break on Pippen's 3-pointer at the
halftime buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers shot 31 percent in the first half, 22 percent in the
second quarter (4-for-18). O'Neal kept Los Angeles close with 15
points and nine rebounds in the first two quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers were 3-for-13 from 3-point range in the first half,
but made 14 of 15 free throws, while Portland was 11-for-17 at the
line.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen scored 12 in the first quarter on 5-for-5 shooting, but
was only 2-for-5 at the foul line. After injuring his finger, he
didn't take another shot until his 3-pointer at the halftime
buzzer.
</P>
<P>
Notes: O'Neal made his first three free throws to run his string
to 15 without a miss over three games. ... Pippen was fined $10,000
by the NBA Tuesday for hitting John Salley in the back of the head
with a forearm late in Game 4. ... Portland was 9-for-15 at the
foul line in the first quarter, while Los Angeles was 3-for-3. ...
The Lakers were called for 11 fouls in the first quarter, three
apiece on Harper and Brian Shaw and two apiece on Bryant and Rice.
... Smith drew three fouls in 1{ minutes in the second quarter. ...
Robert Horry was 0-for-6 from the field in the first half. ...
Midway through the first quarter, referee Joe Crawford called a
technical on Wallace, his first since he was thrown out of Game 1
with two technicals.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Todd Helton finally didn't have a multihit game.
And he still drove in the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   After the Rockies wasted a four-run lead, Helton put Colorado
ahead for good with a bases-loaded walk in the eighth inning as the
Rockies beat the Houston Astros 10-7 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Helton, who leads the major leagues with a .420 average, went
1-for-1 with three walks, giving him 12 hits in his last 17 at-bats
(.706). He is hitting .500 at home (44-for-88).
</P>
<P>
   Colorado, which led 4-0 and 6-3, fell behind 7-6 in the eighth
when Mitch Meluskey's two-run single off Stan Belinda (1-0).
</P>
<P>
   Tom Goodwin tied it with an RBI single off Marc Valdes (1-1) in
the bottom half and Yorkis Perez walked Helton on a 3-2 pitch with
the bases loaded. Darren Bragg added a two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Berkman homered and drove in a career-high four runs for
Houston, which has lost eight straight road games. Richard Hidalgo
went 2-for-3 with three runs scored and is 15-for-31 (.484) in his
last eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Goodwin had three hits and two RBIs for the Rockies (27-22),
who moved five games over .500 for the first time since Sept. 25,
1997 (82-77) Jose Jiminez pitched the ninth for his ninth save.
</P>
<P>
   Houston starter Scott Elarton allowed six runs and nine hits in
six innings, while Colorado's Kevin Jarvis gave up five runs and 10
hits in five-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado took a 2-0 lead in the first on Mike Lansing's RBI
double and Helton's sacrifice fly, and Goodwin added another RBI in
the second. Jeffrey Hammonds made it 4-0 with a run-scoring single
in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Berkman hit an opposite-field, three-run homer in the
fourth, but the Rockies made it 6-3 in the fifth on Darren Bragg's
RBI single and Brent Mayne's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Houston closed to 6-5 in the fifth on RBI grounders by Lance
Berkman and Daryle Ward.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Toby Harrah managed the Rockies while manager Buddy Bell
was in Cincinnati attending his daughter's graduation. ... Houston
homered for the 17th straight game, extending its team record. ...
Ken Caminiti left in the sixth inning with a mild sprained right
hamstring.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Livan Hernandez scattered eight hits in 8
1-3 innings and had a run-scoring double, and Jeff Kent and Bill
Mueller each homered as the San Francisco Giants beat the
Philadelphia Phillies 7-3 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez (4-5), whose sacrifice also set up the first of three
sixth-inning runs, struck out seven and walked one and fell two
outs short of a complete game. Robb Nen got his eighth save,
inducing a game-ending double play from Alex Arias.
</P>
<P>
   However, the win didn't come without some cost for the Giants.
Shortstop Rich Aurilia left in the second inning with a strained
left hamstring and is day to day. Aurilia, who will be re-evaluated
Wednesday, was hurt while sliding safely into home on the first of
Bobby Estalella's three singles. He was replaced by Ramon Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Ashby (2-6) had another rough outing for the Phillies, who
acquired him in a November trade with San Diego. Ashby, losing for
the fifth time in six decisions, gave up six runs and 10 hits in 5
2-3 innings. He walked three and struck out one.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Benard drew a leadoff walk in the third, and after Ashby
retired Mueller and Barry Bonds, Kent connected for his 13th home
run, driving a 2-0 pitch over the the center-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez helped himself in the fourth by lining a double to
left to score Estalella.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco put up three more runs in the in the sixth on
Benard's two-out RBI single, which chased Ashby. Bryan Ward
relieved and Mueller connected for his third home run of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Gant drove in runs with a solo homer in the fourth and and
RBI single in the eighth. Mickey Morandini hit an RBI single in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: San Francisco's pitching staff has thrown five complete
games, tying Arizona for most in the NL. ... The Phillies have lost
seven straight to the Giants. ... Kent's home run snapped a
season-high three-game homerless streak by the Giants. ... An MRI
on the sprained left ankle of disabled Phillies 3B Scott Rolen.
Team physician Dr. Michael Ciccotti said there was some bone
bruising in the ankle area and that Rolen will undergo a treatment
regimen of ice, stimulation and exercise around the ankle joint.
Rolen hurt his ankle a week ago in Houston when he turned it while
rounding first base. ... San Francisco RF Ellis Burks was held out
of the starting lineup Tuesday night because of sore left leg.
Burks, who is expected to play Wednesday, was activated from the

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- James Baldwin won for the eighth time in nine
decisions, and Carlos Lee and Ray Durham homered as the Chicago
White Sox beat the Seattle Mariners 2-1 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin outpitched Paul Abbott (1-2), who made his first start
since being hit in the face by Harold Baines' broken bat last
Thursday in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin gave up one run and four hits in seven innings. He
struck out six and walked three in his first start since having his
nine-game winning streak broken by the New York Yankees in his last
start.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin joined Pedro Martinez and David Wells as the only
eight-game winners in the AL. He boosted his road record to 6-0 and
lowered his ERA to 3.09, including 1.58 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Foulke pitched two scoreless innings for his ninth save in
10 opportunities. He has allowed one earned run in his last 24
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott, who broke his nose and had eight stitches when he was
hit by Baines' shattered bat, allowed four hits in seven innings,
but two of them were solo homers. He struck out a season-high seven
and walked none.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 1-0, the White Sox tied the score with two outs in the
fifth inning when Lee hit a 439-foot homer to center, his 11th of
the season and second in two nights.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the sixth, Durham hit a homer that bounced off
the top of the fence and into the Mariners' bullpen in left to
break the 1-1 tie. It was his seventh homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners scored in the third when Rickey Henderson walked,
stole second and came home on Mike Cameron's single to right.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Mariners placed RHP Gil Meche on the 15-day DL with a
strained shoulder. They recalled RHP Kevin Hodges from Triple-A
Tacoma. Hodges entered the game at the start of the eighth. ...
White Sox manager Jerry Manuel was scheduled to leave after the
game to fly back to Chicago to attend son Anthony's graduation from
high school. Bench coach Joe Nossek will manage the White Sox on
Wednesday. ... Henderson, signed as a free agent by Seattle on May
17 after being released by the New York Mets, stole his first base
at Safeco Field. Henderson's steal gave him stolen bases at 40
ballparks. ... Lee is 7-for-14 with two homers and six RBIs against
Seattle this year. ... The White Sox got their first victory in
five games at Safeco. ... Seattle's Edgar Martinez went 0-for-4,
ending his 14 game hitting streak.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 6, Diamondbacks 1  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Shawon Dunston hit a grand slam in the sixth,
then was ejected two innings later as the St. Louis Cardinals beat
the Arizona Diamondbacks 6-1 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Ankiel (5-2) didn't allow a hit until Arizona pitcher Omar
Daal (2-6) reached on a bunt single with no outs in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Matheny put the Cardinals ahead with a sacrifice fly in the
fifth, and Dunston homered in the sixth following a two-out double
by Jim Edmonds, an intentional walk to Mark McGwire and an infield
hit by Eric Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Dunston followed with a 372-foot drive to left, his fourth homer
of the season and the fourth slam of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Dunston tripled over the head of center fielder Steve Finley in
the eighth, but was thrown out at home by shortstop Tony Womack
when he tried to stretch it to an inside-the-park homer. Dunston
argued with first-base ump Greg Gibson, who slid down the line to
make the call.
</P>
<P>
   Replays appeared to show that Dunston's foot was on home before
Kelly Stinnett applied the tag.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Renteria had a RBI single in the ninth for St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Ankiel allowed one run -- Womack's sixth-inning sacrifice fly --
and three hits in six innings. Matt Morris allowed two hits in
three scoreless innings for his first career save.
</P>
<P>
   Daal gave up five runs and seven hits in 6 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Womack went 0-for-3, ending his hitting streak at 24 games, the
longest in the major leagues this season.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire went 0-for-2. He has not homered in 26 plate
appearances, going 4-for-17 with nine walks and five strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Although the Diamondbacks are the winningest expansion team
ever, the Cardinals are 13-6 against them. ... The Cardinals had
gone homerless for two games -- the first time that happened all
season -- before Dunston's blast. ... LHP Jesse Orosco, coming off
an injured left elbow, joined Peoria of the Class A Midwest League
on Tuesday and threw 15 pitches at the start of his rehabilitation
assignment. Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said Orosco would throw
again Wednesday and then be re-evaluated. ... The Diamondbacks set
a franchise record by going 22 innings with scoring a run -- from
the third inning of a game Sunday against Milwaukee until the sixth
of this one.

<HEADLINE> Padres 6, Brewers 3  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Padres right-hander Adam Eaton took care of it
all in one game -- first big league start, win, hit, RBI and run.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old Eaton had a memorable major league debut Tuesday
night, getting the decision and a double that started a string of
four straight RBI hits in the fifth inning as the Padres beat the
Milwaukee Brewers 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton, whose contract was purchased from Double-A Mobile earlier
in the day, became the Padres' fifth starter for the time being due
to a rash of injuries. He pitched just long enough to get the
decision, going 5 1-3 innings and allowing three runs and five
hits. He struck out four and walked two.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton was the clincher in the deal that sent Andy Ashby to
Philadelphia in exchange for three pitchers on Nov. 10. It turned
out that Eaton was the first of the three to pitch for the Padres
because the other two, Carlton Loewer and Steve Montgomery, have
been on the disabled list since the start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton, who was 4-1 with a 2.68 ERA at Mobile, became the first
Padres pitcher to start and win his major league debut since Stan
Spencer on Aug. 27, 1998, at Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Hoffman pitched the ninth for his 12th save in 13
opportunities. Hoffman loaded the bases with no outs but got a
popup and two strikeouts to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton held the Brewers hitless until Ron Belliard got a two-out
single in the third, followed by Mark Loretta's homer to left
field, his fifth, for a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres sent nine batters to the plate in taking a 4-2 lead
in the fifth. Eaton came up with one out and runners on first and
second, and hit a double down the left field line that went into
the Padres' bullpen, scoring Carlos Hernandez. Eric Owens and Al
Martin followed with RBI singles -- Martin's hit scored Eaton -- and
Ryan Klesko an RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Kory DeHaan hit a two-run double in the eighth, giving the
Padres a 6-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton allowed Jeromy Burnitz's one-out double in the sixth and
was chased by Geoff Jenkins' RBI triple. Carlos Almanzar came on
and got the last two outs, including fielding Charlie Hayes'
grounder to catch Jenkins in a rundown.
</P>
<P>
   Brewers starter Jeff D'Amico (2-3) allowed four runs on eight
hits in 5 2-3 innings, struck out five and walked five.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Tony Gwynn had been on a schedule of playing two games and
then sitting out one to try to help his bum left knee, but said
it's now one on, one off. That's because he slid into second base
on Monday night and there was a little more fluid in the knee than
what the trainers wanted to see. The Padres' first six interleague
games begin Friday at Seattle, and Gwynn is scheduled to be the
designated hitter. ... Gwynn was hitting .186 when he went on the
disabled list April 29 but has raised his average to .273. ...
Loewer was transferred from Triple-A Las Vegas to Single-A Rancho
Cucamonga to continue his rehab assignment. Montgomery started his
rehab assignment Tuesday night at Rancho, allowing one hit in two
scoreless innings and striking out one. ... Brewers C Henry Blanco
has thrown out 11 of 21 baserunners, including Bret Boone in the
fourth and Owens in the eighth. Opposing teams have attempted only
nine stolen bases against Milwaukee since May 5.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Miserable From 3-Point Range  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Lakers kept tossing up
3-pointers in Game 5 of the Western Conference finals Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   And they kept missing them, too.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes, the ball just doesn't go in,'' Brian Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers were 6-for-27 from long range and 24-of-52 from
inside the 3-point arc in losing 96-88 to the Portland Trail
Blazers, forcing a sixth game in the best-of-seven series Friday
night in Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had open looks. The shots that I had just didn't drop,''
Glen Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   The 27 3-point attempts were the most the Lakers have tried all
season -- in 82 regular-season games and 15 more in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a strange game,'' said Shaw, who played only seven
minutes before fouling out with 2:49 to play. ''We definitely had
our opportunities, we couldn't take advantage of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice, who scored 21 points in his team's 103-91 victory in Game
4, but was just 1-for-8 with four points in Game 5, said there was
no sense of urgency for the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would have liked to close the series, but unfortunately, it
didn't happen,'' he said. ''We just have to go up there, put a
complete game together.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his team's shooting effort from outside, Rice said, ''That's
not good, but we'll learn from it. It won't happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice missed all five of his 3-point attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal, who had 31 points and 21 rebounds, said it was
disappointing the Lakers didn't go inside more.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it was an opportunity missed,'' he said of the Lakers'
failure to close out the series. ''We just have to play a little
smarter.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the problem was the Lakers' failure to get the
ball inside or Portland's defense, O'Neal replied, ''A little bit
of both. I'm a little upset, we just have to learn from this.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's an old basketball saying, 'You live by the jump shot,
you die by the jump shot.' We shot 27 3s and made only six. I
thought that we played pretty good defense, but we didn't put the
ball in the basket.''
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant had an off night, going 4-for-13, including 1-for-3
from 3-point range. He sprained his right foot early in the game,
but kept playing and wound up with 17 points, five rebounds and
four assists before fouling out with 4:45 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   X-rays on Bryant's foot were negative, but he will be examined
again Wednesday. He said he planned to practice as the Lakers
prepare for Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   Never were the Lakers' shooting difficulties more pronounced
than in one sequence midway through the fourth quarter, when they
missed three straight wide-open 3-pointers after getting two of
their 14 offensive rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers led 89-79 at that stage, and the Lakers weren't
closer than seven points after that.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were always looking for that dagger,'' Horry said in
explaining the flurry of 3-pointers. ''We didn't look for Shaq
enough on the inside. He was getting great position.''
</P>
<P>
   Horry was 3-for-11, including 1-for-4 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some days it goes, some days it doesn't,'' Horry said with a
sigh. ''Scottie Pippen was very aggressive tonight. When he's that
way, we get in foul trouble. We've got to find a way to slow him
down.''
</P>
<P>
   There were a total of 58 fouls called in the game -- 30 against
the Lakers. Shaw said his team never could find a rhythm because of
the foul problems.

<HEADLINE> Spanish Govt Buys Goya Letters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- The Spanish government has paid $700,000
for 40 letters the 18th-century Spanish master Francisco de Goya
wrote to a childhood friend, discussing everything from life as
royal court painter to the money he sent home to his mother.
</P>
<P>
   The government exercised its right of first refusal and snapped
up the letters Tuesday just as a private collector bidding by
telephone was about to acquire them from a historian who had put
them up for auction, the news agency Efe said.
</P>
<P>
   The letters are part of a faithful correspondence Goya carried
on with lifelong friend Martin Zapater, who lived in their hometown
of Zaragoza in northeast Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Zapater was a merchant who served as de facto administrator of
the money Goya sent home to support his mother in Zaragoza while
serving as royal court artist to kings Carlos III and Carlos IV in
Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   The missives will join 58 others between the two men that are
part of the Prado Museum's collection.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Puerto Rican Senator Sentenced  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Former Puerto Rican Sen. Edgardo
Rosario Burgos has been sentenced to three years of probation for
his role in a scheme to steal millions of dollars in federal funds
meant for AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
   The former senator from northern Arecibo also was ordered on
Tuesday to pay a $50,000 fine and perform 500 hours of community
service.
</P>
<P>
   Rosario Burgos, a doctor, pleaded guilty in February 1999 to a
charge of conspiracy to defraud the now-defunct San Juan AIDS
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted that he received a $40,000 campaign donation from
Advanced Community Health Services, the company hired to administer
the agency. Electoral laws limit such donations to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''Looking at it in retrospect, I wouldn't do it again,'' Rosario
Burgos said. ''I didn't realize what I was doing. When I realized,
I was scared.''
</P>
<P>
   He also admitted to receiving a salary from the institute, where
a position was created for him after he lost his re-election bid in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Rosario Burgos turned state's witness and testified against
institute officials Yamil Kouri, Jorge Garib and Luis Dubon, who
were convicted of stealing $2.2 million in federal AIDS funds.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal rocked the island's government and forced Gov. Pedro
Rossello and former San Juan Mayor Hector Luis Acevedo to take the
stand to deny witnesses' allegations that they accepted part of the
stolen money. Neither was charged with any crime.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, House of Representatives vice president Jose
Granados Navedo admitted he accepted $200,000 in cash campaign
donations from Garib, including $100,000 stuffed in a cardboard
box. He resigned from the legislature but has not been charged with
wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> Jaguar Kills His Handler at Zoo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) -- A jaguar killed his handler, then
escaped from his cage at a zoo in Guyana, police said. The animal
was killed shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The 200-pound jaguar mauled 38-year-old attendant Roxroy Wills
as he was preparing to feed the animal on Tuesday afternoon, police
said. Co-workers at the Georgetown Zoo found him lying near the
open cage. Officials weren't sure if he was attacked inside or
outside the cage.
</P>
<P>
   Police found the jaguar in a nearby shrub and used automatic
rifles to kill it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a sad day at the zoo,'' said employee Roger Lackish.
''Nothing like this has ever happened before.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-workers said Wills was a skilled handler, but that he was
feeding the jaguar without the help of an assistant, as zoo rules
require.

<HEADLINE> Lights Won't Cause Nearsightedness  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM McCALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's OK for parents to leave on the night light, according to a
pair of new studies that say the light won't make children
nearsighted.
</P>
<P>
   Two groups of researchers report in this week's journal Nature
that they were unable to duplicate the results of an earlier study
indicating children who sleep with a night light until age 2 are
three times more likely to develop nearsightedness, or myopia.
</P>
<P>
   ''The original report suggested that parents turn out the
lights,'' said Jane Gwiazda of the New England College of Optometry
in Boston. ''And now with two studies to the contrary, it's safe to
say parents can leave the lights on.''
</P>
<P>
   The two follow-up studies were done separately at the New
England College of Optometry and Ohio State University.
</P>
<P>
   The original study was done by scientists at the University of
Pennsylvania and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and was
published in Nature last May. It raised the possibility that too
much light during the first two years of life prompts the rapidly
developing eyes to grow excessively and throws them out of focus.
</P>
<P>
   The follow-up studies found no difference between the rate of
myopia for children who slept in the dark and those who slept with
a night light.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the real explanation may be -- at least indirectly
-- heredity, the researchers said. Myopic parents are more likely to
have myopic children. And myopic parents may like to leave night
lights on so they can see better at night.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston group studied 213 people ranging in age from 2 to 24,
with a mean age of 11. It found that 20 percent of the children who
slept with night lights developed myopia, exactly the same
percentage as the youngsters who slept in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio State study, which involved 1,220 children with a
median age of 10, found the percentage of children who became
nearsighted after sleeping with a night light as babies was about
17 percent. Statistically, that was the same as the 20 percent of
the children who slept in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the percentage of children who slept in a fully lit
room and later became nearsighted was essentially the same at 22
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest link the Ohio State study found was between the
number of nearsighted parents and their use of night lights.
</P>
<P>
   ''Surprise, surprise: Those of us who can't see like to leave
the lights on,'' said Ohio State optometrist Karla Zadnik.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Stone, an ophthalmologist and co-author of the
Pennsylvania study, said in a response published in Nature that
widespread publicity may have led parents in the follow-up studies
to underreport night light use out of guilt for possibly
contributing to myopia.
</P>
<P>
   Stone also said the differing results may be due to the
differing average age for the children -- the average age in the
Pennsylvania study was 8.

<HEADLINE> Teen Funds Scholarship for Friend  </HEADLINE>
By JAY LINDSAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- For 12 years, David Glattstein felt he could have
done more for Matthew Kamin, his friend who died of leukemia at age
6.
</P>
<P>
   In Matthew's memory, Glattstein -- now 18 -- is using some of the
$20,000 he earned on the stock market to endow a college
scholarship at Swampscott High School.
</P>
<P>
   The $1,000 scholarship will be awarded to a member of the
school's class of 2000, which graduates Sunday. Glattstein is a
graduating senior, and Matthew would have been, too.
</P>
<P>
   Glattstein endowed the Matthew J. Kamin Rainbow Scholarship
anonymously last year and only went public recently with prodding
from Matthew's grandfather, Harvey Michaels.
</P>
<P>
   ''What David is doing, I think is unheard of,'' Michaels said.
''It unselfish, it's magnanimous, it's genuine. It serves as a role
model for other people to give a little bit of themselves and give
something to society.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years ago, Glattstein and his friend Matthew were in the
first grade in Swampscott, an upscale, seaside Boston suburb. Their
families were close. They shared a fascination with rainbows, which
is remembered in the scholarship name.
</P>
<P>
   Glattstein was too young to understand how sick Matthew was. He
just knew he wanted him to feel better. So he visited him in the
hospital, his favorite stuffed animal in tow as a gift. But by the
time Glattstein arrived, Matthew had died.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Glattstein has lived with a lingering -- if unfounded
-- regret about Matthew's death.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always felt guilty that I didn't do enough to help him,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   By last spring, Glattstein realized he had the resources to
honor Matthew's memory, thanks to some savvy stock market
investing.
</P>
<P>
   Glattstein began investing at age 15, using money he received at
his bar mitzvah. He focused on high-tech companies, which he knew
were fueling the stock market boom, and his account grew from
$6,000 to $22,000.
</P>
<P>
   Swampscott High principal Peter Sack said he was touched when
Glattstein approached him last year about funding the annual
scholarship, but not entirely surprised. Glattstein, a member of
the Political Action Club and editor of the school newspaper,
struck the principal as extremely conscientious.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's an activist in the most positive sense of the word,''
Sack said.
</P>
<P>
   Finalists for the scholarship were chosen based on their answer
to this essay question: Define the meaning of living life to the
fullest. The winner, chosen by Glattstein and Matthew's
grandfather, will be announced at commencement Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Glattstein said he was looking for someone who understood that
people should give more than they take.

<HEADLINE> Lazio Hits the Campaign Trail  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Newly nominated Republican Senate
candidate Rick Lazio set off across New York in his ''Mainstream
Express'' campaign bus, looking for votes in his battle against
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Long Island congressman pledged to take a ''message of hope,
opportunity and responsibility'' on the road after he was the
unanimous pick of his party's state convention to take on the first
lady in the closely watched Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With the ''Rocky'' theme blaring from loudspeakers and sporting
a fat lip courtesy of a tumble during a Memorial Day parade, Lazio
declared Tuesday that he is the underdog in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''My opponent is better financed and better known. She comes to
New York with the support of every left-wing special interest, from
Washington insiders to the Hollywood elite,'' Lazio told more than
400 cheering delegates and 1,000 more in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   And, pressing a favorite Republican theme -- that Clinton is a
carpetbagger -- Lazio said, ''I have one advantage she'll never have
-- I can be myself. I am a New Yorker.''
</P>
<P>
   While not criticizing Clinton by name, Lazio accused ''the
opposition camp'' of practicing the ''politics of division ... It
is a bleak, angry place, built of fear. And I will not go there.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said the congressman
had ''offered the people of New York recycled insults and rhetoric
that doesn't match his record. Time and time again Rick Lazio has
voted against New York's working families in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hillary Clinton has been running an inclusive campaign since
day one and fighting for children and families for thirty years,''
Wolfson added. ''New Yorkers will always be able to count on
Hillary to stand up for them in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio left the convention for a three-day bus trip across the
state in his customized cruiser dubbed ''The Mainstream Express''
by campaign aides who used to work on the presidential campaign of
Sen. John McCain. The senator's bus was called ''The Straight Talk
Express.''
</P>
<P>
   For Lazio, 42, the GOP nomination marked the culmination of a
dream that seemed dashed just nine months ago when Gov. George
Pataki persuaded him to suspend his fledgling Senate campaign in
favor of an expected run by New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor dropped out of the race this month after his
diagnosis with prostate cancer. Pataki and other Republican leaders
quickly rallied around the little-known Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has stressed his New York roots, a none-too-subtle
reminder that Clinton only moved into the state in January. And, he
has pointed to his record as a four-term congressman who helped
overhaul the nation's public housing system, worked to protect the
environment and voted to raise the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton camp, on the other hand, portrays Lazio as a
conservative out of step with mainstream New Yorkers. Clinton aides
have repeatedly pointed to Lazio's support for eight out of 10
proposals from former House Speaker Newt Gingrich's ''Contract with
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has also taken her rival to task for saying he's a
supporter of abortion rights, noting he has regularly voted to cut
federal Medicaid funding for poor women's abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Clinton and Giuliani, Lazio has favors banning the
late-term procedure critics call ''partial-birth abortion.'' That
cleared the way for him to pick up the endorsement of the state's
Conservative Party. No Republican has won statewide office in New
York since 1974 without Conservative Party backing.

<HEADLINE> Pa. Relaxes Standards for Bar Exams  </HEADLINE>
By HOPE YEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Less than 10 years ago, prospective
lawyers breezed through the Pennsylvania bar exam at a rate law
students in neighboring states could only hope to equal.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania soon found itself with an image problem, seen as a
haven for litigators who couldn't qualify elsewhere. Standards were
raised in 1995, but the state Supreme Court has now decided to give
law students a break.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in July 2001, aspiring lawyers won't have to meet
individual scoring requirements on both the multiple-choice and
essay portions of the state bar exam. They will pass based on their
combined overall score.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our only concern is that the attorneys that are licensed have
the minimum competency requirements to practice law,'' said Mark
Dows of the Pennsylvania Board of Law Examiners. ''We did not want
to penalize those who take the multiple choice better than the
essay.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes will require Pennsylvania applicants to achieve a
combined score of at least 272 -- two points higher than the
combined total of the two minimum scores currently required. The
state is already adding a ''performance test,'' where test-takers
draft a memo analyzing the viability of a fictitious client's legal
claim.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's more worrisome for us,'' said Tracy Laskowski, a
third-year student at Villanova Law School. ''The fear is having
any change.''
</P>
<P>
   The requirements certainly have had their ups and downs.
</P>
<P>
   Until the mid-1990s, Pennsylvania was one of a few states which
did not grade the essay section if test-takers did well enough on
the multiple-choice questions. The pass rate was 84 percent,
compared with the 61 percent to 80 percent rate in neighboring
states.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pennsylvania had a reputation of being one of the easiest
places to take the bar,'' said Dale Larrimore, executive director
of Bar/Bri of Pennsylvania, which prepares law students for the
exam. ''The thought was that all the people taking the bar here
couldn't pass anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to dispel Pennsylvania's lackluster image in the legal
community, the state Supreme Court in 1995 instituted minimum
scores on both portions of the exam. Passing rates dipped to 48
percent in February 1995 before rebounding to 69 percent that July.
</P>
<P>
   The court had problems of its own at the time. One of its
justices, Rolf Larsen, faced accusations of abusing prescription
drugs and showing favoritism to lawyer friends. He was convicted of
federal conspiracy in 1994 and impeached by the General Assembly,
leading critics to call for legal reform.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Supreme Court finally decided to increase the standards to
help raise the reputation of Pennsylvania attorneys around the
country,'' Larrimore said.
</P>
<P>
   The proportion of attorneys inside Pennsylvania itself exceeds
the national average. One of every 218 Pennsylvanians is licensed
to practice law, compared to a one-to-295 ratio nationwide,
according to figures from the state Court of Judicial Discipline,
Census Bureau and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,900 applicants are expected to take the state bar exam
in July, compared to 3,800 test-takers in 1994. The passage rate
today is about 70 percent -- low when compared to the 72 percent to
78 percent success rates in New Jersey, Maryland and New York,
which score their exams differently but are considered comparable
in difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers say they don't mind the constantly changing
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ''With Philadelphia being the kind of place it is, there are
some practices where you are dealing with people barred in many
states with certain attitudes,'' said Lauren Levin, a Philadelphia
civil litigator. ''But the real test is not the bar exam -- it's
what kind of lawyer you are and how well you do.''

<HEADLINE> Israel Wins Full UN Representation  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- More than 50 years after Israel became a
member of the United Nations, it will finally get the chance to be
represented on key U.N. bodies in New York.
</P>
<P>
   For Israeli U.N. Ambassador Yehuda Lancry, acceptance in one of
the U.N. regional groups that decides on committee memberships
marks a turning point in the Jewish state's stormy relationship
with the United Nations and an end to decades of isolation.
</P>
<P>
   For U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, it marks the end to a
grave injustice and a victory for the Clinton administration, which
decided to publicize a decades-old, behind-the-scenes campaign to
find a region that would accept Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Under U.N. rules, regional groups decide who fills the 10
rotating seats on the Security Council and other key U.N. committee
assignments. Israel was the only U.N. member that was not part of a
regional group, because Arab nations have repeatedly blocked its
admission to the Asian Group -- where it belongs geographically.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, the U.N. regional group of European, North American
and other countries invited Israel to become a temporary member,
with some strings. On Tuesday, Lancry sent a formal letter of
acceptance to the Netherlands' U.N. Ambassador Peter van Walsum,
who currently heads the West European and Others Group, or WEOG, as
it is called.
</P>
<P>
   ''We consider that this is a historic turning point in our
relationship with the United Nations. It is really a new chapter
which we are opening with the family of nations,'' Lancry said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It isn't the end of the road,'' Holbrooke added, ''but it is
far and away the biggest step taken in the last four decades
towards putting Israel where it belongs, as absolutely a full
member of the U.N. without discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Why, after years of opposition from several European countries,
was Israel finally admitted?
</P>
<P>
   Lancry said Israel started campaigning for membership in WEOG
after the 1993 Oslo accords, which laid the groundwork for the
current Middle East peace process, but without success.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Kofi Annan became secretary-general in January 1997,
he raised the issue of Israel's exclusion. On a visit to the Middle
East in March 1998, he said, ''this anomaly should be corrected,''
insisting that the equality of all states be upheld.
</P>
<P>
   Lancry credited Annan's ''exceptional courage'' and Holbrooke's
formidable diplomatic skills in expressing the Clinton
administration's determination ''to put an end to this longstanding
inequity.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing alongside Lancry at a news conference, Holbrooke said
there was a window of opportunity -- and the Clinton administration
worked closely with Israel's President Ehud Barak and Lancry to act
while it was open.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright repeatedly raised the issue
with key leaders, ''and one by one the obstacles began to fall
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Israel must keep pressing for membership in the
Asian group and WEOG will reconsider its temporary membership in
four years.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is also barred from submitting candidates for any
contested posts for two years, and must accept WEOG's existing
rotation for U.N. posts.
</P>
<P>
   ''For Israel simply to go to the head of the line in year one
would not have been reasonable,'' Holbrooke explained.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-Israeli campaign will continue because Israel is only
invited to join WEOG in New York -- not in Geneva, Vienna and
Nairobi where the United Nations also operates.
</P>
<P>
   But Holbrooke stressed that ''New York is the mothership'' of
U.N. operations and Israel's acceptance by WEOG here was the
critical hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   Lancry said he does not expect Israel to get a seat on the
Security Council in the next 10 years -- but he does see some
benefits in WEOG membership here.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that it permits Israel now to channel its energy, its
activity, its spirit, to take advantage of the family of nations --
and to give something to the family of nations,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Holocaust Orphan Connects Relatives  </HEADLINE>
By MARILYN AUGUST
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- The nightmares that tormented Wladimir Zandt for
nearly 55 years have all but vanished, and the Holocaust orphan now
dreams about the gentle face of the mother he never knew.
</P>
<P>
   Zandt used the Internet to track down long-lost relatives -- a
search that turned up the first images he ever saw of his mother, a
host of American cousins he is anxious to meet and troubling
suspicions that his French foster family blocked his relatives'
efforts to bring him to the United States after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've lived my life feeling like half a person, no family, no
roots,'' said Zandt, 59, who lives in Paris. ''I've always hoped
and dreamed about being normal like everybody else. Now, I finally
feel as though I have found myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Zandt learned about his U.S. relatives after consulting the
wartime archives of a French Jewish children's aid group, OSE. He
contacted Holocaust-related groups on the Web, which eventually put
him in touch with Carolyn Sand Velez, his first cousin.
</P>
<P>
   From her home in Walnut Creek, Ca., Velez immediately sent off a
thick envelope filled with pictures of Wladimir's mother, Perla, a
Polish Jew arrested in France and deported to Auschwitz in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   ''Opening the package and seeing my mother's face for the first
time was like being hit over the head,'' Zandt said, showing
yellowed family portraits taken in Warsaw the early 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the files were letters from Morris Sand, his mother's
older brother and Carolyn Sand Velez's father, who had fled Poland
and settled in New York. There were tax returns, affidavits of
financial solvency and a letter discussing payment for Wladimir's
passage to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''My uncle was very aware of my existence and he wanted to adopt
me,'' Zandt said. ''But my foster family insisted on keeping me.
Using false documents, they had the immigration process annulled.
The point is that I was not adoptable -- I had family.''
</P>
<P>
   Zandt was born in Rivesaltes, a French-run internment camp in
the Pyrenees Mountains, on Dec. 30, 1940. Mother and son were
separated weeks after the birth. Zandt knows nothing of what
happened to his father, a Russian Jew.
</P>
<P>
   Perla escaped from the camp, leaving her son behind. She was
arrested in Lyon on June 13, 1944, transferred to the Drancy
transit camp outside Paris and shipped to Auschwitz, where she died
after a short stint in a German factory. She was 31.
</P>
<P>
   Wladimir was later taken in by the Bobichons, a middle-class
French family. He was baptized Guy Bobichon and sent off to a Roman
Catholic boarding school.
</P>
<P>
   At 13, Zandt learned that he was adopted. Two years later, he
learned he was Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was one terrible shock after another,'' Zandt recalled. ''I
had no idea what being Jewish meant. I just felt as if the earth
dropped out from under my feet.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Zandt has little contact with his adoptive family.
He accuses them of having taken him in for financial reasons,
noting that families with foster children got tax breaks and
received extra rations of food and clothing during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Far worse, Zandt claims, the Bobichons never gave him his
adoption file when he turned 21, as required by French law.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was an incredible feeling of being robbed, robbed of
family, of affection and of a culture. First, I felt enormous
anger, now I feel hatred,'' he said. ''Aunts, uncles, cousins, the
real family I could have had all these years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bobichons say they're bewildered and hurt by his
accusations.
</P>
<P>
   ''My brother's experience was very painful, but I'm sure my
parents didn't adopt him for money,'' Nicole Bobichon, 53, said in
a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''They did what they thought was right at the time. It's sad he
doesn't see things the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Zandt's U.S. cousins are looking forward to renewing
links with their long-lost relative.
</P>
<P>
   ''Carolyn and I are elated. Things like this only happen in
movies, and it's much more moving in real life,'' Esther Gold, 68,
said from her home in Howell, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ''To grow up a stranger in your own family, not to have any
blood relatives, and then to suddenly find them after all these
years, sends shivers up my spine.''
</P>
<P>
   Zandt is getting to know his cousins through e-mail and plans to
visit this summer.
</P>
<P>
   He says he plans to finance his trip partly by money he expects
to receive from the French government.
</P>
<P>
   A faded receipt for 1,000 francs confiscated from Perla at
Drancy allowed Zandt to make history. In January, he became the
first French Jew to be awarded compensation from the government for
looted wartime assets. The Drai Commission, created last year to
process claims, confirmed that Zandt will receive about $13,800.
</P>
<P>
   Zandt says the money symbolizes France's recognition of
responsibility for his mother's death.
</P>
<P>
   ''How do you calculate the price of tears, the price of lost
opportunities, the price of a life you didn't lead?'' he asked.

<HEADLINE> Government To Test Popular Diets  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government wants to settle the war of the
diets.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists with the Agriculture Department are going to test two
of the nation's most popular diets -- low-carbohydrate and low-fat --
to see whether they work and how safe they are.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Americans have tried one of the diets or several
variations of them, including the wildly popular, high-protein,
low-carbohydrate regimen developed by cardiologist Robert Atkins
that lets people eat omelets, bacon and bun-less burgers. A rival
diet promoted by Dean Ornish, an outspoken critic of Atkins, is
very low in fat.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now we have millions of dollars being spent on these
diets and everyone is throwing rocks at each other over what is the
best diet,'' said Cyndi Thompson, a spokeswoman for the American
Dietetic Association and a nutrition expert at the University of
Arizona. ''If obesity is the No. 1 (health) issue, then we need to
put our money there and figure out what works.''
</P>
<P>
   USDA researchers plan to put two groups of people on prototype
diets that are similar to those Atkins and Ornish are promoting and
measure how much weight they lose and what effects the plans have
on their health. Some medical experts say the Atkins diet could
damage the kidneys or bones, a claim he disputes. Critics of
Ornish's program say it isn't appealing.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of scientists will develop a protocol for the USDA
studies later this year. The first information from the study
likely would be available in 2001.The studies will be directed by
USDA's nutrition research center at the University of
California-Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they do the diet correctly, it will change the basic eating
patterns of Americans,'' said Atkins, who estimates 40 million
people have followed his plan. ''It will be the greatest step
forward that has ever taken place.''
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said weight-loss plans are
popular in part because too little research has been done on them.
''There doesn't seem to be enough comprehensive information
specific to these diets to counter the claims made by their
promoters.''
</P>
<P>
   Glickman announced the research plans at a major national
conference Tuesday of health and nutrition professionals. It was
the first such meeting since a 1969 conference, on hunger, led to a
huge expansion in federal feeding programs, including the Women,
Infants and Children program that subsidizes meals for pregnant
women and new mothers and their babies.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the top issue is obesity. About 55 percent of
Americans are believed to be overweight, more than double the
percentage in 1969. Meanwhile, about one-quarter of American adults
are obese, according to recent surveys.
</P>
<P>
   ''We may have dramatically reduced hunger in America, but now we
have a serious weight problem,'' said Donna Shalala, health and
human services secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Obesity is measured by a person's weight in relation to height.
At 6 feet, a person is considered overweight at 185 pounds and
obese at 220. Someone who is 5-foot-6 would be overweight at 155
pounds and obese at about 185.
</P>
<P>
   According to the government's latest dietary guidelines, which
are revised every five years to reflect the latest developments in
science, the best way to control weight is by exercising regularly
and eating a balanced diet that includes a lot of whole grains,
fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala has lost 15 pounds since 1996, proof that one can lose
weight without severely restricting calories or food choices, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it comes to crash diets and fad diets, the guidelines are
clear: Stop doing them,'' she said. ''They won't last. Instead,
take the weight off slowly and steadily through a powerful
combination of sensible eating and physical activity.''

<HEADLINE> Path Cleared for Ore. Adoption Law  </HEADLINE>
By AVIVA L. BRANDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Adoptees who have fought in court for two
years to see their birth records will have to wait a little longer.
</P>
<P>
   Blame the paperwork, not more legal squabbling.
</P>
<P>
   The Oregon Health Division was expected to begin processing
adoptees' requests for their birth records today.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are processing them in the order in which we received
them,'' said Mel Kohn, deputy state epidemiologist. ''We have at
least a six-week delay before people at the end of the list will be
processed.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohn said 2,272 requests already had been received by Tuesday,
when U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor rejected an
emergency request to delay Oregon's 1998 adoption records law from
going into effect.
</P>
<P>
   The decision ended two years of court battles begun by six women
who argued the new law violates the privacy of people like
themselves who gave up their children for adoption and started new
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Adoptees can find the application for their original birth
certificates on the Internet. Those who filed applications early
could have their certificates by next week, Kohn said.
</P>
<P>
   Birth mothers have some say in the process. They can download
from the Internet a ''contact preference form'' that would be sent
to adoptees along with their birth certificates.
</P>
<P>
   It gives birth mothers an opportunity to say whether they want
to be contacted, prefer only to be contacted through an
intermediary or whether they do not wish to be contacted. If they
choose the last option, they also must file a detailed family
medical history.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas McDermott, a lawyer for the law's backers and the
adoptive father of a 16-year-old boy, was jubilant Tuesday that his
son and others would have the chance to learn about their pasts.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I've seen with my son is that he really yearns for a more
complete picture of himself,'' he said. ''It's a basic human right
to know your heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Hunsaker, attorney for the six anonymous birth mothers,
was bitter about the removal of the last legal roadblock.
</P>
<P>
   ''My clients are extremely disappointed and scared and even
angry that their rights have been ignored by Oregon's voters and
Oregon's courts,'' Hunsaker said.
</P>
<P>
   He said giving adult adoptees access to their original birth
certificates violates an implied contract the birth mothers thought
they had -- that their identities would be protected and that they
would never be contacted by the children they relinquished.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to review a similar open
adoption records law from Tennessee, although that law was passed
by the Legislature, not by the voters.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee and just three other states -- Alaska, Delaware and
Kansas -- allow adult adoptees access to original birth
certificates, which often have birth parents' names. An adoption
records bill in Alabama is awaiting the governor's signature.

   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Candidates for the mayoral race in the
Western Hemisphere's largest city squared off in a televised
debate, but a leftist leader was already the heavy favorite to win
the July 2 election.
</P>
<P>
   Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador of the Democratic Revolution Party
leads his nearest rival by 17 percentage points in the latest poll,
and one minor party candidate essentially conceded during the
debate Tuesday night that Lopez Obrador would win, asking him to
form an inclusive government.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez Obrador pledged to increase funding for education, combat
both the causes and symptoms of crime, and make the government more
humble.
</P>
<P>
   ''We propose to govern this city from the bottom up,'' he said.
''There won't be luxury offices. We will lower the salaries of
high-level public servants. We won't buy late-model vehicles. We
won't use bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't have a rich government and a poor people.''
</P>
<P>
   The two other main candidates, the ruling party's Jesus
Silva-Herzog and the center-right National Action Party's Santiago
Creel, spent most of their time criticizing the current, 3-year-old
administration of the city, which is of Lopez Obrador's party.
</P>
<P>
   Silva-Herzog, whose party ran Mexico City by presidential
appointment from 1929 until 1997, said in the three years since
Democratic Revolution took over, the government has built only 203
houses. He pledged to build 100,000 over his six-year term.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed the current government for crime, corruption and
constant demonstrations that clog traffic -- all problems that were
at least as bad during his own party's rule of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ''This city is sick, very sick, and needs emergency care,'' he
said. ''Our city needs to put order into the disorder in which we
live.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Creel: ''We work day and night here. We have a city that
never stops. And we have a government that is practically lying
down. On July 2, do we want more of the 70 years of ruling-party
corruption or of the 1,000 days of Democratic Revolution
incompetence?''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico City, with close to 9 million people within city limits
and another 10 million just outside, is the political, financial
and cultural heart of this highly centralized country, and the
mayor wields significant power.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Revolution's Cuauhtemoc Cardenas won a stunning
landslide in 1997 when the mayorship was put up for election for
the first time, but resigned last September to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cardenas had limited success in creating the
large-scale changes he had promised, his interim successor, Rosario
Robles, has been popular.
</P>
<P>
   That appears to have helped Lopez Obrador, who has surged in the
polls since the campaigning began early in the year.
</P>
<P>
   A poll published Tuesday in the newspaper Reforma showed 44
percent of respondents planned to vote for Lopez Obrador, compared
with 27 percent each for Silva Herzog, Mexico's former ambassador
to the United States, and Creel, a former congressional leader.
</P>
<P>
   Reforma conducted face-to-face interviews with 1,109 people May
19-21. The poll had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The elections for president, congress and many local posts will
be held July 2. National Action's presidential candidate, Vicente
Fox, is running generally even in the polls with ruling-party
candidate Francisco Labastida.

<HEADLINE> Helms Recalls Another N.C. Naysayer  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When he exercises his authority to say no,
Sen. Jesse Helms is taking his cues from a fellow North Carolinian
who exasperated presidents and other politicians two centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   Helms, R-N.C., unveiled a portrait in the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee room this month of Nathaniel Macon, who in the
1820s chaired the committee that Helms now heads with the same
parsimony, piety and deep suspicion of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Helms recalled visiting Macon's gravestone, inscribed with a
tribute from Thomas Jefferson, whom Macon both befriended and
beleaguered. He referred to a 1998 policy speech in which he
praised Macon as ''a fierce opponent of any and all measures to
expand the power of the new federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He believed what I do,'' Helms said. ''Saying no is a part of
the job of being the Foreign Relations Committee chairman.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his election to the Senate 28 years ago, Helms has
infuriated leaders of both parties with his fierce opposition to
treaties, his disdain for the United Nations and foreign aid and
his unbending conservative positions on issues such as abortion,
homosexual rights and federal funding for the arts.
</P>
<P>
   Helms, 78, is determined to terminate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty. He led the drive last year to defeat the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. He has made clear that any late-term
agreements worked out by President Clinton and new Russian
President Vladimir Putin will be dead on arrival in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie Faulkner, a history professor at Campbell University in
Buies Creek, N.C., said at the portrait ceremony that Macon ''is in
a very real sense the spiritual predecessor'' of Helms.
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner has written a book published by the Jesse Helms Center
in Wingate, N.C., comparing Macon and Helms. He says the
similarities are striking: their rural North Carolina roots, devout
Baptist beliefs, public and private frugality, distrust of the
federal government, dedication to state sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Macon was House speaker before moving to the Senate in 1815,
where he worked to defeat legislation the following year to
increase a lawmaker's pay from $6 a day to $1,500 a year, said
Richard Baker, the Senate's historian. The salary remained
unchanged for the next 40 years, Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Macon's opposition was most steadfast when it came to imposing
taxes and spending money. He voted for the declaration of war
against England in 1812 but opposed conscription and all taxes
needed to wage war. He voted against money for roads and canals and
opposed rechartering the First Bank of the United States, a
precursor of the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   In 1815 he opposed the purchase of his friend Jefferson's
library, which became the foundation of the Library of Congress,
and in 1824 unsuccessfully tried to block the granting of $200,000
to Revolutionary War ally the Marquis de Lafayette.
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner quoted a fellow historian who described Macon's
political career as ''defeating what he could, obstructing by
parliamentary maneuver what he could not defeat and amending into
uselessness what he could not otherwise obstruct.''
</P>
<P>
   During his 37 years in Congress, ''Macon cast more no votes than
did any 10 other members combined,'' Helms said.
</P>
<P>
   A frustrated John Quincy Adams reportedly described Macon as
''covered by an encrustation of prejudices which experience cannot
remove.''
</P>
<P>
   But Macon, like Helms, also was genuinely liked by his
colleagues for his honesty, lack of airs and the strength of his
convictions. ''Nothing sordid ever entered into his imagination,''
President John Tyler said of Macon.
</P>
<P>
   Helms, for his part, gets along well with his Democratic
opposite on the Foreign Relations Committee, Joe Biden of Delaware,
and has maintained warm relations with Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright. She once presented Helms with a T-shirt reading:
''Someone at the State Department loves me.''

<HEADLINE> In North Dakota, a Question of Time  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH HOFFNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOTT, N.D. (AP) -- Rodney Mueller is getting ready to vote on a
measure he believes will put time on his side.
</P>
<P>
   Mueller, the road supervisor for Hettinger County in
southwestern North Dakota, said Mountain time forces him to watch
the minutes tick away as he waits for orders for truck and road
grader parts.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's impossible to get parts delivered the next day
when he places orders at 4 p.m. because stores in Bismarck, Fargo
and Minneapolis are already closed. They're all on Central time.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of times, you have to wait an extra day for your
parts,'' Mueller said.
</P>
<P>
   The frustration has picked up steam in western North Dakota,
where voters in six counties are set for a straw poll June 13 to
decide whether they want to set their clocks ahead and embrace
Central time.
</P>
<P>
   Such a sweeping desire to vote on a time change is unusual, the
U.S. Department of Transportation says. The agency, which is the
keeper of the nation's time, has approved only five time change
requests in the past decade, senior attorney Joanne Petrie said.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are often very controversial issues,'' she said. ''It
affects people in a very personal way.''
</P>
<P>
   The nine time zones of the United States and its territories are
standardized by Congress. The lines were drawn to avoid populated
areas, but sometimes they've been moved to avoid complication.
</P>
<P>
   The division between Central and Mountain time roughly follows
the Missouri River. About three-fourths of North Dakota is in the
Central time zone and four counties are split between the two time
zones.
</P>
<P>
   Other states know the feeling. South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas
and Texas all have sections in both Central and Mountain times. The
same holds true for states that straddle the Eastern-Central and
Mountain-Pacific divides.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, New Mexico lawmakers passed legislation that would
put the Mountain state in the Central time zone. They argued the
change would cut down on crime and pedestrian accidents as well as
boost commerce and trade with Mexico, most of which is in the
Central time zone.
</P>
<P>
   If voters in North Dakota's Grant, Hettinger, Mercer, Morton,
Sioux and Stark counties endorse the change, county commissions
will consider petitioning the Transportation Department. The agency
would then hold meetings to get public opinion before making a
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the change in North Dakota say it's inefficient
for government and business to run on Mountain time because four
hours of work are lost each day -- at the start, end and two hours
over lunch -- due to the time difference. Opponents include farmers
who work from sunrise to sunset, regardless of the time zone.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Department says it will not modify time
boundaries for an isolated area. ''We don't like islands of time,''
Petrie said. ''We wouldn't want one little county by itself.''
</P>
<P>
   That means the six North Dakota counties are at the mercy of
each other. If Stark County approves a time change and its eastern
neighbor Morton County doesn't, there may be no time change.
</P>
<P>
   Vern Kessel, president of Belfield NAPA Trucking, wants to keep
time the way it is.
</P>
<P>
   His truckers drive throughout the night to get farm and auto
parts to western North Dakota towns by 8 a.m. Changing to Central
time would mean parts wouldn't arrive until an hour after stores
open, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The folks that are depending on us probably won't be too happy
if we can't deliver on time,'' Kessel said.
</P>
<P>
   But Joe Rothschiller, general manager of Steffes Corp. in
Dickinson, believes Mountain time in western North Dakota is
outdated. Stark County went to Central time in 1957, but quickly
changed back following a boycott of the city's merchants.
</P>
<P>
   ''What fit us 43 years ago doesn't necessarily fit us today,''
Rothschiller said. ''We're a much more mobile society. You go back
43 years, they hardly traveled 100 miles away.''
</P>
<P>
   Local officials say the vote has a better chance in more
populated areas such as Dickinson, and in counties that have split
time zones. Farmers and older people who are less apt to endorse a
change make up a large portion of more rural voters, residents say.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm thinking everybody has their mind made up, and I guess
looking at it from experience it's probably going to receive more
no votes than yes,'' said Hettinger County Auditor Roy Steiner.
''People don't like change, and when they're in doubt, they vote
no.''

<HEADLINE> Inauguration Protest Urged in Peru  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Defeated opposition candidate Alejandro Toledo
is calling for a march of four million protesters in Lima to block
President Alberto Fujimori's inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after a runoff vote boycotted by Toledo and marred by
clashes between demonstrators and police, the former World Bank
consultant said the street protests that have gone on throughout
this Andean nation would continue and build into one massive march
designed to paralyze Lima.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo told foreign journalists Tuesday that the protest is
scheduled for July 26, two days before the presidential
inauguration, ''if Fujimori is still around on that date.''
</P>
<P>
   International criticism of Fujimori continues to grow outside
Peru. However, the Clinton administration backpedaled Tuesday from
its official statement a day earlier that Fujimori could not
''claim legitimacy'' after Sunday's ''flawed'' election. State
Department spokesman Philip Reeker limited himself to an expression
of deep regret.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. officials also said Washington is expected to loosen
official ties with Peru. A State Department official said the
administration was reviewing its policies toward Peru in
international lending organizations.
</P>
<P>
   He said the United States was awaiting today's meeting of the
Organization of American States permanent council before deciding
on future steps.
</P>
<P>
   The runoff was abandoned by independent monitors who deemed the
process unfair.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief nationwide television address Monday night, Fujimori
reiterated that the election was fair and said he hoped he would
not disappoint Peruvians ''in initiating a more authentic
democracy'' in his next five years in power.
</P>
<P>
   But Toledo called Fujimori a dictator who was fraudulently
re-elected and spelled out a three-pronged strategy to keep the
president from extending his stay in power for a third, five-year
term.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo said he would travel the country to prepare for the
march, speaking with university students, unions and other
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Another way Toledo said he plans to keep Fujimori from being
sworn in is by persuading at least 61 of the 120 members of
Congress to boycott the body's opening session on July 28. He said
Fujimori cannot be sworn in without a majority present in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's supporters won only 52 seats in the new Congress, but
Toledo charged that Fujimori's political allies have begun offering
as much as $50,000 to some of the congressmen elected on Toledo's
ticket to get them to join Fujimori's governing alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ''They want to reach 61 or 62 so they will have a majority,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo said he also planned to dispatch representatives to
Washington, Europe and other Latin American nations ''to explain
our position and the need to annul this election.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal, he said, was to have a new, clean election called and
if necessary seek a ''transition government'' in the interim. He
said that would require Fujimori to step down.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo said he still hoped that the OAS will condemn Fujimori's
government as illegitimate but said he realizes it may be difficult
for the member nations to reach a consensus.

Boeing, Sikorsky Get Copter Contract

   FOLSOM, Pa. (AP) -- The Army's next generation of armed reconnaissance
helicopter will be made by Boeing Co.'s helicopter division in this Philadelphia
suburb and at United Technologies Corp.'s Sikorsky aircraft unit in Stratford,
Conn., a Boeing official said. The contract to make 13 RAH-66 Comanche
helicopters is worth $3.1 billion, Boeing spokeswoman Madelyn Bush said Tuesday.
Boeing employs about 500 people at its helicopter plant to work on the Comanche,
and about 70 more people should be hired for it over the next year, she said.

Enzyme Blamed As Cause of Lupus
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   German scientists have provided the first direct evidence that a key enzyme's
failure to mop up dying cells contributes to lupus, a potentially fatal immune
disorder. The study, published in the June issue of the journal Nature Genetics,
involved only mice. However, researchers said the immune reactions are very
similar to what occur in humans. Lupus is a disorder that causes the body's own
defenses to mistakenly attack the DNA and proteins within healthy cells.
Complications include arthritis, blood vessel inflammations and kidney failure.

Court Expands Clean-Air Study

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court drew gasps from environmentalists and
praise from industry representatives Tuesday by expanding its review of a major
clean-air dispute. The justices said they will decide whether anti-pollution
regulations must take the costs of compliance -- not just health effects -- into
account. At stake is air quality nationwide. ''It's been a bedrock principle of
the Clean Air Act that the amount of pollution allowed in the air should depend
on how it affects the health of our children and the elderly,'' said Vickie
Patton, a lawyer with the group Environmental Defense. She said a change in the
clean air policy would ''tip the scales'' away from health and toward economic

<HEADLINE> Missile Defense System Criticized  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY ULBRICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The United States has put on the hard
sell for more than a year now, but the European allies remain far
from convinced that Washington's proposed new national missile
defense system is wise or necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and China don't like it, either.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, it's not even certain the thing will even work.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who meets with EU leaders Wednesday before
traveling to Moscow for his first face-to-face talks with President
Vladimir Putin of Russia, is scheduled to decide this year whether
to order the system deployed. It would entail a small number of
interceptors that are supposed to knock down incoming nuclear
missiles fired countries, newly armed with nuclear weapons, that
the United States considers ''rogue states.''
</P>
<P>
   The greatest worry in Europe is that the missile defense system
would end the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, deal a blow to
efforts to prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons and relaunch
the arms race at a time when most the world wants rid of nukes.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, President Jacques Chirac of France voiced the fears
of many Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   ''How do you convince (nations) to stop piling up new arms when
more powerful countries say it's necessary to develop technologies
that put hard-won strategic balances into question?'' Chirac said.
</P>
<P>
   Washington says with countries like North Korea and Iran,
possibly Iraq and others, acquiring nuclear technology, new dangers
arise. Nuclear dissuasion may not prevent these countries from
launching missiles, the Americans say, so a limited defense system
is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ballistic missile threat from states of concern is growing
and real,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told the allies
last week at a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Florence,
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed U.S. system would be illegal under the existing ABM
treaty, which prohibits nationwide missile defenses. The United
States wants to renegotiate the treaty with Russia to take the new
threats into account.
</P>
<P>
   ''But even the modernization, as the Americans say, of the
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty will lead to extremely dangerous and
unpredictable tendencies,'' Sergei Ivanov, secretary of Russia's
Security Council, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has sent to Europe a steady stream of top-ranking
officials of the State and Defense departments to brief both Russia
and the allies on threats as the Americans see them. This has been
reinforced by teams of experts explaining details of current plans
the national missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   A final test of the interceptors is scheduled for July. Clinton
is expected to make a decision in the autumn whether to go ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ''President Clinton's decision will take into account cost,
threat, technological feasibility and a range of other national
security factors, including the impact on our relations with our
NATO and Pacific allies as well as Russia and China,'' Albright
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the allies know that no matter what their
objections, the decision is an internal American matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are asking Clinton to reflect before his decision on the
repercussions of NMD on the entire world system,'' Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine of France said at the Florence meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Some allies, like Germany, would like to see the system deployed
as part of an overall package that would include a big step toward
a START III nuclear weapons agreement, a modified ABM treaty and
agreement with the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to take care that the ABM treaty is not going to be
substantially damaged and that the international arms control
regime will be strengthened,'' said German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer. ''It's clearly a decision for the United States, but it
will not be taken in a foreign policy-free environment.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Leaves Bush Attacks to Others  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- As advertised, a softer, sweeter Al Gore showed
up to accept the endorsement of the League of Conservation Voters.
</P>
<P>
   Gone were descriptions of his opponent as ''smug'' and
''arrogant,'' which left Republican presidential rival George W.
Bush to grouse about the campaign's sudden role reversal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know how many times you're able to reinvent yourself
in the course of a campaign,'' Bush said Tuesday about Gore's
nascent strategy of playing nice guy while leaving Democratic
surrogates to do the dirty work of trying to bring down the Texas
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in Denver, Bush, who has earned positive headlines
laying out his policy agenda, slammed the Clinton-Gore
administration's management of the military and said Gore is
unqualified for promotion to commander in chief. President
Clinton's former Veterans Affairs Secretary Jesse Brown, in turn,
led a conference call with reporters to question why Bush curtailed
his 1970s tour with the Texas Air National Guard, which kept him
out of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokesman Dan Bartlett accused Gore of ''hiding
behind surrogates to pollute Bush's record.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign schedule reflects the bait-and-switch attempt to
highlight the personal stories of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Gore and his wife Tipper appear at a suburban Washington
community center to discuss mental health, with which Mrs. Gore has
struggled, and an initiative to help parents get insurance and care
for troubled children.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday in Atlanta, he speaks out for the privacy and
treatment rights of people with cancer, which killed his older
sister in 1984. Friday's topic, in Washington, is fatherhood. On
Memorial Day, he told veterans about his decision to enlist in the
Army and volunteer for duty in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Playing up the personal, however, has seemed more a product of
Gore's speechwriters than his own heart. His talk of Vietnam was
brief and stilted. And, to Wisconsin environmentalists, Gore
breezed over what aides had billed as a major focus of the speech:
how he learned environmentalism on his father's farm and at his
mother's dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   The light touch is a marked departure for the candidate who, for
weeks, has hammered Bush as smug, arrogant, reckless and
irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign officials eyeing the polls have worried, of late, that
the attacks could backfire and turn off voters, particularly women,
and so Gore has increasingly turned to surrogates -- including
President Clinton and Cabinet secretaries Donna Shalala, Andrew
Cuomo and William Cohen -- to lob the direct criticisms at Bush. In
a recent interview on National Public Radio, Clinton attacked the
Texas governor's national security, environmental and economic
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Bush generally has let others criticize Gore on his behalf. But
on the issue of military readiness, he went after Gore himself on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign spokesman Chris Lehane called the switch part of
''the certain rhythms to every campaign'' and suggested Gore would
not hold his tongue permanently. ''There will be plenty of
opportunities to draw comparisons and contrasts as we go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   This shift in strategy is the latest for Gore. In a dramatic
move last fall, he moved his campaign headquarters from Washington
to Nashville, Tenn., shed some of the trappings of the office of
vice president and began holding lengthy town hall-style meetings
to better connect with voters.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's lakefront campaign appearance showcasing his long
history of environmentalism, Gore managed 22 minutes of lunchtime
remarks without a single reference -- veiled, indirect or otherwise
-- to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane had told reporters to expect the kid gloves, saying Gore
would focus ''on the importance of the environment to families''
and leave discussion of ''the mess in Texas'' to the League of
Conservation Voters. Lehane himself was unable to resist ribbing
Bush, using the phrase ''the mess in Texas'' four times in five
minutes to describe Bush's record.
</P>
<P>
   The program at Milwaukee's War Memorial Center played out
exactly as billed, with League president Deb Callahan harshly
taking after Bush while the closest Gore got to criticism of anyone
was a reference to ''pro-pollution forces in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in a round of interviews with Wisconsin TV stations, Gore
mentioned the Texas governor's name only once. Referencing his own
support for campaign finance reform, Gore said simply: ''Governor
Bush is opposed to it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the economy, Gore blandly told Madison's WKOW-TV, ''My
opponent's approach is very different.''

<HEADLINE> Sierra Club Member Criticizes Gore  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A pioneer in the environmental movement has
joined a board member of the Sierra Club in criticizing Vice
President Al Gore's ''tawdry environmental record.''
</P>
<P>
   David Brower, the club's executive director in the 1950s and
1960s, said Tuesday that when he resigned from the board earlier
this month he urged ''that they support Ralph Nader.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The other two (presidential) candidates are really the same
color'' on environmental issues and ''it's too bad,'' the
87-year-old Brower said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   His comments followed the Republican National Committee's
release Tuesday of a 6-month-old internal e-mail by Sierra Club
board member Michael Dorsey, a doctoral candidate at the University
of Michigan's school of natural resources and environment.
</P>
<P>
   Dorsey's memo said that over the past seven years, the nation's
natural resources ''have been held hostage to the highest bidder,
especially by the oil companies.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Gore was a major disappointment and I agree with Michael''
Dorsey, Brower said. He added that he was ''quite pleased'' when
the environmental group 'Friends of the Earth' ''took off after the
vice president and backed Bill Bradley instead'' last year.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Gore came under attack, he was endorsed Tuesday by the
League of Conservation Voters, the political arm of the
environmental movement.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign shrugged off Dorsey's e-mail as old news and the
Sierra Club issued a statement applauding the vice president's
''vision.'' The group, which says it is surveying members before
endorsing a candidate, is airing $250,000 worth of ads criticizing
Republican presidential candidate Gov. George W. Bush's
environmental record in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact is Al Gore has helped make this administration one of
the most pro-environment in a generation,'' spokesman Doug Hattaway
said. ''He is far and away the best candidate to protect our air
and water while we maintain economic growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader, a Green Party presidential hopeful, tried to capitalize
on the uneasiness among some environmentalists about Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no difference between Gore and Bush except their
rhetoric'' and Republicans and Democrats are ''two parties who
belong to Big Money,'' Nader told CNN. ''Look at the actual record
of the Clinton-Gore administration. They've broken all kinds of
promises that were in Al Gore's 1992 book.''
</P>
<P>
   Released as Gore was switching from a Senate career to
presidential politics as Bill Clinton's running mate, Gore's book
''Earth in the Balance'' turned into a hot seller and cemented his
reputation as an environmentalist with a world view.
</P>
<P>
   In a play on the title, Dorsey's four-page memo says that
''Under the Vice President's leadership the Earth has never been in
the Balance.''
</P>
<P>
   In the memo, which referred to the group's internal
deliberations, Dorsey claimed that Gore failed to protect the
environment on issues ranging from the Florida Everglades to global
free-trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ''With this legacy, no real environmentalist could ever endorse
Al Gore,'' said Dorsey's memo, captioned, ''The Top 10 Reasons Why
Environmentalists &AMP; We Directors of the Sierra Club Should 'Not'
Endorse Vice President Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   His e-mail suggests the board was wrestling with endorsing the
vice president as early as last November, when Gore was battling a
primary challenge from Democrat Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were unable to come to any conclusion as to whether we
would support the vice president -- either in the primaries or the
general election. The chair of the political committee asked that
directors share information on the environmental records of the
candidates,'' Dorsey wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have amassed some information'' and ''although what follows
is a damning indictment of the vice president's tawdry
environmental record, it unfortunately represents only the tip of
the iceberg,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, talked tough on the environment Tuesday,
pledging in words reminiscent of former President Bush's 1992
no-new-taxes promise that he would be unyielding in his protection
of national parks and forests.
</P>
<P>
   ''And just so I'm crystal clear about it: No new road building
and no timber sales in the roadless areas of our national
forests,'' he said in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   On Alaska, Gore was similarly firm. ''I will never -- I will
never agree to oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife
(Refuge), never,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Takes Aim at Gore on Military  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Stepping out from John McCain's shadow,
George W. Bush is leading a Republican charge against the
Clinton-Gore record on military matters.
</P>
<P>
   He was launching a second day of attacks today at the New Mexico
Veterans Memorial Park.
</P>
<P>
   During the GOP presidential primaries, McCain, the senior U.S.
senator from Arizona and a former Vietnam prisoner of war,
chastised the administration for overdeploying troops and allowing
some to live on food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   From New Mexico, Bush was heading to Arizona for two
fund-raisers. He also was appearing with McCain's colleague, Sen.
John Kyl, but not with McCain, who endorsed Bush on May 9 in
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday in Colorado, the first stop on his four-day,
five-state Western swing, Bush accused the Clinton-Gore
administration of letting the U.S. military decay. He said low
morale and lax troop readiness disqualify the vice president from
promotion to commander in chief.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Clinton-Gore record cries out for a new sign on the
Pentagon. It says, 'Under new management,''' the Republican
presidential contender said during a stop at the 100-year-old VFW
Post No. 1, the nation's oldest Veterans of Foreign Wars club.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with his new strategy of being less harsh, Gore did
not respond directly to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, a surrogate, former Veterans Affairs Secretary Jesse
Brown, raised the issue of Bush being allowed to adjust his
commitment to the Texas Air National Guard in 1972 and 1973 while
working in Alabama on a Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this is an issue that he must explain to the American
people,'' said Brown, who was VA chief from 1993 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer replied: ''Mr. Brown must be
unaware of the fact that the governor fulfilled all his
requirements, which is why he was honorably discharged from the
Guard. It's unfortunate that the vice president is hiding behind a
surrogate to make unfounded personal attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing reports that two of 10 Army divisions were not at the
highest state of readiness, that the Air Force ended last year
short 1,200 pilots and that 6,000 soldiers are on food stamps, Bush
said: ''Al Gore claims that qualifies him for a promotion. No.''
</P>
<P>
   He also rejected an offer from Defense Secretary William Cohen,
a fellow Republican, for a briefing on nuclear security. Cohen made
the offer Sunday after Bush proposed deep cuts in the nation's
missile stockpile.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the briefing I got from Colin Powell and Dick Cheney
and Henry Kissinger was substantial,'' Bush said at a news
conference, referring to members of his foreign policy team. ''I
call on my opponent not to allow the administration to politicize
matters of defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon, asked if the Bush campaign had
responded to Cohen's invitation, said, ''The only response we've
seen is in the press, and that was, they said they didn't need such
a briefing. So the secretary considers the issue finished.''

<HEADLINE> Northern Ireland Coalition Is Back  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- As Northern Ireland's
resurrected Catholic-Protestant government got back to business
Tuesday, both sides expressed hope that the unlikely coalition will
survive on the second try.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody involved predicted smooth sailing for the four-party
Cabinet -- the central goal of the province's 1998 peace accord, and
one that has been repeatedly hamstrung by arguments over Irish
Republican Army disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting beside his IRA-linked party's two Cabinet ministers,
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said they were prepared to wage ''a
battle a day'' with Protestant colleagues and the British
government to make the system work.
</P>
<P>
   ''The difficulties haven't gone away,'' Adams said at Stormont
Parliamentary Building, the government headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   After killing 1,800 people during a 27-year campaign to abolish
Northern Ireland as a Protestant-majority British state, the
outlawed IRA has been sticking to a cease-fire since 1997. Hopes
for long-term peace here rose in December when Catholic and
Protestant politicians formed their long-delayed coalition and
Britain, which had directly ruled the province since 1972, placed
substantial responsibilities back in local hands.
</P>
<P>
   But the major Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, agreed to
work alongside Sinn Fein only if the IRA responded by gradually
scrapping its hidden stockpiles of weapons. Britain suspended the
power-sharing experiment after just 11 weeks when the IRA refused
to move on disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   Then, this month, the IRA promised it would begin putting its
weapons ''beyond use'' -- a euphemism for disarmament -- if
power-sharing was resumed and seen to work. As a result, Britain
restored powers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein and the IRA ''know themselves how much rides on
this,'' said Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble, the senior
Cabinet minister, who last weekend received only a bare majority of
support from his party's grass-roots council to re-enter government
with Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA must begin disarming ''in good time and in a good
spirit,'' Trimble said. Otherwise, he said, ''the whole premise of
this government will be proved unsustainable once again.''
</P>
<P>
   The first meeting of the reconstituted Cabinet is scheduled for
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The most immediate conflicts concern the reform of Northern
Ireland's predominantly Protestant police force, the Royal Ulster
Constabulary; whether the British flag will continue to fly over
Stormont and other government complexes; and, most crucially, when
the IRA will begin to disarm in cooperation with international
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The more hard-line Protestant party in the coalition, the
Democratic Unionists, announced late Tuesday that they would
propose that Sinn Fein be expelled from the Cabinet. Like Sinn
Fein, the Democratic Unionists are entitled to two Cabinet posts
because of their significant minority slice of votes.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Unionists' motion stands no chance of success,
but it would challenge Trimble's already divided deputies to unite
publicly in defense of Sinn Fein's right to hold office.
</P>
<P>
   During the Cabinet's previous abortive run, the Democratic
Unionists accepted their two posts but refused to sit in meetings
because of Sinn Fein's presence. Other parties lambasted the
Democratic Unionists as opportunists and hypocrites because they
supposedly were opposed to the entire peace accord yet accepted
power-sharing positions that come with high salaries and
privileges.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-line party now says that if Sinn Fein remains in
office, they will resign their two Cabinet posts -- but have a
rotation of party colleagues take turns filling the vacated posts
''in a holding capacity only.''
</P>
<P>
   This stunt would undermine the government's operation while
preventing other parties from taking over the posts themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The major coalition partners are the Ulster Unionists and the
province's main Catholic-supported party, the moderate Social
Democratic and Labor Party. Each have four Cabinet posts.

<HEADLINE> Mixed Reception for Trucker Rules  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A government proposal to change the hours
truck and bus drivers can work and to set a mandatory break time is
getting a cool reception where the rubber meets the road.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Department is starting a series of meetings
across the country to hear comments on the proposal. But it's
already received a flood of responses from truckers.
</P>
<P>
   ''You need to get out in the real world and find out what it's
really like and do some studies on real people,'' complained Gordon
Van Cleave of Payette, Idaho. ''I'm all for making the highways
safer, but get real and do it right. This is the one of the more
stupid things the government has come up with in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Please consider financially how you will ruin us drivers and
families by limiting hours of service,'' Jady D. Spell of
Covington, La., wrote to the department.
</P>
<P>
   And Robert R. Homan of Port Charlotte, Fla., said he believes
the new rules ''are more a result of the desires of the railroads
and airfreighters, as these proposals are designed to hamper the
movement of freight.''
</P>
<P>
   But the changes were welcomed by Michael A. Stewart, who didn't
include a home address in his e-mail comments.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yo Feds,'' Stewart wrote, ''Don't knuckle under to the
lobbyists. Make the penalties 10 times more severe than they are
now ... Also, you had better enforce them a whole lot better than
you enforce the rules now in place.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed changes were announced last month. Transportation
Secretary Rodney Slater said they would prevent 2,600 accidents and
as many as 115 fatalities every year.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would establish work limits for five different
classes of drivers, with long-distance operators allowed to do no
more than 12 hours of driving in a 24-hour period. They would also
have to install electronic monitors -- black boxes -- on their trucks
to keep track of their work hours.
</P>
<P>
   Current rules, adopted more than 60 years ago, say truckers can
drive no more than 10 hours straight, followed by at least eight
hours off. But they permit up to 16 hours of driving in a day and
don't include required break time as the new rules do.
</P>
<P>
   The American Trucking Association opposed the change, contending
it will require thousands of additional drivers and trucks to meet
current delivery schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Gillan of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety said
allowing 12 consecutive hours on the road would leave drivers even
more exhausted and Parents Against Tired Truckers also opposed
allowing longer consecutive hours of driving.
</P>
<P>
   A selection of comments from truckers:
</P>
<P>
   --''With a reduction in service hours comes a direct reduction in
the income of the already underpaid driver, while at the same time
causing him to spend about 20 percent more of his time away from
home.'' Frank X. Neumann, Streator, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   --''I do not welcome the addition of a time data recorder onboard
my vehicle. ... What's next then? Perhaps a device to monitor the
amount of time a driver actually sleeps.'' Joseph F. Tadlock,
Amarillo, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   --''We don't need more time off on the road, we need more time
off at Home. ... These are all good ideas made up by people that
don't work in the industry.'' Karl H. Schill, Winslow, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   --''Until such time as the antiquated and dangerous pay by the
mile is forcibly done away with, any positive changes expected from
a simple change in the rules will be negligible.'' Guy A. Bourrie,
Washington, Maine.

<HEADLINE> Jackson, Bird Hope Ewing Plays  </HEADLINE>
By HANK LOWENKRON
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Let the debates end right now. Mark Jackson
and Larry Bird don't want to hear any more about the Knicks being
better off without Patrick Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   Acute tendinitis in his right foot kept Ewing from playing the
last two games in the Eastern Conference finals. The Knicks
overcame his absence to win both times, tying the best-of-seven
series 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   That has renewed debate whether the Knicks are a better team
with or without Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, a former teammate and friend of the veteran center,
said there is no question.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you have one of the greatest centers to ever play the
game, one of the biggest hearts to play the game, a warrior, a
great competitor, I think it is to our benefit not to have him on
the floor,'' Jackson said. ''The numbers say they're 5-1 against us
without him (in the playoffs), but I'll take my chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Some say the Knicks can run better without Ewing slowing them
down.
</P>
<P>
   ''The things they do, they can do those things with Patrick in
the lineup. They choose not to and defer to him,'' said Jackson,
adding that he hoped Ewing can return to the series.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing's availability tonight will be a game-time decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''It really shouldn't matter who is out on the court. You pretty
much play the same type of tempo,'' said Reggie Miller, who had 24
points in Monday's loss. ''We know Patrick is coming back at some
point in this series ... We just have to prepare for that.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a different look when he's in there, without Marcus Camby
being in, there a lot of times it is open for drives. But when
Patrick Ewing comes in, he's a great shot blocker. They go to him a
little more on the offensive end, so we have to be prepared for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   New York coach Jeff Van Gundy would barely discuss Ewing's value
to his team Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've done that enough,'' he said. ''I'll let the foolish
remain foolish and not even try to educate them.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Miller: ''Not knowing if Pat is going to be playing or
not, we still have to establish the inside presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird grew close with Ewing during Bird's playing days in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ''Patrick is a friend of mine. I want to see him have an
opportunity to do well,'' said Indiana's coach. ''We want to beat
them. I feel sorry for Patrick. He's struggled with injuries. If
you're going to get to the championship and win it, you want to
beat the best along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The teams find themselves in the identical situation as in last
year's conference finals: all even after four games with home-court
advantage working in each game.
</P>
<P>
   New York won Game 5 here last year 101-94 and then closed out
the best-of-seven series in Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ''You really can't go too much on statistics, but the team that
wins Game 5 is pretty much in the catbird seat,'' Miller said. ''It
is a big game for both teams.''
</P>
<P>
   The home team has won all eight games this season, a trend the
Pacers hope to maintain tonight at Conseco Fieldhouse. Indiana
recorded a league-best 36-5 home mark during the regular season. In
the playoffs, Indiana is 7-2 at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''We took care of business at home. They matched us,'' Jackson
said. ''There's no need to panic.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Indiana's third consecutive trip to the conference
finals and its fifth in seven years. New York ousted the Pacers in
seven games in 1994 and Orlando eliminated the Pacers in seven
games the following year. Chicago beat Indiana in seven games in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just because we lose two games, that doesn't mean we're not
determined,'' said Jalen Rose, whose 21.3 scoring average in the
series leads Indiana. ''We know what it takes to get here. We just
don't know what it's like to get over this hump and that's what
we're trying to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose also believes the home court gives Indiana an edge.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like we're the best team in the NBA on our home floor,
and I'm planning on us holding serve. I don't think there will be a
letdown by us or our fans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson found comfort in his team outscoring New York 49-34 in
the second half of Monday's 91-89 loss after trailing by 17 points
at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did a good job in the second half. It just boiled down to
playing with effort and being a step quicker,'' he said. ''There's
no reason to be concerned. It's a great series. We knew that it
would be a war coming in. Now we get to the good part, we just have
to take care of business in our building.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller anticipated being more aggressive tonight and when the
series returns to New York for Game 6 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I looked for my shot a lot in Game 4,'' said Miller, who was
9-of-23 from the field, with five 3-pointers in 13 attempts. ''I
pretty much look to do the same thing offensively. ... It's
best-of-three right now, and the pressure is back on us tonight to
shift the pressure back on them.''

<HEADLINE> Knight Cites Overall Good Behavior  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE HERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Bob Knight is sure he can control the
infamous temper that almost cost him his job as Indiana basketball
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Under university president Myles Brand's ''zero-tolerance''
policy, one more slip could lead to Knight's immediate firing. But
in an ESPN interview Tuesday night, Knight said he knows he can
behave himself ''because I think I know Bob Knight better than
anybody does.''
</P>
<P>
   The ESPN interview with Roy Firestone and Digger Phelps, and
another interview earlier Tuesday with a hand-picked group of
sports writers, were the first extensive comments from Knight since
Brand's decision May 15 to give him one more chance.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people have problems with temper ... If I'm really
upset and really mad all the time, then that (anger) controls me,
but I really don't think that's the situation,'' Knight said. ''In
most cases, I'm pretty good. I've obviously made a mistake here and
a mistake there, but I don't think those mistakes define the
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight met with Brand for about two hours on May 14. The
president said the next day he had been prepared to fire Knight on
the spot, but was persuaded by the coach that he was sincere in his
promise to control his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had two thoughts in mind when I went in to see the
president,'' Knight said. ''One was our players. The players that
are here now have been incredibly supportive of what we do. ...
They want to play here, they want to play under this system. The
same thing with the kids who will be joining this team for the
2000-01 season. That meant an awful lot to me.
</P>
<P>
   ''Secondly, it's a president that I think was put into a very
difficult position, a lot of pressure on him, and he gave this an
awful lot of thought and tried to do exactly what he thought was
right.
</P>
<P>
   ''I asked him if he wanted me to coach, first of all. And he
said he did. And I said, 'And I want to coach. That's exactly what
I want to do. Now what do we need to do for that to come about?'''
</P>
<P>
   Brand's decision, which also carried a $30,000 fine and
three-game suspension for Knight, followed an investigation of
allegations that Knight choked former player Neil Reed during a
practice in 1997. During the investigation, other charges surfaced,
including one that Knight hurled a vase in the direction of a
secretary and attacked a former assistant coach and the
university's sports information director.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hall of Fame coach said such flare-ups were not frequent
and his behavior in 29 years as coach ''overall has been good.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If you took the percentages of times that I have really gone
overboard in whatever way, in whatever circumstances, that's a
pretty small percentage of all the circumstances I've been in,'' he
said. ''So to me, it's a simple equation: I have to be able to do
all the time, basically, what I do most of the time now.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he needed professional help to control his temper,
Knight responded emphatically: ''No, I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I've understood for a long time -- maybe way back when I was
playing in high school -- that temper is a problem for me,'' Knight
said. ''I think that in many, many cases I've conquered it, and in
some cases I haven't.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight was asked what he thought his legacy at Indiana would be.
</P>
<P>
   ''My legacy has never been any big deal,'' Knight said. ''My
legacy is what comes back to me when I look in the mirror. I've
made mistakes, I've screwed up. ... I know what I've given to this
game.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that resigning ''was never for me much of a valid
option.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier on Tuesday, Knight answered about 40 questions in a
70-minute session with the group of reporters and said he can abide
by the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I can live within any set of parameters, as long as my
mouth is not taped shut. I think you do have to be able to speak,''
Knight said, according to one of the reporters, Hubert Mizell of
The St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times.
</P>
<P>
   He said the scrutiny that will come with Brand's rigid policy
for behavior won't make him a different person, ''but there can be
a different approach. I think my wife (Karen) is as good at anger
management as anyone I could imagine. She's got magnets hung up all
over the house that say, 'The horse is dead. Get off,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   University vice president Christopher Simpson said Knight
selected the reporters for Tuesday's session.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coach Knight wanted to have a group of reporters both locally
and nationally that he felt had been relatively fair and objective
in their coverage,'' Simpson said. ''Those are the ones he invited
to be with us today.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson said Knight was not ordered by Brand or anyone else to
meet with the media.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president had asked him in his dealings with the media in
the future to handle them with decorum and civility,'' Simpson
said. ''Based on what I just heard ... I think he's off to a
wonderful start. We can be nothing but optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   The reporters who interviewed Knight were Mizell; Lynn Houser
and Mike Leonard of the Bloomington Herald-Times; Dave Kindred of
The Sporting News; William Gildea of The Washington Post; Ursula
Reel of the New York Post; and Billy Reed of the Lexington (Ky.)
Herald-Leader.

<HEADLINE> 'Kind of a Simple Equation'  </HEADLINE>
By JIM LITKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   It sounds straightforward enough.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Knight knows how to behave most of the time and so he
reasons, how much harder can it be to behave all the time?
</P>
<P>
   ''To me,'' he said, ''it's kind of a simple equation.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight was masterful Tuesday night, and why not? He was home,
sitting center circle on a court he made instantly recognizable.
Next season was still months away, the barbarians all still on the
other side of the moat. For nearly an hour, Knight gave almost all
the right answers, and in a voice so flat and measured it could
have put the baby to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Anying really ''stupid'' that Knight regretted?
</P>
<P>
   ''Last night, when my wife asked me to go to a movie, and I said
I'm too tired to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Did any transgression weigh more heavily on his heart than the
others?
</P>
<P>
   ''I checked my record this morning and I've never killed
anybody,'' Knight replied. Hadn't caused any families to break up,
either, he added with pride.
</P>
<P>
   What about professional help?
</P>
<P>
   ''My wife,'' he said, practically leaking common sense, ''is the
best anger-management person I ever saw.''
</P>
<P>
   How soon before the next blowup?
</P>
<P>
   He didn't know, but was willing to take odds. Said he was
looking into establishing a lottery so people could bet on the
exact hour. And when the moment arrived, the proceeds go directly
to the Indiana University library
</P>
<P>
   ''And when it's all said and done,'' he predicted, ''the library
will make a lot of money on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Listening to Knight talk, it was easy to imagine how persuasive
he must be on a recruiting visit -- squashing rumors, allaying
concerns, sharing little confidences and more than anything,
selling the kind of loyalty to place and people that is almost
impossible to find elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Let him shape the debate and Knight can be almost charming. At
one point, interviewer Roy Firestone depicted Knight as some sad,
toothless lion, now bereft of his claws, too. In a heartbeat, the
coach turned the image into something gallant: an aging warrior
relying on guile to get by.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like a guy who lost his 94 mph fastball,'' Knight said,
''and now he's got a slider ... There are some things you got to
adjust to.''
</P>
<P>
   And frankly, that's the problem. After listening to Knight for
the better part of an hour, we still have no idea how he's going to
adjust when the real world intrudes on his little duchy down in
Bloomington once more.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's talk was wonderful -- as far as it went. The questions
were tough, but one of the TV interviewers, former Notre Dame coach
Digger Phelps, has been a pal for decades. And the other,
Firestone, is ESPN's king of schmaltz. The only tension the hour
offered was whether Knight would be reduced to tears, a mysterious
effect that Firestone, like onions, has on so many of his guests.
</P>
<P>
   Knight wasn't -- but there was another reason why he came off so
polished. The live TV session was preceeded by Knight sitting down
with seven print reporters of his choosing, a rehearsal of sorts, a
chance to hone the material in his first public appearance since
university president Myles Brand announced Knight would keep his
job.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, the toughest part of the journey is still
ahead. It will come in the form of a referee's blown call near the
end of a tough winter night, or with a stupid news conference query
afterward. It might be a sinfully clever student-rooting section
take on one of his foibles. It might even come from one of his own
ballplayers, clueless about his spot on the floor at first, and
then cueless as Knight approaches, the vein on the side of the
coach's neck throbbing like a misplaced Adam's apple.
</P>
<P>
   All the grief Brand and the rest of the Indiana braintrust
endured for letting Knight keep the keys to his office was
misplaced. The university needed a policy in place to defend itself
from potential lawsuits, and just as important, to make sure the
current ballplayers, incoming recruits and sympathetic alumni
didn't follow Knight off the end of a short plank. Now, when the
coach goes overboard, he does so alone.
</P>
<P>
   All of that was forgotten for a short while, as it should be.
Knight's slate was wiped clean, but in one last little test, Brand
gave the marking pencil to Indiana athletic director Clarence
Doninger and told him to draw up a code of conduct. Knight nearly
clocked Doninger last February, after a tough loss to Ohio State
and the two haven't spoken since.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I'm hoping this,'' Doninger said just before the
interview, ''is the start of the healing process.''
</P>
<P>
   He'd better do more than hope.

<HEADLINE> Belfour Does Belly Flop for Stars  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Dallas Stars goaltender Ed Belfour
seemed to be in a daze in Game 1 of the Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, he was.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour, the biggest Star of them all as Dallas won the Stanley
Cup last season, clearly wasn't himself as the favored Stars were
embarrassed by the New Jersey Devils 7-3 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just that the Devils kept scoring and scoring, it was
how they scored. With soft shots from the point, with
knuckleball-like shots that floated between Belfour's pads, with
shots off the sticks of players -- namely, defenseman Ken Daneyko --
who hadn't scored in the playoffs in five years.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't the Belfour who outplayed the game's premier goalie,
Buffalo's Dominik Hasek, in leading the Stars to their first
Stanley Cup title a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   No, this was the pre-Stanley Cup Belfour -- the sometimes
confused, unconfident Belfour whose unsteadiness was seen as the
Stars' biggest liability going into last season's finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eddie didn't have a great night,'' coach Ken Hitchcock said.
''He has had great nights for us the whole playoffs. He didn't have
a great one, but I know he will bounce back.''
</P>
<P>
   A bad night? This was a bad month for Belfour, who brought a
1.81 goals-against average into the finals. In the previous round,
Belfour limited the Colorado Avalanche to 13 goals, the fewest in a
seven-game Stanley Cup semifinal series in a half-century.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars seemingly didn't have an excuse for their performance,
but Belfour did. He developed a cold during the Western finals, and
took antibiotics and decongestants to get him through Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   Bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''It affected my judgment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When did he realize it?
</P>
<P>
   ''After they scored six goals,'' Belfour said.
</P>
<P>
   Devils fans delighted in Belfour's misfortune, serenading him
with the chant of ''Ed-die, Ed-die,'' before he was mercifully
lifted early in the third period. They also chanted, ''Marty's
Better,'' referring to Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   The chants were a derisive reference to the ''Eddie's Better''
cheers that Stars fans recited against Colorado. Before that
series, Belfour said he was ''as good or better'' than Avalanche
goaltender Patrick Roy.
</P>
<P>
   On this forgettable night, Belfour couldn't have played much
worse.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they played a pretty good offensive game and I
definitely wasn't on my game, making the stops I should be
making,'' said Belfour, who stopped only 12 of 18 shots. ''I didn't
have much energy out there for myself and I don't think our team
played with a lot of energy, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour expects to feel better, and play better, in Game 2
Thursday. If he doesn't, the Stars risk going back to Dallas down
2-0 in a series they were favored to win.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know he will bounce back,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, it was difficult to predict how Belfour would react
to adversity, and his teammates knew it. That all changed when the
Stars won the cup.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think Eddie has bad games,'' Stars forward Mike Keane
said. ''We didn't help him very much. Ed Belfour is not due for a
bad game. We have to play better in front of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour also plans to lay off the cold medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm definitely going to come to the rink with the attitude to
play a lot better and make those saves, and try and play the best
game I can,'' Belfour said. ''It's just one game and definitely a
wake-up call for all of us. We have to play a lot better.''

<HEADLINE> Devils 7, Stars 3  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- It didn't make a difference if the
words were coming from the New Jersey locker room or the Dallas
dressing quarters after the opening game of the Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   The theme was the same after the Devils' 7-3 win on Tuesday
night. It's only one game, don't make too much of it.
</P>
<P>
   The defending champion Stars aren't that bad. The Devils aren't
that good. And there certainly must be something amiss in the
cosmic lineup when even New Jersey veteran defenseman Ken Daneyko
scores a goal.
</P>
<P>
   If the Devils repeat the performance in Game 2 of the
best-of-seven series on Thursday night at the Continental Airlines
Arena, then maybe you can start putting the crown on their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a rarity that that many go in for us,'' said Daneyko, who
snapped a 48-game goal-scoring drought dating to 1995 with his
go-ahead goal early in the second period. ''We got some breaks, but
it's only one hockey game.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know Dallas may have been a little sluggish from traveling
or what not, but we are taking nothing for granted. It's one hockey
game, it doesn't matter if you win 2-1 or 10-1.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the final margin was not indicative of how badly the
Devils, who got two goals apiece from linemates Jason Arnott and
Petr Sykora, outplayed the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas had trouble getting through the neutral zone all night
and it didn't have the speed and intensity to stop the Devils in
the defensive zone.
</P>
<P>
   It also didn't help that goaltender Ed Belfour was feeling a
little weird after taking some cold medication. The result was two
soft goals and six overall before Ken Hitchcock pulled him early in
the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not anybody's fault, it's not one line's fault,'' Dallas
forward Mike Keane said. ''We didn't play very well. We need to
play with more hunger. You saw from the start that we didn't have
that passion and emotion for some reason. Why? We don't know, but
it's one game.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually it was one game that could have been a lot closer had
it not been for one play maybe.
</P>
<P>
   After Arnott and Darryl Sydor exchanged first-period goals,
Daneyko gave the Devils a 2-1 lead with his shot from the left
point after rookie John Madden won a faceoff with veteran Guy
Carbonneau.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas had a marvelous chance to tie the game midway through the
second period when Mike Modano, who had a relatively quite night,
seemed to catch Martin Brodeur off-guard with a shot from the
left-wing boards. The goaltender could not control the puck and
Brett Hull swooped in for the loose rebound and snapped a shot on
goal from in close.
</P>
<P>
   It went into Brodeur's glove.
</P>
<P>
   ''I made the save, but I think he just shot it right into my
glove,'' said Brodeur, who faced only 18 shots.
</P>
<P>
   The save with 10:01 left in the period kept the game from being
tied, and just 29 seconds later Sykora scored on a great
behind-the-back pass from Patrik Elias for a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens blasted a shot through Belfour's pads with a little less
than four minutes left in the period for a 4-1 lead. Sergei Brylin,
Sykora and Arnott stretched the lead to 7-1 in the opening 5:12 of
the final period.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the last goal was scored, Belfour had been replaced
by Manny Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just one game and definitely a wake-up call for all of
us,'' said Belfour, who allowed six goals in the final three games
of the Western Conference finals against Colorado, and 13 goals
overall in the series. ''We have to play a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, who have now won four straight playoff games since
falling behind Philadelphia 3-1 in the Eastern Conference
semifinals, really can't play much better. The seven goals tied for
their second most in a playoff game and it was two more than
they've scored in any postseason game this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you get into the playoffs scores don't mean too much,''
said coach Larry Robinson, who replaced Robbie Ftorek as coach in
March and now has New Jersey three wins from hockey's most
prestigious trophy. ''It's nice for some of our guys to start
scoring some goals, because they have been hard to come by.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano and Hull, who combined for 18 goals and 39 points in the
first three rounds of the playoffs, took five shots and didn't
register a point.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Sim and former Devil Kirk Muller scored 12 seconds
apart in the third period to make the score more presentable.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were flat and a step late all night,'' Hitchcock said. ''I
think our whole group really struggled in our own zone with the
quickness. I don't think we've played against a group of forwards
this quick before, and we made a lot of mistakes because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Stars don't stop making mistakes, the Devils will become
the first Eastern Conference team to win the Stanley Cup since they
did it in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   And one more game may tell.

<HEADLINE> Polish President Talks With the AP  </HEADLINE>
By DINA KRAFT
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Poland's visiting president said Jewish
families whose property was seized after World War II would be
compensated if Poland lifts legal barriers.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Polish President
Alexander Kwasniewski said Tuesday that if the Polish government
legalizes privatization of property seized by the communists, then
Jews and others would be at least partially compensated for
property lost.
</P>
<P>
   Most Jewish property was first seized by the Nazis during World
War II, then taken over by the communist government.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we have such a law, of course we will try to give some
recompensation,'' Kwasniewski said, ''This of course means for
Jewish people, Jewish families too.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, who is in Israel for a three-day visit, said he
discussed the matter during meetings at Israel's parliament Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Kwasniewski said Jewish compensation was taking time because
Poland's borders were dramatically changed by World War II, making
privatization complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Some 3.5 million Jews made up a thriving community in Poland
before World War II. About 3 million were killed in Nazi death
camps and ghettos, and others left Poland in the 1960s amid
communist-sponsored anti-Semitic campaigns. The community now
numbers 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli-Polish relations have also been strained by the presence
of a large cross next to the Auschwitz death camp, where 1 million
Jews were killed. About 300 smaller crosses on the site were
removed last May.
</P>
<P>
   Noting Pope John Paul II's recent pilgrimage to the Holy Land,
which was heralded as a milestone in Jewish-Catholic relations,
Kwasniewski said now was a good time to again address the cross.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good time to discuss with the Catholic church how to
find a solution without humiliating anybody,'' Kwasniewski said.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of the cross, which was originally erected as a
backdrop for a 1979 papal mass, has drawn protests from Jewish
groups around the world and the Israeli government for insulting
the memory of Jews killed at Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   During his visit, Kwasniewski met with Israeli President Ezer
Weizman and Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Kwasniewski, on his second official trip to Israel, was to
discuss ways to boost Poland's annual $40 million exports to Israel
and encourage more Israeli investment in Poland, as well as
cooperation between Polish and Israeli arms industries.

<HEADLINE> Bee Spellers Follow Tradition  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mona Goldstein has been here before.
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter Amy made it to fourth place in the 1998 Scripps
Howard National Spelling Bee. Today, daughter Joy -- a.k.a. JJ --
will continue the family tradition by spelling with the other 247
contestants in the opening rounds of the national competition.
</P>
<P>
   It's a family thing for the Goldsteins, said the mother, whose
family lives in West Hempstead, N.Y. JJ had to defeat her
13-year-old brother, Ari, in a local bee to make it to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''The real goal behind this is for the kids to enhance their
vocabularies,'' said Goldstein, who has 6-year-old Amanda waiting
to be old enough to compete. ''They are all winners because of what
they've learned.''
</P>
<P>
   JJ, a fifth-grader who likes to read 16-year-old Amy's e-mails
and play basketball with her brother, ''when he isn't cheating,''
is among 19 spellers who will follow a brother, sister, parent or
cousin in the final rounds that begin here today.
</P>
<P>
   No major changes have been implemented from last year's rules to
speed up the marathon two days of spelling, but Jamaica returns to
the competition this year after being banned in 1999 for holding
its local qualifying contest too early. Critics said youngsters
there had as much as a six-month head start to prepare for the
national finals. The 1998 winner was from the Caribbean island
nation.
</P>
<P>
   This year, pupils are arriving from 49 states -- the exception is
Vermont, where no newspaper sponsored a local bee this year -- and
the District of Columbia, American Samoa, the Bahamas, Guam,
Jamaica, Mexico, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the
worldwide schools run by the Defense and State departments.
</P>
<P>
   The 75-year-old competition always has been a family affair,
said Mark Kroeger, a spokesman for Scripps Howard, the
Cincinnati-based media group that sponsors the national finals and
produces the wordlists and study materials. In 1990, for example,
eight spellers were related to previous contestants, he said; 14
were last year.
</P>
<P>
   This is the 73rd annual National Spelling Bee. The series began
in 1925 but was not held in the World War II years 1943-45.
</P>
<P>
   ''You often see whole families come down for the bee,'' Kroeger
said Tuesday, as families went on bee-sponsored tours of Washington
landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise to officials that some children are inspired to
spell by watching a sibling, Kroeger said. ''You can see the
families that encourage a high standard of academics.''

<HEADLINE> Mets 10, Dodgers 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Todd Pratt capped a six-run ninth inning with
a pinch-hit grand slam as the New York Mets rallied past the Los
Angeles Dodgers 10-5 Tuesday night for their fourth win in five
games.
</P>
<P>
   With Los Angeles ahead 5-4, Mike Piazza singled leading off the
ninth against Jeff Shaw (2-3), who blew a save for the fifth time
in 16 chances. Robin Ventura walked and Todd Zeile singled home the
tying run.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Adams relieved and struck out pinch-hitter Joe McEwing.
Kurt Abbott then loaded the bases with a walk, Jon Nunnally struck
out and Melvin Mora walked on a 3-2 pitch for a 6-5 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt, batting for John Franco (2-1), followed with his fifth
homer of the season, the first grand slam of his career. It was the
Mets' fifth slam of the year, the second by a pinch-hitter. Benny
Agbayani did it March 30 in Tokyo to beat the Chicago Cubs 5-1 in
11 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The game lasted 4 hours, 9 minutes -- 13 minutes short of the
major league record, set by the Yankees and Baltimore on Sept. 5,
1997, and matched by Milwaukee and the Chicago Cubs on May 11.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles catcher Todd Hundley left in the sixth inning with a
strained right hip after he went from first to third on Dave
Hansen's broken-bat single.
</P>
<P>
   One out later, pinch-hitter Geronimo Berroa tied it at 4 with a
bloop single off Dennis Cook and Mark Grudzielanek put the Dodgers
ahead with a single off Pat Mahomes.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers nearly lost both of their catchers in one inning.
Geronimo Berroa's foul line drive barely missed hitting Chad
Kreuter in the head. Berroa, who bruised his left foot while
fouling a pitch during that at-bat, was replaced on the bases by
pitcher Carlos Perez, then was taken for X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   Edgardo Alfonzo had three hits and three RBIs for the Mets, who
played their first game since losing shortstop Rey Ordonez for six
weeks with a broken bone in his left arm.
</P>
<P>
   New York rallied from a 3-1 deficit on Piazza's RBI single in
the fifth against Eric Gagne and Alfonzo's two-run single in the
sixth off Herges. Alfonzo has 19 RBIs in his last 19 games.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching on six days' rest, Eric Gagne allowed two runs and six
hits in four-plus innings. The rookie right-hander escaped a
bases-loaded jam in the fourth after walking three batters. But the
Mets chased him in the sixth on Piazza's RBI single, his 20th RBI
in 23 games.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Orel Hershiser, who hadn't pitched for the Dodgers since
May 9 and asked to be optioned to the minors to get in some
competitive work, allowed an unearned run and four hits over six
innings for Class-A San Bernardino Tuesday night in a no-decision
against Lancaster. ... Monday was the 10th anniversary of the day
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson was fired as Mets manager. ...
Johnson's won-lost record against the Mets is 21-22. His .588
winning percentage in New York is still the highest among the 16
managers in Mets history -- 38 points higher than Bobby Valentine's.
The only current Met who played for Johnson in New York is reliever
John Franco.

<HEADLINE> Remains of Jesse James Being Exhumed  </HEADLINE>
By MATT CURRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRANBURY, Texas (AP) -- Add another chapter to the legend of
Jesse James.
</P>
<P>
   Cemetery crewmen, acting under court orders, moved aside a hefty
headstone Tuesday and dug up the remains of a man who purportedly
claimed he was Jesse James. DNA tests are planned to see if he was
the outlaw.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is certainly a historic day, a historic moment,'' said
Steven Reid, an attorney for Jesse Quanah James and Charles A.
James, two men who claim to be James' grandsons. ''We hope it's an
opportunity to provide some additional information on the life and
legend of Jesse James.''
</P>
<P>
   History books say James was shot in the back and killed by Bob
Ford, a member of his own gang, on April 3, 1882, in St. Joseph,
Mo.
</P>
<P>
   But some Granbury residents insist the outlaw survived, assumed
the name of J. Frank Dalton and moved to the town 25 miles
southwest of Fort Worth. They claim he lived to be 104 and was
buried in 1951 under the gravestone that reads ''Jesse Woodson
James'', which includes the inscription, ''Supposedly killed in
1882.''
</P>
<P>
   A University of California anthropologist will perform a DNA
analysis on the remains exhumed Tuesday and compare it to the DNA
of Oklahoma City lawyer Robert Jackson, a known James descendant.
</P>
<P>
   The body buried under James' name in 1882 also was exhumed, in
1995. Scientists who examined those remains said later that the
body was most likely that of James.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the Dalton theory say the findings were not
conclusive.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to set history straight. They made a big mistake,''
said Bud Hardcastle, an Oklahoma used-car salesman and amateur
historian who said years of research pointed him to the Texas
grave. A Hood County judge ordered the exhumation this year.
</P>
<P>
   James was among the most famous outlaws of the Old West, his
exploits sensationalized in dime novels. Along with his brother
Frank, James was a member of the feared Quantrill's Raiders during
the Civil War. After the war, he joined up with other former
Confederates to rob banks and trains.
</P>
<P>
   While historical documents show that James was killed by Ford in
1882, some say James faked his death to elude authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In Granbury, townspeople are said to have suspected Dalton was
the outlaw and Dalton supposedly made the claim himself shortly
before his death.
</P>
<P>
   The late Hood County Sheriff Oran C. Baker said he examined
Dalton's body at his death and ''counted 32 bullet holes from his
forehead to his knees.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Gilliam Beckett, who operates the Jesse James Museum
in Kearney, Mo., does not buy any of it. Besides the DNA testing of
remains from the Missouri grave, handwriting analysis done in the
1980s also show that Dalton wasn't James, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also said the men who claim to be James' grandsons are not
his direct descendants.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know where the real Jesse is buried, up here in Kearney,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the dispute is good for Granbury, a town of about 6,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one of the many legends we have here,'' said Mary
Saltarelli, a spokeswoman for the local Convention &AMP; Visitors
Bureau. ''We do have a lot of tourism. We have a legend that John
Wilkes Booth lived here, as well.''

U.S. Missile Defense System Criticized

<P>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The United States has put on the hard sell for
more than a year now, but the European allies remain far from convinced that
Washington's proposed new national missile defense system is wise or necessary.
Russia and China don't like it, either. What's more, it's not even certain the
thing will even work. President Clinton, who meets with EU leaders Wednesday
before traveling to Moscow for his first face-to-face talks with President
Vladimir Putin of Russia, is scheduled to decide this year whether to order the
system deployed.

	   It's OK for parents to leave on the night light, according to a pair of new
studies that say the light won't make children nearsighted. Two groups of
researchers report in this week's journal Nature that they were unable to
duplicate the results of an earlier study indicating children who sleep with a
night light until age 2 are three times more likely to develop nearsightedness,
or myopia. The two follow-up studies were done separately at the New England

Boeing employs about 500 people at its helicopter plant to work on the Comanche,

Enzyme Blamed As Cause of Lupus
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   German scientists have provided the first direct evidence that a key
enzyme's failure to mop up dying cells contributes to lupus, a potentially fatal
immune disorder. The study, published in the June issue of the journal Nature
Genetics, involved only mice. However, researchers said the immune reactions are
very similar to what occur in humans. Lupus is a disorder that causes the body's
own defenses to mistakenly attack the DNA and proteins within healthy cells.
Complications include arthritis, blood vessel inflammations and kidney failure.

Court Expands Clean-Air Study
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court drew gasps from environmentalists and
praise from industry representatives Tuesday by expanding its review of a major
clean-air dispute. The justices said they will decide whether anti-pollution
regulations must take the costs of compliance -- not just health effects -- into
account. At stake is air quality nationwide. "It's been a bedrock principle of
the Clean Air Act that the amount of pollution allowed in the air should depend
on how it affects the health of our children and the elderly," said Vickie
Patton, a lawyer with the group Environmental Defense. She said a change in the
clean air policy would "tip the scales" away from health and toward economic
concerns.

<HEADLINE> Court Upholds Ban on Soft Money  </HEADLINE>
By HOPE YEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Lawyers for a man challenging a 1907 ban
on corporate contributions to federal candidates say they may
appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court after a lower court upheld the law
as constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Floyd Abrams had urged the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals to strike down the ban, arguing that ''soft money''
loopholes in the campaign finance law makes the ban on corporate
contributions ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   But in an unanimous opinion released this month, the 10-member
court in Philadelphia stated that ''any reform in this area must be
sought from Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Abrams represents Renato P. Mariani, the former president of
Empire Sanitary Landfill who was indicted in a campaign finance
probe.
</P>
<P>
   Mariani and other former Empire officials were charged with
funneling corporate money from the landfill to candidates for
federal office, including President Clinton and Republican
presidential candidate Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Mariani sued the federal government, contending the 93-year-old
contributions ban is unconstitutional. His attorneys also argued
the ban was meaningless since corporations may donate unlimited
amounts of soft money for so-called ''issue ads'' that make veiled
attacks on candidates without directly advocating their defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams on Tuesday criticized the appeals court for upholding ''a
system which simply fails to accomplish anything other than trap an
occasional unwary contributor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Election Commission, which opposed Mariani's
challenge, said it was confident the ban could withstand an appeal
to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   General Counsel Lawrence Noble said that while the growing
influence of soft money is troubling, that was no reason to throw
out the regulations altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just because the law doesn't address every perceived problem
doesn't mean it's unconstitutional,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Rocker Tommy Lee Released From Jail  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. (AP) -- Rocker Tommy Lee has been released after
serving five days in the Los Angeles County Jail for violating
parole in a domestic violence case by drinking alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's probation violation occurred as he and estranged wife
Pamela Anderson celebrated on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Five months later, after the couple broke up, the actress
reportedly called the district attorney's office and reported that
Lee had violated his probation by drinking alcohol, KABC-TV
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Malibu Superior Court Judge Lawrence Mira ordered Lee to return
to court for a progress report Sept. 5.
</P>
<P>
   She warned the former Motley Crue drummer to stick to the
straight and narrow during the Tuesday hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ''(If you) do not commit to sobriety ... then you're going to
come back to this court and it'll be a very unhappy experience for
you,'' Mira said.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing Friday, Mira extended Lee's probation to May 26,
2003, reinstated random drug testing for Lee, 37, and ordered him
to enroll in Alcoholics Anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   The rock star was charged in February 1998 with spousal abuse,
child abuse and a firearms violation after Anderson called police
from her Malibu home and reported she had been assaulted during an
argument.
</P>
<P>
   Lee pleaded no contest to felony corporal injury to a spouse and
was sentenced to terms of 180 days in jail and three years in state
prison, both of which were suspended, as well as 200 hours of
community service and time in a batterer treatment program.

<HEADLINE> Lazio hits the trail in the ''Mainstream Express''  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Starting his first full day of campaigning
aboard his ''Mainstream Express'' bus, Republican Senate candidate
Rick Lazio said his race against Hillary Rodham Clinton was ''a
struggle between somebody on the far left and somebody in the
center.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressman from Long Island said he had dubbed the bus the
''Mainstream Express'' for two reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ''One is to reinforce my record in the house which is a
mainstream record which is, I think, where the vast majority of New
Yorkers are,'' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said the second reason was ''to reinforce this is a
grass-roots campaign and we're going to be out and open and among
the people. I'm going to be here answering your questions like I am
right now at every stop. We're going to be accessible. I expect to
be held accountable ... I think that's what this campaign should be
all about. It shouldn't be about rope lines and checking
credentials and scripted responses.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio made his comments to reporters before heading off to visit
a Syracuse milk plant.
</P>
<P>
   Pledging to take ''our message of hope, opportunity and
responsibility'' on the road, the Long Island congressman was the
unanimous pick Tuesday of his party's state convention to take on
the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   With the ''Rocky'' theme blaring from loudspeakers and sporting
a fat lip courtesy of a tumble during a Memorial Day parade on
Monday, Lazio took the convention stage at a Buffalo hotel to
declare: ''I am the underdog in this race.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My opponent is better financed and better known. She comes to
New York with the support of every left-wing special interest, from
Washington insiders to the Hollywood elite,'' Lazio told more than
400 cheering delegates and over 1,000 more in attendance in a more
than 25-minute speech.
</P>
<P>
   And, pressing a favorite Republican theme -- that Clinton is a
carpetbagger -- Lazio said, ''I have one advantage she'll never have
-- I can be myself. I am a New Yorker.''
</P>
<P>
   While not criticizing Clinton by name, Lazio accused ''the
opposition camp'' of practicing the ''politics of division ... It
is a bleak, angry place, built of fear. And I will not go there.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said the congressman
had ''offered the people of New York recycled insults and rhetoric
that doesn't match his record. Time and time again Rick Lazio has
voted against New York's working families in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hillary Clinton has been running an inclusive campaign since
day one and fighting for children and families for thirty years,''
Wolfson added. ''New Yorkers will always be able to count on
Hillary to stand up for them in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Emulating Bill Clinton's successful 1992 presidential campaign
and Sen. John McCain's failed run for the White House this year,
Lazio left the convention for a three-day bus trip across the state
on his customized cruiser dubbed ''The Mainstream Express'' by
campaign aides who used to work on the McCain campaign. The
senator's bus was called ''The Straight Talk Express.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio attended a rally at a Buffalo baseball park Tuesday
evening then headed to Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   After the stop at the Syracuse milk plant, the congressman was
headed to the Finger Lakes for a stop at a winery and a walk
through the village of Watkins Glen. Also scheduled was a visit to
the Corning Glass Museum and rallies in Elmira and Binghamton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, meanwhile, planned a rally with supporters today in New
York City and a visit to a school in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   For Lazio, 42, the GOP nomination marked the culmination of a
dream that seemed dashed just nine months ago when Gov. George
Pataki convinced the congressman to suspend his fledgling Senate
campaign in favor of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's expected run.
</P>
<P>
   The dream was reborn on May 19 when the New York City mayor
announced he was leaving the Senate race because of prostate
cancer. Pataki and other Republican leaders quickly rallied around
the little-known Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Since entering the race, Lazio has been stressing his New York
roots, a none-too-subtle reminder that Clinton only moved into the
state in January. And, he has pointed to his record as a four-term
congressman who helped overhaul the nation's public housing system,
worked to protect the environment and voted to raise the minimum
wage.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton camp, on the other hand, portrays Lazio as a
conservative out of step with mainstream New Yorkers. Clinton aides
have repeatedly pointed to Lazio's support for eight out of 10
proposals from former House Speaker Newt Gingrich's ''Contract with
America.'' She has also taken her rival to task for saying he's a
supporter of abortion rights, noting he has regularly voted to cut
federal Medicaid funding for poor women's abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Clinton and Giuliani, Lazio has also come out in favor of
banning the late-term abortion procedure that critics called
''partial-birth abortion.'' That has cleared the way for him to
pick up the endorsement of the state's Conservative Party. No
Republican has won statewide office in New York since 1974 without
Conservative Party backing.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were modestly lower at the start of
trading today as investors stepped back from Tuesday's buying spree
to re-evaluate their strategies.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq
composite index was down 22.41 at 3,437.07. On Tuesday, the index
recorded its best day in history, with the largest percentage gain
ever and the second-largest point gain ever.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators, which joined the Nasdaq in Tuesday's
rally, were also lower. The Dow Jones industrial average was down
14.65 at 10,512.48 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down
1.32 at 1,421.13.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent Technologies fell 1 9/16 to 56 7/16. The company, the
world's biggest maker of telephone equipment, is acquiring
Chromatis Networks, a privately held optical networking firm, for
about $4.5 billion in stock. Lucent said the deal would will help
it gain business in big cities.
</P>
<P>
   Kmart rose 11/16 to 8 5/16. The company tapped the No. 2
executive at drug chain CVS Corp. as its new leader, replacing
Floyd Hall, who announced in mid-May that he was planning to retire
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street is already waiting for the government's employment
report for the month of May, due out Friday. The report could offer
some indication of whether six interest rate increases by the
Federal Reserve have begun to slow the pace of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   But a preliminary sign of success came today from the Commerce
Department, which reported that sales of new homes tumbled 5.8
percent in April. That marked the largest decline since last
September.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 110.39 million
shares, ahead of Tuesday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies slipped 0.54 to
476.16.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.6 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's Xetra DAX index was up 0.02 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.05 percent, and France's CAC-40 was
up 0.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Mixed Reception for Trucker Rules  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A government proposal to change the hours
truck and bus drivers can work and to set a mandatory break time is
getting a cool reception where the rubber meets the road.
</P>
<P>
   ''The proposal is a knife in the heart of my industry,'' Godfrey
LeBron, a bus tour operator from Elmont, N.Y., told regulators
today as the Transportation Department began a series of public
hearings to get comments on the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are different,'' LeBron said, seeking an exemption for bus
drivers to the proposed rule.
</P>
<P>
   David Osiecki of the American Trucking Association contended
that the proposed limits on driver work time would result in less
safety, requiring the hiring of more inexperienced drivers and
putting more trucks on the highways to get the goods delivered.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rule is also proving unpopular with individual
truckers, who have been flooding the department with written
comments.
</P>
<P>
   ''You need to get out in the real world and find out what it's
really like and do some studies on real people,'' complained Gordon
Van Cleave of Payette, Idaho. ''I'm all for making the highways
safer, but get real and do it right. This is the one of the more
stupid things the government has come up with in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Please consider financially how you will ruin us drivers and
families by limiting hours of service,'' Jady D. Spell of
Covington, La., wrote to the department.
</P>
<P>
   And Robert R. Homan of Port Charlotte, Fla., said he believes
the new rules ''are more a result of the desires of the railroads
and air-freighters, as these proposals are designed to hamper the
movement of freight.''
</P>
<P>
   But the changes were welcomed by Michael A. Stewart, who didn't
include a home address in his e-mail comments.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yo Feds,'' Stewart wrote. ''Don't knuckle under to the
lobbyists. Make the penalties 10 times more severe than they are
now. ... Also, you had better enforce them a whole lot better than
you enforce the rules now in place.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed changes were announced last month. Transportation
Secretary Rodney Slater said they would prevent 2,600 accidents and
as many as 115 fatalities every year.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would establish work limits for five different
classes of drivers, with long-distance operators allowed to do no
more than 12 hours of driving in a 24-hour period. Trucks would be
required to carry electronic monitors -- black boxes -- to keep track
of drivers' work hours.
</P>
<P>
   Current rules, adopted more than 60 years ago, say truckers can
drive no more than 10 hours straight, followed by at least eight
hours off. But they permit up to 16 hours of driving in a day and
don't include required break time as the new rules do.
</P>
<P>
   The American Trucking Association opposed the change, contending
it would require thousands of additional drivers and trucks to meet
current delivery schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Gillan of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety said
allowing 12 consecutive hours on the road would leave drivers even
more exhausted. Parents Against Tired Truckers also opposed
allowing longer consecutive hours of driving.
</P>
<P>
   A selection of comments from truckers:
</P>
<P>
   --''With a reduction in service hours comes a direct reduction in
the income of the already underpaid driver, while at the same time
causing him to spend about 20 percent more of his time away from
home.'' Frank X. Neumann, Streator, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   --''I do not welcome the addition of a time data recorder onboard
my vehicle. ... What's next then? Perhaps a device to monitor the
amount of time a driver actually sleeps.'' Joseph F. Tadlock,
Amarillo, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   --''We don't need more time off on the road, we need more time
off at home. ... These are all good ideas made up by people that
don't work in the industry.'' Karl H. Schill, Winslow, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   --''Until such time as the antiquated and dangerous pay by the
mile is forcibly done away with, any positive changes expected from
a simple change in the rules will be negligible.'' Guy A. Bourrie,
Washington, Maine.

<HEADLINE> Medical Journal Editor To Divest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- The newly appointed editor of the New England
Journal of Medicine is pledging to divest any interest he has in
pharmaceutical companies in an effort to avoid conflicts of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeffrey Drazen also said he might have made a mistake last
year when he praised an asthma drug that was made by a company he
received money from as a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were probably a little overzealous,'' Drazen said Tuesday.
''In the future we'll be more careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Drazen, an asthma specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital,
takes over as editor on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a
''notice of violation'' against Sepracor Inc., the maker of the
drug, levalbuterol.
</P>
<P>
   Drazen was paid by Sepracor to evaluate studies on the drug. He
concluded the product was the ''first real advance in rescue asthma
therapy in over 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Sepracor used Drazen's praise to promote the drug. But the FDA
found the statement overstated the safety and efficacy of the
product.
</P>
<P>
   Drazen also said he would sever all financial ties to drug
companies before he assumes his position with the journal, USA
Today reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Drazen has had financial ties with at least 21 drug companies
since 1994, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   He is replacing interim editor Dr. Marcia Angell, whose May 18
editorial ''Is Academic Medicine for Sale?'' criticized doctors who
place profits first.
</P>
<P>
   Drazen said the answer was no. He said academic researchers must
work closely with these companies to remain up-to-date on new drugs
as they come into the market.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no way around it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The key is for doctors running the clinical trials on the drugs
to have no financial interest in the outcome, he said.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Up 3l; Dow Up 27  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned mostly higher today after a slate
of economic reports suggested rising interest rates are
successfully slowing the economy and warding off inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index
was up 31.31 at 3,490.79. The Nasdaq was building on Tuesday's
gains, when the rose 254.37 points, or 7.9 percent -- its largest
percentage gain ever and the second-largest point gain ever.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators, which joined the Nasdaq in Tuesday's
rally, also turned upward after early declines. The Dow Jones
industrial average was up 27.41 at 10,554.54 and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was up 7.55 at 1,430.00.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks shook off some early weakness after three separate
economic reports offered signs that the economy is no longer
growing at the rapid pace that prompted the Federal Reserve to
raise interest rates six times in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said the most significant report was data from the
Purchasing Management Association of Chicago. The group's index of
area business activity fell to 53.9 in May, on a seasonally
adjusted basis, from 56.5 in April. The report is considered a good
gauge of the national purchasing managers' report, due out on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Also today, the Commerce Department reported that sales of new
homes tumbled 5.8 percent in April. That marked the largest decline
since last September.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the Index of Leading Economic Indicators declined
by 0.1 percent last month, the Conference Board said today. The
compilation of forward-pointing economic statistics is designed to
forecast the future direction of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The three reports combined to entice buyers, who are beginning
to feel that the Fed's efforts to quell inflation are succeeding,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The economy is already showing evidence of a slowing rate of
expansion,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, chief market strategist at
A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis, pointing to reports last week
that showed declines in existing home sales and consumer
confidence. ''Inflation reports remain benign.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wall Street was already looking ahead to the government's
employment report for the month of May, due out Friday. That report
should indicate whether a continued low jobless rate is forcing
companies to boost wages and benefits to retain workers.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent Technologies fell | to 57]. The company, the world's
biggest maker of telephone equipment, is acquiring Chromatis
Networks, a privately held optical networking firm, for about $4.5
billion in stock. Lucent said the deal would will help it gain
business in big cities.
</P>
<P>
   Kmart rose 13/16 to 8 7/16. The company tapped the No. 2
executive at drug chain CVS Corp. as its new leader, replacing
Floyd Hall, who announced in mid-May that he was planning to retire
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 278.90 million
shares, ahead of Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 4.62 to 481.32.

<HEADLINE> 'Sex and the City' Set To Return  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- As we rejoin ''Sex and the City,'' we find our
four gal pals, fabulous but chilly, at the railing of a ferry bound
for Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, this is good,'' Miranda grumbles to the others. ''We're
actually crossing water to meet men.''
</P>
<P>
   She gazes back across the harbor at Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who would have thought,'' she deadpans, ''that an island that
tiny would be big enough to hold all our old boyfriends?''
</P>
<P>
   Setting sail for its third season on HBO Sunday at 9 p.m.
Eastern, ''Sex and the City'' retains all the sass, savvy and eye
appeal of summers past. For the next 18 weeks, we'll be treated to
the Manhattan mating dance. And showing us the steps will be four
of its funniest, most footloose devotees.
</P>
<P>
   There's Carrie (played by Sarah Jessica Parker), the
self-described ''sexual anthropologist'' who writes a newspaper
column called ''Sex and the City.'' Charlotte (Kristin Davis) is an
art dealer and Smith graduate who still believes in love, all the
better on Egyptian cotton sheets. Samantha (Kim Cattrall) is a
liberated PR exec who's been there, done that -- then done it again
elsewhere at her earliest opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out this sexy sisterhood is Cynthia Nixon as Miranda, a
corporate lawyer who, as self-fulfilling prophecies go, could beat
the Oracle at Delphi. That is, Miranda insists all men are scum
and, as often as not, manages to prove herself correct.
</P>
<P>
   Smart, cynical, judgmental and controlling -- that's Miranda.
''But the people who are prickliest are always softies on the
inside,'' Nixon insists. ''First, Miranda fights. Then she
softens.''
</P>
<P>
   And, often, with a splat. Like the time a bedmate overcame
Miranda's resistance to swearing at him while they made love. To
her surprise, she found she liked it. Then she went too far. She
shocked him with her outbursts. Another ex-boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about ''Sex and the City'' with a reporter recently,
Nixon is as tickled as anyone at such misadventures. And no wonder:
She escaped the unforgiving world her series depicts.
</P>
<P>
   ''People always ask me whether women really act that way,'' she
says. ''I don't! But I haven't been in the dating scene, like,
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   At 34, she has lived with her partner Daniel Mozes (a college
English professor and photographer) since she was 21. They have a
3{-year-old daughter, Samantha.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Nixon thinks there's room on TV for a series about single
women with active libidos who aren't discredited as ''loose.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the greatest thing about the show, in terms of whether
it's 'real' or not, is the number of men these women have. As
viewers, we know them and love them, and we don't think of them as
sluts. They're just women who have a lot of sex.''
</P>
<P>
   And when they're not having it, they're liable to be talking
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''On an upcoming episode they speculate on who among them they
might like to have a threesome with,'' says Nixon, chuckling.
''Nobody picks Miranda. None of the others even notice they haven't
picked her. So Miranda becomes obsessed with why.''
</P>
<P>
   Over a salad at a no-glitz restaurant near her Upper West Side
Manhattan digs, Nixon looks as different from her character as she
claims to be. While Miranda, like her three pals, is typically
glammed up, Nixon presents herself in jeans and a sweater over a
T-shirt. Her carrot-colored hair is capping a face free of makeup.
</P>
<P>
   Having just shopped for dinner, she has a sack of fresh produce
on the seat beside her. This is a welcome day off from the show's
busy routine, and she's making the most of it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I lead a very stable life,'' she says. ''I grew up here, and
my life is pretty much the same as it's always been.''
</P>
<P>
   Since childhood, part of that life has been acting. But only
part.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never felt like show biz was the be-all and end-all,'' she
explains. ''And when I was a child, everybody put the fear of God
in me that not many child actors become adult actors.''
</P>
<P>
   Sound advice. Yet Nixon made the leap and has been busy ever
since. Her films include ''The Pelican Brief'' and ''Addams Family
Values.'' She has appeared on and off Broadway in plays ranging
from ''Romeo and Juliet'' to ''Angels in America.'' She has had
numerous roles on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Auditions for ''Sex and the City'' came up in 1997. Nixon was
game for any of the four characters. Since then, she has thought a
lot about the ''in'' group they comprise.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see Carrie's friends as aspects of her,'' Nixon says. ''Her
body, Samantha. Her mind, Miranda. Her heart, Charlotte.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she proposes a distaff variation of the Judgment of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want Carrie to have a dream where she goes back to ancient
Greece, and there's a contest between goddesses: Hera offers her
power, Athena offers her brains, Aphrodite offers her love.
</P>
<P>
   ''Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte would play the goddesses, each
arguing for their point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Doubtless, over a nice lunch. And no men allowed.

<HEADLINE> Did Doctor Give Comfort or Death?  </HEADLINE>
By C.G. WALLACE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Dr. Robert Weitzel was either an angel of
mercy, easing the pain of his dying patients, or a methodical
killer preying on the elderly patients entrusted to his care.
</P>
<P>
   Over 16 days from late 1995 to early 1996, five of the
psychiatrist's patients died at the geriatric-psychiatric unit of
the Davis Hospital and Medical Center in Layton.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contend that all five were admitted for dementia --
not life threatening diseases -- and that Weitzel killed them with
lethal doses of morphine.
</P>
<P>
   Now the 43-year-old doctor is charged with five counts of murder
and could spend the rest of his life in prison if convicted. His
trial begins June 5 in Farmington.
</P>
<P>
   Weitzel's notes state he ordered nine nurses to administer
morphine to the patients. In some cases, he consulted with the
patients' families about making their loved ones more comfortable
as they died.
</P>
<P>
   At least four patients or their relatives had signed
do-not-resuscitate orders. The relatives trusted the doctor and
believed their family members had died natural deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Bringhurst, a registered nurse, described the day her
mother, 72-year-old Mary Crane, died.
</P>
<P>
   ''I asked if there was anything we could do,'' Bringhurst
testified at a preliminary hearing in late January. ''Dr. Weitzel
said, 'We can give her some morphine and keep her comfortable and
hasten the inevitable.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bringhurst thanked the doctor for his help.
</P>
<P>
   Merlin Larsen said at the hearing that he placed his 93-year-old
mother, Judith Larsen, who had suffered two strokes, at the
hospital after she began causing disturbances at a care center.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after she was comatose and Weitzel said she didn't have
long to live, Larsen said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was, I thought, very kindly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators exhumed the bodies of Larsen and Crane, along with
83-year-old Ennis Alldredge. Autopsies showed that Larsen died from
lethal amounts of morphine, police said. The cause of death was
inconclusive for Crane and Alldredge.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the bodies of Ellen Anderson, 91, and Lydia Smith,
90, were also exhumed. Those autopsy results have not been
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys from both sides are honoring a gag order imposed at
the preliminary hearing and would not discuss the case.
</P>
<P>
   But evidence at that hearing showed that one of the five
patients died after just 17 hours in Weitzel's care. None of the
deceased was taking any medication stronger than Tylenol prior to
being admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know the doctor say the charges are absurd.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is truly going to break my heart if he is convicted. People
do not realize what a good doctor he is. He saved my daughter, what
more can I say?'' said Jan Smith LaBard, who credits Weitzel with
helping her teen-age daughter recover from severe depression.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Lubsen, who has known Weitzel for years, describes him as
a loyal friend who would lend support in times of need.
</P>
<P>
   Weitzel surrendered his license to practice medicine in
California in 1997 after allegedly having an affair with a former
patient he had treated for depression.
</P>
<P>
   At about that same time, the Utah Division of Occupational and
Professional Licensing began investigating an anonymous complaint
of misconduct in Utah, said division spokesman Kim Morris. The
licensing division turned over the contents of their investigation
to the police, Morris said. The murder charges followed.
</P>
<P>
   Weitzel also faces federal charges in Utah on 22 counts of
prescription fraud. He is accused of writing 18 prescriptions for
morphine and four for the pain killer Demerol to six patients, but
keeping the drugs. That trial has not been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, he is under investigation in Bay City, Texas, for
the Dec. 19, 1998, death of 87-year-old Laura Ware, said Bay City
Police Capt. Jim Jumonville.
</P>
<P>
   Weitzel cared for Ware at the Legacy Nursing Home in Bay City.
She died at Matagorda General Hospital, where Weitzel also
practiced, but officials there would not comment, citing pending
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the legal battles ahead for Weitzel, families of his
patients, who had thought their loved ones died peacefully, are
seeking closure.
</P>
<P>
   Merlin Larsen's brother, Harold, said he knew nothing about
Weitzel until the charges were filed.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been in trouble every place he's ever worked. We pity him
because he's made such a mess of his life,'' he said. ''We're
hoping that we can put a conclusion to it. Maybe the trial will do
that, maybe it won't. I don't know.''

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Up 34; Dow Up 16  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned mixed today as investors wondered
whether some new signs of slower economic growth mean that the
Federal Reserve is nearing the end of its long run of interest-rate
increases.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index was
down 33.56 at 3,425.92, teetering between gains and losses. On
Tuesday, the index rose 254.37 points, or 7.9 percent -- its largest
percentage gain ever and the second-largest point gain ever.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators, which joined the Nasdaq in Tuesday's
rally, were mixed. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 16.44 at
10,543.57 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 0.52 at
1,421.93.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said interest rate worries were preventing the market
from building decisively on Tuesday's gains.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we're going to see these periodic rallies, but I don't
think they'll be sustainable because of the nervousness that's
lingering over monetary policy,'' said Ned Riley, chief investment
strategist at State Street Global Advisors.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks shook off some early weakness after three separate
economic reports offered signs that the economy is no longer
growing at the rapid pace that prompted the Federal Reserve to
raise interest rates six times in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said the most significant report was data from the
Purchasing Management Association of Chicago. The group's index of
area business activity fell to 53.9 in May, on a seasonally
adjusted basis, from 56.5 in April. The report is considered a good
gauge of the national purchasing managers' report, due out on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Also today, the Commerce Department reported that sales of new
homes tumbled 5.8 percent in April. That marked the largest decline
since last September.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the Index of Leading Economic Indicators declined
by 0.1 percent last month, the Conference Board said today. The
compilation of forward-pointing economic statistics is designed to
forecast the future direction of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The three reports should convince investors that the Fed's
efforts to quell inflation are succeeding, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The economy is already showing evidence of a slowing rate of
expansion,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, chief market strategist at
A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis, pointing to reports last week
that showed declines in existing home sales and consumer
confidence. ''Inflation reports remain benign.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wall Street was already looking ahead to the government's
employment report for the month of May, due out Friday. That report
should indicate whether a continued low jobless rate is forcing
companies to boost wages and benefits to retain workers.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent Technologies fell ~ to 57[. The company, the world's
biggest maker of telephone equipment, is acquiring Chromatis
Networks, a privately held optical networking firm, for about $4.5
billion in stock. Lucent said the deal would will help it gain
business in big cities.
</P>
<P>
   Kmart rose 1 1/16 to 8 11/16. The company tapped the No. 2
executive at drug chain CVS Corp. as its new leader, replacing
Floyd Hall, who announced in mid-May that he was planning to retire
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 402.21 million
shares, ahead of Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.34 to 477.04.

<HEADLINE> Carly Simon Celebrates New Album  </HEADLINE>
By MARY CAMPBELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Carly Simon says she didn't try to write a song
about her struggle with cancer; instead the song, ''Scar,'' led
her.
</P>
<P>
   ''One day in my bathtub I was looking out the window at snow and
I wrote the first verse. I was thinking about my scar and how it is
something that would make a person who is loved more lovable,'' she
says. ''If you love somebody, you just want to kiss and protect
their scars; you want to protect the things about them that make
them vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon, whose new album, ''The Bedroom Tapes,'' was released May
16 by Arista, says she's now in good health, and has gotten over a
bout with writer's block, recovered from depression, and moved from
New York to Boston to Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm feeling so much as if music once again has come to my
rescue,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Bedroom Tapes'' is a look at what's been going on in her
life. The bedroom, she hastens to explain, is daughter Sally's old
room in the house on Martha's Vineyard, where Simon now lives full
time and where she did most of the recording.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote most of the songs for the CD while she was undergoing
chemotherapy for breast cancer. ''I think the reason is that when
you have a life-threatening illness, you call upon life itself to
fight it. You get more and more involved in life, whatever that
means to you. For me, it was music,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing chemotherapy, Simon, 54, went into depression
from the chemicals for about six months. The song ''I Forget'' is
about that experience.
</P>
<P>
   ''I waited for the sun to go down so I could go to bed. It was
that long tunnel where you don't see the light at the end,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   ''People may forget life was ever good and not recognize the
symptoms as being depression. I hope that people, if they listen to
the song and recognize themselves, will get treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   One verse of ''Scar'' is about a friend who phoned and said he
wanted to see her, but who didn't call again after she told him she
was healing from cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people during my illness avoided me,'' Simon says.
''I think they were frightened of their own mortality. They didn't
want to talk to anybody fighting a life-threatening disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a lot of compassion for people who don't know what to
say. Not everybody has strengths in the same area.''
</P>
<P>
   The breast cancer diagnosis came in October 1997, with surgery
that November and chemotherapy from January to June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Her writer's block arrived earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''Around 1996, everything was coming out like garbage,'' she
says. ''I'd had slumps before, but nothing nearly as long-term as
that one.''
</P>
<P>
   She decided not to write songs anymore, and in 1997 released
''Film Noir,'' an album of songs from films.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was thinking music had abandoned me,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The beginning of the end for writer's block came when she heard
''Embraceable You'' on a jukebox. That led to the first song she
wrote for the new album, ''In Honor of You (George).''
</P>
<P>
   ''I was the person who had lost her way in the song. I found it
again by imagining George Gershwin sitting in summer heat, writing
that song, looking for the hook,'' Simon says.
</P>
<P>
   After that, she didn't write for another year and a half, until
early 1998. But she was thinking about writing songs in a free
form. ''A lot don't have choruses,'' she says. ''They go wherever
they want to. They have an overriding sense of something I want to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon had made one album with her sister, Lucy, in 1964, before
her solo career started. Most of her hits came in the 1970s,
including ''That's the Way I've Always Heard it Should Be,''
''Anticipation,'' ''You're So Vain,'' ''Haven't Got Time for the
Pain'' and ''Nobody Does it Better.'' There also was ''Jesse,'' in
1980, and ''Let the River Run,'' in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Simon's fear of appearing on stage seems to be receding, and
this summer she will do some singing in public. She says she
enjoyed a recent concert in New Orleans with her children, Sally
and Ben, both of whom are performing and recording. They were born
when she was married to James Taylor. Since 1987, she has been
married to businessman and poet Jim Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Simon says she doesn't have a favorite song on the new album,
though she enjoys moving to the beat of ''Big Dumb Guy'' and likes
''Actress,'' which was inspired by hearing little girls worrying
about bad camera angles after an audition.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could easily put myself in that place -- a little girl
putting on lipstick, imagining I was going to be a movie star one
day. It became my voice. Sometimes songs start with somebody else's
voice and become my voice,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Simon says she's happy now.
</P>
<P>
   ''All kinds of really positive things are happening. I'm
thinking with the release of this record how much I feel as if I've
been rejuvenated,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ''My health seems to be fine now,'' she says. ''I'm thriving and
enjoying life more than I ever have and I'm very happy living on
Martha's Vineyard and just feeling great. I get scared every time I
go to the doctor for a checkup, but I did that before I got cancer,
too.''

<HEADLINE> On Stage: Has Bogosian Gone Soft?  </HEADLINE>
By DOUGLAS J. ROWE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Has Eric Bogosian gone soft?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, he says, but it's more like society has hardened.
</P>
<P>
   In his latest one-man show, ''Wake Up and Smell the Coffee,''
off-Broadway's erstwhile angry young man says, ''I can talk the
talk. I can't walk the walk. ... I toe the line ... Show me the
line -- I get in it. That's the kind of rebel I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics used the words ''midlife crisis,'' ''mellow,'' even
''sweet-natured'' in characterizing his latest production. One
reviewer noted that the ''targets in his 90-minute show are dated
or unworthy'' of his talents. He takes aim at materialism,
terrorist violence (the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing), self-help
gurus, the glorification of stupidity in movies and the seeming
capriciousness of God.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if the cartoon of the snarling, jagged-toothed dog
attacking a cup of coffee on the Playbill cover should be defanged
-- or replaced by the insipid image of someone shooting fish in a
barrel.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm only putting out what's going on with me, and I suppose
that I must be, on some level, mellower,'' Bogosian says, sitting
in his TriBeCa office strewn with books ranging from a Strindberg
anthology to a compendium of monologues put together by his wife,
Jo Bonney, posters from his and other plays, and newspaper clips
about recent Yankee championships.
</P>
<P>
   While rehearsing the play, he pointed out to Bonney, who is also
the play's director: ''You know there isn't one wino, bum, junkie,
sleazebag in the whole show.''
</P>
<P>
   His Obie-winning one-man efforts ''Drinking in America,'' ''Sex,
Drugs &AMP; Rock 'n' Roll'' and ''Pounding Nails in the Floor With My
Forehead,'' as well as other solo productions that date back to the
late 1970s, often were populated by such types. The closest in his
new show, which also has an array of angry characters, is a
narcissistic creep undergoing therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The biggest difference is that times have changed,'' Bogosian
says. ''I realized 10 years ago, when I was watching this TV show
'In Living Color,' and they were doing a sketch about a wino in
front of a supermarket. And I thought, 'Whoa, I was doing stuff
like this 10 years ago. ...' I think the level of irony and
aggression has become just so absorbed in the culture that me
throwing myself around out there doesn't rub people as wrong as it
used to.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never set out to be shocking. I just set out to make stuff
that I like,'' he says. ''Maybe it's mellower. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Outrageousness is such a standard now, he notes, that last
summer's ''South Park'' movie depicted Saddam Hussein and Satan as
lovers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not even in the same ballpark as that,'' Bogosian says.
''This is the age of Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails, and I'm
not going to get into a competition with them about who can be the
most outrageous.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now perhaps putting me out there as a 27-year-old,
semi-junkie, flipped-out, skinny performer was more interesting
than a 47-year-old father of two. ... I don't know. Fellini said,
'You pull your pants down in front of everybody, and if they laugh
at you, it's your tough luck.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bogosian doesn't think his new show represents a midlife crisis,
as one reviewer suggested, but he concedes he's had one recently.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no question in my mind that's what I've been going
through. When basically I said, 'Wow, I guess I'm over some hill,
and now I'm going to go on to the looking-over-the-shoulder part of
my life.' And I said, 'No, I reject that.' ... There are guys out
there who are 80 years old who are rockin' and I'm going to do it
to the end, too,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ''You ask me right now, face to face, am I walking the walk? I
think to a certain degree I do walk the walk. My work is walking
the walk -- doing these shows or whatever I'm trying to test myself
with -- and it's been a hard walk lately.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past four years, he says he's been killing himself over
a play he wrote, ''Griller,'' and he can't seem to get all the
kinks out.
</P>
<P>
   A production of ''Griller'' at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago
received poor reviews. ''Gossip,'' a recent movie in which he plays
a sharp-tongued teacher, was widely panned. And now his latest
off-Broadway show -- his sixth full-length solo and his first in six
years -- is ending after an abbreviated run.
</P>
<P>
   Bogosian sounds daunted but unbowed, though. Far from his
acid-tongued, hypercaffeinated stage persona, he's warm, friendly
and accommodating, joking at one point: ''I have no boundaries,
just resentments.''
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Woburn, Mass., about 12 miles outside Boston, the
son of an accountant.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, he would lock himself in his bedroom and pretend to
be different people. Then when a 10th-grade teacher had the class
perform plays, he took to the stage like a natural.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to study theater at Oberlin College in Ohio. When he
graduated in 1976, he headed to Manhattan, where he was caught up
in the downtown performance art world and the strange mixture of
the city's low and high life. The characters who would later define
his monologues began to take shape.
</P>
<P>
   Bogosian fell in with other underground performers, including
Laurie Anderson and Whoopi Goldberg, and he remembers his early
career frustrations, when people hated his work and gigs got
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   He was performing in various small theaters and clubs in 1982,
when the late Joseph Papp, then director of the New York Public
Theater, was so impressed by his one-man show, ''Men Inside,'' that
he scheduled it.
</P>
<P>
   Then from 1986 to 1994, he enjoyed numerous successes: His
off-Broadway one-man show, ''Drinking in America,'' another series
of urban monologues, won an Obie and was followed by the equally
popular ''Talk Radio,'' which Oliver Stone made into a movie
starring Bogosian. He also had a good run at Lincoln Center for his
play, ''subUrbia,'' which Richard Linklater made into a film in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   But he takes hardest the poor reception for ''Griller.'' It's
been criticized as being structurally flawed and having an
incredible ending. Like ''subUrbia,'' it's another tale of the
American Dream knocked off its rails.
</P>
<P>
   The play is set on the Fourth of July. Gussie, a self-made man,
has turned 50 and four generations of his family gather at a
picnic. All reek of success, and yet failure abounds. One son is a
junkie; the other is a driven, egotistical impotent stockbroker,
whose marriage is failing and whose wife has a fling with his
brother before the picnic ends. Meanwhile, Gussie's mother is dying
of cancer. The play ends with Gussie killing his father's alcoholic
friend, and pretending that it was an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Bogosian says the negative reception for his play made him want
''to just wrap myself up in wool and say, 'I don't want to play
anymore. I have all my old toys. I like them. They were really
good. And now what I'll do: I'll get real comfy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he sees himself as ''bopping along in the tradition of
American humor that includes Mark Twain and Lenny Bruce,'' which,
he says, is a lot better than the ''endless revivals'' on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's so easy to congratulate ourselves putting up these
revivals,'' he says. ''Where's now? Now? I want to know about
now!''

<HEADLINE> Tom Lehrer Is Back for Encore  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN ROGERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- He's been called the J.D. Salinger of song,
someone who once stood on the precipice of big-time musical fame,
only to walk away.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, as Tom Lehrer gets on the phone to discuss what he
insists will absolutely be the last recordings he'll ever release
(a retrospective boxed set), he sounds positively joyful that he
never allowed himself to become a household word.
</P>
<P>
   ''No, no, I don't do television,'' Lehrer says he told an ABC
News producer who had called the reclusive musician at his
Cambridge, Mass., home just the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to change his mind, she chided him, asking when exactly
was the last time he had appeared on television.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said 1965,'' he recalls matter-of-factly.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just too nerve-racking,'' he complains of such exposure.
''For one thing, the invasion of privacy is not commensurate with
the rewards. Secondly, they'll probably want me to sing a song. And
I don't want to convey the idea that I'll ever do that again.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehrer emerged as a brilliant song satirist in the early 1950s
from the coffeehouses and clubs around Cambridge, where he had
arrived 10 years earlier as a precocious 15-year-old Harvard
freshman.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in Manhattan, the son of a successful necktie
designer, and recalls an idyllic childhood of Broadway shows, which
served as his musical inspiration, and strolls through Central Park
at any time of the day or night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh yeah, New York was wonderful. I loved it then,'' he
recalls.
</P>
<P>
   At Harvard, he was a boy wonder, earning a degree in mathematics
at age 18, then a master's -- and he began to write silly songs to
amuse his friends.
</P>
<P>
   The expertly crafted, scathingly sarcastic tunes sounded as if
they had been lifted directly from the Broadway stage. They poked
fun at the major issues of the day: sex, politics, racism,
religion, pollution, political assassinations.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying himself on piano and singing in a nasal voice he
once described as ''the greatest baritone to grace the American
stage since that of Millard Fillmore,'' Lehrer would sometimes
weave tales of a 1950s Norman Rockwell America gone astray:
</P>
<P>
   ''I remember Dan, the druggist on the corner. He was never mean
or ornery. He was swell. He killed his mother-in-law and ground her
up real well. And sprinkled just a bit, over each banana split. In
my hometown.''
</P>
<P>
   Or he could be just plain silly. As when he exhorted the Roman
Catholic Church, then trying to broaden its appeal by taking Latin
out of the Mass, to ''really sell the product,'' with a catchy
little ditty for the choir called ''The Vatican Rag:''
</P>
<P>
   ''Get down on your knees, fiddle with your rosaries. Bow your
heads with great respect, and genuflect, genuflect, genuflect.''
</P>
<P>
   But by the mid-1960s, Lehrer was gone.
</P>
<P>
   He began teaching math at MIT, leaving behind a legion of fans
who never forgot him.
</P>
<P>
   He says now that he was never comfortable appearing in public,
never understood ''the cult of the performer.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I enjoyed it up to a point,'' he says. ''But to me, going out
and performing the concert every night when it was all available on
record would be like a novelist going out and reading his novel
every night.''
</P>
<P>
   And he was never really obsessed with writing songs either.
Indeed, he only recorded about three dozen.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I got a funny idea for a song,'' he says now, ''I wrote
it. And if I didn't, I didn't. ... I wasn't like a real writer.''
</P>
<P>
   So why was he so good?
</P>
<P>
   ''The guy is just a marvelous wordsmith and a pretty good
tunesmith, too,'' says musicologist Barry Hansen, who helped
produce the new three-CD boxed set, ''The Remains of Tom Lehrer.''
</P>
<P>
   ''And let's face it,'' quips Hansen, aka radio personality Dr.
Demento, ''a song like 'Poisoning Pigeons in the Park' never really
goes out of style.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehrer, 72 now and semi-retired, knows that firsthand. He still
meets college students who discovered him in high school when some
social studies teacher -- ''trying desperately to be a pal,'' he
suspects -- played a song like ''National Brotherhood Week'':
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh, the Protestants hate the Catholics. And the Catholics hate
the Protestants. And the Hindus hate the Muslims. And everybody
hates the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ''But during National Brotherhood Week ... It's National
Everyone-Smile-At-One-Another-Hood Week. ... It's only for a week
so have no fear. Be grateful that it doesn't last all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes students will seek him out at the University of
California, Santa Cruz -- where he teaches math one quarter a year
now, mainly to escape the New England winters -- and they expect him
to be funny.
</P>
<P>
   ''But it's a real math class,'' he says. ''I don't do any funny
theorems. So those people go away pretty quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   A friendly, self-effacing man, Lehrer dismisses sheepishly the
idea that what he did musically was genius.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, he will acknowledge pride in the fact that one of his
albums, ''An Evening Wasted With Tom Lehrer,'' was nominated for a
Grammy in 1960. But he'll also tell you that while it didn't win,
he's prouder still that at least it didn't lose to Alvin and the
Chipmunks, who were also nominated that year.
</P>
<P>
   ''That would have been too ignominious,'' he says.
</P>

<HEADLINE> At Last, Herman Wouk Speaks  </HEADLINE>
By HILLEL ITALIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) -- At the gate of Herman Wouk's house
you'll see a sign that warns of guard dogs. It might well read
''MEDIA BEWARE.'' For the author of ''The Caine Mutiny,'' ''The
Winds of War'' and other million sellers rarely bothers with the
press, a luxury of writing books that speak so well for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But a generation has passed since his last blockbuster, ''War
and Remembrance.'' It's unlikely young readers of Stephen King or
John Grisham know his name, or know much about his books. His
recent fiction spent relatively little time on bestseller lists and
a few of his novels are out of print.
</P>
<P>
   Wouk has never operated like a ''commercial'' author; his works
follow no proven formula. But his current publication, ''The Will
to Live On,'' would be a hard sell for any writer. Neither fiction
nor memoir, it's a text about preserving Judaism that resides
quietly in religion sections of bookstores around the country.
</P>
<P>
   So Wouk, concerned the book itself won't be preserved, has
invited a reporter inside his home.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to take time to get out there and it may never get
out there,'' he says. '''The Will to Live On' is about the survival
of the Jewish people, and how to harness that power for the
centuries to come. It's not something to pick up at an airport.''
</P>
<P>
   The setting here makes it hard to worry about anything. Wouk's
home is the very picture of Paradise: palm trees and watered lawns;
swimming pool and tennis court; a spacious, ranch-style house with
hand-carved doors and floors of Mexican tile.
</P>
<P>
   It's a typically dry desert day, a beautiful day, the heat
tempered by a near invisible coating of clouds. Wouk writes
whenever possible, but right now he cuts a nice figure as a man of
leisure: khakis and soft white hat, a can of Dr. Pepper in hand,
his legs stretched across the verandah that hangs in the shade to
the side of his house.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no complaints,'' comments the author, speaking a few
days before his 85th birthday. He lives well and knows it. He has
prosperity, long-term companionship (his wife of 55 years, Sarah,
who also serves as his agent), many friends and the blessing of
good health.
</P>
<P>
   Wouk doesn't look his age, or even close. He stands straight and
trim and walks with just the slightest hitch. His face is rugged,
yet thoughtful, warmed but not burned by the desert sun. And he can
converse for hours, his expressions ranging from unblinking
concentration to -- reminders of his days as a gag man for Fred
Allen -- a boyish smirk.
</P>
<P>
   He may no longer be famous among general readers, but he's a
giant in the Jewish community. His friends and acquaintances
include Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Sen. Joseph Lieberman. He's given many speeches on Jewish
issues and has received several prizes, including a lifetime
achievement award from the Jewish Book Council. He attends
synagogue both in Palm Springs (where he occasionally gives
sermons) and in Washington, D.C., where he first lived in the 1960s
and still maintains a home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a bit in awe when I first met him,'' says Lieberman, a
Connecticut Democrat. ''When I first came to Washington and settled
in Georgetown and began to go to the synagogue there it was
described by more than one person as 'Herman Wouk's Synagogue.'''
</P>
<P>
   ''He doesn't think success should change your values. He doesn't
make any compromises when it comes to religion,'' says another
Washington friend, Daniel Schorr, senior news analyst for National
Public Radio and a somewhat less religious man.
</P>
<P>
   ''I remember when he went to my son's Bar Mitzvah. It was on a
Saturday (the Jewish Sabbath). He would not drive there. He walked,
about 8-9 miles. And after the service broke up he started to
leave. I said, 'Aren't you going to stay for lunch? It's kosher.'
And he said, 'Yes, but not kosher enough.'''
</P>
<P>
   Wouk appears an odd fit both in Palm Springs -- better known for
golf than for synagogues -- and in the literary world. From Ernest
Hemingway to James Joyce, major authors of the 20th century were
considered either anti-religious or at least highly skeptical. But
Wouk is part of a smaller group that includes C.S. Lewis, Graham
Greene and Flannery O'Connor, those who openly maintained a
traditional faith.
</P>
<P>
   Wouk is an Orthodox Jew whose books virtually all include some
kind of religious theme. ''Marjorie Morningstar,'' published in
1955, was one of the first bestselling novels about Jewish life;
two recent novels, ''The Hope'' and ''The Glory,'' are set in
Israel. He's also written two nonfiction books about religion,
''The Will to Live On'' and ''This Is My God,'' a widely read
publication released 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   '''This Is My God' was a much revered text in my home growing
up,'' Lieberman says. ''It was a work of someone who was proud to
be Jewish, and was using his gift of communication to explain why
it had such meaning. I was growing up an observant Jew in
Connecticut and it was encouraging to me that a man who had
achieved such success also held on to his faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond his religious views, Wouk has an uncertain status as a
writer. Although some of his manuscripts are now stored with the
Library of Congress, few critics see him as a canonical figure.
Like his old friend, the late James Michener, he's been placed
above writers like Michael Crichton but below literary figures such
as Saul Bellow and Philip Roth. Wouk is a deeply read author of
serious subjects who has rarely received serious acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a writer, he doesn't seem to me very gifted, although I
wouldn't say he's inept,'' says the award-winning critic Leslie
Fiedler, author of ''Love &AMP; Death in the American Novel'' and many
other books. ''He reflects the milieu he came from, radio comedy.
He has that certain level of skill, but he can't get to that next
level.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he's taken as dignified, important, but not
avant-garde enough, not cutting edge enough,'' adds Ruth Wisse, a
professor of Yiddish and comparative literature at Harvard
University.
</P>
<P>
   Wouk himself has presented modest assessments of his craft. Back
in the 1950s he told one reporter he was not a ''high stylist.'' In
''War and Remembrance,'' a writer notes in his journal: ''I could
contribute nothing new; but writing as I do with a light hand, I
might charm a few readers into pausing, in their heedless hurry
after pleasure and money, for a look at the things that matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Few authors have so well met their own standards, and so enjoyed
themselves along the way. Wouk has had a classic 20th-century life,
from childhood among immigrants in New York City to his years at
sea during World War II to this resort for celebrities where he now
spends much of his time.
</P>
<P>
   The son of Russian Jews, he was born in New York in 1915. The
household was religious -- his mother was a rabbi's daughter -- and
also devoted to books. His father read to him from the works of
Sholem Aleichem, the great Yiddish writer. The works of Mark Twain
entered his life thanks to a traveling book salesman who sold them
to his mother.
</P>
<P>
   A lifetime later, Twain remains his favorite writer, despite
Twain's irreverence when it comes to matters of faith.
</P>
<P>
   ''I found it all very stimulating,'' Wouk says. ''His work is
impregnated with references to the Bible. He may be scathing about
it, but they're there. He's making jokes about religion, but the
Jews are always making jokes about it.''
</P>
<P>
   A star student in high school, Wouk majored in comparative
literature and philosophy at Columbia University and edited the
college's humor magazine. After graduation, Wouk followed the path
of so many bright, clever New Yorkers in the 1930s: He headed to
California, where he worked five years on Allen's radio show.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fred was very individualistic. It was his style -- a
hard-bitten, New England satirical buzz-saw kind of wit,'' says
Wouk, who recalled a piece he wrote for Allen.
</P>
<P>
   ''It happens in the zoo and Fred's a new guy coming to work with
the animals. A zoo manager takes him over to the hippopotamus and
says, 'This hippopotamus has a problem. There's something in the
back of his mouth and you need to reach your arm in and get it
out.'
</P>
<P>
   ''And Fred says, 'I'm not going to put my arm in the back of his
mouth. The keeper says, 'You don't have to worry about that. He's a
vegetarian.' Fred says, 'Well, he can taste it and spit it out,
can't he?'''
</P>
<P>
   If not for the war Wouk might have stuck to comedy sketches.
After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, he enlisted in the Navy and
served as an officer in the Pacific. There, he received a writer's
most precious gift -- free time. He read and read, from the Bible to
Victorian fiction, and wrote what became his first published novel,
the radio satire ''Aurora Dawn.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just having fun. It had never occurred to me write a
novel,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   By the time ''Aurora Dawn'' came out, in 1947, Wouk was married
and living in New York. He was also studying the Talmud, and would
soon release the novel ''City Boy,'' a coming-of-age story highly
influenced by Twain.
</P>
<P>
   Next, he wrote about the Navy. In 1951, Wouk published the novel
for which he's most remembered: ''The Caine Mutiny.'' The now
classic story of the unstable Captain Queeg and his unhappy crew
sold slowly at first but eventually topped bestseller lists and won
the Pulitzer Prize. It was made into a movie starring Humphrey
Bogart and has been performed as a play everywhere from China to
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''I first read 'The Caine Mutiny' when I was in high school. I
was on the subway in Manhattan and I was so caught up in it I found
myself in Brooklyn,'' says author Robert Caro, whose books include
''The Power Broker,'' his acclaimed biography of Robert Moses.
''Nearly 50 years later, the book remains fresh in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   For a time, Wouk was compared to other World War II novelists:
Norman Mailer, Irwin Shaw, James Jones. But his next book looked
into more domestic matters -- a young Jewish girl who dreams of
acting and ends up in the suburbs. Her real name was Marjorie
Morgenstern. Her stage name provides the novel's title, ''Marjorie
Morningstar.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My agent was absolutely appalled,'' Wouk recalls. ''He
submitted it to the editor of a women's magazine and the editor
said, 'Herman Wouk has destroyed himself. He's a man who writes
big, sweeping dramas about men in action. Then he writes about this
girl and nothing happens. He should burn this book and forget
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   But like ''The Caine Mutiny,'' the novel sold millions and was
made into a movie, starring Natalie Wood. Wouk was famous enough to
appear on the cover of Time magazine, even as some Jews complained
his book perpetuated stereotypes, and critics like Fiedler
complained he was too old-fashioned.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wouk and Bellow came at the moment when Jewish-American
literature was moving from the periphery to the center, but
appealing to two completely different audiences,'' Fiedler says.
''Bellow, like most writers critics take seriously, attacked the
basic values of middle-class Americans: easy piety, marriage, life
in the suburbs. Wouk challenges nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Wouk has responded two ways: He doesn't judge
the characters in his stories, but tries to tell the truth; and
whether he really ''challenges nothing'' depends on what you think
needs challenging. (Bellow, meanwhile, is an admirer of Wouk.)
</P>
<P>
   Wouk believes that among writers, anti-conformity is a kind of
conformity. ''It seems curious,'' he wrote in ''Aurora Dawn,''
''that life 'as it really is,' according to modern inspiration,
contains a surprising amount of 'fornication, violence, vulgarity,
unpleasant individuals, blasphemy, hatred, and ladies'
underclothes.'''
</P>
<P>
   He knows others don't share his views and he doesn't necessarily
expect them to change. For example, both ''This Is My God'' and
''The Will to Live On'' take a similar approach to ''Mere
Christianity'' and other works by C.S. Lewis. They preach not to
the converted, but to the curious. They anticipate arguments about
religion and try their best to answer them.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no use in talking about religion with anybody who is
sure that God does not exist,'' Wouk wrote in the introduction to
''This Is My God.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My book will irritate such a person and give him no light. ...
But I suggest that agnosticism, when it becomes an ear-stopping
dogma, may be as bad a mental handicap as superstition.''
</P>
<P>
   Wouk challenges himself above all. He recalls when he began work
on ''The Winds of War,'' his epic World War II novel. It was the
1960s, he was living in Washington and adjusting to middle age and
had never written historical fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ''It had always been there -- first of all as a dream -- this book
about the whole war. Ibsen said somewhere that sooner or later
every man comes against his 'life lie,' that he thinks he's going
to do a certain thing and then he realizes that he's never going to
do it,'' Wouk says.
</P>
<P>
   ''And when I was getting toward my 50s I thought, 'This is your
life lie, this book about World War II.' And I had no confidence I
could do it, but I thought, 'OK, if you've got a story to tell you
go and tell it.''
</P>
<P>
   His ambition these days is still greater. As stated in ''The
Will to Live On,'' Wouk is exploring how the Jewish people can
continue. He worries about assimilation, the Melting Pot. ''Dying
is a terror, an agony, a strangling finish,'' he writes in his
current book. ''Melting is a mere diffusion.''
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing Jewish history, Wouk concludes the answer is
education: scripture, history, culture. Even today, he participates
in the process. This interview began midmorning, after his daily
reading of the Talmud. It will end midafternoon, so he can prepare
to lead a Talmud class that night.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only break I've had in my study was when I was at sea,
because I couldn't bring a Talmud,'' Wouk said. ''But I went
through the Hebrew Bible completely and every day I would put on
tefillin (small black boxes containing biblical passages that are
tied around the arms and above the forehead). It was taken for
granted by everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once the ship was wrecked in a typhoon in 1945, off Okinawa.
There were 125 ships driven on to the beach, and with some loss of
life. We were hung on a reef all night, but had no loss of life.
</P>
<P>
   ''And I noticed among the crew a new sort of respect and
affection. I was the executive officer, always Mr. Bad Guy. But
here were the sailors, saying, 'Hello, Mr. Wouk,' 'Good morning,
Mr. Wouk.' I asked someone what this was all about and he said the
guys were convinced they were saved by Lt. Wouk's black boxes.''

<HEADLINE> French Film Shows Algerian Violence  </HEADLINE>
By MARILYN AUGUST
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Flash back: French refugees hug their last few
possessions as the ship carrying them to safety pulls slowly out to
sea. The scene is Algeria 1962, when the North African nation
lurched violently toward independence from France.
</P>
<P>
   Flash forward: Black-veiled Muslim women march for peace as
nightly massacres terrorize the population. The scene is Algeria
1994, when the Islamic insurgency against the military-backed
government reached new heights of violence.
</P>
<P>
   These images evoking the torment of modern Algeria are brought
to the screen by French director Alexandre Arcady, 51, a pied-noir,
or French colonial, who fled with his family in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   A box-office hit since it opened in France last month, ''La-bas,
Mon Pays'' (Over There, My Homeland) is the first foreign film to
be shot on location in Algeria in 16 years. It earned high marks
from the press in Algeria after its world premiere there.
</P>
<P>
   ''The film crews stopped traffic. We prepared sets. This wasn't
like making a documentary or filming for the nightly news,'' said
Arcady, who received permission to film from President Abdelaziz
Bouteflika.
</P>
<P>
   Colonial Algeria and the 1.2 million pieds-noirs who fled for
their lives during the 1962 war of independence, including 120,000
Jews like Arcady, have fueled the director's imagination throughout
his career.
</P>
<P>
   ''Le Coup de Sirocco'' and ''Le Grand Carnaval'' are nostalgic
takes on the comfortable life of the French during 130 years of
colonial rule. The blockbuster ''Le Grand Pardon'' (The Day of
Atonement) portrays North African Jewish and Arab mobs fighting for
turf in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   None of those films was shot in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was incredible to be behind the camera in the streets where
I played as a kid, in the house where I was born, in the cemetery
where my grandmother is buried,'' Arcady said. ''But the Algeria of
my childhood no longer exists.''
</P>
<P>
   Arcady says the film's very existence sends a signal that
Algeria may be ready to renew artistic ties with the West. Before
independence, Algiers boasted 400 movie theaters, mostly
French-owned. Today, there are only 10 in the whole country, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a sign of a new openness and a desire for
change,'' he said at a post-screening debate in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Algeria has been isolated since 1992, when violence erupted
after the army canceled legislative elections that a Muslim
fundamentalist party was poised to win. At least 100,000 people
have died.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Bouteflika, who was elected on a peace platform six
months earlier, invited popular pied-noir singer Enrico Macias,
whose songs evoke passion and longing for Algeria, to perform in
his native Constantine.
</P>
<P>
   In exile since the massacre of family members during the
independence war, the Jewish Macias accepted. The tour was
canceled, however, when Algerian officials bowed to pressure from
18 Muslim clerics who attacked the visit as an attempt to establish
diplomatic ties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Loosely adapted from a novel by Rene Bonnell, ''La-bas, Mon
Pays'' is the tale of a TV anchorman called back to his native
Algeria to rescue the daughter of his first love, Leila, whose
father was an Arab postal worker and a neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before independence, Christians, Jews and Arabs lived in the
same building, with their front doors always open, sharing each
other's joys and sorrows,'' Arcady said.
</P>
<P>
   That harmony ended when violence broke out and segregation
became the norm.
</P>
<P>
   ''A European walking in an Arab neighborhood or vice versa was
risking his life,'' said Lazare Bouaziz, 66, a retired dentist,
whose family fled the port city of Oran on the eve of the July 1962
massacres.
</P>
<P>
   The film has been popular among pied-noirs who lived through the
period.
</P>
<P>
   ''Arcady could have made a sugar-coated version of our
experience,'' Bouaziz said. ''But instead, he showed the violence
of our exodus -- raw and unembellished.''

<P>
   ''Beyond the Pale'' (Valley Entertainment) -- Bruce Henderson
</P>
<P>
   The stories are the stars on ''Beyond the Pale,'' 10 tales of
desperation and desolation in America's heartland.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Henderson makes no direct reference to his recent battle
with cancer, but he sings of the loneliness and bitterness that can
result from bad luck and bad choices. Henderson is a transplanted
Oklahoman now living in New York City, and his perspective on
small-town small-timers is anything but romantic.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody ever said life was easy/nobody ever said life wasn't
tough,'' he sings on ''Flatlands.'' ''Nobody ever said very much at
all/in the place where I come from.''
</P>
<P>
   As a follow-up to Henderson's acclaimed solo debut, ''The Wheels
Roll,'' ''Beyond the Pale'' offers further proof that he knows how
to write a compelling narrative tale. ''August,'' for example, is
the story of a third-rate romance told in dialogue. Henderson
generally steers clear of cliches, instead building his tunes
around engaging turns of phrase (''This life ain't like an arrow;
you don't wind up where you aim'').
</P>
<P>
   Musically, guitarist Henderson finds room in his arrangements
for a lap steel, accordion, organ, fiddle and mandolin. ''Beyond
The Pale'' will fit in the alt-country section of your collection,
but it's similar to what John Mellencamp and others were doing 15
years ago -- four-square tunes expertly played with few frills but
plenty of passion. And the songs are special.

   ''The Final Concert'' (The Right Stuff) -- Marvin Gaye
</P>
<P>
   First of all, the title of ''The Final Concert'' is misleading.
The 65-minute recording documents a 1983 show by Marvin Gaye in
Indianapolis during his final tour, which ended in Los Angeles. And
be forewarned that the sound is bootleg quality, probably the
reason the performance hasn't been released until now.
</P>
<P>
   Those quibbles aside, the show took place less than a year
before Gaye was shot to death by his father, and ''The Final
Concert'' captures the star in all his glorious contradictions. He
is by turns sexual, spiritual, sensual and topical, tapping a
remarkable range of emotions with one of his generation's greatest
voices.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gaye was plagued by paranoia and insecure about his
talent, he seems relaxed and upbeat during this show. And he's
backed by a terrific 18-piece band, which includes Wah Wah Watson
on guitar and Sheila E on percussion.
</P>
<P>
   The hits are here, including ''I Heard It Through The
Grapevine,'' ''Let's Get It On'' and ''What's Going On.'' But some
of the best performances are on lesser-known material such as
''Third World Girl'' and ''Joy.'' Before the latter tune, Gaye
speaks fondly of his father in a dedication that is heartbreaking,
given what happened later.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Final Concert'' makes us miss Gaye all over again.

   ''The Dumbest Magnets'' (Evil Teen) -- Dolly Varden
</P>
<P>
   ''The Dumbest Magnets'' blurs the lines between alt-country and
pop the way the Jayhawks do on ''Smile,'' only Dolly Varden does it
better. It's yet another music business mystery that a band this
good could remain so unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The lovely harmonies of the husband-and-wife duo who lead this
Chicago band, their thoughtful lyrics, soaring melodies and killer
hooks make ''The Dumbest Magnets'' giddily addictive, and as good
as any album I've heard this year.

<P>
   ''Dancin' With Them That Brung Me'' (Gearle Records) -- Stacey
Earle
</P>
<P>
   Stacey Earle opts for a richer, fuller sound on ''Dancin' With
Them That Brung Me'' without losing any of the homespun charm that
made her debut so wonderful. Earle has a thin but affecting voice
and a simple, country-folk style that recalls early Nanci Griffith.
Highlights here include her cover of brother Steve's ''Promise You
Anything'' and her own ''Did I Say I'm Sorry.'' Highly recommended.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ''Love God Murder'' (Columbia) -- Johnny Cash
</P>
<P>
   ''Love God Murder'' is a thematic, rather than chronological,
look at the career of a great American songwriter. Included with
each of the three discs in this box set (each is also available
separately) is a short essay on the theme: June Carter Cash writes
about love, U2's Bono tackles God and Quentin Tarantino takes on
murder.
</P>
<P>
   The essays are somewhat interesting, but that wouldn't matter if
these weren't great songs. Rather than being monotonous, the strict
adherence to each theme makes for something of a revelation,
providing depth and power as Cash examines love, religion and
violence in their many forms. ''Love God Murder'' is essential
listening.

<P>
   ''Republica Dominica'' (Putumayo) -- Various artists
</P>
<P>
   Putumayo's world music collections are uniformly excellent, and
almost always include two or three knock-your-socks-off songs.
''Republica Dominica'' is no exception. It's an enjoyable musical
journey to a country that is often overlooked on the world music
scene. It focuses on the guitar-driven style known as bachata,
highlighting several simmeringly funky tunes with slinky guitar
playing. And if the first two cuts don't knock your socks off,
you're already barefoot.

   He swapped his given name of Prince Rogers Nelson for an
unpronounceable symbol during a protracted contract battle with his
former record label. That led others to dub him ''The Artist
Formerly Known as Prince,'' or ''The Artist,'' for short. Now that
his contract has expired, Prince has reclaimed his name. To
celebrate, he has scheduled a June 13 concert in his hometown of
Minneapolis. Prince says he will continue his fight against what he
perceives as major label domination of the nation's music scene.
Prince, who was born on June 7, 1958, has promised not to ''give up
the store to Forrest Gump accounting firms who think a royalty
check is like a box of chocolates.''

   This year's season finale of ''Spin City'' marked the final
appearance of Michael J. Fox on the ABC sitcom. Fox left his
starring role to concentrate on fighting Parkinson's disease, a
progressive neurological disorder. He has launched the Michael J.
Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, and says he expects a cure
for the disease by the time he is 50. Fox, who was born on June 9,
1961, was one of the stars of the '80s sitcom ''Family Ties'' and
the ''Back to the Future'' series of films. Fox has insisted that
he isn't giving up show business. But as he told Diane Sawyer on
''20/20'' recently, ''As a performer, I want people to see what I'm
performing, not the dexterity and gymnastics it was taking for me
to perform it.''

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Rick Bayless  </HEADLINE>
By SAMANTHA CRITCHELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Rick Bayless can identify the defining moment of
his life. He was 14. While on a family vacation in Mexico, the
Oklahoma native fell deeply in love with the country and the
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Bayless, now 46, planned a career as a Spanish teacher, but had
strong ties to food. His parents owned a barbecue restaurant in
Oklahoma City, and ''we were always hanging out in the kitchen.''
He also taught cooking classes to support himself while he was
getting his doctorate in Latin American anthropological
linguistics.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, Bayless landed the perfect job: He was hired
as a consultant by a small chain of Mexican-American restaurants in
Los Angeles. He spent months at a time exploring different regions
of Mexico -- at someone else's expense.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like to do it again, but life's not like that,'' said
Bayless, chef and owner of the Frontera Grill and Topolobampo
restaurants in Chicago, during a recent interview at a Manhattan
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now I have a 9-year-old daughter and I'd have to get back from
trips like that to see her dance performances,'' he said. ''But
that doesn't mean I don't get those fixes. We go back to Mexico for
shorter trips several times a year.''
</P>
<P>
   His new TV cooking show ''Mexico One Plate at a Time,'' now
airing on public television, is part culinary tutorial, part
travelogue. A companion cookbook with 110 recipes will be released
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most TV cooking tutorials that tape three shows a day in
studio kitchens with high-tech equipment, Bayless uses a single
camera that follows him as he visits marketplaces and restaurants
all over Mexico. It takes three days to film the Mexican segment
for each show, then they shift to Bayless' Chicago home for the
actual cooking.
</P>
<P>
   One benefit of filming in his own home is his wonderful kitchen.
''I have to pinch myself with this kitchen. It's a cook's dream,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   1. This isn't your first TV show, you had one in the late 1970s.
What is different about doing a cooking show now?
</P>
<P>
   Bayless: I did my first show 21 years ago on a nonexistent
budget. I got paid $100 a show, plus I had a $500 research grant.
It was back in the days where the only thing on TV that was cooking
was still only Julia (Child), and she was in her golden era. ... My
series was 26 shows then, and it was all studio and me cooking my
heart out. Nowadays, people are looking for cooking shows to appeal
to a much broader audience.
</P>
<P>
   2. While many of the show's episodes feature tacos, quesadillas
and other foods that sound familiar to U.S. audiences, will viewers
be surprised to see the final products?
</P>
<P>
   Bayless: First of all, tacos have soft shells. American tacos
are no more like Mexican tacos than a ham sandwich. ... When I'm
walking through a Mexican market and I pull out one of those hard
U-shaped shells, it's totally out of place there. Hopefully, I will
teach people to make something infinitely more mouthwatering.
</P>
<P>
   3. What are some other differences between American-Mexican food
and Mexican food?
</P>
<P>
   Bayless: They've started opening Taco Bells in Mexico now and
people consider it American food, which is very ironic. A friend of
mine in a Mexican city said to me, 'You've got to taste this dish,
this American dish. We've got it all over the place in Mexico now.
It's nachos.'
</P>
<P>
   4. Has the Latin craze brought on by pop stars made TV audiences
and restaurant customers more receptive to your food?
</P>
<P>
   Bayless: I think it has, and the growing Latino population in
the United States has made the availability of ingredients much
greater. They are leaking out into ... regular grocery stores.
Twenty years ago, I would talk about jicama and how you'd have to
find yam bean in a Cantonese market. Cilantro we used to call fresh
coriander. It's in any grocery store now.
</P>
<P>
   5. Is there anywhere else in the world that has captured your
attention like Mexico did when you were young?
</P>
<P>
   Bayless: My heart can't be two places at once. But a few years
ago, my wife and I went to Thailand, and Thailand is like the
Mexico of Asia. If I was 14 and I took that family vacation to
Thailand, I bet you that's where I'd be.

<HEADLINE> Nashville Sound: Lee Ann Womack  </HEADLINE>
By JIM PATTERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Lee Ann Womack has struck a chord with
listeners and the country music industry with her Top 10 hit ''I
Hope You Dance.''
</P>
<P>
   The innovative arrangement of a song that urges listeners to
seize the day signals an artistic turn for Nashville, which has
been in a three-year sales slump.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens/Promise me that
you'll give faith a fighting chance/And when you get the choice to
sit it out or dance/ I hope you dance,'' Womack sings to the
backdrop of a swirling string section arranged by David Campbell,
father of pop star Beck.
</P>
<P>
   The song is one of several this year that have broken out of
country's sound-alike pop mold. Veterans Kathy Mattea, George
Strait and Alan Jackson and newcomers Clay Davidson and Eric
Heatherly have also released progressive singles or albums that set
them apart from the pack.
</P>
<P>
   Womack sang backup on Strait and Jackson's ''Murder on Music
Row,'' which criticizes Nashville's lack of support for traditional
country music.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old singer from Jacksonville, Texas, said it's not
important whether one agrees with that point of view, but it helps
stir interest in the genre as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what makes it great -- the passion,'' Womack said.
''When we get to the point where we're afraid we're going to tick
somebody off or something, then we lose some of the really cool
things, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   Womack said her new hit marks a turning point in her career. ''I
think it's going to be the biggest song that I've had yet.
</P>
<P>
   ''As an artist, I'm looking way down the road, and I'm hoping
that I have lots of 'I Hope You Dances' and they get bigger and
bigger,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There is a pop sensibility to the ''I Hope You Dance'' single.
But elsewhere on the same-title CD (MCA Nashville), there is a
touch of Alison Krauss-inspired bluegrass (''The Healing Kind'')
and hard country songs skimmed from the cream of mainstream
Nashville songwriters Rodney Crowell, Bobbie Cryner and Dean
Dillon. The album ends with the old Don Williams hit ''Lord I Hope
This Day Is Good.''
</P>
<P>
   Most encouraging is her inclusion of songs written by Bruce
Robison and Buddy and Julie Miller, stalwarts of Nashville's
so-called alternative country scene.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's such an untapped pool,'' she said. ''People in town are
listening to them, but they're not (recording) them. And I don't
know why.''
</P>
<P>
   Womack, the daughter of a disc jockey, attended Belmont
University in Nashville. She worked as a college intern at MCA
Records years before being signed to a recording contract there.
</P>
<P>
   Her first album ''Lee Ann Womack'' was released in 1997. It was
noted for its hard country sound when country was going through a
pop phase. The ''Some Things I Know'' CD followed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''I Hope You Dance'' includes three songs produced by Frank
Liddell, her second husband. They are the parents of a 16-month-old
daughter. Womack has a 9-year-old daughter from her marriage to
country singer Jason Sellers.
</P>
<P>
   ''My first job that's primarily on my mind is as a mother,'' she
said. ''When I heard the lyrics to 'I Hope You Dance,' I realized
that those are the things that I want my children to know, that
every mother wants their children to know.''

<HEADLINE> Puff Daddy Adds Fashion Line  </HEADLINE>
By FRANCINE PARNES
For The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- This may come as a surprise to his music fans,
but Sean ''Puffy'' Combs is a contender for a top honor in the
fashion industry. That's right, fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Combs, better known as music mogul Puff Daddy, is one of three
new menswear designers nominated for an American Fashion Award. The
winner will be announced June 15 by the Council of Fashion
Designers of America at a gala at Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   As a representative of hip-hop culture, Combs has set a tone for
fashion that made it a natural for him to move into the garment
industry. He is chairman and CEO of the line called Sean John,
after his first and middle names. The collection is targeted for
males 12 to 40 and is designed by a professional staff. In its
first year, the line, including jeans, shirts and T-shirts, had
sales exceeding $32 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''Men's fashion was boring, to be honest,'' Combs said. ''And it
still is. I just felt it was unfair for us to not have fun like
women get to have. They get to be fabulous and have some style and
have an outfit they can put on and feel good about. We're gradually
taking men into the zone of being able to feel beautiful, but still
be able to be a strong man about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Combs knows a thing or two about fashion. His white suit, a
signature style, is practically transporting. ''The white stuff, to
be honest, is like a personal, spiritual thing. White is a color I
dream about all the time. I feel safe in white because deep down
inside, I'm an angel,'' he said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   His first-ever show last February attracted a star-studded
audience of rappers Lil' Kim and Missy Elliot, R&AMP;B legend Luther
Vandross, New York Yankee Derek Jeter, New York Knick Patrick Ewing
and comedian Sandra Bernhard.
</P>
<P>
   More typically, Combs is recognized as the Grammy-winning CEO of
Bad Boy Entertainment, plus a rap star. He is also owner of trendy
Justin's restaurants in New York and Atlanta, named for one of his
two sons.
</P>
<P>
   He's philanthropic, too, having founded Daddy's House Social
Programs in New York City for homeless and foster children. His
record company has a charity division run by sister Keisha.
</P>
<P>
   If that's not enough multitasking, Combs plays the leader of a
New York crime syndicate in the upcoming film ''Made,'' which is
scheduled for release next year.
</P>
<P>
   The mogul with a ''Bad-Boy''-tattooed biceps, a penchant for
Versace and a platinum-and-diamond cross necklace knows how to
combine the brains of a music exec with the style of a rock star.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never like to be pinpointed with my style,'' Combs said.
''The complexity of my personality is a reflection of my style.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to clothes, ''I've got a wide range of flavors
that I like,'' he said. What's appealing about fashion, according
to Combs, ''is that you're supposed to experiment. It's like your
supply of color and you're a painter. You're supposed to have fun
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   For his New York Fashion Week preview in February, Combs, 30,
showed bare-chested male models dripping in $14 million worth of
jewels and smothered in mink.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a big social message going on,'' said CFDA president
Stan Herman after the show. ''When you saw those diamonds, you
didn't want to look at rhinestones anymore. He made it natural to
see guys wearing diamond necklaces and bracelets. It really
worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Harlem, Combs went from intern at Uptown Records in New
York City in 1991 to vice president. He was soon instrumental in
creating the debut albums of Mary J. Blige and Jodeci. In 1993, he
signed with Arista Records to distribute his Bad Boy label,
launching a series of releases that went platinum.
</P>
<P>
   For his fashion line, Combs already has the mandatory celebrity
clientele: Chris Rock and Jerry Seinfeld, rapper Eminem, Donald
Trump and fellow music exec Russell Simmons, who has his own Phat
Farm fashion label.
</P>
<P>
   Combs consulted Simmons, among others, before launching his own
line. ''I basically asked for advice. He told me it wasn't easy for
a black designer to start a line and be treated seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, ''You almost have to be a psychic to predict what's
going to be in fashion in another year,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> William Shatner Is Back  </HEADLINE>
By TED ANTHONY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The guy in the leather jacket is flailing his
arms, swinging his microphone, jabbing his finger, barking in his
bandmates' faces. Then, after several songs, he unleashes his
finale: He grabs a guitar and smashes it. ''Name your own price!''
he shouts with beat-poet bonhomie.
</P>
<P>
   Who is this bizarre bard of the 30-second commercial spot, this
histrionic ham so adeptly straddling the line between self-parody
and self-humiliation?
</P>
<P>
   Might it be? Could it be? It is!
</P>
<P>
   It's William Shatner -- actor, author, starship captain,
Canadian. William Shatner, 69, a celebrity retooled for the Age of
Irony -- disproving again, in typically Shatnerian style, F. Scott
Fitzgerald's warning that there are no second acts in American
life.
</P>
<P>
   Here's Shatner the Pitchman hamming it up as he touts the
name-your-price deals at priceline.com, the Internet broker of
airline tickets and sundry other items. Here's Shatner the Manic
Comic appearing as the Big Giant Head, the alien leader on NBC's
''3rd Rock From the Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's Shatner the Sci-Fi Icon sent up by an arrogant but
good-hearted Tim Allen in the wildly popular ''Star Trek'' satire
''Galaxy Quest.'' And here's Shatner the Novelist churning out
engaging prose in three sci-fi series, including a set of tales
about the resurrection of his alter ego, Capt. James T. Kirk.
</P>
<P>
   Fitting. For like the icon he embodied, the actor has been
resurrected as well. A generation after ''Star Trek'' sealed his
immortality, nearly two decades after ''T.J. Hooker'' threatened to
undo it, William Shatner has become a brand name.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's almost accidental. I'm not sure what caused it,'' Shatner
said on a recent day, taking a moment between rehearsals of the
''3rd Rock From the Sun'' season finale. He sounds sedate, not at
all like the over-the-top extraterrestrial overlord he plays.
</P>
<P>
   ''Something's happened out there,'' he said in a telephone
interview. ''People are perceiving me as funny, and they want funny
things from me.''
</P>
<P>
   He's giving them what they want. Because everyone, it seems, is
hungry for Shatner. Those who love him love it. Those who love to
hate him -- who, on Web sites like The First Church of Shatnerology,
lampoon his reputation for over-the-toppery -- love it even more.
</P>
<P>
   After 1994's ''Star Trek Generations'' killed off Capt. James T.
Kirk, Shatner, by his own account, spun into a funk. ''Rescue
911,'' the emergency drama he hosted, was canceled, as was
''TekWar,'' a short-lived TV series based on one of his book
series.
</P>
<P>
   ''My career and my personal life both fell apart. I needed some
serious cheering up,'' Shatner wrote in ''Get a Life!'' (Simon &AMP;
Schuster Trade), his account of how he finally came to understand
the ''Star Trek'' phenomenon after earning Trekkies' enmity by
heckling fans on NBC's ''Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in early 1998, Priceline came calling.
</P>
<P>
   The operators of the Internet site, where customers make offers
for goods, decided to hire a recognizable voice for radio ads. Two
names came to mind: Bill Cosby and Shatner. They chose the latter
and went to his house to pitch him. Shatner ''thought we were
crazy,'' said Priceline spokesman Brian Ek.
</P>
<P>
   The company kept at him for weeks, and finally he signed on and
asked to be paid in stock options -- an unusual idea, and a risk.
The radio and newspaper ads, edited by Shatner, were
straightforward and low-key -- low-key for Shatner, that is.
</P>
<P>
   When Priceline took off, TV ads seemed a natural next step. The
New York office of the ad firm Hill Holliday decided to use popular
songs about change and travel, which led to the exhumation of a
much-heckled chapter in Shatner's past.
</P>
<P>
   As the original ''Star Trek'' slouched to its budget-strapped
end, Shatner recorded ''The Transformed Man,'' a 1968 album that
capitalized on his new fame (the album cover said ''William
Shatner: Captain Kirk of Star Trek'').
</P>
<P>
   On it, in the staccato tones of a righteous starship captain, he
belted out unusual renditions of ''Mr. Tambourine Man,'' ''Lucy in
the Sky With Diamonds'' and other hits. It sounds like this:
''Picture yourSELF! In a boat! On a RIVER!'' The LP enshrined
Shatner in the annals of musical history. One critic, after
listening, concluded that he ''sounds in dire need of padded
restraints.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Shatner remembers ''The Transformed Man'' as an album
''in which I linked prose and lyrics to a song in kind of a medley
to show a relationship between the written word and music.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, people made fun. But 32 years later, he's getting the last
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The Priceline ads play off the lounge-lizard notion. Set in what
appears to be a crowded, smoky bar (again, Shatner's idea), they
feature him in a leather jacket singing his unique take on ''Free
Bird,'' ''Age of Aquarius'' and other songs. In between, he throws
in improv comedy lines about airline tickets, online purchases and
naming your own price. In the last of the 10 spots, he smashes his
guitar a la Pete Townshend. Even Shatner's backup band didn't know
what he had planned.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't take anybody looking closely at the commercials to
see the man's having fun,'' Ek said. And when Priceline posted
digitized video of the ads on its Web site, visits jumped 4,000
percent overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of celebrities are so concerned with projecting a very
focused image. They either want to be the comedian or they want to
be serious. Bill is willing to let people interpret,'' said David
Wecal, executive creative director at Hill Holliday's New York
office.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's out there singing, and he's not the world's greatest
singer,'' Wecal said. ''The fact that the man is out there doing
that takes a lot of courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ''3rd Rock'' brought Shatner aboard for a recurring
role as the Big Giant Head opposite John Lithgow's earthbound alien
operative. Shatner plunged in with glee, portraying the uber-ET as
a Bloody Mary-swilling, womanizing boor whose only redeeming
character trait is that he occasionally departs for another galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was the leader of one of the greatest TV space shows in
history; he should be the supreme leader of another. We thought
that type of cult value would be terrific,'' said Bob Kushell,
executive producer of ''3rd Rock.''
</P>
<P>
   Shatner has always been adept at comedy. One of the best
original ''Star Trek'' episodes, ''The Trouble With Tribbles,''
featured a tour-de-force comic performance, and he parodied his
command pomposity in ''Airplane II: The Sequel'' (1982).
</P>
<P>
   ''He goes through life with this true measure of confidence that
is unparalleled to anybody I've ever met,'' Kushell said.
</P>
<P>
   Shatner may have another reason to focus on work. Last summer,
his wife Nerine drowned in their swimming pool, an event that
devastated him. He has established a memorial fund in her name, and
his most recent book, ''Beyond the Stars'' (HarperCollins), is
dedicated to ''my beloved.'' ''She defined love. She was my
passion,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In an upcoming novel about Captain Kirk, he plans to take
''aspects of my life and integrate them into the Kirk character'' --
something that will undoubtedly resonate with ''Trek'' fans. The
newest Kirk novel, ''Preserver'' (Pocket Books), comes out next
month.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Shatner is such a pop-culture icon that a man named
J. Trusk tours ''Star Trek'' conventions in a Starfleet uniform
doing gigs as Shatner/Kirk -- sort of an intergalactic Elvis
impersonator.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Priceline stock has made Shatner far richer. A
new set of Priceline ads pitching long-distance phone calls and
other business services makes its debut in coming weeks, again
featuring a singing Shatner -- this time with some of today's
popular musicians. And Shatner says he's being sent scripts and
getting myriad TV offers. ''These things were waiting for me,'' he
marvels.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who's getting more value out of the deal? Is it Priceline or
is it Shatner? They've really increased the value of Shatner's
personal brand,'' said Jason Hartman, an expert in how to turn
yourself into a coveted brand name.
</P>
<P>
   Call it what you will, then: reinvention, rediscovery,
resurrection. William Shatner is back, he's marketable, and he's
getting laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very narrow line between being funny and being an
idiot. You can walk over that line very easily without even knowing
it,'' Shatner said. ''But if you take yourself seriously at any
time, you're in trouble. The whole thing's a cosmic joke, I
think.''

<HEADLINE> German TV Plans Nazi Comedy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) -- A German television station is filming
a movie of a kind never before attempted here: a comedy about the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   In the film still under production, a Jew named Harry Geduldig
manages to infiltrate the Nazi party and take the place of
Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels in order to free the woman he
loves.
</P>
<P>
   At the climax of the movie, under the working title ''Goebbels
and Geduldig,'' the character ends up in Adolf Hitler's southern
mountain retreat with Goebbels' wife, Magda.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think such a subject also has to be possible today,'' said
lead actor Ulrich Muehe. ''It's already been done abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for his role as Goebbels, Muehe said he listened to
original speeches, playing them on the set just before filming
scenes.
</P>
<P>
   The film is to be shown sometime in the fall of 2001 on
Germany's Suedwestrundfunk public station.

<HEADLINE> Study Criticizes Media Drug Coverage  </HEADLINE>
By KATHARINE WEBSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   A study of how the mass media cover health found that many news
stories on drugs fail to report side effects or researchers'
financial ties to the companies that make the medications.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers looked at 207 newspaper and TV stories from 1994
to 1998 on three drugs: aspirin, used to prevent heart disease;
pravastatin, a cholesterol-lowering drug also used to prevent heart
disease; and alendronate, a drug for preventing and treating
osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   In the 170 stories that cited experts or scientific studies,
half included at least one expert or study with financial ties to
the drug's manufacturer. Of those, only 40 percent reported the
potential conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that fewer than half the news stories
reported the drugs' side effects and only 30 percent noted their
cost.
</P>
<P>
   The study by researchers from Harvard University and Harvard
Pilgrim Health Care, a managed care insurer, was being published in
Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine, whose incoming editor
has been criticized for an apparent conflict of interest involving
a drug company.
</P>
<P>
   Wire service stories were included in the study, including some
by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Forty percent of the stories studied did not report the numbers
behind the claims of medical benefits. Among the 124 stories that
did quantify the benefits of a drug, 83 percent reported only the
relative benefit and 2 percent reported only the absolute benefit.
Just 15 percent reported both, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   For example, many 1996 stories about an alendronate study said
the drug would cut an osteoporosis patient's risk of a broken hip
in half -- the relative benefit. But most failed to include the
absolute reduction in risk, from a 2 percent chance of a hip
fracture to 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting only the relative benefit is ''an approach that has
been shown to increase the enthusiasm of doctors and patients for
long-term preventive treatments and that could be viewed as
potentially misleading,'' the authors wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Some studies do not report absolute benefits. Others look at
drugs in the experimental phase; manufacturers will not release a
price until the drug is approved and on the market.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, while the top medical journals require researchers
to report their financial ties to drug companies, some studies do
not include the information because a researcher fails to disclose
it.
</P>
<P>
   ''The financial entanglements can be essential information for
these science stories, and we want to provide readers whatever
details we can,'' said Mike Silverman, deputy managing editor for
national news of The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ''We try very hard to provide an adequate context for the
readers, and sometimes the information is available in (medical)
journal articles or obtainable in interviews on deadline, and
sometimes it isn't,'' said Cornelia Dean, science editor of The New
York Times, another of the publications studied.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it makes some really valuable points,'' Rob Stein,
science editor for The Washington Post, said of the study. ''I
think there's a real danger of oversimplifying these things.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was led by Ray Moynihan, a fellow at the Commonwealth
Fund, a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving health care.
Funding was provided by the Commonwealth Fund and the Harvard
Pilgrim Health Care Foundation, a nonprofit organization linked to
the insurer.
</P>
<P>
   The incoming editor of the journal this week responded to
reports about an apparent conflict of interest stemming from his
ties to drug companies. Dr. Jeffrey Drazen, who becomes editor in
July, said he may have made a mistake last year when he praised a
new asthma drug made by a company that had hired him to evaluate
studies about the medication. He also said he would divest himself
of any financial interests in drug companies before taking over as
editor.

<HEADLINE> Truckers Unhappy With New Limits  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Unhappy bus and truck drivers contend proposed
new limits on the time they can drive will cost the economy
millions of dollars and make the roads less safe.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers and industry representatives packed a Transportation
Department hearing room Wednesday as federal regulators began
hearings on the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''The proposal is a knife in the heart of my industry,'' charged
Godfrey LeBron of Paradise Tours in Elmont, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Eyre of Eyre Bus Service in Glenelg, Md., agreed,
commenting that under the proposed rule he would have to increase
his staff from 55 drivers to 86 and buy 10 minivans to send out
relief drivers for longer trips.
</P>
<P>
   The rule would establish work limits for five different classes
of drivers, with long-distance operators allowed to do no more than
12 hours of driving in a 24-hour period, with two hours of break
time within the 12. Long-distance trucks would be required to carry
electronic monitors -- black boxes -- to keep track of drivers' work
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Current rules, adopted more than 60 years ago, say truckers can
drive no more than 10 hours straight, followed by at least eight
hours off. But they permit up to 16 hours of driving in a day and
don't include required break time as the new rules do.
</P>
<P>
   David Osiecki of the American Trucking Association said leaders
of his organization believe the outcome will ''very likely to be
less safety, not more.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rule would result in ''more trucks operated by more
drivers new to the industry, more trucks operating during the day
with the rest of us, more trucks being operated in an aggressive
fashion and more trucks parking in unsafe locations,'' Osiecki
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. David C. Bridge Jr., of the Connecticut Division of Motor
Vehicles, said the rules could reduce accidents if properly
enforced, but criticized the proposal as overly complex and hard
for drivers and regulators to understand.
</P>
<P>
   Announced last month, the proposed changes would prevent 2,600
accidents and as many as 115 fatalities every year, according to
the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Mortimer of the Transportation Intermediaries Association,
which represents transport-related businesses such as warehouses
and commodity brokers, worried that drivers nearing the end of
their permitted hours would be inclined to speed up to complete a
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the hearings began, the department has been flooded
with comments via mail and e-mail. A sampling of the opinions
included:
</P>
<P>
   --Robert R. Homan of Port Charlotte, Fla., said he believes the
new rules ''are more a result of the desires of the railroads and
air-freighters, as these proposals are designed to hamper the
movement of freight.''
</P>
<P>
   --''Yo Feds,'' wrote Michael A. Stewart, who didn't give his
address. ''Don't knuckle under to the lobbyists. Make the penalties
10 times more severe than they are now. ... Also, you had better
enforce them a whole lot better than you enforce the rules now in
place.''
</P>
<P>
   --''I do not welcome the addition of a time data recorder onboard
my vehicle. ... What's next then? Perhaps a device to monitor the
amount of time a driver actually sleeps,'' said Joseph F. Tadlock
of Amarillo, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is being done to stop four-wheeled vehicles from driving
36 hours at a time, etc.? They are the cause of 70 percent of ALL
accidents involving big trucks,'' asked Dean E. Elliott, Las Vegas,
Nev.
</P>
<P>
   Other public hearings on the rules are scheduled for Ontario,
Calif., June 7-8; Golden, Colo., June 12-13; Kansas City, Mo., June
15-16; Indianapolis, June 20-21; Hartford, Conn., June 26-27 and
Atlanta, June 29-30.

<HEADLINE> Casino owners battle over billboard  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EAST LYME, Conn. (AP) -- A billboard at a key highway
intersection for gamblers headed to one of the state's two huge,
Indian-run casinos is at the center of a spat between the two
tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers at the intersection of Interstate 95 and I-395 can
stay on I-95 and head for the Foxwoods Resort Casino or bear left
and head to the Mohegan Sun.
</P>
<P>
   For three years, the billboard has urged travelers to go left
and visit the casino operated by the Mohegan tribe. But now an
advertisement recommends Foxwoods, operated by the Mashantucket
Pequot tribe.
</P>
<P>
   The Mohegans are suing the billboard's owner, PNE Media of East
Hartford, alleging violation of Connecticut's Unfair Trade
Practices Act, breach of contract, and breach of covenant of good
faith and fair dealing over the much-in-demand billboard.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew L. Houlding of Bridgeport, an attorney for the Mohegans,
said the casino had an option to renew the contract for the
billboard site and tried to do so but was denied by PNE. Instead
PNE leased the site to the Pequots in March, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe Mohegan Sun did everything, and more, to renew the
billboard contract, but for reasons that have yet to be determined,
PNE failed to honor its obligations,'' said Houlding.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, the Mohegan Sun casino first began
leasing the billboard for $4,500 a month in April 1997 advertising
the location of their casino.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides were set to sign a renewal deal for that billboard
and others worth $534,698, the lawsuit said. But later, PNE said it
would be doing business with Foxwoods, not Mohegan Sun, according
to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew B. Nevas of Westport, the billboard company's attorney,
said the lawsuit was without merit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mohegan Sun had a contract which expired on March 31,'' Nevas
said. ''There was never any extension of that contract. It expired
by its own terms, and once it expired PNE was free to rent the
space to anyone they chose.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Talks Trade in Europe  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT WIELAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- President Clinton and European Union
officials failed Wednesday to end bilateral trade disputes but
pledged to work to resolve them through the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   After a meeting at the Queluz Palace, a sprawling 18th century
guest house outside Lisbon, Clinton told reporters that as he nears
the end of his eight years in the White House, he is leaving
America's overall relations with Europe in fine shape.
</P>
<P>
   He said East European nations were joining the ''trans-Atlantic
mainstream,'' the 15 EU nations were taking charge of their own
security needs within NATO and Russia has completed ''its first
democratic power transfer in its entire history.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing next to Clinton under a hot sun, European Union
Commission President Romano Prodi hailed Clinton's trans-Atlantic
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Prodi said that while President Kennedy declared himself to be a
Berliner in a June 26, 1963 speech in the German city, Clinton was
''a European. You belong to our family.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, Prodi and Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio
Guterres, whose country now holds the EU presidency, did not report
any progress in their meeting toward resolving disputes over trade
in bananas, beef and genetically modified food.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said later that the US-EU summit revealed
''lively and frank'' disagreements.
</P>
<P>
   One official, who asked not to be named, said Clinton expressed
his dismay with European subsidies for Airbus planes and ''was
puzzled as to why the Europeans'' were denouncing U.S. efforts to
tone down income tax breaks for U.S. exporters.
</P>
<P>
   The EU accuses the Clinton administration of not doing enough to
get rid of the 15 percent tax break that benefits 6,000 exporters
including such giants as Boeing, General Motors and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO views the perk as unfair. And the EU has seized on that
WTO position, especially since the Geneva-based trade organization
has already twice sided with Washington. It has allowed the United
States to impose import penalties of $191 million and $120 million
against the EU for restricting, respectively, imports of bananas
from U.S. multinationals and American beef treated with growth
hormones.
</P>
<P>
   Prodi told reporters that he and Clinton agreed ''all trade
disputes will be settled, case by case, under WTO rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides also reaffirmed their commitment to a multilateral
trading system. They said in a joint statement that they believed
''an early launch to an inclusive new round of WTO trade
negotiations would offer a major boost to global economic growth,
employment and sustainable development.''

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Shuts Refugee Camp  </HEADLINE>
By ELAINE CHAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- Hong Kong's last Vietnamese refugee camp was
closed at midnight tonight, putting an official end to the boat
people saga the territory has grappled with for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, refugees carted TV sets, refrigerators,
stereos and bags of belongings to their new homes from the remote
camp at Pillar Point, a collection of two- and three-story barracks
that had provided them with free housing since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   At midnight, security guards marched out before officials pulled
the front gate shut and hung a sign on it pronouncing the camp's
permanent closure.
</P>
<P>
   The government decided in February to shut the camp and give the
Vietnamese refugees Hong Kong residency, calling it a humanitarian
solution for the residents and their Hong Kong-born children who
had been stuck in the territory awaiting relocation to the West --
some for up to two decades.
</P>
<P>
   But the change has been difficult for some of the impoverished
Vietnamese, who must find the means to survive in an affluent
society that often is criticized as discriminatory to immigrants.
Many are unemployed or work odd jobs.
</P>
<P>
   After the closure, more than 100 people who claim they cannot
afford to move out remained in the camp behind the gate. They want
the government to give them housing and money to stay afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Officials refused to say what they would do to the people who
stayed behind, despite their earlier threats that they would be
kicked out. Police earlier searched the barracks for weapons to
prevent outbreaks of violence.
</P>
<P>
   The government said it has given some families moving allowances
of about $500 to $1,460. Some got additional housing and welfare
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Those who refuse to leave will not be given further assistance,
said Robert Chan, the head of the government Civil Aid Service,
which took over the camp today.
</P>
<P>
   ''We appeal to them to move out quickly,'' Chan said. ''They're
able-bodied and able to lead a self-reliant life.''
</P>
<P>
   Refugee Tsang Sing-san, 26, said his income from occasional
construction jobs is not enough to pay rent.
</P>
<P>
   ''How can I leave? With that compensation, I'm not able to get a
place to live,'' said Tsang, who came to Hong Kong on a boat in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   About 1 million Vietnamese fled to neighboring countries on foot
or by boat to escape political persecution and poverty after the
communist North defeated the U.S.-backed South in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong, then a British colony, gave unconditional temporary
asylum to people awaiting resettlement in the West until 1988, when
it added a screening process to separate political and economic
refugees. The latter were eventually sent home.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of refugees had been stuck in Hong Kong because they
were refused asylum elsewhere due to criminal records or drug
problems. Others had nowhere to go because the government could not
prove their identity.
</P>
<P>
   Some 1,274 have applied for Hong Kong residency, while 143 have
not.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as the mid-1990s, 5,000 people were packed into
Pillar Point barracks, located next to drab factories. Crime was
common, and the close quarters led to sporadic brawls, especially
between southern and northern Vietnamese.

<HEADLINE> Sao Paulo Braces for Water Rationing  </HEADLINE>
By STAN LEHMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Millions of residents of South
America's biggest and wealthiest city raced Wednesday to fill pots,
pans, cisterns and even swimming pools with water in preparation
for five months of water rationing.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Thursday, about 3 million people -- nearly one-third of
the city's population -- will be required to follow what authorities
call the two-and-one plan: two days with water, one day without.
</P>
<P>
   The rationing will affect more than 500 districts of northern
Sao Paulo, where rich and poor alike depend on the 250-square-mile
Guarapiranga Reservoir for their water.
</P>
<P>
   While many residents seemed unconcerned Wednesday, many were
stocking up on water ahead of the first dry day.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just filled my pool and replenished the water tanks,'' said
Teresa Nicoretto, a 35-year-old housewife in the fashionable
Morumbi neighborhood. ''I think I'll be fine as long as the
rationing system works the way they say it will.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its economic clout, Sao Paulo has never learned to
manage water.
</P>
<P>
   In the Southern Hemisphere summer between December and March,
heavy rains often cause rivers to overflow, and floods bring the
city to a standstill. Now, after seven months of sparse rains,
reservoirs are drying up.
</P>
<P>
   The Sao Paulo state water and sewage utility, known as Sabesp,
said rainfall between October and April was almost 30 percent below
average. As a result, the Guarapiranga Reservoir has fallen to 17.7
billion gallons, or 42 percent of capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Worsening matters are some 300,000 squatters who in recent years
have illegally occupied land near the reservoir. The squatters have
destroyed surrounding vegetation, drying up a network of
underground springs that helped replenish Guarapiranga.
</P>
<P>
   ''The haphazard occupation of the area has waterproofed the
ground, making it impossible for rainwater to penetrate the soil
and feed these springs,'' said Professor Antonio Fernando Monteiro,
head of the Ecology Department of the Sao Paulo State University.
</P>
<P>
   The dry spell has also affected the other five reservoirs that
supply the 7 million residents of greater Sao Paulo. But Sabesp
said those reservoirs were at normal capacity for this time of the
year, and that rationing in other areas was not being considered.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Study Stirs Anti-Semitism  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- Switzerland's painful re-examination of its World
War II record has stirred ''unacceptable'' anti-Semitic sentiments,
the foreign minister said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Historians' efforts have ''opened a long overdue debate'' that
must be continued, Joseph Deiss told the country's main Jewish
organization, the Swiss Confederation of Hebrew Congregations.
</P>
<P>
   But the reappraisal of the past has brought out old
anti-Semitism, ''which manifests itself in readers' mail,
threatening letters to Jewish personalities or organizations, or in
other ways,'' Deiss said. ''That is unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 government-commissioned report found that anti-Semitic
sentiments had sprung from the controversy over Switzerland's
relations with Nazi Germany and its banks' treatment of Holocaust
victims' assets.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland's two biggest banks agreed in August 1998 to pay
Holocaust survivors $1.25 billion in compensation for wartime
losses. The accord followed prolonged international pressure,
notably from Jewish groups.
</P>
<P>
   A government working group was looking for new ways of fighting
racism and anti-Semitism, Deiss noted. Several convictions for
anti-Semitism have been secured under the 1995 anti-racism law,
which outlaws belittling of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish confederation leader Rolf Bloch retired Wednesday, and
the confederation's assembly was expected to decide Thursday on a
successor.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Up 25; Dow Up 33  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were modestly higher today as investors
wondered whether some new signs of slower economic growth mean that
the Federal Reserve is nearing the end of its long run of
interest-rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   In midafternoon trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite
index was up 24.85 at 3,484.33, having teetered between gains and
losses for much of the session. On Tuesday, the index rose 254.37
points, or 7.9 percent -- its largest percentage gain ever and the
second-largest point gain ever.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators, which joined the Nasdaq in Tuesday's
rally, were mixed. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 32.64 at
10,559.77 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 11.02 at
1,433.47.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said interest rate worries were preventing the market
from building decisively on Tuesday's gains.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we're going to see these periodic rallies, but I don't
think they'll be sustainable because of the nervousness that's
lingering over monetary policy,'' said Ned Riley, chief investment
strategist at State Street Global Advisors.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks shook off some early weakness after three separate
economic reports offered signs that the economy is no longer
growing at the rapid pace that prompted the Federal Reserve to
raise interest rates six times in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said the most significant report was data from the
Purchasing Management Association of Chicago. The group's index of
area business activity fell to 53.9 in May, on a seasonally
adjusted basis, from 56.5 in April. The report is considered a good
gauge of the national purchasing managers' report, due out on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Also today, the Commerce Department reported that sales of new
homes tumbled 5.8 percent in April. That marked the largest decline
since last September.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the Index of Leading Economic Indicators declined
by 0.1 percent last month, the Conference Board said today. The
compilation of forward-pointing economic statistics is designed to
forecast the future direction of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The three reports should convince investors that the Fed's
efforts to quell inflation are succeeding, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The economy is already showing evidence of a slowing rate of
expansion,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, chief market strategist at
A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis, pointing to reports last week
that showed declines in existing home sales and consumer
confidence. ''Inflation reports remain benign.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wall Street was already looking ahead to the government's
employment report for the month of May, due out Friday. That report
should indicate whether a continued low jobless rate is forcing
companies to boost wages and benefits to retain workers.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent Technologies rose $0.688 to $58.688. The company, the
world's biggest maker of telephone equipment, is acquiring
Chromatis Networks, a privately held optical networking firm, for
about $4.5 billion in stock. Lucent said the deal would will help
it gain business in big cities.
</P>
<P>
   Kmart rose $1.25 to $8.875. The company tapped the No. 2
executive at drug chain CVS Corp. as its new leader, replacing
Floyd Hall, who announced in mid-May that he was planning to retire
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 611.53 million
shares, ahead of Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.65 to 479.35.

<HEADLINE> FBI Pays To Watch for Suspect  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NOWELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The FBI is paying outdoorsmen familiar
with the remote mountains of western North Carolina to watch for
signs of serial bombing suspect Eric Rudolph, who has eluded a
manhunt for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   It's the latest tactic employed by authorities, who have had no
luck in tracking down the experienced backwoodsman.
</P>
<P>
   However, since the FBI began paying the fees months ago, the
scouts haven't been any more successful in finding Rudolph than
anything else the agents have tried.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it was worthwhile,'' said Lt. Mike Stevens of the
North Carolina Wildlife Commission, who was approached by federal
agents last fall to help recruit hunters and other outdoorsmen to
serve as part-time scouts. ''They were pretty much grasping for
straws.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said the scouts typically were paid between $15 and $20
an hour by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ''They wanted to find someone who was willing to go up on the
ridge tops at night and listen,'' he said. ''They only wanted
locals who knew the lay of the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph, 33, is charged in three Atlanta-area bombings,
including the 1996 Olympic Park bombing in which a woman died.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also suspect he was involved in the 1998 explosion
that killed a policeman and maimed a nurse at the New Woman All
Women Health Care clinic in Birmingham, Ala. Days later, Rudolph
disappeared into the western North Carolina wilderness. A $1
million reward has been offered for information leading to his
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time agents have turned to the public for
help in the Rudolph manhunt. In 1998, at the height of the search,
the Southeast Bomb Task Force allowed hunters into the same woods
agents were searching, in hopes the hunters or their dogs might
find Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 agents were searching the rugged landscape for
Rudolph at the time, but now the operation is far smaller. In
March, the task force announced it was vacating its command post in
the mountain town of Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   Task force leader Steven McCraw insisted at the time the search
would continue, but with agents investigating leads and not
searching the woods.
</P>
<P>
   The last confirmed Rudolph sighting was in July 1998, when he
was said to have visited the home of a food store owner to stock up
on provisions. McCraw said investigators believe Rudolph may have
been involved in a February 1999 break-in at a local restaurant,
but no fingerprints or other evidence directly implicated him.

<HEADLINE> Germany May Aid U.S. Parents  </HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- On the eve of President Clinton's visit to Berlin,
the German government is signaling it may help in resolving
international child custody disputes that threaten to strain ties
between the key trans-Atlantic allies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to raise the increasingly high-profile topic
when he meets German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder in Berlin on
Thursday, the second stop on his European tour.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the cases involve American parents who married
non-Americans, divorced and have since been frustrated in efforts
to gain custody or to see their children. The problem is
particularly acute in Germany, where the decades-long presence of
U.S. troops led to many German-American marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Up to this point, Schroeder's government has taken a hands-off
position in such cases, saying custody fights involving American
parents are exclusively a matter for German courts.
</P>
<P>
   But the government recently has suggested it could change its
position. One approach being considered would set up a group of
lawmakers from both countries to mediate custody fights, government
spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has complicated German-U.S. ties just when German
policy-makers are fretting that the two partners are drifting apart
after the end of the Cold War, which united the West in opposing
communism.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has put the number of custody disputes from
mixed German-American marriages at nearly 60. And the U.S. Congress
recently singled out Germany, Sweden and Austria, rebuking them for
allegedly breaching the Hague Convention. The 1980 treaty says
children should be returned to the country that had been their home
in cases where both parents have legal custody.
</P>
<P>
   One impetus for the new focus on the problem is the highly
publicized case of French-born Lady Catherine Meyer.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer has fought to reclaim her sons, ages 12 and 14, since her
German ex-husband refused in 1994 to return them from a visit to
Germany. Meyer, now in Washington as the British ambassador's wife,
has written a book about her experience titled ''They Are My
Children Too.''
</P>
<P>
   In another case, New Yorker Joseph Cooke lost his children --
Danny, 10, and Michelle, almost 9 -- after their German mother
sought treatment for mental illness and turned them over to foster
care seven years ago. A German court ruled in 1995 that the
children had bonded with the foster family and would suffer if they
were returned to their father.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright confronted German Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer about the Cooke case during Fischer's
visit to Washington in May. Fischer said he was ''deeply
impressed'' by Cooke's plight.
</P>
<P>
   The case of 6-year-old Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez also focused
U.S. attention on the issue. Other such cases are coming to the
fore as hundreds of parents battle for custody across borders and
struggle to reconcile opposing legal systems.
</P>
<P>
   German officials have insisted that they can't influence the
courts, which weigh custody rights against the need to shield
children from traumatic changes. In practice, this means that once
a disputed American-German child has spent more than a year in
Germany -- even if abducted -- courts are reluctant to return the
child to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say a panel of German and French legislators set up
last year to try to broker solutions between rival parents could
now provide a model for countering U.S. criticism.

<HEADLINE> Fujimori Faces Economic Challenges  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- After his tainted re-election victory,
President Alberto Fujimori doesn't just face the threat of
international sanctions and opposition forces eager to topple him.
</P>
<P>
   He must also deal with millions of poor Peruvian supporters who
expect him to deliver what he promised -- jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In the final weeks of a campaign riddled with irregularities and
allegations of vote rigging, Fujimori solidified his support with
promises to create hundreds of thousands of jobs, largely through
government spending.
</P>
<P>
   It's an issue that most Peruvians, out of sheer economic need,
consider more urgent than the sanctity of democratic institutions.
Only one in two people in the labor force has steady work.
</P>
<P>
   But the promises may prove too expensive to fulfill and may have
dangerously inflated expectations among the country's poor.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a time bomb,'' said political scientist Fernando
Rospigliosi, calling Fujimori's pledges ''truly incredible
demagoguery.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, he won't be able to deliver on these promises nor
satisfy the expectations that were stirred up,'' Rospigliosi said.
</P>
<P>
   The runoff was boycotted by challenger Alejandro Toledo, marred
by violent demonstrations and abandoned by independent monitors,
who said a fair election was impossible without a postponement.
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday's voting, the U.S. State Department insisted
Fujimori could not ''claim legitimacy'' and called the ballot
''flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration was awaiting the outcome of a meeting
Wednesday by the Organization of American States before deciding a
course of action, which could include cuts in direct aid or changes
in U.S. policy toward Peru in international lending organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think the international pressure will add to Fujimori's
difficulties in fulfilling the campaign promises,'' said Ricardo
Adrogue, a vice president of economic and marketing analysis for
Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Peru currently receives $177 million in military, anti-narcotics
and humanitarian aid, according to the U.S. Embassy in Lima.
Hundreds of millions of dollars flow into the country from
international lenders, like the Inter-American Development Bank and
World Bank, which fund everything from building highways and
improving health care to financing small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has sent out mixed messages about the severity of
sanctions it might impose. The Clinton administration must walk a
fine line between encouraging fair democratic elections and
avoiding the destabilization of a country that has been its
strongest regional ally in fighting narcotics trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   ''Regardless of what the U.S. says or does, it's making Peru
less attractive to investment,'' said Carol Graham, a senior fellow
with the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, Toledo, a former World Bank consultant who
grew up in poverty, had gained ground among Fujimori's traditional
bastion of support, the poor.
</P>
<P>
   But two weeks before the second round, Fujimori blitzed the
airwaves with his own promises of ''work for all Peruvians.''
</P>
<P>
   He pledged to kickstart agricultural production with a massive
irrigation project to make the barren Andean sierra bloom. He
promised public works jobs would abound with the construction of
roads and schools, and said the annual flow of foreign tourists
would more than double to 2.5 million by 2005, creating one job for
every two visitors.
</P>
<P>
   But a growing number of financial analysts question where
Fujimori will find the cash to fund his great job push.
</P>
<P>
   International election monitors complained throughout the
campaign that Fujimori was using state-funded public works projects
to pander to voters.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori denies any pre-election spending binge occurred. But
some economists warn that the burst of spending overshot strict
deficit targets set by the International Monetary Fund. They
predict the government will now have to cut spending in the second
half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government has very little room to move in the economic
front,'' said Pablo Secada, an economist with Santander Central
Hispano.

<HEADLINE> Germany Set To Open World's Fair  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER, Germany (AP) -- The decision to give Germany its
first-ever World's Fair was made in the middle of 1990 -- in the
delicate moments after the fall of the Berlin Wall and before the
country's peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
   The fair opens Thursday and the world is a decidedly different
place. Almost all remnants of the Wall are gone and the standoff
between communism and capitalism ended mostly peacefully. The globe
is linked by the Internet, where the Web brings faraway places to
anyone's desktop.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers are already on the defensive about whether the $1.6
billion cost of staging Expo 2000 -- billed as the largest-ever fair
-- is worthwhile in the information age.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear why they're worried: The world's richest country and
trailblazer for new information technology, the United States,
isn't represented for the first time, unable to get enough
corporate backing.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the United States is launching a Web site promoting
cultural events -- including readings by writers William Styron and
Art Buchwald -- running parallel to the fair in the central German
city of Hanover.
</P>
<P>
   On the plot designated for the American exhibit, the United Arab
Emirates has built a desert stocked with camels.
</P>
<P>
   ''I myself think it is embarrassing for the United States to be
everywhere in the world but the Expo,'' said Birgit Breuel,
commisioner-general of the fair.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that there will be no U.S. presence at the 5-month
fair, whose grounds are so vast it takes nine hours just to walk
through. McDonald's has six restaurants; IBM has set up a theme
park with the assistance of experts from Disney's Epcot Center.
Coca-Cola and Yahoo! are corporate sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly the kind of shift that illustrates the changing
world in which this year's fair is taking place -- with the new
superpowers -- international corporations -- taking a lead role
rather than countries.
</P>
<P>
   The first World's Fair, in 1851, was conceived by Britain's
Prince Albert as a vehicle for showcasing the British Empire's
technological progress.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, fairs have left enduring marks: The Eiffel Tower was
built for the 1889 fair; Seattle got its trademark Space Needle for
the 1962 event; Brussels, Belgium, looked to the future of atomic
energy with its enlarged sculpture of an atom, still a landmark
after the 1958 fair.
</P>
<P>
   Inventions such as aspirin, steam engines and huge cannons were
the centerpieces of fairs past. Alexander Graham Bell showed off
his telephone and Thomas Edison displayed a new telegraph and a
motor for bicycles.
</P>
<P>
   Technology isn't the only thing that's changed.
</P>
<P>
   World exhibitions until 1940 all had a decidedly colonial focus,
with the world empires showing off the benefits of being under
their flags.
</P>
<P>
   Now pavilions have much humbler aims. Thailand's theme is food.
Bhutan has constructed a temple to depict religion in harmony with
nature. The Netherlands showcases trees. Japan's pavilion is made
from 80 percent paper that will be entirely recycled later.
</P>
<P>
   At the British pavilion, visitors pass an original door from 10
Downing Street, the prime minister's residence, followed by
presentations highlighting Britain's diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ''We aim to get a certain message over about the Brits rather
than the stereotypical image that people have,'' said Alp Mehmet,
press attache to the British Embassy in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   The front hall of Germany's pavilion leads visitors past 47
larger-than-life sculptures of prominent people in German history,
set in a maze of scaffolding designed to give the impression of the
country as a work in progress. Hitler isn't there, but Steffi Graf,
Einstein and the Brothers Grimm are.
</P>
<P>
   During the 153-day event, organizers hope 20-25 million visitors
will stay for at least two days and purchase 40 million tickets at
$32 each. Still, the fair is expected to lose money. Estimates for
opening day attendance have already been cut from 200,000 to
150,000 -- and only about 56,000 tickets have been sold. Thousands
of free tickets are being distributed.
</P>
<P>
   Officials insist fair attendance will grow.
</P>
<P>
   ''Great exhibitions of the past were possibly the greatest
events of their time,'' said Ole Philipson, chairman of the Expo's
steering committee. ''Because -- perhaps in spite of this new
technology -- these hands-on events remain incredibly popular with
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The next fair is planned for 2005 in Japan, and officials at the
International Exhibitions Organization say they already have many
countries bidding for the 2010 fair.

<HEADLINE> Farms To Be Seized in Zimbabwe  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- The government will seize 841
white-owned farms and hand them over to landless blacks by the end
of June, a government official announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Kwenda, described as the director of land acquisition in
the office of President Robert Mugabe, made the announcement while
touring the country to explain a new land-seizure law passed by
ruling party lawmakers last month, state radio reported.
</P>
<P>
   The law empowers the government to seize private land without
paying compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Kwenda said the landless would be allowed to settle on the
properties before roads, water supplies, schools and other
infrastructure are installed, the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corp.
reported. That would be a departure from the normal practice in
which farms acquired for resettlement were carved up into plots
with access roads and basic utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Since February, squatters led by ruling party militants have
occupied more than 1,400 white-owned farms, saying they were
protesting the slow pace of the government's land nationalization
program.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear whether squatters on farms not
among the 841 to be nationalized would be forced off land they have
claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Kwenda spoke in the agricultural center of Chinhoyi, 70 miles
northwest of Harare. His remarks came despite a plan proposed by
President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa in which Saudi Arabia, Nordic
countries and other donors would contribute $14 million to pay 118
farmers who did not contest seizure but demanded fair compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The 118 farms would serve as a model for future land reform.
</P>
<P>
   State radio said the government will list the 841 targeted
properties in an official proclamation Friday.
</P>
<P>
   David Hasluck, director of the Commercial Farmers' Union, said
even under the new land nationalization law, the state was required
by the constitution to give owners 30 days to respond to the
proclamation. It therefore could not act before the end of June, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, ownership rights enshrined in the constitution and laws
protecting private property have been ignored by the government
during violent land occupations by mobs and veterans of the bush
war that ended white rule in Rhodesia, as Zimbabwe was known before
independence from Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe has described the occupations as a justified protest
against unfair land ownership mainly by the descendants of British
settlers.
</P>
<P>
   The Movement for Democratic Change opposition group, the biggest
threat to the ruling party in parliamentary elections slated for
June 24-25, accuses Mugabe of allowing the occupations and
promising land to bolster his flagging popularity among the rural
poor, and to punish white farmers for openly supporting the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   At least 26 people, most of them opposition supporters, have
been killed in political violence that began in February. Four of
the dead were white farmers.

<HEADLINE> CHRO questions number of minority inmates shipped out of state  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A state agency wants to know whether too
many minorities are being shipped from prisons in Connecticut to
one in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities has
asked the Department of Correction for an updated count of minority
inmates sent to Wallens Ridge State Prison in Big Stone Gap, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears that the vast majority of the inmates sent to
Virginia are racial minorities,'' CHRO Executive Director Cynthia
Watts Elder wrote to DOC Commissioner John Armstrong in a letter
dated May 19.
</P>
<P>
   CHRO is concerned that the percentage of minority inmates sent
to Virginia may be higher than the percentage of minorities in the
general inmate population, she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   If so, there may be grounds for a civil rights lawsuit, CHRO
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not making any accusations,'' said Lena Ferguson, a
legislative and regulations specialist for the CHRO. ''We're just
seeking information right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission decided to take up the issue after some
prisoners, their families and advocates said inmates at Wallens
Ridge do not feel safe. The transfers, which state officials say
ease crowding in Connecticut prisons, have drawn sharp criticism
from prisoners and their families.
</P>
<P>
   In April, David Tracy, a 20-year-old white inmate from
Bridgeport, hanged himself in his cell at Wallens Ridge. In March,
three Connecticut inmates were shot with rubber bullets by guards
trying to break up a scuffle.
</P>
<P>
   Prints of Civil War battle scenes featuring the Confederate flag
were removed from Wallens Ridge Warden Stanley Young's office after
some Connecticut lawmakers complained.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Young filed a federal lawsuit claiming he
has been depicted as a racist by Rep. Michael Lawlor, Sen. Alvin
Penn, the head of the Bridgeport NAACP chapter and three
Connecticut newspapers. The defendants have called the suit
unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong is expected to meet with the CHRO on June 8. DOC
spokeswoman Christina Polce said there is no disparity between the
number of minorities at Wallens Ridge and the number in Connecticut
prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without knowing the exact percentages, we can state that the
smaller population in Virginia mirrors the racial breakdown of the
larger population in Connecticut,'' Polce said.
</P>
<P>
   Corrections officials would not immediately say how many of the
500 inmates shipped to Wallens Ridge since October are minorities.
But Lawlor said about 80 percent of the first 300 inmates
transferred to Virginia were black and Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lawlor, about 73 percent of Connecticut's inmate
population is black and Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   ''After criticism was raised about that, it was clear that an
effort was made to send more white guys down there,'' said Lawlor,
D-East Haven, who co-chairs the Legislature's Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Prisoner advocates and some lawmakers say prison overcrowding
could be eased by placing more people in treatment programs instead
of behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   And racial disparity is something that pervades the entire
criminal justice system, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's definitely a problem, but it's a problem with the
whole system,'' said Penn, D-Bridgeport.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Shuts Last Refugee Camp  </HEADLINE>
By ELAINE CHAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- Hong Kong closed its last Vietnamese refugee
camp Wednesday, ending the quarter-century boat people saga in the
territory and leaving about 100 people homeless.
</P>
<P>
   At midnight, security guards marched out of the remote camp at
Pillar Point before officials pulled the front gate shut and hung a
sign pronouncing its permanent closure.
</P>
<P>
   The government decided in February to shut the camp and give
residency to the Vietnamese refugees, calling it a humanitarian
solution for them and their Hong Kong-born children who had been
stuck in the territory awaiting relocation to the West -- some for
up to two decades.
</P>
<P>
   But the change has been difficult for some of the impoverished
Vietnamese, who must find the means to survive in the affluent
society that often is criticized as discriminatory to immigrants.
Many are unemployed or work odd jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, refugees carted TV sets, refrigerators,
stereos and bags of belongings to their new homes from the camp, a
collection of two- and three-story barracks that had provided them
with free housing since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   After the closure, more than 100 people who claim they cannot
afford to move out defied orders and remained inside the camp. They
want the government to give them housing and money to stay afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Officials refused to say what they would do to the people who
stayed behind, despite earlier threats that they would be kicked
out.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will take legal and reasonable measures that the community
will find reasonable,'' said Robert Chan, head of the government
Civil Aid Service, which took over the camp Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Police earlier searched the barracks for weapons to prevent
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Tsang Sing-san, 26, said his income from occasional construction
jobs is not enough to pay rent.
</P>
<P>
   ''How can I leave? With that compensation, I'm not able to get a
place to live,'' said Tsang, who came to Hong Kong on a boat in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   The government has given some families moving allowances of
about $500 to $1,460. Some got additional housing and welfare
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Those who refuse to leave will not be given further assistance,
Chan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We appeal to them to move out quickly,'' Chan said. ''They're
able-bodied and able to lead a self-reliant life.''
</P>
<P>
   About 1 million Vietnamese fled to neighboring countries on foot
or by boat to escape political persecution and poverty after the
communist North defeated the U.S.-backed South in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong, then a British colony, gave unconditional temporary
asylum to people awaiting resettlement in the West until 1988, when
it added a screening process to separate political and economic
refugees. The latter were eventually sent home.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 223,000 Vietnamese refugees have passed through Hong
Kong. About 144,000 gained asylum abroad, mostly in the United
States, Canada and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of refugees had been stuck in Hong Kong because they
were refused asylum elsewhere due to criminal records or drug
problems. Others had nowhere to go because the government could not
prove their identity.
</P>
<P>
   Some 1,274 have applied for Hong Kong residency, while 143 have
not.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as the mid-1990s, 5,000 people were packed into
Pillar Point barracks. Crime was common, and the close quarters led
to sporadic brawls, especially between southern and northern
Vietnamese.

<HEADLINE> Russian Official Killed in Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
By NICK WADHAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Rebels killed the Russian government's
second-highest official in Chechnya, a spokesman said Wednesday --
the latest in a series of attacks that has the military on the
defensive despite its claims that the rebels have been defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Zveryev was riding in a car in the capital, Grozny, when
a remote-control bomb ripped through his vehicle Tuesday evening,
said Musa Dzhamalkhanov, a spokesman for Russia's temporary
administration in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Grozny Mayor Supyan Makhchayev, who was with Zveryev, was
injured in the bombing. Makhchayev's assistant was killed.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechen rebels' ability to pull off such an attack in the
Russian-controlled capital was yet another sign of their stepped-up
resistance. Eight months after Moscow sent its forces into the
North Caucasus republic to quell rebel activity, it is the rebels
who appear to have the initiative, able to launch attacks almost
anywhere, analysts said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The events of the last days have made that reality even more
stark. Over the weekend, three Russian police officers were killed
in an ambush in Grozny. That was followed by an attack on Russian
troops that left five dead in southern Chechnya on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''These new events are an answer to Russian claims that the
conflict is coming to an end,'' said Alexei Malashenko, an expert
on the Caucasus at the Carnegie Endowment for Peace in Moscow. ''I
have a feeling the Russians weren't expecting this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chechen attacks mark a low point for Moscow in the war that
started late last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Chechnya had been virtually independent since Russian forces
withdrew in 1996 after being fought to a standstill by separatists.
But Russia sent ground forces back into Chechnya in September after
rebels invaded neighboring Dagestan and allegedly bombed several
apartment buildings in Russia, killing 300 people.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian troops won a string of victories culminating in the
capture of Grozny in February. But they have stalled since then,
unable to defeat an estimated 3,500 remaining rebels in Chechnya's
southern mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of Russian soldiers and police officers have been killed
in ambushes in recent months. Each time, the Chechens have
surrounded Russian units, often inflicted serious losses and then
escaped. And in recent weeks, the rebels appear to have stepped up
their campaign by trying to assassinate Chechens who work for the
Russian-backed administration.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the string of high-profile attacks could mark the
start of more active rebel campaigning against the Russians now
that summer has arrived, warming the region and masking many areas
in thick foliage.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Russian commanders announced the start of another
offensive on rebel strongholds in the mountains. But there was no
sign that the Russian forces were making headway or curbing the
rebels' ability to strike back across the province.
</P>
<P>
   ''One has the idea that the federals, as before, don't have a
well-thought-out tactical plan that takes into account rebels
turning to methods of a partisan war,'' said the Segodnya
newspaper, which has been critical of Russian President Vladimir
Putin.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians also appear to be having problems building local
support in Chechnya. On Monday, the Kremlin's representative in
Chechnya, Nikolai Koshman, dismissed former Grozny Mayor Bislan
Gantamirov, who had been put in charge of a pro-Moscow Chechen
militia.
</P>
<P>
   Gantamirov was dismissed for neglecting his duties, Koshman
said. Gantamirov had been reported to be under consideration to
eventually lead Chechnya, under strict control from the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their tactical successes, the rebels probably are not
strong enough to oust Russian forces from Chechnya, as they did
four years ago. And with the Russians ruling out a political
settlement, the conflict appears to have settled into stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see any political will among the Russians to end this
war,'' said Viktor Kremenyuk, deputy director of the Center for USA
and Canada Studies. ''As long as the rebels keep getting supplies,
this will go on forever.''

<HEADLINE> Britain Bares Underwear To World  </HEADLINE>
By SUE LEEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Saucy? The British?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, and keeping well abreast of the latest science, judging by
a new exhibition of -- er -- underwear at London's Design Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the nation famed for its reserve has raised its hem,
offering a peep at sheepskin corsets, barely-there cashmere vests
and a glow-in-the-dark bra.
</P>
<P>
   Should all the titillation prove too much, there's also a bra
that detects a racing heartbeat and a pair of panties that protects
against radiation.
</P>
<P>
   ''This exhibit is a compelling statement about British design --
but it's also quite saucy,'' said Dame Helena Kennedy, a leading
lawyer and chairwoman of the British Council, which launched the
show Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The perception of British people as being strait-laced is no
longer real,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   To prove it, the displays are almost as provocative as the
garments.
</P>
<P>
   Vivienne Westwood's blue sheepskin corset and ditzy,
star-patterned mini-crinoline and Alexander McQueen's pink satin
corset crusted with black Swarovski crystal are suspended inside
giant inflatable women's legs in transparent plastic.
</P>
<P>
   Vacuum-packed thongs and Clements Ribeiro's red silk chiffon
panties with polka dots hang from pegs on a washline.
</P>
<P>
   Near the entrance, a mannequin sprawls seductively on her back,
a vision in pink fishnet stockings and the briefest green teddy and
panties by the aptly named Agent Provocateur.
</P>
<P>
   And everywhere there are bras to make even 1950s ''sweater
girl'' Lana Turner envious -- from Gossard's new padded Ultrabra
Super Boost in patriotic red-white-and-blue, to Stella McCartney's
tassels and gray beads, to Agent Provocateur's sliced-away style in
sheer black net.
</P>
<P>
   For the traditionally minded, there are the more substantial
constructions of Rigby and Peller (they put the foundation in
foundation garments), suppliers of spine-stiffening unmentionables
to the royal family since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Owner June Kenton, personal bra fitter to Her Majesty Queen
Elizabeth II and Queen Mother Elizabeth, believes 80 percent of all
women are wearing the wrong size bra ''and have two drawers-full of
bras that they don't wear.''
</P>
<P>
   Rigby and Peller's offerings contrast with the futuristic Techno
Bra, made of conductive textile with silicon gel inserts that
contain electronic devices to detect heartbeat changes.
</P>
<P>
   A British industrial design company is developing the piece for
the commercial market and designer Kirsty Falconer hopes it may one
day incorporate a personal alarm that will sound if the wearer is
attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Constructed in a dun-colored conductive nylon and silver fabric,
the anti-radiation panties are no thing of beauty. But if, as their
makers claim, they drain electricity from the body -- thereby
protecting it from magnetic radiation -- can you afford to be
without them?
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition runs through July 2, then tours Japan and
Australia.

<HEADLINE> Lucent to pay $4.5 billion for optical networking company with key product </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MURRAY HILL, N.J. (AP) -- The world's largest maker of
communications networking equipment, Lucent Technologies, plans to
buy Herndon, Va.-based Chromatis Networks, an optical networking
firm, in a $4.5 billion stock deal.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent executives are banking the deal, announced Wednesday,
will help them better compete with Cisco Systems Inc. and Nortel
Networks Corp., Lucent's chief rivals in the fast-growing market
for optical networking equipment.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Chromatis makes a new ''metro optical networking
system'' that can carry data, voice and video traffic together at
the speed of light between large-bandwidth, long-haul networks and
computer users in urban business complexes and high-rise apartments
-- all for about half the current cost.
</P>
<P>
   ''Buying Chromatis allows us to bring the power of optical
networking from the long-haul networks down to a customer's
desktop,'' said Lucent spokesman Bill Price.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lucent also announced Wednesday that its NetworkCare
Professional Services division and IBM Global Services have formed
a worldwide alliance to enable a new type of service providers
called CyberCarriers to offer businesses, government agencies and
consumers the latest network-based services more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   CyberCarriers, including companies such as AT&AMP;T and Qwest, offer
high-speed networking and data center services, including data
storage and network transport, to customers such as Internet
service providers, Web-hosting companies and e-commerce sites.
</P>
<P>
   In the optical networking field, Lucent's strength has been
creating long-haul networks linking far-flung cities and regions,
according to Price.
</P>
<P>
   Chromatis, which has about 150 employees, is best known for its
Metropolis system, the first in the industry that routes Internet,
data and voice traffic together on metropolitan fiber optic
networks. In addition, the capacity of the system can be increased
by splitting the light beams used to transmit information into many
wavelengths.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe their product is about 12 to 15 months ahead of
everyone else on the market,'' Price said.
</P>
<P>
   Chromatis, which has a research facility near Tel Aviv, Israel,
is testing its Metropolis system with several telephone carriers
and recently signed a five-year contract to deploy the system for
Cogent Communications, which provides Internet service to large
office buildings in 12 major U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
   ''The combination of Lucent and Chromatis will provide the
industry with next-generation metro optical networks that meet the
cost and capacity requirements for both traditional service
providers as well as the very different requirements of the new
broadband Internet service providers,'' said Bob Barron, chief
executive officer at privately held Chromatis.
</P>
<P>
   Murray Hill-based Lucent will acquire Chromatis for
approximately 78 million shares of Lucent common stock. Tuesday's
closing price of $58.19 per share makes the deal worth about $4.5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Several key Chromatis executives could receive an additional 2.5
million shares of Lucent stock, valued at about $145 million,
contingent upon Chromatis meeting certain performance goals, Lucent
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent expects to complete the purchase by June 30. The company
said the acquisition likely will reduce Lucent's earnings per share
by about 2 cents in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, and by about a
nickel in fiscal 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The deal excludes a 7 percent stake in Cromatis that Lucent
already owns through its Lucent Venture Partners venture capital
subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Chromatis, founded in 1998, will become part of Lucent's Optical
Networking Group. Barron and the company's five co-founders will
remain with Lucent, the companies said.
</P>
<P>
   Acquisitions of smaller manufacturers and major factory
expansions have become almost a weekly event in the hot market for
optical network equipment. Demand for network capacity has been
growing exponentially as more businesses try moving into electronic
commerce and more consumers get access to high-speed Web services.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Cisco and Nortel, Lucent's biggest competitors include
JDS Uniphase and Corning.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this spring, Nortel said analysts were forecasting that
the world market for optical networking systems would swell from an
estimated $543 million this year to $15 billion by 2004.

<HEADLINE> Experts: Medicare Should Pay More  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A panel of private experts who advise Congress
on Medicare is recommending a payment increase for the nation's
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hospitals' financial status has deteriorated significantly
over the past two years,'' said a report released Wednesday by the
Medicare Payment Advisory Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The commission chairwoman, Gail Wilensky, said shrinking
payments from private health plans are a bigger cause of hospitals'
troubles. But, she said, ''We did feel a general sense of some
concern'' that Medicare was contributing to the financial crunch.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is recommending hospitals get a Medicare raise in
2001 about 2 percentage points more than an inflation-based payment
increase previously approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The advisory panel also is recommending development of a more
precise system for compensating hospitals when they care for
Medicare patients who require more expensive than average
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Many members of Congress, concerned about the financial health
of hospitals and other health care providers back home, are
supporting legislation this year to increase Medicare payments.
Lawmakers, however, must balance that priority with political
pressure to add expensive new prescription drug benefits to the
health insurance program for the elderly and disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you look at where we are with our overall national
economy and the size of the (government) surplus, the fact of the
matter is as a society we can do all of these things,'' said
Richard J. Pollack, executive vice president of the American
Hospital Association.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals have been pressing hard for more Medicare money in
advertising and lobbying campaigns, and even in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Supreme Court declined to get involved in a
dispute between 181 hospitals and Medicare over the size of extra
payments hospitals have received for sicker patients, deferring to
a lower court ruling favoring the government.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital budget margins -- what is left for improvements, charity
work or profit after covering the basic costs of patient care --
have declined from 6 percent in 1997 to 2.7 percent in 1999,
according to new estimates by the commission.
</P>
<P>
   For Medicare patients alone, hospital budget margins fell to 6.5
percent in 1998 from 9.8 percent in 1997 -- reflecting the first
impact of payment curbs Congress enacted as part of a 1997 push to
balance the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals are just one group of health care providers clamoring
for more money from Medicare, however.
</P>
<P>
   Under lobbying pressure last year, lawmakers voted to put back
$16 billion cut from Medicare in 1997. But nursing homes, home
health care agencies, health maintenance organizations and others
continue to press for more.
</P>
<P>
   Wilensky stressed that while the advisory commission's latest
report did not evaluate other caregivers' concerns, Congress will
need to consider them along with hospital finances.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the Congress chooses to do another set of give-backs ...
they need to look at the other components as well,'' Wilensky said.

<HEADLINE> Putin Centralization Plan Approved  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- The lower house of parliament on Wednesday
strongly approved President Vladimir Putin's plan to strengthen
central government and rein in regional leaders -- moves he says are
necessary to help resuscitate the economy.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 of the Duma's 450 deputies approved each of the
plan's three bills on first reading, giving them the necessary
two-thirds to override rejection in the upper chamber, which will
consider the plan if it passes three readings in the lower house.
</P>
<P>
   One of the bills calls for changing the upper house, or the
Federation Council, from a chamber made up of governors and
regional legislative leaders to one of full-time, appointed
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The second and third bills would allow Putin to dismiss
governors found to have broken federal law and give governors the
power to dismiss lawbreaking mayors in their regions.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Russia's 89 regional governors have thrown their support
behind the plan. Analysts said some governors were trying to trade
their support for Kremlin concessions, while others were working
behind the scenes to organize resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's plan has been welcomed by many as a sensible effort to
end the chaos and lawlessness that have hampered economic revival.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need a strong, effective state, and the presidential bills
are aimed at that,'' said Boris Gryzlov, head of the pro-government
Unity group in the State Duma.
</P>
<P>
   But some liberal critics warned that giving the Kremlin the
power to dismiss elected governors could lead to authoritarian
rule. Some legislators, including former Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov, said the bills would require constitutional amendments to
be valid.
</P>
<P>
   During Wednesday's debate, Duma deputies across the political
spectrum spoke in support of the bills. The Communist Party voiced
some reservations, saying Putin's plan would weaken the Federation
Council.
</P>
<P>
   Business tycoon Boris Berezovsky was the only Duma member who
spoke strongly against the plan, arguing that it would give the
president too much power and undermine the fledgling democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no doubt about the need to strengthen the government,
but the president's efforts would lead to a global catastrophe,''
Berezovsky said. ''The bills are setting the scene for Russia's
ruin.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin downplayed the criticism from Berezovsky, who was a
powerful insider during Boris Yeltsin's years as president. ''It is
not bad that a point of view is expressed,'' Putin said during a
trip to Yaroslavl, just north of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has already divided Russia into seven administrative
zones, each to be supervised by a presidential representative. The
Putin administration said the previous administrative arrangement --
which put a Kremlin representative in each of the 89 regions -- was
cumbersome and ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the seven new representatives are generals with the
army, police or intelligence services -- underlining Putin's
promises to restore law and order. The seven zones coincide with
the command structure of the army and Interior Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Recover a Bit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean prices edged back up slightly
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, recovering from a big
rain-inspired selloff the previous day.
</P>
<P>
   While rain continued to fall in many Midwest growing regions,
market-watchers said the soggy weather had been factored into
prices for now.
</P>
<P>
   Soybean prices consolidated after Tuesday's plunge and also were
supported by a rise in soymeal, attributed to strong export demand
in global markets.
</P>
<P>
   Corn climbed back after dipping to 4{-month lows the previous
day, although forecasts for more rain kept the gains minimal.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat futures benefited from lower U.S. crop ratings and a small
improvement in overseas export markets.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for July delivery rose { cent to $2.74} a bushel; July
corn rose } cent to $2.25 a bushel; July oats were unchanged at
$1.13 a bushel; July soybeans rose { cent to $5.17{ a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Beef and pork futures advanced in trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   June live cattle rose .70 cent to 67.77 cents a pound; August
feeder cattle rose .45 cent to 84.77 cents a pound; June lean hogs

<HEADLINE> India's Nuke Program More Secretive  </HEADLINE>
By RAMOLA TALWAR BADAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOMBAY, India (AP) -- India's secret nuclear development program
has just become more secretive, raising concern among some
scientists about safety -- and leading others to suspect that India
is planning to ratchet up weapons production.
</P>
<P>
   A new government order allows India's foremost nuclear body, the
Bhabha Atomic Research Center -- known as BARC -- to effectively
watch over itself. The order eliminates the oversight of the
political appointees on the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board.
</P>
<P>
   The order is dated April 25 and signed by Rajagopalan
Chidambaram, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission. A copy of
the order was seen by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Titled ''Office Memorandum,'' it was meant for the eyes of only
two officials. It says it was issued ''with the approval of the
competent authority'' -- that is, the office of Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
   The order says the ''regulatory and safety functions at BARC ...
will henceforth be exercised through an Internal Safety Committee
structure to be constituted by the director (of) BARC.''
</P>
<P>
   The document had not been publicized in India by Wednesday. But
some regulators and scientists asked to comment spoke out against
it, saying it could lead to danger from unannounced accidents or
leaks and could contribute to weapons buildup in this volatile
region.
</P>
<P>
   Both India and its rival neighbor Pakistan conducted nuclear
weapons tests in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going in a very negative direction,'' said Adinarayana
Gopalakrishnan, chairman of the regulatory board from 1993-96.
''This is as if we've set the clock back 25 years and we're
standing where Russia stood -- totalitarian control and little
concern for the public.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Even during my days we had difficulty monitoring BARC
functions,'' he said. He added that the nuclear center ''had an
unwritten weapons function. This is just making it official.''
</P>
<P>
   A top nuclear scientist who spoke on condition of anonymity said
the new order is intended to maintain secrecy since weapons-related
activities could be scaled up.
</P>
<P>
   Suhas Sukhatme, current chairman of the regulatory board,
confirmed the existence of the order.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm in agreement with the order,'' he said by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   He said that when the board was set up, ''there was a fuzzy line
about what we could and could not oversee. The fuzziness is removed
and clarity has been established.''
</P>
<P>
   Sukhatme said he saw no contradiction in BARC overseeing itself.
''The public need be totally reassured that there is nothing shady
going on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts estimate India has enough plutonium to produce 85 to 90
nuclear weapons, and Pakistan has sufficient highly enriched
uranium for 40 nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Gopalakrishnan, the former regulatory board chairman, said the
need to develop more fissile material may have prompted the new
order.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very definite they plan to go full steam with
weaponization and more laboratories may need to come in ... and
they don't want someone to be snooping around,'' he said from the
southern city of Hyderabad.
</P>
<P>
   Senior scientists within the regulatory board were upset about
the reduction of its authority, saying they fear safety will be the
casualty.
</P>
<P>
   Buddhi Kota Subbarao, a retired naval engineer who worked on
India's nuclear submarine program, said the new order goes against
the concept of nuclear safety.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe and in the United States, regulatory bodies check
civilian nuclear plants as well as monitor the surroundings of
weapons facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ''The person executing cannot be the regulator,'' said Subbarao,
who has argued in court for more autonomy for the
government-appointed regulatory board. ''The concept of a regulator
is to check excesses.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1995 report Gopalakrishnan submitted to the government, 50
of some 132 safety lapses at nuclear facilities involved BARC.
Gopalakrishnan could not elaborate on the report since he is bound
by India's Official Secrets Act.
</P>
<P>
   Chidambaram, the man who signed the April order and a key
scientist behind India's nuclear weapons tests, did not answer
questions faxed to his office Monday. His office said no answer
could be expected before Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the order, India did not grant inspection rights to
international bodies because it has not signed the Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since we do not have inspection rights in India, this is not a
matter for us to get involved in,'' said David Kyd, a spokesman for
the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, Austria.

<HEADLINE> Woody Harrelson Praises Marijuana  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Woody Harrelson doesn't hide his illegal
habit -- in fact, he has been outspoken on the virtues of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   His latest move is to narrate ''Grass,'' a documentary opening
Friday in San Francisco that traces the evolution of anti-marijuana
laws and shows how, despite huge expenditures, marijuana use has
increased.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do smoke, but I don't go through all this trouble just
because I want to make my drug of choice legal,'' Harrelson said.
''It's about personal freedom. We should have the right in this
country to do what we want, if we don't hurt anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson, who recently starred in ''Play It to the Bone'' with
Antonio Banderas, said he has no movies in sight, but he's looking
forward to performing on stage in the fall in ''The Late Henry
Moss,'' written and directed by Sam Shepard. Sean Penn and Nick
Nolte are also cast in the San Francisco production.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not doing this for the money,'' he said. ''I'm a huge fan
of Sam Shepard.''

<HEADLINE> Tommy Lee Released from Jail  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. (AP) -- Rocker Tommy Lee has been released after
serving five days in the Los Angeles County Jail for violating
parole in a domestic violence case by drinking alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Malibu Superior Court Judge Lawrence Mira ordered Lee to return
to court for a progress report in September and warned him to stick
to the straight and narrow.
</P>
<P>
   ''(If you) do not commit to sobriety then you're going to come
back to this court and it'll be a very unhappy experience for
you,'' Mira said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's probation violation occurred as he and estranged wife
Pamela Anderson celebrated on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Five months later, after the couple broke up, the actress
reportedly called the district attorney's office and said Lee, the
former drummer for Motley Crue, had violated his probation by
drinking alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   The rock star was charged in February 1998 with spousal abuse,
child abuse and a firearms violation after Anderson called police
from her Malibu home and reported she had been assaulted during an
argument.
</P>
<P>
   Lee pleaded no contest to felony corporal injury to a spouse and
was sentenced to 180 days in jail and three years in state prison,
both of which were suspended, as well as 200 hours of community
service and time in a batterer treatment program.

<HEADLINE> Clinton May Share Defense Technology  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- Trying to calm fears of a nuclear arms
race that would leave Europe vulnerable, President Clinton promised
Wednesday to share any new missile defense technology with U.S.
allies, saying ''it would be unethical'' to keep it solely for
America's protection.
</P>
<P>
   Still, European leaders remained uneasy about the proposed
American system. Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres,
speaking for the European Union, declared, ''We have -- I'll say all
of us -- a main concern'' about the U.S. program.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing a sweep of foreign policy problems at a news
conference on his second day in Europe, Clinton also said there was
''a much greater sense of urgency'' in the Middle East peace
process after Israel's troop withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
''All the balls are up in the air,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Quickening the pace of Mideast diplomacy, Clinton will meet here
Thursday with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. He also touched
base by telephone Wednesday with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   The president spoke in the manicured gardens of the 18th century
Queluz Palace at the conclusion of an inconclusive meeting with
Guterres, who holds the current chairmanship of the 15-nation
European Commission, and EU Commission President Romano Prodi.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting failed to resolve trade disputes with Europe over
sales of American beef, bananas and genetically modified food and
tax breaks for U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
   There was no sense of dismay, though, as all sides sought to
emphasize areas of agreement, such as rebuilding the Balkans and
combatting AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in poor countries.
Clinton and National Security Adviser Sandy Berger went golfing
after the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Lisbon was the first stop on a week-long journey that will take
Clinton to Berlin and then to Moscow for a weekend summit with
Russian President Vladimir Putin. Clinton also will stop in Ukraine
on the way home Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite U.S. efforts to lower expectations for the meeting with
Putin, Clinton said that ''we might make more headway than most
people expect. I'm just not sure.'' But he said he would be
surprised if he and Putin bridged all their differences on missile
defenses and Russia's crackdown in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said later Clinton's optimism was about an
expected agreement for the United States and Russia to destroy 34
tons of military-grade plutonium on each side. It is enough
plutonium to make tens of thousands of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Russia strenuously opposes U.S. development of an anti-missile
system, arguing it would upset the strategic balance between
Washington and Moscow. Critics of the U.S. system say it will
prompt Russia and China to build up their nuclear arsenals, fuel
tensions with Moscow and separate the United States from Europe's
security.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has promised to announce a decision within months on
whether the United States will proceed with the program, now
estimated to cost $30 billion. His decision will follow a July test
flight of an interceptor rocket after mixed results in earlier
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hinted that the United States would be willing to share
its missile defense technology with Russia, America's Cold War
adversary.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've done a lot of information sharing already with the
Russians,'' he said. ''We have offered to do more and we would
continue to.'' He said it was inconceivable to develop the
technology for a missile shield against new threats and not make it
available to ''civilized nations'' that are in sync with the United
States on arms control.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it would be unethical not to do so,'' the president
said. ''That's always been my position and I think that is the
position of everyone in this administration.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Clinton refused to embrace the position of
Texas Gov. George Bush, the presumed Republican presidential
nominee, who says the U.S. shield should protect America's allies
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said ''there is a
difference'' between Clinton's and Bush's positions.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials were at a loss to describe what the
United States would do to help protect allies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think the ideas are formulated to the point that I can
articulate beyond the president's statement today, where he's
committed to sharing technology,'' Lockhart said. Similarly, Tony
Blinken, the National Security Council's senior director for
European affairs, said, ''I think it's premature to get into it.''

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Parliament Meets on Border  </HEADLINE>
By RODEINA KENAAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BINT JBEIL, Lebanon (AP) -- The Lebanese parliament met on
Israel's doorstep Wednesday -- sometimes in darkness as the
electricity went out -- and pledged $46.3 million to help rebuild
war-devastated south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The parliament's extraordinary session, held in Bint Jbeil less
than two miles from Israel's border, was the first signal the
government was moving to take control of the area.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the difficulties the region faces, part of the
parliamentary session was conducted in the dark because the
electricity failed and a backup generator malfunctioned.
</P>
<P>
   Bint Jbeil, like the rest of the former Israeli zone, was
largely cut off from the rest of Lebanon during the occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Israel provided electricity, water, telephones, hospitals and
jobs. At least for now, the humanitarian branch of Hezbollah said
it was stepping in to provide some of those services.
</P>
<P>
   Jihad al-Binaa, Arabic for Struggle for Reconstruction, has
distributed water to residents, sprayed insecticides in 35 villages
and has sent out veterinarians to check cattle, said Ibrahim
Ismail, an agricultural engineer who is the group's director.
</P>
<P>
   Another Hezbollah branch sent mobile clinics to outlying
villages. Hezbollah also took over the only hospital in Bint Jbeil,
and its doctors began performing operations and delivering babies.
</P>
<P>
   The first baby born after the end of occupation was a girl her
parents named ''Tahrir,'' Arabic for liberation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did not want to leave any shortages in health service,''
said Fouad Taher, who is running the hospital Israel renovated 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ismail, the agricultural engineer, estimates 1,500 homes were
destroyed in the occupation. Many more were damaged by fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The government has estimated the cost of repairing the damage at
$1 billion, and Ismail indicated the Jihad al-Binaa aid group
expects the government to handle the bulk of the rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Prime Minister Michel Murr said the Cabinet plans to
approve a first payment of $33 million to rebuild destroyed or
damaged houses. A sum of $3.3 million was allotted to restore
electricity within a week, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Murr also said the government will spend $10 million to provide
water to 70 percent of the area within a month, adding that rest
will be taken care of in three months. In the meantime, water is
being supplied by tanker trucks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri called on the government to offer
tax exemptions and to give compensation to residents to rebuild
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Bint Jbeil, the largest Shiite Muslim town in south Lebanon, saw
its population of 60,000 dwindle to 4,000 during the occupation,
which was marked by almost daily fighting by Lebanese guerrillas
against Israeli troops and their allied Lebanese militiamen.

<HEADLINE> Black U.S. Lawmakers Visit Cuba  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHEPARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Three members of the Congressional Black Caucus
began a five-day visit to Cuba on Wednesday to explore the prospect
of relaxing the United States' 38-year-old economic embargo against
the communist country.
</P>
<P>
   That possibility may have gained strength in the aftermath of
the Elian Gonzalez case and a recent House vote to give China
status as a normal trade partner, members said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Like no other time before, we are seeing different groups,
like some Republicans, farm interests, church groups and others
starting to push to end the embargo,'' said Rep. James Clyburn,
D-S.C., who is leading the delegation. ''Our country is ready to
re-examine our Cuba policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clyburn, along with Reps. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., and Bennie
Thompson, D-Miss., planned to meet with government ministers,
educators and business people and tour the city of Santiago de
Cuba, the island's center of Afro-Caribbean culture.
</P>
<P>
   While a total lifting of the embargo does not seem imminent, the
lawmakers said they would be satisfied if the House approves
legislation to allow American sales of food and medicine to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Both Thompson and Clyburn represent hard-pressed farmers looking
for new markets.
</P>
<P>
   During a meeting with Economics Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez,
the congressmen sought, and received, assurances that black farmers
would be not ignored in any trade agreements with American
producers.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the delegation strolled along the cobblestone streets of
Old Havana, near the capital's famous Malecon seawall.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe we ought to be pushing diplomacy with everybody,''
Thompson said. ''We should not be condemning them because they have
a different government than we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans and Cubans exchanged warm embraces and joked in the
early morning hours Wednesday after the delegation arrived,
underscoring the friendly relationship that traditionally has
existed between black American lawmakers and the island. This marks
the fifth visit by members of the black caucus in the last 18
months.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban authorities appreciate especially the support black
congressional members have shown during their battle to return
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to his father. Rodriguez repeated that
gratitude Wednesday when he met with caucus members around a large
oval table at the ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Clyburn said that representatives of the 38 black members in
Congress had planned this visit well before the Gonzalez case
focused American attention on U.S.-Cuban relations and before last
week's landmark vote to grant permanent, normal trade status to
China.
</P>
<P>
   Several farmers groups have visited the island in recent months
and are pushing members of Congress to dismantle or substantially
weaken the embargo imposed by President Kennedy in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Over the opposition of Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the
House will vote later this month on a provision in an agricultural
bill to license U.S. sales of food and medicine to Cuba as long as
they aren't subsidized by U.S. taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the embargo maintain it is necessary to punish
Fidel Castro's government and help foster internal opposition to
his 41-year rule.
</P>
<P>
   But Thompson said he doubted a few more years of the embargo
would succeed where the previous decades of choking off trade had
failed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think Castro is going anywhere,'' Thompson said. ''I
think the only people who are suffering (from the embargo) are the
seniors and the children.''
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Lucius Walker, executive director of Pastors for Peace, a
New York-based nonprofit church group which organized the
lawmakers' visit, said that if any silver lining could be seen from
the battle over 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, it is heightened
awareness of the Cuban embargo among Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez was found floating at sea Thanksgiving Day off the
Florida coast and was placed in the temporary custody of relatives
in Miami. They sought to keep the boy from returning to Cuba
despite the wishes of his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez. Now both
sides await a court ruling that will determine where the boy lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''As traumatic as it was (for) Elian and his family, the
positive is that more and more people are seeing the cruelty of the
blockade,'' Walker said. ''If we didn't have this blockade, the
Elian situation wouldn't have happened. And people are listening to
that message now.''

<HEADLINE> Greek Jews Wary of Backlash  </HEADLINE>
By BRIAN MURPHY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- The messages dripped of pure hate.
''Hitler was right,'' vandals wrote during the desecration last
week of the largest Jewish cemetery in Greece. A similar message
appeared on a Jewish community Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks are startling in a nation with no history of
widespread anti-Semitism and a strong distaste for Fascist-style
groups since the collapse of a military dictatorship in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   But Greece's small Jewish community is being targeted in the
backlash against a government plan to remove religious affiliations
from identity cards -- a proposal that has incensed the powerful
Greek Orthodox Church.
</P>
<P>
   Many opponents blame a vague ''conspiracy'' of Jews and European
Union bureaucrats for the ID changes. Church leaders have declared
a ''relentless struggle'' to overturn the plan, which they see as a
first step toward a possible separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ask our politicians: Are they listening to the Greek
Orthodox people or the Jewish lobby?'' protest leader Panayiotis
Lyras said at a march Wednesday of about 2,500 people opposed to
the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those who lay a hand on Orthodoxy will pay for it. There are
battles ahead,'' he said as the marchers headed toward parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Most mainstream clerics have been careful to distance themselves
from any calls for violence. Yet cliques of religious fringe groups
and ultra-nationalists have drawn considerable strength from the
church-fostered controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The cemetery attack -- Nazi slogans and symbols painted on
buildings and more than 90 graves last Friday -- was the third
against Jews or Jewish sites in Greece in a month.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jewish plot behind the IDs,'' said a headline in the Orthodox
Press, a weekly newspaper thought to reflect church thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the crusaders fighting the ID changes are trying to
rally support with calls similar to the slogan of the 1967-74
junta: ''Greece for Christian Greeks.''
</P>
<P>
   A parliament member, Giorgos Karatzaferis, has made an issue of
whether a respected colleague, Miltiades Evert, wore a yarmulke
while accepting an award for his father's role in saving Jews
during the Nazi occupation of Greece. Only about 5,000 Jews remain
from a prewar population of more than 80,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who is, or who is not with the Jews?'' said Karatzaferis, who
has used his Athens television station as a soapbox to attack the
ID changes. ''Who conspires and who does not conspire against our
country?''
</P>
<P>
   Jewish leaders note there are no signs of an organized
ultra-nationalist political movement such as Austria's Freedom
Party. But there are clear worries of a backlash against anyone not
Greek Orthodox, who comprise more than 97 percent of the
population.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's xenophobia,'' said Jean Cohen, a Greek Jewish journalist
and commentator. ''There is a difference between being anti-Semitic
and xenophobic ... Xenophobic means they are against anyone who is
not Greek Orthodox.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Wednesday, the head of the Greek Orthodox
Church, Archbishop Christodoulos, used descriptions that could be
viewed as incompatible with the secular and multicultural strivings
of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Greek church and people are one and the same,'' he said.
''Greeks are Christian Orthodox.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he later added, Jews ''have no reason to be scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Andreas Andreanopoulos, a commentator writing in the daily
Exousia newspaper, blamed Greek Orthodox leaders for ''cultivating
a dangerous spirit of inquisitorial mania and fanaticism.''
</P>
<P>
   This atmosphere can turn suddenly against minorities, some
scholars say.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anytime you have ethnic identity and religion intertwined, as
in the case of the Greek Orthodox Church, there is the potential
for very negative attitudes toward anyone considered an enemy of
their perception of the world,'' said Doug Bandow, an analyst
specializing in religion and politics at the Cato Institute in
Washington.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sues To Block Gas Pump Deal  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department filed suit Wednesday to
block a deal it said would eliminate competition in the sale of
pumps used in 90 percent of U.S. gas stations to transfer gasoline
from underground tanks to surface dispensers.
</P>
<P>
   The civil antitrust suit, filed in U.S. District Court in
Madison, Wis., would block a proposed joint venture between
Franklin Electric Co. Inc. and United Dominion Industries Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would combine the assets of Franklin Electric's
subsidiary FE Petro and the petroleum related assets of United
Dominion's subsidiary, The Marley Co.
</P>
<P>
   The two subsidiaries now compete with each other and are the
only two companies that produce and sell submersible turbine pumps
in this country. The government said Marley's ''Red Jacket''
turbine pumps have 60 percent of the market, compared with 40
percent for FE Petro's pumps. The government said FE Petro
introduced new technology in the 1990s and had taken market share
from Marley.
</P>
<P>
   The joint venture would be 75 percent owned by Franklin Electric
and 25 percent by Marley.
</P>
<P>
   ''This proposed joint venture would create a monopoly in the
sale of submersible turbine pumps in the United States, resulting
in higher prices, less innovation and lower quality service for
customers,'' Assistant Attorney General Joel I. Klein said. ''We
brought this suit to preserve the benefits of competition for the
owners and operators of gasoline service stations that require
these pumps to operate their businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Headquartered in Bluffton, Ind., Franklin Electric reported 1999
sales of $293.2 million. Its FE Petro subsidiary produces
submersible turbine pumps at a plant in McFarland, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   A wholly owned subsidiary of United Dominion Industries Limited,
United Dominion is headquartered in Charlotte, N.C. United Dominion
Industries Limited is a Canadian corporation with sales of $2.15
billion in 1999. Its Marley subsidiary produces the pumps at a
plant in Davenport, Iowa.

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen will travel to
Brussels, Belgium, next week to attend NATO meetings and then fly
to Moscow for talks with his Russian counterpart, Gen. Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the trip Wednesday, the Pentagon said Cohen also
will attend meetings in Sweden and Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
   No details were provided, but Cohen is expected to use the
Moscow talks with Sergeyev to pursue some of the arms control and
security issues that President Clinton intends to discuss with
President Vladimir Putin this weekend. Chief among those are the
U.S. push to amend the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty to permit
the Pentagon to deploy a network of defenses to defend all 50
states against long-range missiles.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amnesty International on Wednesday opened a
campaign aimed at ending the diamond trade from rebel-held areas of
Sierra Leone, asking that all diamonds sold in the world be
identified by the country they came from.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 people protested in front the State Department,
chanting ''No justice, No diamonds'' and carrying signs that read
''Sierra Leone is Dying for Diamonds.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Today, diamond buyers across the United States may be saying
'I love you' with a diamond that has paid for a bloody decade of
rape, amputations and enslavement -- a diamond mined from
rebel-controlled areas of Sierra Leone,'' William F. Schulz,
executive director of the U.S. chapter of the human rights group
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   He said that governments as well as anyone who buys or sells
diamonds ''should all support a system that separates legitimate
diamonds from those that fund human rights violations.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Viagra Not Bad for Heart  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Viagra caused no harmful changes in blood flow in men
with
severe heart disease, a study financed by the drug's maker found.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The study in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine added to
evidence that Viagra alone does not increase the risk of heart
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Many men who are impotent also have heart disease, because the
risk factors are often the same: old age, diabetes, high blood
pressure and high cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania measured blood
flow inside the coronary arteries of 14 men with severe narrowing
of at least one artery. They found no adverse cardiovascular
effects and a slight improvement in coronary blood flow reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra did lower the men's blood pressure slightly, as
previously reported.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra has been linked to an increased number of heart attack
deaths, mostly in patients who use it while taking nitrates,
because the combination can lead to a sudden, severe drop in blood
pressure. Sex also can increase the risk of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   The study was led by Dr. Howard Herrmann, of the University of
Pennsylvania. It was supported by a grant from Pfizer, which makes
Viagra.

<HEADLINE> Hormone Helps Crohn Disease Patients  </HEADLINE>
By KATHARINE WEBSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   Human growth hormone combined with a high-protein diet
significantly eased the symptoms of Crohn's disease in
three-quarters of patients with moderate to severe cases, a study
found.
</P>
<P>
   Crohn's affects the digestive tract, causing persistent
diarrhea, abdominal pain, bleeding and breakdown of the intestinal
wall. About half of all Crohn's patients require surgery at some
point to remove intestinal obstructions or repair holes in the
bowel. There is no known cure, though drugs can ease symptoms in
some patients.
</P>
<P>
   The study in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine found
that 11 of 19 adults treated with growth hormone while on a
high-protein diet went into remission. Three others saw significant
improvement. Eighteen patients taking a dummy drug while on a
high-protein diet saw no significant improvement.
</P>
<P>
   The study was supported by grants from Eli Lilly and the
Genentech Foundation for Growth and Development, a nonprofit that
gets funding from Genentech Inc. Both pharmaceutical companies make
growth hormone.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 1 million Americans suffer from Crohn's disease,
according to the Crohn's &AMP; Colitis Foundation of America. Up to
120,000 people are diagnosed with moderate to severe disease each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Several anti-inflammatory and immune-suppressing drugs can send
the disease into remission but do not prevent long-term relapse.
Others prevent relapse in some patients but do not make the disease
go into remission.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the new study, Dr. Alfred Slonim of North Shore
University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., said growth hormone causes
few harmful side effects in children and adolescents who take it
for years.
</P>
<P>
   If further studies find it is effective for long-term treatment
of Crohn's, it may prove safer than current remedies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of Crohn's is unknown, but one theory is that
infections or hereditary factors weaken the intestinal wall, making
it more susceptible to inflammation and tissue breakdown when it
comes in contact with disease-causing organisms. An exaggerated
immune response may also play a role.
</P>
<P>
   Slonim's approach was based on earlier research that showed
growth hormone improved intestinal repair in patients who had part
of their bowels surgically removed. Slonim theorized that growth
hormone may rebuild and strengthen the intestinal wall. A
high-protein diet provides the building blocks for tissue repair.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 14 patients who improved, virtually all said their
abdominal pain disappeared. They also reported less diarrhea. Side
effects were mild. Ten patients reported some swelling and five had
headaches.
</P>
<P>
   The study is provocative, but limited because of its small size,
Dr. Balfour Sartor of the University of North Carolina wrote in an
accompanying editorial.
</P>
<P>
   Growth hormone appeared almost as effective as the
anti-inflammatory drug infliximab, the only medication approved
specifically for Crohn's disease, Sartor said. However, Slonim's
group did not perform exams to see whether the intestinal tissue
was healthier.
</P>
<P>
   Another study in Thursday's journal found that the
anti-inflammatory drug methotrexate can keep severe symptoms at bay
in Crohn's patients who have previously responded well to that
medication.
</P>
<P>
   A 1995 study led by Dr. Brian Feagan of the John P. Roberts
Research Institute in London, Ontario, found that 39 percent of
Crohn's patients went into remission when treated with 25 grams per
week of methotrexate.
</P>
<P>
   Feagan's latest study found that patients who continued to take
15 grams per week of methotrexate were less likely to relapse: 65
percent remained in remission, compared to 39 percent of patients
who got a dummy medication.

<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A former state budget director who worked in
the Cuomo administration was named Wednesday to a new economic
development position at the State University of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The SUNY Board of Trustees unanimously approved the appointment
of R. Wayne Diesel as the university system's vice chancellor for

<HEADLINE> Air Force: Gay Doctor Should Pay Up  </HEADLINE>
By KIM CURTIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- In exchange for a four-year commitment to
the Air Force, Dr. John Hensala got top-flight medical training at
Northwestern University and Yale, unburdened by the costs of
tuition and books.
</P>
<P>
   Then, seven months before the psychiatrist was to report for
full-time military duty, he announced to his superiors that he is
gay.
</P>
<P>
   He was promptly discharged and billed $70,000 for the cost of
his education.
</P>
<P>
   The military has made similar demands of dozens of other gays
who have been ousted. But Hensala is challenging the demand for
reimbursement in court, in what could be the first such lawsuit
against the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force said Hensala deliberately timed his announcement
to get out of his military obligation.
</P>
<P>
   But Hensala, 35, said he did not know he was gay when he signed
up.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is largely on principle,'' Hensala said in an interview
in his apartment in San Francisco's largely gay Castro District.
''I would be able to pay back the funds eventually. But an employer
who fires someone just because they're gay ... I don't think it's
the right of the employer to say, 'You owe us this money.'''
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, before the military's ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy,
Hensala entered the Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship
Program. In exchange for tuition, Hensala served 20 weeks of active
duty over four years.
</P>
<P>
   He earned a medical degree at Northwestern University. The Air
Force agreed to defer his active duty service during his three-year
residency at Yale, and then put it off again while he took a
two-year fellowship in child psychiatry at the University of
California at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in 1994, the Air Force told him that his four years of
active duty would have to begin the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, after he hired a lawyer, Hensala announced that he
is gay.
</P>
<P>
   ''In light of recent policy changes concerning homosexuality ...
I have decided that I should inform you, prior to beginning active
duty service, that I am gay,'' his letter to his superiors said.
''I do not believe this will affect my ability to serve in the Air
Force as a child psychiatrist.''
</P>
<P>
   He later submitted a list of gay rights groups with which he was
involved and a list of people who could confirm his homosexuality.
He then called his adviser at Scott Air Force Base near St. Louis
and asked about housing there for his boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force launched an investigation. It did not dispute that
Hensala is gay, but an investigating officer reported: ''There is
very strong evidence that Capt. Hensala made the homosexual
statement, hoping to trigger separation and avoid his active duty
commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Hensala, however, said his coming out happened ''very gradually,
very reluctantly.'' In 1988, he told his parents and a few close
friends.
</P>
<P>
   But he said eventually he realized he could not tell his
patients to live their lives with integrity if he couldn't do it.
''Being dishonest with co-workers flies in the face of who I was
trying to be as a human being,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Hensala received an honorable discharge under the
''don't ask, don't tell'' policy and was ordered to reimburse the
government $68,536.50 for tuition, $1,902.31 for books, $150 for
board, $285 for equipment rental and $555.72 for supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Hensala sued in federal court May 18.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force spokesman Maj. Chet Curtis said about 100 Air Force
members who graduated from its medical program were discharged
between January 1996 and July 1999 for being gay. All have been
asked to repay the money and most are doing so, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stacey Sobel, legal director for the Servicemembers Legal
Defense Network, said many ousted gays pay back the money for fear
of receiving a bad credit rating or because they do not realize
they can fight it.
</P>
<P>
   She said Hensala's is the first lawsuit she knows of by any
ousted gay service member against reimbursing the government for
education costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force has until July 17 to respond to Hensala's lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   During the nearly two-year Air Force investigation, Hensala
started a successful private practice and began working with gays.
</P>
<P>
   Hensala, who still wears his dark brown hair in a short,
military-style cut, said he would rejoin the Air Force tomorrow if
the service wanted him.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were a lot of elements I really liked,'' he said. ''I
wanted to serve, but I didn't feel I could abide by a policy that
was bad for my own mental health.''

<HEADLINE> Inmate advocate barred from state prisons  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- An inmate advocate has been barred from
state prisons for what administrators contend was her role in
fomenting unrest among prisoners in late 1999.
</P>
<P>
   State Corrections Commissioner Glenn Goord wrote Alice Green on
May 9 saying she was ''correct'' to surmise that she and her staff
at the Albany-based Center for Law &AMP; Justice ''are being denied
access'' to state prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Green said she has been unable to get into a state prison since
last year. Scheduled visits since then seemed to fall through at
the last second or invitations from prison groups were rescinded,
Green complained. She said Wednesday that Goord's letter was in
response to a month's worth of daily calls to the commissioner's
office seeking to determine if prisons were indeed off-limits to
her and others in her group.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am really disturbed about it,'' she said Wednesday. ''It
affects the work that we do. I have been working in the prisons for
a little over 20 years and never had any incidents, never did
anything wrong. It is hurting the families of prisoners and
prisoners.''
</P>
<P>
   Goord said he considers Green and others in her group a ''clear
threat to the safety and security of correctional employees and
inmates.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Goord charged that Green's group encouraged
inmates to strike on or around Jan. 1, 2000, to protest state
parole policies, prison labor issues and other grievances prisoners
have against the way state prisons are run.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thanks to the professionalism, vigilance and dedication of
department employees, the action was averted, albeit at a cost to
the taxpayers of millions of dollars,'' Goord said.
</P>
<P>
   The state mobilized all 1,000 members of its SWAT-like emergency
response teams and stationed them near prisons throughout the state
to deal with possible strikes. They were never called into
facilities to quell any violence or other disturbances.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors began to circulate widely as 1999 came to a close about a
planned strike by some inmates to coincide with problems facilities
might experience due to the Y2K computer bug.
</P>
<P>
   No such computer problems occurred, nor did inmate strikes come
off, though the Sing Sing and Green Haven prisons were locked down
prior to Jan. 1 because of weapons and other problems.
</P>
<P>
   Green said it is ''totally ridiculous'' that she agitated in
favor of an inmate strike, though she acknowledges being
sympathetic to prison complaints about parole and prison labor.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're a prisoner rights advocacy group,'' Green said. ''But I
in no way did anything inside the prison or outside the prison to
encourage it (the strike).''
</P>
<P>
   Goord did not say how long Green would be banned from prisons,
but Green said she assumed it will go on for as long as he is
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Prison system spokesman James Flateau said Green is the only
person currently barred from New York prisons as a possible
security risk to inmates and staff.
</P>
<P>
   New York law gives the state's prison commissioner wide
discretion to decide who and who does not get to visit facilities.

<HEADLINE> Remains Found in Czar Killing Site  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Archeologists discovered two sets of human remains
at the site where communists gunned down Russia's last czar and his
family, but the corpses were unlikely to be those of two missing
royal children, historians said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Archeologists were excavating the site in Yekaterinburg, a city
900 miles east of Moscow, ahead of construction work on a memorial
cathedral that is to begin next month. They were searching for the
basement room of a demolished house in which Czar Nicholas II and
his family were assassinated in 1918.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the royal bodies were exhumed in 1991 from a mine shaft
outside the city, and reburied in St. Petersburg in 1998. But
diggers never found the skeletons of two royal children -- the heir,
Alexei, and a sister, either Maria or Anastasia.
</P>
<P>
   The remains found Tuesday evening were in decayed coffins near
the house, said Alexander Blokhin, head of the Discovery
Foundation, a local historical society. But preliminary evidence
suggested the bones were from a village cemetery dating to the 17th
century, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''These bones have no relation to the events of 1918,'' Blokhin
said by telephone from Yekaterinburg, located at the foot of the
Ural Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The archeologists, assisted by volunteers from the Orthodox
Church, had been searching for the basement Tuesday, over which
they hoped to build the cathedral's altar.
</P>
<P>
   Historians say Bolshevik revolutionary guards lined up and shot
the czar, his wife, Alexandra, their five children and several
servants in the small basement room. They then loaded the bodies
onto a truck and disposed of them, first in a mine shaft, then in a
shallow forest grave.
</P>
<P>
   The house was demolished in the 1970s on orders from former
President Boris Yeltsin, who was then the region's party chief.
Soviet authorities at the time worried the building might become a
pilgrimage site.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Orthodox Church is considering canonizing the
family.

<HEADLINE> FCC Adopts Phone Bill Changes  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- All telephone customers are expected to see
savings on their July long-distance bills under a dramatic overhaul
devised by the industry and adopted by the Federal Communications
Commission Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The commission cut by $3.2 billion the ''access fees'' that
local phone companies charge long-distance carriers to connect
calls -- costs that are typically assessed to consumers.
Long-distance companies have pledged to pass on the savings,
meaning their customers should see lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers that make few or no long-distance calls would see the
most immediate benefits -- with their bills dropping $3 to $4 a
month. Moderate and heavy users stand to gain from falling
long-distance rates or price wars that the new plan may trigger,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to affect everyone differently, but overall,
everyone is going to benefit from this plan,'' said FCC Chairman
William Kennard.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers should begin seeing the changes in their July
statements.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators have sliced access charges by several billion dollars
over the past few years to better reflect local phone companies'
connection costs -- but Wednesday's reduction is the most dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC's action implements an industry proposal offered by
long-distance carriers AT&AMP;T and Sprint and major local phone
companies Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, GTE and SBC Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials said the plan is a major step in moving the
long-distance business toward the trend of flat-rate -- rather than
per-minute -- pricing. That's something that wireless carriers and
Internet providers that offer phone service over their data lines
have already latched onto.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's probably the trend of the future,'' said John Nakahata,
spokesman for the industry coalition. ''This will allow those types
of plans to proliferate.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gene Kimmelman of Consumers Union said the public will
only realize the benefits ''if long-distance companies deliver on
their promise to pass through the savings with rate reductions.''
</P>
<P>
   There is practically no way of measuring whether this is
happening or not, he warned.
</P>
<P>
   Kimmelman did note that the plan offers benefits for those who
make few or no long-distance calls -- long a source of concern for
consumer advocates.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Wednesday's action, AT&AMP;T pledged to eliminate a $3
monthly charge for residential customers on AT&AMP;T's most basic
calling plan, since some consumers make calls totaling less than
that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Under AT&AMP;T's basic rate schedule, a consumer that makes 10
minutes of calls a month would save $2.52 a month and more than $30
a year. A person who makes no calls would save $4.71 and more than
$56 a year, the commission said. More than 41 percent of
long-distance users make 10 minutes or less in calls each month.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also folds together and reduces two flat-rate charges
now on monthly bills. One, the subscriber line charge, covers the
cost of the phone line from the local phone company into the home
and is capped at $3.50 a month. A second pays for long-distance
companies' use of the local phone network. It now averages about
$1.50 per month.
</P>
<P>
   These two costs will be consolidated and reduced to $4.35. It
would rise to $5 next July. The commission would then study the
cost to see whether it should be raised further.
</P>
<P>
   A portion of the access fees that long-distance companies
currently pay local phone companies goes toward keeping phone
service affordable for low-income people and those in high-cost
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of contributing to this $650 million fund indirectly,
consumers would see the monthly charge for universal service
assessed by their long-distance carrier spelled out as a separate
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers will also see a separate fee from their local phone
company, averaging about 36 cents, also used to keep phone service
affordable.
</P>
<P>
   These moves fit into the goal outlined by a 1996
telecommunications law of making subsidies explicit and clear to
consumers.

<HEADLINE> Killer, killer's mother plead for his life in murder trial  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOMS RIVER, N.J. (AP) -- A killer who ignored his victim's pleas
for mercy now wants a judge to show some.
</P>
<P>
   Derek LeCompte, 20, who stabbed a thrift shop owner to death
during a robbery, asked Superior Court Judge Edward J. Turnbach on
Wednesday to spare him the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm asking you to allow me to live,'' LeCompte said.
</P>
<P>
   The killer's mother, lawyers and former principal also urged
Turnbach to have mercy on LeCompte, calling the troubled
high-school dropout a victim of neglect and abuse who doesn't
deserve to die.
</P>
<P>
   LeCompte faces either the death penalty or life in prison for
the May 4, 1999, killing of Linda Thomas, 42, of Lacey Township.
Thomas, owner of The Garage Depot in Toms River, was stabbed more
than 40 times by LeCompte and then left to die as he gathered up
cash and stereo equipment from the store and packed them into her
car.
</P>
<P>
   The killing was captured on videotape by a store surveillance
camera. LeCompte removed it from the videocassette recorder in the
store and threw it out in an apartment complex Dumpster, along with
his bloodied clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The manager of the apartment found the items and contacted
authorities. LeCompte, who was 19 at the time, surrendered a day
later and admitted to the killing.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, LeCompte's mother took the stand, describing her
son as a smart boy who played trombone and belonged to a Young
Astronauts club. Under questioning by defense attorney Robert
Konzelmann, she said the boy witnessed alcoholism and domestic
violence as she took one lover after another into their
trailer-park home.
</P>
<P>
   At 15{, he moved out, first taking up residence in a motel
frequented by crack users and later living out of a car that didn't
run. The two saw each other only once between then and his arrest
for the murder, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Please don't take him away,'' Denise LeCompte told Turnbach,
tears streaming down her cheeks. ''Don't give him the death
penalty. I don't want him to die. My children are all I have
left.''
</P>
<P>
   LeCompte took the stand to read a statement but was not
questioned by his lawyer or the prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Thomas, 37, the victim's husband, left the courtroom
beforehand because he didn't want to hear LeCompte, who apologized
for killing Thomas and said he would turn back time if he could.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Thomas returned moments later to address the court,
standing before Turnbach as Executive Assistant Ocean County
Prosecutor John J. Mercun stood next to him, holding a framed color
photograph of a smiling Linda Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   He told the judge the murder of ''my angel, Linda'' broke his
heart and irrevocably damaged the couple's daughters, Melanie, 17,
and Heather, 12.
</P>
<P>
   ''People say it's better to have lived and loved then not to
have loved at all? They don't know Linda,'' said Douglas Thomas,
who closed the thrift shop after the killing because he couldn't
stand the memory.
</P>
<P>
   Mercun urged Turnbach to condemn LeCompte. He called the killing
premeditated and vicious, citing testimony that LeCompte wore an
extra set of clothing to the store because he knew he would be
bloodied by the time he left.
</P>
<P>
   He killed Thomas so she couldn't testify against him and he even
tried to do away with the ''silent witness'' -- the videotape --
before leaving the store, Mercun said.
</P>
<P>
   ''As she begged and pleaded for her life, he stood over her,
looking into her eyes, with a knife poised over her,'' Mercun said,
his voice rising. ''He rendered his decision 42 times. 'No witness,
no witness, no witness,''' Mercun said, simultaneously thrusting
his hand downward in a stabbing motion, mimicking LeCompte's
killing blows.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he's worthy of death, your honor,'' he told Turnbach.
</P>
<P>
   Turnbach, who must decide whether the aggravating factors
outweigh the mitigating ones, said he would pronounce his sentence
at 9:30 a.m. Thursday. If he spares LeCompte, the killer would get
63 years and nine months in prison and have to serve 85 percent of
it.

<HEADLINE> Official: No Jerusalem Deal Soon  </HEADLINE>
By SARI BASHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A Palestinian official said Wednesday that
Israel has offered to withdraw from more than 90 percent of the
West Bank as part of a peace treaty, but an Israeli official said
that deal would not resolve the status of contested Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The two spoke on the eve of a summit between Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and President Clinton designed to push forward
negotiations over the treaty. The meeting Thursday is in Lisbon,
Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   A Palestinian official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed earlier comments by Israeli Interior Minister Natan
Sharansky that Israel has offered to return more than 90 percent of
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The official said the Palestinians rejected the proposal because
it fell short of demands that Israel give up the entire West Bank
and Gaza Strip, areas captured in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
   A close Barak aide, meanwhile, said that the peace treaty being
drafted by Israel and the Palestinians would not resolve the status
of Jerusalem, claimed by both sides as their capital. Jerusalem
Affairs Minister Haim Ramon said it would take a few years to
resolve the thorny issue, and that in the meantime, traditionally
Arab east Jerusalem would remain under total Israeli sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed reports that Israel had agreed to Palestinian
municipal autonomy for Arab neighborhoods in the eastern sector but
said there had been some progress in deciding how much land Israel
would return to the Palestinians for their future state.
</P>
<P>
   Barak was cautious about the prospects for an outline for the
treaty, already months overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will see in the coming months if there is a real desire on
the other side to make an agreement and end the conflict,'' Barak
said at a lookout that was the site of 1948 battles over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   He rescheduled his meeting with Clinton, originally planned for
Thursday evening in Berlin, to Thursday morning in Lisbon so that
he could return home in time to participate in a celebration
marking Israel's 1967 capture of east Jerusalem. Clinton and Barak
are to discuss prospects for reaching a treaty outline.
</P>
<P>
   If progress is made in the talks, the possibility of a summit
between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Barak and Clinton has
been raised.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat met U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk in Gaza for
almost two hours and asked for U.S. help with the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am sorry to say that in the last round of negotiations,
there were many obstacles in all directions,'' Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat aide Nabil Abourdeneh said Arafat would meet negotiators
late Wednesday to decide when informal peace talks, originally
scheduled for Wednesday evening, would resume.
</P>
<P>
   The talks are being moved from Sweden to an undisclosed location
in the Middle East. An Israeli official said they would restart
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting unnamed Palestinian sources, Israel Radio said that in
the last round of talks, Israel offered the Palestinians a deal in
which it would annex 15 percent of the West Bank, including areas
in the Jordan valley, lease 10 percent of the West Bank containing
major Jewish settlements for 99 years, and give the Palestinians 75
percent for a future state. The report said Arafat rejected the
offer.

<HEADLINE> Many Jobless After Shahtoosh Ban  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- A court order banning the manufacture of
a soft wool derived from the endangered Tibetan antelope has left
nearly 20,000 workers jobless in Kashmir, a newspaper report said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The government was planning to revive handicraft, handloom and
silk industries in Kashmir to rehabilitate the jobless workers,
Textile Minister Kashi Ram Rana said Tuesday in Srinagar, the
capital of Jammu-Kashmir state, according to The Statesman.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Kashmir have suffered since 1989 because of a
civil war by Islamic militants that has discouraged tourism and
prevented them from selling handicrafts.
</P>
<P>
   Shahtoosh shawls, which cost $2,000-$15,000 apiece, are so fine
that even a large one can be pulled through a wedding ring.
</P>
<P>
   Kashmir was the only place where trading in the soft wool was
permitted, until the court passed the order earlier this month on a
suit filed by the Wildlife Protection Society of India.
</P>
<P>
   Tibetan antelope, called chirus, are protected by Indian law.
But Jammu-Kashmir state was exempt because of the special status
accorded to the state when it acceded to India in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildlife Protection Society said the Kashmir exemption has
been the biggest hurdle to rescuing the chirus, which have dwindled
from 1 million a half century ago to 75,000 today.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say chirus are slaughtered by the thousands in
the Tibetan plateau in China. Their hides are taken to Kashmir,
where the fiber is woven into shawls and scarves by master weavers.
The products eventually make their way to clandestine world
markets.
</P>
<P>
   India is a signatory to the United Nations Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species, which prohibits the
shahtoosh trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Jammu and Kashmir High Court said earlier this month that
the state must implement all international agreements signed by
India.

<HEADLINE> Mo. Primary Splitting GOP  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eyeing an open seat in the House, top
Republicans are wading forcefully into a contested primary as the
party picks a candidate to succeed retiring Democratic Rep. Pat
Danner of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Dennis Hastert intends to campaign for Sam Graves, a
state senator and one of five hopefuls in the primary race,
according to GOP sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   That will come as a disappointment to Teresa Loar, a member of
the Kansas City Council and another of the hopefuls. ''I haven't
heard from them, (party leaders) but I've heard from a number of
sources that they prefer a white conservative male to a moderate
female,'' Ms. Loar said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   She said she had tried to reach Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia, head
of the GOP campaign committee, by phone, ''but nobody seems to be
returning my call.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Wilkinson, a spokesman for the House GOP campaign committee,
said top officials there had spoken with Ms. Loar. He said the
committee plans no formal endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Danner, serving her fourth term, announced unexpectedly last
week she would retire. The 66-year-old lawmaker had disclosed
earlier this year she was undergoing treatment for breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Because her withdrawal occurred after the filing period had
closed for candidates, state officials reopened the race to
newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   Among those jumping in was the congresswoman's son, former state
Sen. Steve Danner, one of four Democratic contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Erik Smith, a spokesman for the House Democratic committee, said
party officials will remain neutral in the race to choose a
candidate. But several Democrats, speaking privately, said the
party hierarchy views Danner as the best chance to keep the seat
from falling into GOP hands.
</P>
<P>
   ''A contested primary in this district is clearly going to hurt
any chance they thought they had of winning the seat,'' Smith said
of the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson countered, ''It's a district that (GOP presidential
contender George W.) Bush will carry that we should win.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are defending a narrow House majority in the fall
elections, and Danner is only the eighth Democrat to retire,
compared with 23 GOP lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain is back on the air in New Hampshire, where his
presidential bid soared, this time using his political clout to
campaign for other Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In an ad for Rep. Charles Bass, R-N.H., McCain notes the many
months he spent campaigning for president in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''I made a lot of friends here in New Hampshire, people who are
independent and not afraid to stand up for the things they believe
in -- like Charlie Bass,'' McCain says. ''Charlie's done a good job
in Congress, and most important to me, he's not afraid of straight
talk.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, McCain also taped a spot for Rep. Tom Campbell,
R-Calif., running for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm enjoying it,'' said the Arizona senator, who taped many
ads of his own during his failed presidential run.
</P>
<P>
   A McCain ad for Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., who is fighting
one of the tightest Senate races in the nation, is on the air now.
McCain also has taped a spot for Republican Jim Cunneen, who is
running for Campbell's spot in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Sending a fund-raising solicitation to a not-so-receptive group
is an occupational hazard in the days of multimillion dollar
campaigns. And Rick Lazio's newly hatched Senate campaign in New
York has quickly fallen prey.
</P>
<P>
   ''The exciting Kick-Off Reception'' in New York City is set for
June 27, according to a memo. ''There are four levels of
commitment,'' from members, who agree to raise $10,000, to general
chairs who commit to raise $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the recipients of the memo included Emily's
List, an organization devoted to electing Democratic women
candidates who favor abortion rights, and which is supporting first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton against Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Malcolm, the organization's president, responded tartly.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, I cannot attend, would not like my name listed
on the invitation, and will not raise any money for Mr. Lazio,''
she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   She went on to say that Lazio ''is not pro-choice ... is not a
Democrat ... is not a woman.''

<HEADLINE> Argentine Workers Protest Program  </HEADLINE>
By KEVIN GRAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Thousands of workers rallied
Wednesday against the International Monetary Fund and a government
plan of taxes and spending cuts intended to re-ignite Argentina's
stagnant economy.
</P>
<P>
   The protest led by two union groups was timed for the arrival of
an IMF delegation consulting on the government's economic recovery
program.
</P>
<P>
   Many government workers joined in the rally, abandoning their
desks at midday to join the thousands of protesters hoisting union
banners and waving Argentine flags, as they marched through
downtown Buenos Aires to a leafy plaza fronting Argentina's
Government House.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are capable of defeating the financial dictatorship,''
shouted labor leader Hugo Moyano, referring to international
financial organizations. Labor leaders took turns addressing the
crowd, condemning the economics of a ''savage capitalism'' before
Moyano announced plans for national strike June 9.
</P>
<P>
   The government plan ''has produced a heavy tax burden that has
only brought misery,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   President Fernando De la Rua on Monday announced a new round of
spending cuts to resuscitate South America's second-largest
economy. He called for sharp cuts in state salaries and state
pensions to trim the $7.1 billion deficit by $2.5 billion this
year, as required by law.
</P>
<P>
   ''These measures aren't against anyone, but instead are for the
better for everyone,'' De la Rua told reporters Wednesday. ''They
are to help create jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Argentina's national joblessness rate has been hovering at 14
percent, and the rate is even higher in the country's cash-strapped
interior.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Teresa Basilio and a fellow group of university professors
joined the march, complaining the cuts would compromise public
education.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government has take several steps but there has been no
economic reactivation,'' she said. ''To the contrary, we are still
stuck. All these economic adjustments are being made on the backs
of the worker.''
</P>
<P>
   Adherence to the deficit-reduction program is in part to help
Argentina maintain access to standby funds from the IMF, if
necessary. Shortly after taking office in December, De la Rua
pushed through an unpopular tax hike and labor reform which helped
Argentina secure a $7.4 billion standby loan.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual move, members of Argentina's Roman Catholic Church
have offered support for the march, as have at least a dozen
congressmen from De La Rua's Alliance party.

<HEADLINE> Feds: 87 Percent Conviction Rate  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eighty-seven percent of defendants charged
with federal crimes were convicted in fiscal 1998 and almost three
out of four people convicted were sentenced to prison, the Justice
Department reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of the 106,139 federal arrests during the 12 months
that ended Sept. 30, 1998, charged drug or immigration violations,
according to the first comprehensive study of federal arrest data
by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Drug violations accounted for
29 percent of the arrests, and immigration offenses for 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-one percent of those convicted were sentenced to prison,
up from 60 percent of those convicted in 1990. Offenders convicted
of violent felonies were sentenced to an average of 84.2 months in
prison during 1998; felony drug offenders to 78.8 months;
immigration offenders to 26.4 months and property offenders to 25.4
months.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the time actually served reached 87 percent of the
sentence, up from 65 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The number of defendants prosecuted rose to 78,172 in 1998, up
12.7 percent from the 1997 total. Drug cases accounted for 38
percent of the increase; immigration cases for 29 percent of it.
Eighty-three percent of federal defendants were charged with
felonies. More serious than misdemeanors, felonies carry a maximum
penalty for more than one year in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Pretrial release also showed a decline -- to 43 percent of those
charged in 1998, down from 62 percent in 1990. Those least likely
to be released were charged with immigration offenses, violent
crimes, drug or weapons violations.
</P>
<P>
   Of those released awaiting trial, 84 percent completed their
release without incident, but 3 percent committed new crimes, 2
percent failed to make scheduled court appearances and 14.5 percent
committed technical violations of release conditions, like failure
to participate in substance abuse treatment. The total exceeds 100
percent because some defendants fit more than one category.
</P>
<P>
   Appeals to U.S. Courts of Appeals remained constant at 10,000 to
11,000 a year between 1990 and 1998. Of the 10,105 appeals
completed in 1998, 82 percent upheld the district court ruling, at
least in part.

<HEADLINE> France Restricts Media Photographs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- News photographers in France will have to change
their ways next year under a new law that limits who can be
photographed and how.
</P>
<P>
   France's leading picture magazine, Paris Match, denounced the
law as the toughest in Europe, and said in its Thursday edition
that it was prepared to defy the law and go to court.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, passed Tuesday by the Senate and set to take effect
Jan. 1, is aimed at reinforcing the right to be presumed innocent.
</P>
<P>
   For years, there have been complaints in France that the news
media runs roughshod over judicial procedure regarding the
presumption of innocence. Such complaints gained momentum following
a series of bombings in France in the 1990s and the 1997 death of
Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
   The law prohibits photographers from taking pictures of suspects
in handcuffs or of victims of crime whose dignity could be
compromised by a visual image.
</P>
<P>
   Publications that print photographs deemed in violation of the
law could face a court-imposed fine of up to $14,000.
</P>
<P>
   French magazines, newspapers and photographers contend that the
law is a form of censorship that limits press freedom and takes
away the constitutionally guaranteed ''right to inform.''
</P>
<P>
   ''France will become the only country in the European Union
where the publication of certain photos will be prohibited under
penalty of heavy fines,'' Paris Match's executive editor, Alain
Genestar, wrote in an editorial published in its latest issue,
dated June 8.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine, whose stock and trade is photographs, called the
law ''outdated and discriminatory'' and said it planned to ignore
it.
</P>
<P>
   If penalized, Genestar said, Paris Match would take its case
before the European Court of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   French photographers decry the law as restrictive but say they
are unlikely to soon change their on-the-job behavior because the
final decision to print a picture rests with publications, not the
photographers.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is part of French Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou's
sweeping reform of the criminal justice system to protect the
rights of suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The law also allows lawyers to be present during questioning of
suspects and gives a special judge the power to terminate or
prolong temporary custody.

<HEADLINE> Villagers Concerned About Division  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   GHAJAR, Israel-Lebanon Border (AP) -- For years, the residents of
Ghajar have felt like a soccer ball being kicked around by Syria,
Israel and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   After last week's Israeli troop withdrawal from Lebanon, the
fate of the Muslim village of 1,800, sitting in a triangle of murky
frontiers, has become even more uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Ghajar could either remain under Israeli rule, become part of
Lebanon, or be cut in half, depending on the findings of U.N.
cartographers who are remapping the Israeli-Lebanese border.
</P>
<P>
   Most Ghajar residents, who are Alawites like Syrian President
Hafez Assad, said they want to remain in Israel because of the
relative freedom and prosperity they have enjoyed since Israel
captured the village from Syria 33 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dividing Ghajar is definitely not an option, said villager
Mohammed Issa, 35.
</P>
<P>
   ''What would they do? Draw a line so the children are over here
and the parents are over there?'' Issa said in fluent Hebrew as he
stood outside the three-story white concrete house where he lives
with his wife and six children.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. spokesman Marwan Ali said experts have not yet reached a
conclusion about Ghajar.
</P>
<P>
   The village sits at the foot of Mount Dov, which Israel captured
from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli soldiers at first marched into the village, but then
withdrew, leaving Ghajar residents cut off on all sides. With
Syrian passports, they could not easily enter Lebanon, while the
Israelis blocked to road to Syria.
</P>
<P>
   So the people of Ghajar asked the Israelis to take over the rest
of their village, allowing them to harvest their fields which
Israel had occupied. In time, villagers took jobs in Israeli towns.
Unlike other villagers under occupation, they accepted Israeli
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Life with Israel has been good to Ghajar. It has white-painted
houses with blue or green trim, paved streets, a brick-lined
promenade and a green, manicured soccer field that would do a team
in Tel Aviv proud.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're the only Alawite village in Israel,'' said Mussa Vanos,
32, serving food in his little restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   However, the one thing the experts agree on is that Ghajar is
not in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Amnon Kartin, a geographer at Tel Aviv University, said that
based on colonial maps of the frontier between French-held Lebanon
and French-held Syria, Ghajar was part of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, Lebanon handed the village to Syria to allow its
residents to reunite with Alawites in Syria, Kartin said.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese border expert Issam Khalifeh said Ghajar was originally
Lebanese, but that he was not sure about its more recent history.
</P>
<P>
   In another possible clue to a Lebanese past, villagers said they
still owned fields on the Lebanese side of the border that they
could no longer reach to cultivate.
</P>
<P>
   Issa said he preferred to stay under Israeli rule. Raising his
arms in frustration, he said ''it would be awful'' if Ghajar were
attached to south Lebanon, controlled by Hezbollah guerrillas whom
he called ''terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah guerrillas, celebrating Israel's withdrawal last week,
have pledged to continue to fight unless Israel returns all
Lebanese territory, including the disputed area around Mount Dov.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether Hezbollah specifically sought control
over Ghajar. The Lebanese government has not claimed the village.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has said it would follow the lead of the United Nations
in determining the final border. U.N. officials are using a 1923
border between French-held Lebanon and British-held Palestine as
their guide.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Cabinet Minister Matan Vilnai met with Ghajar villagers
this week and told them that their Israeli citizenship would have
no bearing on their fate, including a possible division of the
village.
</P>
<P>
   ''It depends on the exact line from 1923,'' Vilnai said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the U.N. Security Council voted Wednesday to keep the
1,053 U.N. military observers on the Golan Heights for six more
months, until Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Disengagement Force was sent to the heights at the end
of the 1973 Mideast war. The plateau was seized from Syria by
Israel in 1967.

<HEADLINE> Counties Donate To Meet Lawmakers  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An association of county governments,
partially funded by local taxpayer dollars, contributed $20,000
each to the Democratic and Republican parties to help get the ears
of elected officials in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The five-figure ''soft money'' donations allow officials of the
National Association of Counties to attend contributor-only
luncheons, briefings and other events with Congress members.
</P>
<P>
   ''Participating in these two groups gives us access to
leadership on both sides,'' said association spokesman Tom Goodman.
''By being members of these groups, it gives us opportunities to
participate in activities that the DNC and RNC hold. This gives us
additional access that we may not have.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal Election Commission records show the association, which
lobbies on issues important to counties, gave $21,500 in
unregulated soft money to the Republican National Committee last
month. Goodman said the group donated a similar amount to the
Democratic National Committee, which isn't due to report its
contributions until July 15.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman said this is the first time the organization has
contributed to the parties.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Makinson, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for
Responsive Politics, said he hadn't heard of local governments or
their associations donating political money in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ''You would hope that the nationwide organization that
represents county governments wouldn't have to resort to paying an
entry fee to meet with politicians in Washington,'' said Makinson,
whose group studies money and campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,800 of the nation's 3,066 counties are members of
the association, and those member counties are home to more than 75
percent of the nation's population.
</P>
<P>
   About one-fifth of the organization's income comes from dues
paid by counties. Other money is earned through rents, royalties
and selling products such as financial services to counties and
their employees.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman said the contributions open up another avenue for county
officials to lobby members of Congress and the administration. The
association staff also visits Capitol Hill and county officials
call their own members of Congress on issues.
</P>
<P>
   One issue atop their legislative agenda is the moratorium on
Internet sales taxes. Goodman said businesses that sell on the Web
should pay the same taxes as other businesses. Without those taxes,
states lose revenue, some of which makes its way to county
governments, and local businesses may close their doors because of
the unfair competition, Goodman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a need to find as many ways as possible to meet with
members of Congress,'' Goodman said. ''This gives us one more way
of accomplishing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Makinson said lawmakers should be opening their doors to county
officials without campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got one level of government paying the ante to talk to
another level of government,'' Makinson said. ''County officials
should be talking to federal officials because they're county
officials, not because they've made a contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Other givers have also caused controversy. In 1998, the American
Cancer Society made $15,000 contributions to both the Democratic
and Republican governors' associations so representatives of the
charity could attend forums and dinners with the governors, much
like tobacco executives and other special interests do. Spokesman
Roger Salazar said the society no longer makes the donations.

<HEADLINE> Tentative agreement reached to end month long walkout  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CHRISTOFFERSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WETHERSFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- The American Red Cross and its blood
collection workers in Connecticut reached a tentative three-year
contract agreement Wednesday that would end a monthlong walkout.
</P>
<P>
   The deal came on the 31st day of strike by 200 members of the
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local
3145. The workers were seeking better pay and less hectic work
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side would release details of the deal, saying they
wanted workers to hear the proposal first.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an improvement over the previous last best offer of the
Red Cross that compelled the strike,'' said Jeffrey Jump, chief
negotiator for the union.
</P>
<P>
   A vote on the deal was scheduled for Saturday. No date has been
set for employees to return to work.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very pleased, looking forward to having our employees
back at their jobs,'' said Lynn Townshend, Red Cross spokeswoman.
''We're relieved.''
</P>
<P>
   Blood collections in Connecticut have dropped to about 100 pints
per day from the usual 600. The Red Cross has been holding only one
blood drive each day, instead of the six to 12 it held before the
strike. The agency hopes to have a full compliment of blood drives
within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Jump predicted the members would ratify the deal. The union's
negotiating committee is unanimously recommending the agreement, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel good about it, to say the least,'' Jump said. ''Every
issue has been addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Jump thanked state and federal mediators for their help in
reaching an agreement, which came after a full day of negotiations
at the state Department of Labor in Wethersfield. He praised the
striking workers for maintaining solidarity throughout the strike.
</P>
<P>
   ''The membership has been remarkable,'' Jump said. ''They have
really stuck this out and persevered.''
</P>
<P>
   Jump attributed the settlement to both sides showing
flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Although no hospital reported any problems with blood delivery
or service because of the strike, a controversy arose after the
Connecticut AFL-CIO urged the union's 265,000 members to boycott
blood drives until the contract dispute was resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The union had had also asked the American Red Cross ''to cease
the transfer to Connecticut of blood from national inventories or
other centers around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut Hospital Association called that move
irresponsible, and a threat to the blood supply.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Down 59; Dow Down 5  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed mostly lower Wednesday as
investors, viewing signs of slower economic growth with skepticism,
abandoned their belief that the Federal Reserve is close to ending
its string of interest rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index fell 58.57 to close at 3,400.91,
failing to extend its 254.37-point gain from Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 4.80 to 10,522.33.
Broader stock indicators, which had joined the Nasdaq in Tuesday's
rally, were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 1.85 to
1,420.60.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said interest rate worries prevented the market from
building on Tuesday's gains.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we're going to see these periodic rallies, but I don't
think they'll be sustainable because of the nervousness that's
lingering over monetary policy,'' said Ned Riley, chief investment
strategist at State Street Global Advisors.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks slipped despite three separate economic reports that
offered signs that the economy is no longer growing at the rapid
pace that prompted the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates six
times in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said the most significant report was data from the
Purchasing Management Association of Chicago. The group's index of
area business activity fell to 53.9 in May, on a seasonally
adjusted basis, from 56.5 in April. The report is considered a good
gauge of the national purchasing managers' report, due out on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Commerce Department reported that sales of new homes
tumbled 5.8 percent in April. That marked the largest decline since
last September.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the Index of Leading Economic Indicators declined
by 0.1 percent last month, the Conference Board said. The
compilation of forward-pointing economic statistics is designed to
forecast the future direction of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The three reports were encouraging, but not conclusive enough to
convince the Fed that inflation has been tamed, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''(The report) that growth in the factory sector is moderating
is good news for the Fed, but the slowing is nowhere near enough to
keep them from boosting rates further,'' said Mark Vitner,
economist at First Union Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street was also looking ahead to the government's
employment report for the month of May, due out Friday. That report
should indicate whether a continued low jobless rate is forcing
companies to boost wages and benefits to retain workers.
</P>
<P>
   Banks and brokerages were mostly higher. Citigroup rose $1.875
to $62.188 and American Express rose $3.375 to $54.
</P>
<P>
   Investors sold some of the technology stocks that rose
significantly on Tuesday. Qualcomm fell $10 to $66.375.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard dropped $4.375 to $120.125 after chief executive
Carly Fiorina dismissed speculation that she might announce a
spinoff of Veriphone, a maker of credit-card verification terminals
and e-commerce software.
</P>
<P>
   Riley said that even with Tuesday's rally enticing some buyers
back into the market, many investors are staying away from
technology stocks until the Fed stops raising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are not immune,'' he said, discounting the theory that
technology companies won't be hurt by rising rates because they
tend to borrow less money than industrial companies. ''They may not
borrow, but their clients do and they will eventually curtail their
technology purchases.''
</P>
<P>
   The tech sector's dizzying spiral downward from its March 10
record has also convinced some investors to broaden their
portfolios into long-neglected sectors outside the technology
world, Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not see people as committed to one single sector,'' he
said. ''That myopic strategy has led to some disappointing
short-term results.''
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume totaled 1.14
billion shares, compared with 1.01 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.52 to 476.18.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.6 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index fell 0.1 percent and France's CAC-40 was
up 0.8 percent. Britain's FT-SE 100 ended nearly unchanged,
slipping 0.3 points.

<HEADLINE> Prosecution witness grilled by defense in Peeler trial  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- Josephine Lee, who says she was the
lookout when a gunman killed an 8-year-old murder witness and the
boy's mother, was called Wednesday to testify on behalf of the man
accused of arranging the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, the state's star witness against Russell Peeler, testified
earlier in the trial that she overheard Peeler and his brother,
Adrian, plan the murders of Leroy ''B.J.'' Brown Jr. and his
mother, Karen Clarke. Lee also said she helped Adrian Peeler get
into the Clarke house and watched as he shot the mother and son on
Jan. 7, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, Peeler's defense attorneys confronted her with
two letters she wrote to her former landlord, Norman Williams, in
which she said she doesn't know anything about the crime and lied
about the Peelers' involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Norman you know that I lied on the Peelers. But I was scared
when the police came to the house to get me so I told them that I
had something to do with the murder. But I do not know anything,''
she wrote in a letter to Williams in May, just after she testified
against Russell Peeler.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who lived across the street from Clarke and her son in a
house owned by Williams, last year pleaded guilty to conspiracy to
commit murder. She agreed to testify against the Peeler brothers in
exchange for a maximum prison sentence of seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Peeler is accused of masterminding the murders to
prevent the boy from testifying against him in the 1998 slaying of
Clarke's boyfriend, Rudolph Snead Jr. His brother, Adrian, is
accused of being the actual triggerman who killed the mother and
son.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning from Peeler's attorneys Wednesday, Lee said
she lied in her letters to Williams because she was hoping to live
in his house when she is released from prison. She later
contradicted herself, saying she did not want to go back to
Williams' house.
</P>
<P>
   She insisted that she was telling the truth when she said she
overheard Russell Peeler ask his brother, Adrian, to kill the
mother and son. She also repeated her original story that she got
Adrian inside the Clarke housing by knocking on the door and
identifying herself as the girl who lived across the street.
</P>
<P>
   ''This right here is a lie,'' she said, holding up one of the
letters she wrote to Williams. ''I'm telling the truth now,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Lee has changed her story.
</P>
<P>
   When Lee first testified as a prosecution witness, Peeler's
attorneys grilled her about a letter she wrote to her own attorney
in Dec. 1999 in which she denied knowing anything about the
killings. At the same time, she sent three separate letters to
Bridgeport police officers in which she said she asked forgiveness
for having a role in the killings.
</P>
<P>
   The defense also called Williams as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, a 75-year-old nicknamed ''Pops,'' said he did not see
Russell Peeler at his house the day before the murder, calling into
question Lee's testimony that she overheard Russell and Adrian
planning the murders as they sat in Williams' house that day.
</P>
<P>
   Williams also said he did not see Adrian Peeler at his house the
day of the murders. Lee testified that Adrian Peeler walked into
Williams' house holding a gun and that she brought him across the
street to Clarke's house with him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Did you see Adrian with Josephine Lee with a gun in his
hand?'' Peeler's attorney, William Koch, asked Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ''No way,'' Williams replied.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination from Bridgeport State's Attorney
Jonathan Benedict, Williams acknowledged that he and others who
stayed in his house had smoked crack cocaine. Lee testified that
Russell Peeler used Williams' kitchen to cook the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Closing arguments in the case are scheduled for Friday. The jury
is expected to begin deliberations Monday after receiving
instruction on the law from the judge.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Fear Russian Uranium  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russia has proposed selling extra
commercial-grade uranium to a U.S. company, but lawmakers want the
Clinton administration to reject the deal, contending it could lead
American uranium plants to close.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers worry that if more ready-to-use uranium is
available from Russia, there will be less need for enriched
American uranium and jobs will be lost.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Enrichment Corp. has plants in Piketon, Ohio, and
Paducah, Ky., the only plants in the country where uranium is
enriched. A plant in Metropolis, Ill., is the sole one that readies
uranium for enrichment.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers from the three states have asked the administration to
reject the deal with the Bethesda, Md.-based company. The National
Security Council and State Department would have to agree to any
new arrangement with Russia before it could proceed to further
consideration by the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a bad idea,'' Rep. Ted Strickland, D-Ohio, said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A letter signed by 19 members of the Illinois congressional
delegation said the Illinois plant already is ''on the verge of
shutting down.'' A deal with Russia ''may greatly exacerbate an
already serious situation,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   The company president, in a letter to Congress, insisted there
would be no connection between a plant-closing decision and a deal
with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The quantity of low-enriched uranium under discussion ''will not
trip a decision to cease enrichment at one of our plants,'' William
Timbers wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The company was part of the federal government before it was
spun off in 1998 in a $1.9 billion stock sale. It provides uranium
fuel for civilian power plants, accounting for about a third of the
worldwide market.
</P>
<P>
   Its profits have declined sharply because of a slump in the
uranium market and increasing costs at the aging enrichment plants.
The company, which is in the process of eliminating 625 of its
2,800 jobs, also says it has lost money on a deal to buy Russia's
uranium stockpile and sell it to utility companies worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Timbers acknowledged the Russians have proposed
selling commercial-grade uranium, and confirmed that it arose
during talks to renegotiate the price of uranium being salvaged
from nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial-grade uranium would not require processing at the
Illinois, Ohio and Kentucky plants, but Timbers said that would not
mean the plants would have to close.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal goes through, the company would release the Russian
uranium on to the market as part of a package deal, sold only ''if
matched with material manufactured in our country by our
employees,'' according to the letter.
</P>
<P>
   ''This matched material will be used to make high-cost U.S.
produced (uranium) more attractive to our customers and help us
beat the aggressive foreign competition,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   To Strickland and Rep. Ed Whitfield, R-Ky., an arrangement to
buy utility-ready uranium would turn the company into a broker that
someday could decide to serve all its customers with foreign
uranium.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing would encourage the demise of our domestic industry in
the same way that this would,'' Strickland said.

<HEADLINE> List Targets Top Drug Traffickers  </HEADLINE>
By KEN GUGGENHEIM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is trying to put
the financial squeeze on the world's biggest drug kingpins, but
there are fears innocent people and businesses could get caught in
the wringer.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is required, under legislation approved last
year, to provide Congress by Thursday with a list of what it
considers to be the top foreign drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Those on the list -- and their foreign business associates --
would have their U.S. assets frozen in most cases. Americans would
be barred from doing business with them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're hitting these people (traffickers) where it really
hurts,'' said Rep. Porter J. Goss, R-Fla., chairman of the House
Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   However, civil libertarians are concerned that assets will be
seized before foreign companies have a chance to defend themselves.
Some U.S. and foreign companies fear they will be penalized for
unwittingly doing business with traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   And Mexico is wary of the new law, known as the Foreign Drug
Kingpin Designation Act. Though supporting its goals of fighting
traffickers, Mexican leaders worry the list could become
politicized and influenced by Mexico's critics in Congress,
creating a ''scandalous political atmosphere,'' Juan Rebolledo,
Mexico's undersecretary of foreign relations, said in an interview
in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials and legislators have raised their concerns in
meetings with their U.S. counterparts in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement from Mexico City late Wednesday, the Mexican
foreign relations department repeated that it ''fully agrees with
the spirit of the law.'' But it expressed concerns about whether
foreign companies in the United States will be given due process of
law.
</P>
<P>
   It said it has ''demanded the necessary care so that the
political process before the U.S. Congress doesn't affect, with
unfounded charges, the prestige of innocent Mexican individuals or
businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell, who sponsored the legislation, said he
expects the ''angst'' about the list will calm down after its
release.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know the list will be very conservative, probably by and
large people already under indictment in the United States,'' said
Coverdell, R-Ga. ''It will not be a long list.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said that the first part of the
list -- the names of major drug traffickers -- was being reviewed
Wednesday by President Clinton in Lisbon, Portugal, where he was
meeting with European Union leaders. Those names will be released
Thursday and the traffickers' assets will be frozen immediately,
the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The other part, naming the traffickers' business associates, was
being prepared by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign
Assets Control, but it was unclear when it would be made public.
Other names and businesses could be added later.
</P>
<P>
   The list could contain names of suspects who have been publicly
identified before, such as Alejandro Bernal Madrigal of Colombia,
the Arellano Felix brothers in Mexico, Wei Hsueh-kang, a Chinese
national, and former Myanmar warlord Khun Sa.
</P>
<P>
   Naming business associates has raised greater concerns. TMM, a
giant Mexican shipping company that has long fought rumors linking
it to drug trafficking, hired a Washington firm to lobby on its
behalf. TMM spokesman Luis Calvillo said the company is now
reassured that the U.S. government ''has taken the adequate steps
to make sure that innocents aren't hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States-Mexico Chamber of Commerce is still troubled,
though, that any businesses linked to drug trafficking would have
to fight in federal court to clear their names.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't really enforce the concept of innocent until proven
guilty,'' said Jeff Sparshott, spokesman for the chamber in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the law note that it was modeled after a 1995
executive order that gave the government the power to penalize
Colombian drug traffickers and their associates. Few due process
complaints have been raised over the blocking of Colombian assets,
they say.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a five-member commission has been formed to evaluate the
procedure of blocking assets and judicial remedies available to
anyone affected by the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell said he expects U.S. companies will be warned if are
they doing business with foreign companies linked to drug
traffickers -- and will be expected to sever ties.
</P>
<P>
   ''We live in an environment today that institutions have to pay
attention to who their clients are,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Search on for Missing Hondurans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) -- At least 3,000 Hondurans have
disappeared in the past 10 years en route to the United States via
Guatemala and Mexico, a private organization said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Committee of Disappeared Migrants, which is made up of about
200 relatives of the missing, said in a statement that it was
trying to establish contacts with private U.S. organizations in
order to find the missing people.
</P>
<P>
   The group said it believes thousands of Hondurans who left for
the United States since 1990 never made it. They could have died
during the journey, may be living in ''lamentable conditions'' in
Guatemala and Mexico or may be in jails in the United States, the
group said.
</P>
<P>
   The organization has asked the government of President Carlos
Flores Facusse to help in the search, and has urged people ''not to
risk their lives in search of new foreign horizons.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the group, more than 100,000 Hondurans live in the
United States under a temporary amnesty program created in the wake
of 1998's Hurricane Mitch, while 40,000 others reside there
illegally.
</P>
<P>
   The group says the immigrants send about $600 million a year to
their relatives -- more than the $400 million in revenues generated
by coffee, the country's principal export.
</P>
<P>
   The group also urged the government to provide new job
opportunities to lessen the temptation to leave the country.

<HEADLINE> Lazio promises high road, blasts Clinton as ''far left''  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATKINS GLEN, N.Y. (AP) -- While pledging aboard his ''Mainstream
Express'' campaign bus to ''take the high road'' against Senate
rival Hillary Rodham Clinton, Rick Lazio launched one of his most
stinging attacks to date against the first lady on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Associated Press aboard his customized
campaign cruiser on the way to Watkins Glen in the Finger Lakes,
Lazio said New Yorkers should be asking themselves: ''What have you
done for us for the last eight years? Have you been in our corner,
or are you just a Johnny-come-lately who is aspiring to a position?
Is this about ambition or is this about public service?''
</P>
<P>
   New York Republicans have been complaining for months that
Clinton is a carpetbagger who wants to use the Senate seat as a
stepping stone to a run for president.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio refused to say what he thought the first lady's ambitions
might be, but maintained that he harbored no presidential
aspirations of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this will be the pinnacle of my career,'' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate interview with CNN, Lazio showed a softer side,
tearing up when he talked about his late father, Anthony Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he'd be very proud of this,'' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   The trip marked the first full day of campaigning for the
little-known congressman from Long Island aboard his newly acquired
campaign bus, a coach reminiscent of Sen. John McCain's ''Straight
Talk Express.'' It was also the first day on the road for Lazio
since picking up the Republican Party's Senate nomination at the
state GOP convention in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio began Wednesday in Syracuse and hit the trail already
prepared to do battle, and work at raising his name recognition
with voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a struggle between somebody on the far left and
somebody in the center,'' he told reporters before boarding his bus
for a trip to the nearby Byrne Dairy milk plant where he and his
wife were treated to ice cream cones.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said he had dubbed the bus the ''Mainstream Express'' for
two reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ''One is to reinforce my record in the house which is a
mainstream record which is, I think, where the vast majority of New
Yorkers are,'' Lazio said. ''The second thing is to reinforce this
is a grassroots campaign and we're going to be out and open and
among the people.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to be here answering your questions like I am right
now at every stop,'' he added. ''We're going to be accessible. I
expect to be held accountable ... I think that's what this campaign
should be all about. It shouldn't be about rope lines and checking
credentials and scripted responses.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Lazio's own acceptance speech to the GOP convention
on Tuesday had contained the stage direction to ''smile'' at one
point, Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said: ''Candidates
in glass buses shouldn't throw stones. Once again, Rick Lazio's
rhetoric doesn't match reality.'' He also suggested a better name
for Lazio's bus would be ''the double-talk express.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Lazio's new bus was something of a carpetbagger,
sporting a temporary registration plate from Alabama. Inside was a
makeup artist, on hand to help conceal the split lip he suffered
Monday when he took a tumble during a Memorial Day parade.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson also said, ''It sounds like Congressman Lazio has taken
the low road out of Buffalo, offering more insults instead of
ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Stopping at the Glenora Wine Cellars, overlooking Seneca Lake
just outside Watkins Glen, Lazio told Yates County Republicans that
he would be a fiscally responsible senator.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want any blank-check philosophy here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, at a news conference, Lazio was asked to explain
what it was that made Clinton a candidate of the ''far left.'' He
demurred, other than to mention her unsuccessful attempt to
overhaul the nation's health care financing system.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are going to try to get me into this, 'He said, she
said' deal,'' the congressman said. ''I only want to talk about who
I am and what I've done.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his not-too-subtle attacks on Clinton, Lazio and
his supporters appeared determined Wednesday to convince New
Yorkers he really was a ''mainstream'' Republican and not the
right-wing, Newt Gingrich-loving conservative the Clinton camp has
been making him out to be.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rick is middle-of-the-road,'' moderate Amo Houghton, a fellow
New York Republican congressman, told a rally in Watkins Glen.
''We're not extremists.''
</P>
<P>
   During a walking tour of Watkins Glen, where sports cars once
raced through the streets, Lazio was greeted warmly and given
encouragement from locals and visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're tired of the word 'Clinton,''' Jonathan Ciener, 51, of
Cocoa Beach, Fla., told the congressman. The owner of a company
that manufactures gun accessories had his Ferrari parked across the
street.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kick her ass, Rick,'' the driver of a van shouted out his
window. The congressman, dressed casually in a polo shirt, blue
blazer and khakis, waved.
</P>
<P>
   At a campaign stop in Elmira later Wednesday, Lazio was greeted
by an enthusiastic crowd of about 150.
</P>
<P>
   At a later rally in Binghamton, Lazio again attacked Clinton for
being a non-New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   ''Being a New Yorker is more than moving into a multimillion
dollar house and putting a Yankee hat on,'' Lazio told a sparse but
enthusiastic crowd of no more than 250 people.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in the audience was a Lazio supporter. Mary
Franzonello over nearby Endwell said she was a conservative
Republican and that Lazio just wasn't conservative enough for her.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want Hillary, but what's Lazio offering us as a real
alternative,'' she said while carrying a six foot high photograph
of Hillary Clinton with words coming out of her mouth that said
''Lazio and I share views on abortion, gun control and the
environment.''

<HEADLINE> Official: Agency Knew of Asbestos  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOZEMAN, Mont. (AP) -- The Environmental Protection Agency knew
more than 15 years ago that asbestos fibers were killing people in
the small Montana town of Libby but ''dropped the ball,'' a
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Bozeman Daily Chronicle quoted Christopher Weis, an EPA
toxicologist, who said the agency's headquarters was aware of the
situation but never passed the information along to the regional
office in Denver -- which is now heading up the EPA response in
Libby.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 200 deaths related to asbestos exposure have been
reported in the Libby area, where a mine produced thousands of tons
of asbestos as a byproduct of vermiculite, which is used in
insulation, as a gardening additive and in other products.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said Weis told a University of Colorado
environmental journalism conference last week that an EPA study at
the W.R. Grace vermiculite mine in the mid-1980s showed death
projections of ''almost 100 percent'' for miners there.
</P>
<P>
   ''EPA is reeling in shock, the whole agency, as to how this
slipped through the cracks,'' Weis told that gathering, the
newspaper said. ''We dropped the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Weis did not return phone calls from The Associated Press. The
EPA's regional office in Denver also did not return calls seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported the
hazards in Libby in a series of stories. Those stories surprised
EPA officials in Denver, said Weis, who was part of the federal
response team in Libby.
</P>
<P>
   Further investigation has shown that the initial tally of the
death toll in the town of 2,700 people may have been low, Weis
said, because asbestos-related problems are notoriously diagnosed
inaccurately.
</P>
<P>
   The mine's mill spewed as much as 5,000 tons of asbestos a day
and other fibers apparently were brought home on the dusty clothing
of workers. EPA is sampling air, soil and other materials in Libby
to find out just how extensive the contamination is.

<HEADLINE> Census: 92 Percent of Work Done  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 110 million households counted, and
another 10 million to go.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau announced Wednesday it has reached 92 percent
of the roughly 120 million U.S. households, either by mail or
through a visit from a census-taker at the front door.
</P>
<P>
   But Census Bureau Director Kenneth Prewitt acknowledged that
those homes still uncounted will be the toughest task yet for his
census-takers. He said he hoped an encouraging e-mail sent
Wednesday from President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore to all
Census Bureau employees will help.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am extremely gratified that they have sent this message to
all our staff, recognizing the dedication and work that has brought
us to this point,'' Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   In late April, the Census Bureau started out with a pool of
about 440,000 part-time enumerators across the country charged with
finding the 42 million households that did not mail back a Census
2000 form.
</P>
<P>
   Those who remain uncounted include hard-to-reach inner-city
residents, anti-government people, and those concerned their
answers will not remain confidential, Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will have to redouble our efforts to reach the remaining 8
percent of households, so that we can deliver to the country the
accurate and complete census it needs for the coming decade,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Montenegro Official Murdered  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A top security adviser of
Montenegro's pro-Western president was shot and killed late
Wednesday, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Goran Zugic, a former ranking police officer, was
the first murder of a prominent Montenegrin official after a series
of high-profile killings in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Zugic was killed in front of his home in Podgorica, the capital
of Montenegro, which forms Yugoslavia along with the larger Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Zugic, 45, was as a security adviser of President Milo
Djukanovic, who is at odds with Yugoslav autocratic President
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters saw Zugic's body as police investigated the murder in
a dark alley in front of his home. Police blocked all major roads
in Podgorica, searching for the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   The slayings in Serbia included warlord Zeljko Raznatovic, known
as Arkan, in January, defense minister Pavle Bulatovic in February
and ruling party official Bosko Perosevic in May.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic is at odds with Milosevic over a series of political
and economic issues. Montenegro is seeking autonomy or outright
independence from Yugoslavia because of Milosevic's autocratic
policies.

<HEADLINE> Federal panel approves NU, ConEd merger  </HEADLINE>
By CAREN BENJAMIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on
Wednesday gave its blessing to the merger of Northeast Utilities
and Consolidated Edison Inc. of New York, but negotiations toward
state approval of the deal stalled in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The $7.5 billion deal would create the country's largest
electric and gas distribution company, with more than 6.4 million
customers in New York and New England.
</P>
<P>
   The federal panel approved the proposed merger without comment
after the utilities allayed concerns about the effect it would have
on competition.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, the companies pointed out they have already spun
off most of their power-generation assets in order to comply with
electric deregulation laws.
</P>
<P>
   NU sold its fossil fuel plants in Connecticut and Massachusetts
well above book value and has put its Millstone nuclear power
plants up for auction.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders from both companies have already approved the
merger.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have also made assurances that customers will not
pay more for electricity as a result of the merger, according to
the regulatory commission's order approving the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are particularly pleased with the speed in which FERC made
the approval as well as the findings in which FERC clearly stated
that the merger with ConEd will not affect competition or energy
pricing,'' said NU spokesman Terrence McIntosh.
</P>
<P>
   The merger still needs approval from regulators in Connecticut,
New York and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Hearings in Connecticut had begun but were cut short in favor of
negotiations after citizens groups complained the state was getting
nothing from the deal.
</P>
<P>
   For the past month Connecticut's Department of Public Utility
Control has been negotiating with the utilities over rate cuts, job
protections, corporate donations, land preservation and other
benefits for customers and the state.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was the utilities' deadline to file a settlement, ask
for regulatory proceedings to resume or ask to continue talks. No
agreement was reached and NU will ask that the merger hearings
continue, McIntosh said.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said the state
will continue to push for a better deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''When hearings resume at the DPUC, we will continue to oppose
the merger until Connecticut receives substantial benefits and
savings, and Connecticut's economy and work force are protected,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The hearings should start up again in two to three weeks,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission must also approve the deal.

Coroner Probing 9 Possible E. coli Deaths
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Ontario's chief coroner was investigating nine
deaths Wednesday in connection with the province's killer E. coli
outbreak as Premier Mike Harris finally bowed to pressure and
called a full-scale public inquiry into the tainted water tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Chief coroner James Young stressed that not all the deaths are
necessarily related to the water poisoning in rural Walkerton,
Ontario, but at least seven people are thought to have died from E.
coli infections over recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Two others -- a 92-year-old woman who died May 15 and a
69-year-old man who died May 19 -- have been added to the list of
deaths possibly linked to the outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry will be wide-ranging and will delve into how the
town's water was tested, how the contamination occurred and whether
government actions or policy played a part.
</P>
<P>
   That could include calling Harris or some of his cabinet
ministers to testify.

British Columbia Treaty Future in Jeopardy
</P>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- The future of a treaty
process covering almost all of British Columbia is in jeopardy
after the band furthest along in negotiations pulled out Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Sechelt band, which has always enjoyed a greater degree of
informal self-government than most in the province, has said it
will turn its back on the treaty process and instead ask a court to
hear its land claim.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government wants to cram their final statements down our
throats,'' Chief Garry Feschuk said at a ceremony Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Feschuck said even when he signed the agreement in principle
last year, he knew there were a lot of issues to be addressed, but
he said he thought that could be done before a final treaty was
signed.
</P>
<P>
   He said it will take three months for the court process to kick
in. In that time, the band is willing to listen to any further
offers from the federal and provincial governments.

<HEADLINE> Feds Defend Prescribed Burns  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT SONNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Reeling from the disastrous blaze in Los
Alamos, N.M., federal officials defended prescribed burns Wednesday
as critical to returning more natural fire cycles to the West.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the conventional wisdom now is that prescribed fire
makes sense and you need to have it,'' Bureau of Land Management
Director Tom Fry said during a break at a wildland fire summit
called by Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn. About 200 firefighters and land
managers attended.
</P>
<P>
   ''While it does have its detractors ... we are past the point
where we are questioning whether it is appropriate,'' Fry said.
</P>
<P>
   Prescribed or controlled burns are intended to clear out
underbrush and reduce fuel for a large, potentially catastrophic
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt suspended all prescribed
brush-clearing fires on department lands after one set at Bandelier
National Monument in New Mexico was blown out of control by high
wind and scorched about 48,000 acres in and around Los Alamos.
Several hundred families were left homeless.
</P>
<P>
   The burn ban for most agencies will end on June 12; it will
continue indefinitely for the Park Service. The Bureau of Land
Management plans to burn 289,000 acres of land by the end of the
year -- up about 30 percent from last year, Fry said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Los Alamos is on a lot of our minds as a nation,'' said Bob
Vaught, supervisor of the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest in
Nevada, the largest national forest in the continental United
States. ''And yet prescribed fire is a necessary part of resource
management.''

<HEADLINE> Gore: Don't Ban Cigarettes  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MACON, Ga. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, confronted by a
handful of angry tobacco workers, said Wednesday he does not want
to make cigarettes illegal and would do what he could to protect
tobacco-industry jobs -- as long as it doesn't undercut efforts to
keep kids from smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am happy to do anything I can to help you preserve your
livelihood, but I am not going to say or do anything that in any
way undermines or weakens the toughest possible measures to prevent
children from ever getting into the habit of smoking. Now if that
costs me votes, I'm willing to pay that price,'' Gore said at an
open meeting with voters, where he was sharply questioned by
employees of Brown &AMP; Williamson's tobacco manufacturing plant here.
</P>
<P>
   One woman told Gore, the Democratic presidential contender, that
she would like to vote for him, but that she and her co-workers
feel the federal government is trying to eliminate their jobs with
its anti-smoking campaign and litigation against tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Harris, president of the local Machinists union, showed
Gore photos of a vacant fabrication unit at B&AMP;W where, Harris said,
machinery has already been shipped overseas with Macon-area jobs
sure to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, a former smoker himself, told both that tobacco companies
were making their own economic decisions to relocate operations
abroad and they had nothing to do with the federal crackdown on
cigarette sales and marketing to children.
</P>
<P>
   ''If, over time, the demand (for cigarettes) is decreased and
the jobs are lost as a result of that, then we have to accept that
fact,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've seen someone die from lung cancer and a lot of families
have been affected by it, and it's almost completely preventable
and I am just not going to compromise on it,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   In the back of the Douglass Theater, where Gore fielded
questions for more than three hours, stood Frank Hunger, widower of
Gore's older sister Nancy, who died of lung cancer in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Hunger traveled to Georgia for a campaign speech
Thursday in Atlanta addressing cancer research and the privacy and
treatment rights of cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
   Gore insisted Wednesday night that he does not intend to outlaw
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ''No matter how deep my concern, I have never advocated making
the product illegal. There are tens of millions of adult smokers
and, in recognition of that reality, there's just a universal
acceptance on all sides of the debate that the product is going to
remain legal,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris later told reporters he is a Gore delegate to the
Democratic National Convention but was undecided about who to vote
for. ''There's a lot of people at my plant who aren't sure which
way to go because the Democrats are trying to put the tobacco
industry away,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> UN Reports on Women's Progress  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- In an assessment of women's progress
toward equality, the United Nations reported Wednesday that more
girls are attending school -- but that all females still confront
''a global epidemic'' of violence.
</P>
<P>
   The mixed snapshot for women five years after a major
international women's conference in Beijing shows they comprise an
increasing share of the world's labor force but are making no
headway in cracking the top echelons of business and government.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. reports show women generally marrying later, having
fewer children, and living longer, but still comprising two-thirds
of the world's illiterates and almost half the victims of HIV and
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   A 180-page report on ''The World's Women 2000'' produced by the
U.N. Statistics Division and a 21-page report by the U.N.
Children's Fund on ''Domestic Violence Against Women and Girls''
were released separately Wednesday, five days before the start of a
major U.N. women's conference.
</P>
<P>
   Ministers from 188 nations will meet for five days starting
Monday -- shadowed by thousands of women from grassroots
organizations -- to review progress toward implementing the
wide-ranging platform of action adopted at the 1995 U.N. women's
conference in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   With the goal of achieving full gender equality, the platform
called on governments to revise laws to ensure women's equal
rights, to provide equal education for girls and to ensure the
right of women to decide matters of sexual and reproductive health.
It also urged governments and businesses to put women in top
decision-making positions and called for the elimination of
violence against women.
</P>
<P>
   The UNICEF report said most data on violence against women is
believed to be ''not only conservative, but unreliable.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it concluded that physical violence against women
is prevalent and that 20 percent to 50 percent of women have
experienced domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF said too few nations have moved to stop violence against
women, ranging from infanticide to spousal abuse to honor-killings.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Statistics Division report also concluded that physical
and sexual abuse affects millions of girls and women worldwide --
and remains underreported.
</P>
<P>
   Presenting the report at a news conference, U.N.
Undersecretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs Nitan Desai
said that ''available data show that women are making gains, but
persistent disparities exist between women and men.''
</P>
<P>
   The gender gap in schooling for youngsters is closing, he said,
but will not be closed by the target date of 2005 which was set in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that at least one-third of women are part of
the work force in all regions except northern Africa and western
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But it also concluded that ''women remain at the lower end of a
segregated labor market and continue to be concentrated in a few
occupations, to hold positions of little or no authority and to
receive less pay than men.''
</P>
<P>
   In the five years since Beijing, the report said women's
participation in the top levels of government and business ''has
not markedly increased.''

<HEADLINE> Chile's Leader Offers Land  </HEADLINE>
By EDUARDO GALLARDO
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- President Ricardo Lagos offered land and
money to restive Mapuche Indians on Wednesday, but warned that
violent opposition to timber and electric companies in southern
Chile will not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all must act within a state of law,'' Lagos said in
announcing the creation of a ''truth'' commission, his first major
initiative to resolve the demands of Chile's poor Indian
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The Mapuche Indians have long been demanding what they consider
their ancestral lands, and some have engaged in violent clashes
against timber projects and a hydroelectric dam being built 350
miles south of Santiago.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos vowed on the campaign trail last year to quickly tackle
the Indians' problems and solve their land disputes. His latest
move came a year after his predecessor Eduardo Frei signed a
landmark anti-discrimination pact with the indigenous communities.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from the various tribes attended Wednesday's
ceremony at the presidential palace for the creation of the
so-called Commission for Historic Truth and a New Deal.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, grouping officials, scholars, businessmen and
Indian representatives, is supposed to study the past and present
situation of Chile's 1.2 million native Indians, mostly Mapuches
living in the south. It is to propose measures to solve their main
problems -- poverty, discrimination, joblessness, lack of land and
poor education.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos used the occasion to announce that the Mapuche will be
given some 370,500 acres of government-owned land, one third of it
before the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 10,000 Mapuche families will be granted $192 each
to buy seeds and other agricultural products, Lagos said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lagos insisted violent actions would not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot permit small groups to stymie Chile's development,''
Lagos said, a reference to the Mapuche opposition to the
multi-million dollar Ralco dam project. ''But at the same time we
will not impose on these groups conditions that are unacceptable to
them.''

<HEADLINE> Poll: Americans Back Some Gay Rights  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Just over half of Americans say gay couples
should not be allowed to marry, according to an Associated Press
poll. But just as many say gay partners should have some legal
rights of a married couple -- such as inheritance, Social Security
benefits and health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   More women than men feel gay marriage is OK. So do more
Democrats than Republicans, more young people than old, more people
who feel gays are born with that sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne McFarlane, a 57-year-old retiree from Plantation in south
Florida, said in an interview, ''The ideal of marriage is family,
and a child needs both sexes to be brought up properly.'' But she
also said gay partners should get typical benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, conducted for the AP by ICR of Media, Pa., found that
51 percent were opposed to allowing gay couples to marry, while 34
percent approved.
</P>
<P>
   Half the respondents were asked the question a bit differently --
whether they approved of allowing gays to form a ''domestic
partnership'' that would give them the rights and benefits of
opposite-sex marriage.
</P>
<P>
   In that question, which did not refer to ''gay marriage,'' the
number that approved allowing such a relationship grew slightly to
41 percent while the opposition was almost half.
</P>
<P>
   The AP poll found that at least half of Americans support the
rights of gays to receive health insurance (53 percent), Social
Security benefits (50 percent) and inheritance (56 percent) from
their partners.
</P>
<P>
   The governor of Vermont signed a law in April that allowed gay
couples to form ''civil unions'' with the same benefits and rights
as civil marriage. Vermont was the first state in the nation to
pass such a law, which was separate and distinct from the state's
marriage statutes.
</P>
<P>
   A Vermont poll by ORC Macro of Burlington, Vt., found that about
a third favored gay marriage and more than half opposed it. A
national poll by the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights
organization, found in 1998 that almost half opposed gay marriage,
and just over four in 10 favored it. It, too, found that a majority
favored providing benefits such as inheritance rights, Social
Security benefits and health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   After the Hawaii Supreme Court raised the possibility of state
approval of same-sex marriage in 1993 -- a prospect the state's
voters later rejected -- many states and the federal government
passed laws denying recognition to such marriages.
</P>
<P>
   In the AP poll, a fourth of men, compared with four in 10 women,
said gay marriage should be allowed. One in five Republicans
favored such marriages compared with four of 10 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 1,012 people was taken May 17-21. Its error margin
was plus or minus 3 percentage points, slightly larger for the
split sample.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a certain sanctity to man, woman and family,'' said
Bill Allen, a 57-year-old retired chemical engineer from
Elizabethtown, Ky. He often votes Republican and considers himself
a moderate. Allen says gay marriage ''is an insult to the whole
concept'' of marriage and family life.
</P>
<P>
   Gay marriage is a new concept to most people, according to Evan
Wolfson, with the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, an
organization that litigates for the rights of gays and lesbians.
Wolfson tracks the progress of efforts nationwide to achieve gay
marriage rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''Vermont has now given people an example of how the sky will
not fall,'' Wolfson said. ''We are looking at where we can move
forward. Where the next breakthrough will come is not clear.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll indicated almost a sliding scale of acceptance of gay
marriage. For adults between 18 and 34, some 54 percent thought gay
people should be allowed to marry, while only 14 percent of those
over 65 felt that way.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they eventually will have those rights,'' said Tom
Wilson, a 47-year-old electrial engineer from Sacramento, Calif.,
who doesn't favor gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Sentiment differed sharply among those who believe gays are born
with that sexual orientation, about a third of those questioned,
and those who believe they choose to live that way, almost half:
</P>
<P>
   --A majority, 59 percent, of those who felt gays are born said
they should be allowed to marry.
</P>
<P>
   --Two thirds, 69 percent, of those who felt gays choose their
orientation said they should not be allowed to marry.
</P>
<P>
   For Sonia Groshong, a 47-year-old homemaker from the town of
Sultan near Seattle, her close acquaintance with gay people has
made her more accepting of gay marriage, even though she still has
reservations about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''My belief is that they know what they're doing and they have
to live in society, too,'' Groshong said. ''They're people. Whether
I feel it's wrong or not, they should be treated as people.''

<HEADLINE> New N.M. Fire Burns 22,000 Acres  </HEADLINE>
By DEBORAH BAKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PECOS, N.M. (AP) -- Firefighters worked Wednesday to turn the
front edge of a 23,500-acre fire north toward the Pecos Wilderness
and away from the main watershed for Las Vegas, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   It's an ambitious plan, ''but I think it's do-able,'' Van
Bateman, incident commander for the fire, told a news conference
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ground crews with bulldozers cut fire lines to protect the
Gallinas Canyon watershed a mile away, while air tankers carrying
fire retardant and helicopters carrying buckets of water hit the
fire from above.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday evening, fire spokeswoman Maria Garcia said flames had
reached the canyon.
</P>
<P>
   ''The far north end of the fire has reached what is essentially
considered the upper portion of the Gallinas watershed,'' she said.
''However, water quality has not been affected.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said trees, roots and other vegetation further down the
canyon act as a natural filtering system for the watershed and can
still remove ash.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a growing possibility that more moisture might
aid firefighters over the next few days, National Weather Service
meteorologist Mike Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   The columns of smoke that roiled skyward Tuesday were gone
Wednesday as thick smoke hovered over the burned and burning area,
blanketing Interstate 25 in spots. The air was hazy and smelled of
smoke in Las Vegas, a city of about 15,000 east of Santa Fe. The
city is about 12 miles from the blaze and out of its path,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the West, wildfires have scorched parts of Arizona,
California, Colorado and Utah. Hot, dry weather has left huge
sections of the region vulnerable, and the heat was expected to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   A wildfire set by lightning May 24 had burned through 9,500 dry
acres of Kaibab National Forest in Arizona. Firefighters had the
blaze about 40 percent contained Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Wraps Up Sugar Harvest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba's crucial sugar harvest yielded slightly less
than the government's target of 4.1 million metric tons, but
officials noted Wednesday that final figures still show an
improvement over the previous harvest.
</P>
<P>
   The final production figure for the 1999-2000 harvest was 4.05
million metric tons, the Communist Party daily Granma reported.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper quoted Cuba's sugar minister, Gen. Ulises Rosales
del Toro, as saying that authorities decided to call the harvest
finished and not cause ''pointless damage'' to the sugar industry
by insisting that the goal be met.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba reported production of 3.8 million metric tons for the
1998-1999 harvest.
</P>
<P>
   Although no longer Cuba's No. 1 source of hard currency, sugar
remains a key part of the communist island's economy -- accounting
for about half of all export income -- and its harvest remains a key
indicator of overall economic health. Tourism has overtaken sugar
in recent years as Cuba's top money maker.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Fidel Castro's government use the sugar production
figures as proof that the country still remains in financial crisis
a decade after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba's sugar industry has been hard hit by low prices on the
world market.
</P>
<P>
   While Cuba exported an increase of 571,000 tons of sugar from
the 1998-1999 harvest over the previous harvest, export income from
sugar was $117 million less, Rosales de Toro said.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Sentenced in Murder Scheme  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- A criminal defense lawyer and former federal
probation officer was sentenced Wednesday to eight years in prison
for hiring a hit man to kill two of his former clients.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick R. Ford, 48, pleaded guilty in January to two counts
of planning a murder-for-hire, U.S. Attorney Donald K. Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   Stern said Ford tried to hire a hit man to kill two former
clients who he thought could implicate him in a plot to kidnap a
wealthy marijuana dealer.
</P>
<P>
   The man he tried to hire for $11,000 was an undercover agent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just want them dead,'' Ford told the agent, according to
court documents. ''I don't want them to suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern said Ford proposed the kidnapping and expected to profit
from the ransom money. He said the investigation into the
kidnapping plot continues.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Cardinal John O'Connor left nearly all of his
possessions to church groups, according to his will filed
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor left most of his religious items to the New York

   The exception was the chalice that he was given when he was

   Mother Agnes Mary Donovan, head of the order, called the bequest

<HEADLINE> Ex-Hong Kong Governor Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Former Hong Kong Gov. Lord MacLehose, the first
official to discuss the delicate issue of handing over the British
colony with Beijing, has died. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   He died Saturday, according to newspaper reports. No cause or
location of death was given.
</P>
<P>
   As the British governor of Hong Kong from 1971 to 1982,
MacLehose oversaw the colony's development from a small trading
post into one of the most important industrial and commercial
centers in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   He also took a pragmatic approach to relations with China,
particularly as Britain's 99-year lease on the colony was quickly
approaching its end. In July 1997, Hong Kong -- a British colony for
156 years -- was formally handed back to China.
</P>
<P>
   It became a Special Administrative Region in China, with
guaranteed autonomy under a so-called ''one country, two systems''
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure, MacLehose tried to improve relations with
Beijing. He was the first governor to celebrate China Day and he
made a successful visit to the Chinese capital in 1979. When
MacLehose returned from the meetings, he reportedly assured Hong
Kong business leaders that they could ''put their hearts at ease.''
</P>
<P>
   While MacLehose was widely credited with helping Hong Kong
prosper economically, some accused him of being too trusting of the
Chinese and failing to introduce Western-style democracy to the
colony.
</P>
<P>
   MacLehose summed up his opposition to full elections, saying:
''If the communists won, that would be the end of Hong Kong. If the
nationalists won, that would bring in the communists,'' according
to The Daily Telegraph.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the London-based newspaper, MacLehose later
admitted that his opposition to introducing full democracy was
''the sort of thing one looks back at and wonders whether one
should have done it.'' But MacLehose added: ''I still think I was
right.''
</P>
<P>
   After his retirement, MacLehose returned to Britain, but he was
in attendance in 1997 when Hong Kong was formally handed back to
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Noel, and two daughters. A funeral
service was planned for Friday in southern Scotland and a memorial
service in London was to be announced later, his family said.

<HEADLINE> NY Teen's Death Ruled Homicide  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) --Soon after Josh Slaughter was born, police say he
was shaken so violently his brain was injured, causing the onset of
cerebral palsy. Police arrested his mother and she later pleaded
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 14 years later, the medical examiner's office has ruled his
death in April a homicide, stemming from the shaking when he was
about 3 months old.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney is reviewing the case and has not decided
whether charges will be brought against Mitzi Slaughter, 38, in her
son's death.
</P>
<P>
   She was questioned by police on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Slaughter had pleaded guilty in 1988 to second-degree assault
for shaking her son and served a six-month jail sentence and five
years probation.
</P>
<P>
   After her arrest, Josh was placed in the care of the city's
children's welfare agency. He lived in foster homes until 1997,
when he was transferred to a facility run by United Cerebral Palsy
of New York State. Officials at that facility did not return calls
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   According to the medical examiner, Josh's death April 12 was
caused by bronchial pneumonia with septicemia, meaning he had a
blood infection. He also had complications stemming from a
neurological disorder that resulted from his being shaken as an
infant, said Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the medical
examiner's office.

<HEADLINE> Son of President Coolidge Dies  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER GRAFF
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- John Coolidge, the oldest living
offspring of an American president, died Wednesday at 93.
</P>
<P>
   The son of President Calvin Coolidge died at the
Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H., after being
hospitalized for respiratory problems, said a spokesman for the
Calvin Coolidge Memorial Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ''John Coolidge was very much like his father,'' said historian
Howard Coffin. ''He was a man of few words, but what came out were
well chosen.''
</P>
<P>
   John Coolidge was at military camp in the summer of 1923 when
his father became president upon the death of Warren Harding.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was taking summer military training at Fort Devens,
Massachusetts, and didn't know anything about it,'' John Coolidge
once said of his father's swearing in. ''In fact, the next morning,
I was standing in line for breakfast when a captain came by and
asked me if I'd seen the morning papers.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I told him no, he said, 'Your father is the president of
the United States.' Naturally, I was surprised, but nothing
changed. I guess a lot of people expected me to rush off to
Washington, but I stayed and finished training.
</P>
<P>
   ''Father wouldn't have it any other way.''
</P>
<P>
   John Coolidge was born Sept. 7, 1906, in Northampton, Mass. He
spent most of his adult life in Connecticut where he was a railroad
executive and operated a business in Hartford. He also worked to
preserve the buildings that make up the President Calvin Coolidge
State Historic Site.
</P>
<P>
   ''He bought property time and again when the state didn't have
money, and it became part of the site,'' said John Dumville of the
state division of historic preservation. ''He gave generously of
things that belonged to his mother and father.''
</P>
<P>
   Coolidge is survived by a daughter, three grandchildren and two
great-grandsons. His wife, Florence, died in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Unshaded Skipping Belmont Stakes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Unshaded, the winner of the Coolmore
Lexington Stakes and runner-up in the Peter Pan, will skip the
Belmont Stakes, according to trainer Carl Nafzger.
</P>
<P>
   Nafzger said Unshaded will skip the June 10 race because the
colt, the son of 1990 Kentucky Derby winner Unbridled, still has
much to learn.
</P>
<P>
   ''It takes a real experienced, focused colt to run in the
Belmont and I don't know if he's quite that mature yet,'' Nafzger
said. ''It takes a real focused horse to go a mile-and-a-half.''
</P>
<P>
   Unshaded, owned by James Tafel, is not nominated to the Visa
Triple Crown and would have to pay a $100,000 supplemental fee to
enter the Belmont. However, Nafzger said that was not a factor in
the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Nafzger said Unshaded would arrive at Churchill Downs on
Thursday after being shipped home from Belmont Park, where he
finished second to Postponed in the Grade II Peter Pan last week.
</P>
<P>
   The next possible start for the colt could be the Grade III
Round Table at Arlington International in Illinois the same day as
the Belmont, Nafzger said, aiming the colt toward the $1 million
Grade I Travers at Saratoga in August.

<HEADLINE> Penn State Baseball Coach Ill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- Penn State baseball coach Joe
Hindelang will miss a super-regional championship series in Texas
this weekend after suffering a mild heart attack early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Hindelang, 54, was in stable condition after being
transferred to the Hershey Medical Center, sports information
director Jeff Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant coach Randy Ford will fill in for Hindelang in the
best-of-three series against Texas that begins Friday night. The
winner goes to the College World Series in Omaha, Neb.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said Hindelang is expected to be released from the
hospital Saturday. Nelson also said doctors told Hindelang he won't
be able to travel for two weeks after he is released, making it
doubtful he would go to Omaha if Penn State advances.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our No. 1 concern, however, is that Joe receives the proper
medical attention and experiences a speedy and complete recovery,''
athletic director Tim Curley said.
</P>
<P>
   Hindelang started coaching the Nittany Lions in 1991 after
coaching at Lafayette and the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy. He
played baseball and basketball at Temple University.

<HEADLINE> Pirates 5, Marlins 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Wil Cordero and Jason Kendall homered as the
Pittsburgh Pirates completed a three-game sweep of the Florida
Marlins with a 5-2 victory Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Cordova (3-4) won his second straight start as the
Pirates matched their season high for consecutive wins with three.
They also won three straight May 5-7.
</P>
<P>
   Cordova pitched 6 2-3 innings, allowed two runs, 10 hits, struck
out five and walked one. Mike Williams got the last out for his
eighth save.
</P>
<P>
   Both of Pittsburgh's homers came off Florida starter Jesus
Sanchez (4-4).
</P>
<P>
   Warren Morris singled in the first for his seventh hit in 10
at-bats, and Cordero followed with his seventh homer.
</P>
<P>
   Derrek Lee hit his eighth homer in the second inning for Florida
to make it 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall hit a solo shot in the third to make it 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins got within a run in the fourth when Mike Lowell
doubled and scored on Alex Gonzalez's single.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pirates scored twice without a hit in the fourth.
Sanchez walked two batters and second baseman Luis Castillo made an
error. Mike Benjamin hit a sacrifice fly and another run scored on
Cordova's infield grounder to cap the scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez allowed five runs, four earned, five hits, struck out
four and walked three in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins have dropped 11 of 13 and were 2-7 on a road trip to
St. Louis, Cincinnati and Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
Notes: While the Pirates scored two runs without a hit, the
Marlins got three hits in the first and didn't score. Castillo was
picked off after he singled and Preston Wilson grounded into an
inning-ending double play. ... Florida's Brant Brown has struck out
30 times in 70 at-bats. Brown grounded into a double play as a
pinch hitter. ... The Pirates' only other series sweep this season
was in Chicago, their other three-game winning streak. ... The
Pirates have won 11 of their last 13 home games against Florida.

FCC Change Will Lower Phone Bills

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- All telephone customers are expected to see savings
beginning with their July long-distance bills under a dramatic overhaul devised
by the industry and adopted by the Federal Communications Commission today.
People who make few or no long-distance calls could see their bills drop by as
much as 50 percent. The commission cut by $3.2 billion the ''access fees'' that
local phone companies charge long-distance carriers to connect calls -- costs
that are typically assessed to consumers. Long-distance companies have pledged
to pass on the savings, meaning their customers should see lower rates.

<HEADLINE> Former Neb. Star Pleads Innocent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Pleas of innocent to six charges,
including an alleged beating of a girlfriend, were entered on
Wednesday by Lawrence Phillips, the former Nebraska star whose
personal problems cut short his pro football career.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Elden Fox ordered Phillips held in lieu of
$630,000 bond, the amount requested by prosecutors. But Fox also
ordered another bail hearing Thursday and scheduled a preliminary
hearing for June 13.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old running back had a previous domestic violence
arrest involving a girlfriend while in college and was put on
probation. Another probation sentence resulted from his plea of no
contest in Plantation, Fla., to a charge of hitting a woman in a
bar.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest incident, police were called to a Beverly Hills
residence about 4 a.m. Saturday, where officers said they found
Phillips' girlfriend had been attacked. He was arrested when he
arrived at the home about eight hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips pleaded innocent to felony counts of corporal injury on
a cohabitant, making a terrorist threat and conspiring to dissuade
a witness, as well as misdemeanor counts of carrying a concealed
firearm in a vehicle, carrying a loaded firearm and vandalism with
damage of less than $400.
</P>
<P>
   A first-round draft choice of the St. Louis Rams in 1996,
Phillips was later released for insubordination. He was
subsequently released by the Miami Dolphins after the misdemeanor
battery conviction in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   He revived his career with stellar play in NFL Europe in 1999
and was signed by the San Francisco 49ers, only to be cut for
missing practice.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Jim Popp of the Canadian Football League's
Montreal Alouettes said he recently spoke with Phillips about
playing for his team.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was ready right then and there to come up to Montreal and
get ready for the season,'' Popp said. ''Then he backed off. He
wanted to wait. We haven't really talked since.''

<HEADLINE> Dodgers' Hundley Placed on DL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Catcher Todd Hundley was placed on the 15-day
disabled list Wednesday by the Los Angeles Dodgers because of a
strained rib cage muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley, batting .290 with 13 homers and 33 RBIs, strained the
abdominal oblique muscle in his right rib cage Tuesday night while
running the bases in a 10-5 loss to the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like I have a knife stuck in me right now,'' Hundley
said before the finale of the three-game series. ''On the average,
injuries like this take three to six weeks till you feel 100
percent, but there's no guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only good thing about it is that it's not the cartilage
between the ribs. That could be six months because the rib cage is
very delicate. But we have it centered, and we know exactly where
it's at.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11-year veteran, who broke Roy Campanella's major league
record for catchers with 41 home runs in 1996 with the Mets, was
finally feeling 100 percent healthy for the first time since
undergoing elbow surgery in September 1997 before this latest
mishap.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just a little bump in the road,'' Hundley said. ''Now
I've got to work twice as hard to get back from this, once the
doctors clear me and say it's safe to go back to lifting weights
and working out again. It'll be real delicate the next two weeks.
The trick is not to aggravate it and start all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred in the sixth inning, following Hundley's
leadoff double. He took off on a broken-bat single to center by
Dave Hansen, and was about five steps from third base when he
turned to his right to see if center fielder Melvin Mora would have
a chance to make at play at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Hundley felt a burning sensation and eased up. A few
minutes later, he staggered off the field and into the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole muscle went,'' said Hundley, who was examined
Wednesday morning by doctors Frank Jobe and Ralph Gambardella.
''The way it was explained to me, the muscle completely expanded
and then completely contracted -- all in one shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley, who turned 31 last Saturday, is going on the DL for the
fourth time in his career. Backup catcher Chad Kreuter, whose
eight-game suspension stemming from an altercation in the stands
with a fan at Wrigley Field is under appeal, started Wednesday
night's game for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Infielder Alex Cora was recalled from Triple-A Albuquerque to
fill Hundley's roster spot.

<HEADLINE> Philly School Takeover Averted  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER BROWN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Mayor John F. Street announced a plan
Wednesday to bail out the Philadelphia schools, averting a state
takeover of the financially strapped school district -- at least
through next year.
</P>
<P>
   The state will put up nearly $70 million through deferred taxes
and the city will add $20 million under the plan, though Street
said it was unclear how the city would come up with its share of
the money. The school board approved also about $30 million in cuts
Wednesday, primarily in administrative offices, teacher training
programs and staffing in a comprehensive day-care program.
</P>
<P>
   The state agreed it will not take over the schools under that
deal, Street and Gov. Tom Ridge said.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 law allows the governor to take over the city's schools
if the school board does not produce a valid budget or state
officials determine that it is not educating pupils well enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a good agreement for the city, and a good agreement
for the state,'' Ridge said. ''It gives Philadelphia parents the
certainty they deserve that their schools will be open next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Street said the deal was good for Philadelphia's children.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think there can't be a world-class city if we have a
second-class education system,'' Street said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the temporary solution, the school district's budget
crisis is not over, the mayor said. The city and state still must
work out a long-term solution to the school district's perpetual
budget problems.
</P>
<P>
   After Street's announcement, the Philadelphia School Board
approved about $30 million in cuts to help reduce the budget
shortfall. The 2001 budget still has an $80 million lump-sum
deficit, board member Rhonda Chatzkel said.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Money May Insure Kids  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTINE HANLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- This city at the heart of booming
Silicon Valley is considering an ambitious and unprecedented plan
that would use the national tobacco settlement to make sure every
child in town has health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   In a city where even middle-class professionals struggle with
the cost of living, six of the 10 members of the City Council back
the plan. It would use the settlement money and revenues from
California's cigarette tax to insure every one of San Jose's 36,692
children who are not covered.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's been a lot of discussion that the region has become so
obsessed with wealth that it's lost its heart and soul,'' said Bob
Brownstein, policy director for an organization called Working
Partnerships, which helped draft the plan. ''It would be nice to
have San Jose be the first city in the country to make this kind of
commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-six states and several cities and counties are debating
how to spend their shares of the $206 billion owed to them after
suing the tobacco industry to recoup the costs of treating sick
smokers. Many municipalities plan to use the money for purposes
unrelated to health -- deficit reduction, schools, capital
construction.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, Mayor Richard Riordan suggested using the city's
share to cover lawsuits arising out of a police scandal. The City
Council rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
   In Orange County, the Board of Supervisors voted to use some of
its $912 million to build jails and reduce its bankruptcy debt.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose is believed to be the first municipality to try to
earmark a portion of its share -- $10 million per year for 25 years
-- to cover all insured children. The plan would cost $1.8 million
to launch and about $6 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Ron Gonzales had suggested spending the money on senior
services, tobacco education and schools. But he tabled that plan
Tuesday after the majority of the council backed the children's
health insurance initiative. His spokesman, David Vossbrink, said
the mayor believes it's worth looking into the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, the city would set aside $2 million each
year, and that would be matched by surrounding Santa Clara County,
which expects to get $18.5 million per year from the settlement.
About $500,000 would come from the cigarette tax revenues and about
$2 million more would come from foundations and private donors.
</P>
<P>
   A decision could come as soon as two weeks, when both the city
and county are expected to pass their budgets. A simple majority is
required at both levels.
</P>
<P>
   ''The benefits of this would be enormous, and if we do it,
there's a good chance others will follow suit,'' said Councilwoman
Margie Matthews, one of the six who favor the plan.

<P>
   San Jose has not been short on philanthropic missions in the
Internet boom, with several dot-com companies recently offering
free computer hardware or software to schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   But programs like that don't have much impact on Leticia Lopez,
a single mother in San Jose who constantly worries that her three
sons or daughter might come down with an illness too expensive to
treat.
</P>
<P>
   She earns $8 an hour as a janitor and housecleaner and makes too
much to get public assistance to help pay for health care. Her jobs
don't offer it and she can't afford it after paying $945 a month
for a two-bedroom apartment she says is infested with cockroaches
and rats, so her family has been uninsured for three years.
</P>
<P>
   ''My kids have no protection. They're out there on their own,''
Lopez said. ''We have a lot of fears. They get sick a lot, but I
just give them Tylenol or painkillers. I can't take them to the
emergency room because I can't afford it.''

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Katie Smith scored a franchise-record 34
points as the revamped Minnesota Lynx opened their second season
with a 73-62 victory over the Cleveland Rockers on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Kristin Folkl added 15 points for the Lynx, who withstood
several runs by the Rockers in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Smith also tied a team record with six 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Her previous career high was 27 points, set Aug. 11, 1999. The
old team record was 28 set twice last summer by Brandy Reed, who
was traded to Phoenix in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Smith topped both marks with her fifth 3-pointer with 7:52 left.
That gave her 29 points and provided the Lynx with a 56-51 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Eva Nemcova led the Rockers with 20 points, but she didn't get
to the free throw line, where she hit 62 straight last season after
missing her first.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockers trailed just 63-60 with 3{ minutes left but Smith
scored five points as the Lynx closed the game with a 10-2 run.
</P>
<P>
   The Lynx, who have just five players left from last year,
started an entirely new lineup from their inaugural opener a year
ago. Smith missed the opener last year while recovering from a knee
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Smith scored 18 points in the first 16 minutes and her fourth
3-pointer gave the Lynx a 34-24 lead. Nemcova then scored eight
points in an 11-1 run that tied it at 35 with just over a minute
left in the half, and the Rockers trailed 37-36 at halftime.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Herbert Perry hit a tiebreaking double in the
ninth inning Wednesday, leading the Chicago White Sox over the
Seattle Mariners 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Lee reached second with one out in the ninth when third
baseman John Mabry allowed the ball to go under his glove for a
two-base error.
</P>
<P>
   Perry followed with a ground-rule double to right off Kazuhiro
Sazaki.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Howry (1-1) pitched 1 2-3 hitless innings and Keith Foulke,
Chicago's fifth pitcher, got three outs for his 10th save.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's Aaron Sele allowed three runs and three hits in 6 1-3
innings. Cal Eldred gave up three runs, five hits and seven walks --
which matched his career high -- in 5 2-3 innings. He struck out
nine.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago manager Jerry Manuel missed the game to attend son
Anthony's high school graduation in Chicago and bench coach Joe
Nossek managed in his place.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle went ahead in the first when Eldred walked Mark
McLemore, Alex Rodriguez, Edgar Martinez and Mike Cameron.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lampkin homered in the second, but Carlos Lee cut it to 2-1
in the third when he homered for the third consecutive game, his
12th of the season.
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud had an RBI single in the fifth, but Chicago tied it
in the seventh when Chris Singleton singled, Herbert Perry was hit
by a pitch and Sele threw a wild pitch, and pinch-hitter Brook
Fordyce hit a two-run single off Arthur Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Eldred walked seven two other times. ... ... The White Sox
acquired INF Tony Graffanino from Tampa Bay for RHP Tanyon Sturtz.
Both Graffanino, who will be 28 next Tuesday, and Sturtze, 29, were
playing at Triple-A when the trade was made. The White Sox assigned
Graffanino to Triple-A Charlotte. ... Seattle LHP Jamie Moyer,
placed on the DL on April 21 because of a strained muscle in the
back of his left shoulder, will be on a pitch count when he returns
Friday night against San Diego. Trainer Rick Griffin said Wednesday
he expects Moyer to be held to 85-90 pitches. Moyer, 37, has been
on the DL three times in his major league career. The Mariners have
two other starting pitchers on the DL; RHPs Freddy Garcia
(fractured right tibia) and Gil Meche (strained right shoulder).

<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- John Coolidge, the oldest living
offspring of an American president, died Wednesday of respiratory
problems. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Coolidge was the son of President Calvin Coolidge who became
president in 1923 upon the death of Warren Harding.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Coolidge won election in his own right in 1924 but
decided against re-election in 1928.
</P>
<P>
   John Coolidge spent most of his adult life in Connecticut where
he was a railroad executive and operated a business in Hartford. He
also worked to preserve the buildings that make up the President
Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site.
John Sunshine Darley:
</P>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- John Sunshine Darley, a pilot who taught such
celebrities as singer John Denver and actor Cliff Robertson to fly,
died Sunday. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   Darley, who left his native Philippines for the United States in
1941, was the first private citizen to be appointed as a Federal
Aviation Administration examiner. He was inducted into the Colorado
Aviation Hall of Fame in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife started Aero Training of the Rockies in 1970.
His students included Denver and Robertson.
Donald W. Davies:
</P>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Donald W. Davies, whose pioneering work on data
transmission contributed to the development of the Internet, died
Sunday. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   Working at the National Physical Laboratory, Davies is credited
with coining the term ''packet switching'' in 1966 for data
transmission that is fundamental to the workings of the Internet.
He also led a team that built one of the first functioning networks
using packet data.
</P>
<P>
   Davies' team presented its paper at a 1967 conference in
Tennessee where Lawrence Roberts of the Advanced Research Projects
Agency of the U.S. Department of Defense presented a design for
creating a computer network. In the United States, this led to the
development of ARPANET, the prototype for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   His books included ''Communication Networks for Computers'' in
1973, ''Computer Networks and their Protocols'' in 1979, and
''Security for Computer Networks'' in 1984.
Robert Fryer:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Robert Fryer, a producer of some of
Broadway's best-known musicals, including ''Wonderful Town,''
''Sweet Charity,'' ''Mame'' and ''Chicago,'' died Sunday of
complications from Parkinson's disease. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Fryer usually produced with such partners as George Abbott,
Lawrence Carr, Mary Lea Johnson and James Nederlander.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, he produced ''A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,'' a musical
version of the best-selling Betty Smith novel.
</P>
<P>
   He had his first big success in 1953 with ''Wonderful Town,'' a
musical adaptation of ''My Sister Eileen,'' featuring a score by
Leonard Bernstein, Betty Comden and Adolph Green. The musical won
five Tony Awards, including one for its star, Rosalind Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later was ''Auntie Mame,'' another hit. He also
produced the musical version of the comedy, retitled ''Mame,''
which starred Angela Lansbury. Opening in 1966, the show ran 1,508
performances, the longest of any of Fryer's Broadway productions.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, he had another hit musical, ''Sweet Charity,''
starring Gwen Verdon.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, Fryer brought to Broadway the original production of
''Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   He also made several films that received Oscar nominations. His
movies include ''The Prime of Miss Jane Brodie,'' ''Travels With My
Aunt,'' ''The Boys From Brazil'' and ''The Shining.''
David Levinson:
</P>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- David Levinson, former managing editor
of the Long Beach Press-Telegram, died Tuesday of cancer. He was
70.
</P>
<P>
   He was hired as an editorial writer for the Press-Telegram in
1970. Levinson also worked as a features copy editor and music
critic, covering the Long Beach Symphony. He soon rose to the rank
of managing editor, a post he held until retiring in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Levinson had a lifelong fascination with used and rare books,
and turned his hobby into an at-home Internet business called Book
Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife and two sons.
Petter Lindstrom:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Dr. Petter Lindstrom, a neurosurgeon who was
abandoned by wife Ingrid Bergman in a high-profile affair a
half-century ago, died May 24. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Lindstrom was married to Bergman for 10 years, moving with her
from Sweden to the United States when her acting career took off
here in the late '30s and early '40s.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman began an affair with Italian director Roberto Rossellini
in 1948, leaving her husband and their daughter, Pia, to live with
Rossellini in Italy. She bore him a son, Roberto.
</P>
<P>
   The love triangle and out-of-wedlock birth shocked Bergman fans
who were used to seeing the screen idol playing nuns and martyrs.
The U.S. Senate even denounced the affair from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   She divorced Lindstrom in 1950 to marry Rossellini, and their
eight-year marriage produced two more children, Ingrid and
Isabella. Isabella Rossellini became a noted actress in her own
right. Bergman died in 1982.
Lord MacLehose:
</P>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Former Hong Kong Gov. Lord MacLehose, the first
official to discuss the delicate issue of handing over the British
colony with Beijing, died Saturday. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   As the British governor of Hong Kong from 1971 to 1982,
MacLehose oversaw the colony's development from a small trading
post into one of the most important industrial and commercial
centers in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   He also took a pragmatic approach to relations with China,
particularly as Britain's 99-year lease on the colony was quickly
approaching its end. In July 1997, Hong Kong -- a British colony for
156 years -- was formally handed back to China.
</P>
<P>
   It became a Special Administrative Region in China, with
guaranteed autonomy under a so-called ''one country, two systems''
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure, MacLehose tried to improve relations with
Beijing. He was the first governor to celebrate China Day and he
made a successful visit to the Chinese capital in 1979. When
MacLehose returned from the meetings, he reportedly assured Hong
Kong business leaders that they could ''put their hearts at ease.''
Joe Massimino:
</P>
<P>
   TUSTIN, Calif. (AP) -- Joe Massimino, longtime band leader for
''The Mike Douglas Show,'' died May 24 of complications from
stomach cancer. He was 64.
</P>
<P>
   Massimino won an Emmy during his 15 years leading the band for
talk show host Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   At 17, he was hired to play in Tommy Dorsey's band after an
audition where he impressed the big band leader by ripping through
Dorsey's ''T.D. Boogie,'' a tune he had committed to memory.
</P>
<P>
   He toured with Dorsey for three years, and went on to musical
associations with ''Tonight Show'' bandleader Doc Severinsen,
singer Joe Williams and the big bands of Buddy Rich and Louis
Bellson.
</P>
<P>
   Massimino was known as a be-bop-based improviser who usually
worked at an acoustic piano.

<HEADLINE> Miss. Jumper Beats World Leader  </HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Superman reigned supreme.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi's Savante Stringfellow, who has Superman tattoos on
his biceps and calf and wears a Superman T-shirt during warmups,
won the men's long jump at the NCAA Track and Field Championships
on Wednesday night, beating world leader Melvin Lister of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Stringfellow, last year's national champion but the runner-up to
Lister at this season's Southeastern Conference Championships,
soared 26 feet, 9} inches, and had four of the five best jumps in
the competition in beating his rival for the third time in five
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   His other big jumps were 26-8\ and two at 26-5 before fouling on
his final two attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tried to come out and set the tone,'' said Stringfellow,
ranked fourth in the world this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew so much was riding on this. This was Melvin's last
collegiate long jump and I didn't want to make it a happy
celebration for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lister, the defending champion and with a best of 27-10\ at the
SEC Championships, appeared listless, finishing fourth at 26-0.
</P>
<P>
   ''He looked lackadaisical out there,'' Arkansas jumps coach Dick
Booth said after watching Lister's first three attempts. ''He's not
running fast. He's got to hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lister never hit it, going 25-1}, 25-4}, 25-11 and fouling twice
before reaching his best on his final attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was the worst Melvin Lister you'll ever see,'' the
Razorbacks' star said. ''You'll never see that Melvin Lister again.
I wasn't into it. I had a bad day.''
</P>
<P>
   Lister had swept the long jump and triple jump at the NCAA
Indoor Championships in March, when Stringfellow failed to qualify
for the long jump final, and was favored to repeat at the outdoor
championships. He'll get a shot to redeem himself in the triple
jump final Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Auburn discus thrower Gabor Mate, who continually
watches films of 1976 Olympic champion Mac Wilkins, won a gold
medal for the second straight year.
</P>
<P>
   To cap his performance, the sophomore from Hungary smashed
Wilkins' 18-year-old stadium record with a toss of 215-8 on his
final throw. Wilkins had set the mark of 212-6 in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm proud I broke the Olympic champion stadium's record,'' the
fun-loving Mate said. ''He was an awesome thrower.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's one of my idols because of his consistency in meets. His
distances were impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Mate opened with a big throw and was so elated that he kissed
the ground. After his final throw, he kissed his left footprint
where he started in the back of the discus circle.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before the first throw, I felt a lot of pressure to perform
well and pull out a good throw,'' Mate said. ''Afterward, I felt
relief.
</P>
<P>
   ''After the last throw, I had a special feeling for the meet. I
like to do something special, something unique, something
original.''
</P>
<P>
   Mate did something unusual earlier in the season. He and
roommate Reedus Thurmond, who finished third at 203-7, decided that
whoever surpassed 215 feet would have to dye his hair. Mate did it
March 26, setting the collegiate record of 219-6. So his
brownish-black hair now has a lot of blonde flowing through it.
</P>
<P>
   That won't last long. After winning the national title again,
Mate said he would dye his hair orange and blue -- Auburn's colors.
</P>
<P>
   Before this season, Mate had set a modest goal of making the
Hungarian Olympic team. Now, his aim is much loftier.
</P>
<P>
   ''As my performances grew, I got greedier,'' he said. ''I think
the Olympic final will be my goal now.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, SMU's Florence Ezeh won her second consecutive
women's hammer throw title with a meet-record 211-10, breaking the
previous mark of 209-4 by South Carolina's Lisa Misipeka set in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Ezeh, who is unbeaten this year, also won the 20-pound weight
throw title indoors. The indoor victory came on her final attempt.
The outdoor championship was less dramatic, her best throw coming
on her fourth of six attempts.
</P>
<P>
   It took a while for Ezeh, a native of France, to get going
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''On my first throw I was so tense I couldn't throw,'' she said.
''On my second, I tried to improve but I couldn't really. The third
didn't work out.
</P>
<P>
   ''Between flights (the third and fourth rounds), since nothing
was working out, I prayed and it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   In the other final, Tara Rohatinsky led a 1-2 BYU finish in the
women's 10,000 meters with a time of 33 minutes, 49.24 seconds.
Marty Hernandez was runner-up in 33:50.45.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas, favored to win its record-tying ninth consecutive
men's title, saw Sam Glover post the fastest time in the heats of
the 400 hurdles, 49.58, and James Karanu win his 800 heat in
1:47.91, but teammate D'Marcus Brown didn't qualify for Saturday's
hurdles final, Danny Lincoln failed to advance through the heats of
the 3,000 steeplechase and the Razorbacks' 400 relay team placed
last in its qualifying heat.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA, the women's NCAA indoor champion and among the favorites
for the outdoor title, also lost its 400 relay team for Saturday's
final as the Bruins finished last in their heat.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays 4, Orioles 3  </HEADLINE>
By FRED GOODALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- The Tampa Bay Devil Rays finished
off the Baltimore Orioles not once, but twice Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   B.J. Surhoff's grounder off reliever Roberto Hernandez's glove
went to shortstop Felix Martinez, who threw the ball to first for
the final out in Tampa Bay's 4-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   After first-base umpire Brian Runge called Surhoff out, the
Devil Rays came on the field to shake hands in celebration of the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Surhoff, Orioles manager Mike Hargrove and first-base
coach Eddie Murray argued the call. That's when third-base ump John
Shulock overruled Runge, saying Fred McGriff's foot came off first
base.
</P>
<P>
   So after a nine-minute delay, which included Tampa Bay manager
Larry Rothschild saying he would play in protest, the game resumed.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Johnson singled before Hernandez struck out Brady
Anderson to end it with the tying run on third.
</P>
<P>
   McGriff's 399th career homer, a two-run shot off Buddy Groom
with one out in the eighth inning, led Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   McGriff had gone 36 at-bats since May 17 without a homer when he
pulled a 1-2 pitch into the right-field stands as Baltimore's
bullpen squandered another late-inning lead, this time denying Mike
Mussina a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Mecir (4-1) pitched two-thirds of an inning, while Hernandez
got his fifth save in nine opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Mussina allowed two runs, four hits and struck out five in seven
innings. Groom (3-3) replaced him at the start the eighth and gave
up a leadoff walk to Jose Guillen, who took second on Randy Winn's
sacrifice bunt.
</P>
<P>
   McGriff was stuck in a 7-for-40 slump when he delivered his
game-winning homer, the only extra-base hit by either team.
</P>
<P>
   Will Clark and Cal Ripken Jr. hit RBI singles off Cory Lidle in
the fourth, and Lidle hit Ripken with the bases loaded to force in
a run for a 3-1 lead in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Vinny Castilla had RBI singles in the first and sixth off
Mussina, but the rest of the Devil Rays hitters were 0-for-5 with
runners in scoring position against the Baltimore starter.
</P>
<P>
   Mussina is off to the worst start of his career, primarily
because of poor run support this season. He ended a four-game
losing streak when he beat Seattle last week and was tough on the
Devil Rays after a hit batter, a walk and Castilla's RBI single
gave Tampa Bay a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander retired 12 in a row before Martinez singled
with two outs in the fifth and stole second.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays lost the first two games of the series while
going 3-for-26 with runners in scoring position, and missed out on
another opportunity when Gerald Williams popped out to second base
to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Lidle shut down the Orioles for three innings, allowing only two
baserunners before Mike Bordick singled to open the fourth. Clark
went to second when Guillen misplayed his RBI single for an error,
and Ripken followed with his run-scoring single for a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Tampa Bay starter ran into more trouble in the sixth when he
gave up one-out singles to Delino DeShields and Albert Belle and
walked Clark to load the bases. Lidle left after hitting Ripken in
the back to drive in DeShields to make it 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays escaped further damage when reliever Mark Guthrie
struck out Harold Baines and Surhoff flied to deep right.
</P>
<P>
   Castilla's second RBI single trimmed Baltimore's lead to 3-2.
But Mussina got Bubba Trammell to fly out, then struck out Mike
DeFelice with runners at second and third to get out of the jam.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Lidle became the 10th Devil Rays pitcher to start this
season. Anaheim has also used 10, the only other AL team to start
as many. Tampa Bay used 12 different starters in 1998 and 13 last
year ... Baltimore has gotten six or more innings from starting
pitchers in eight consecutive games ... Mussina didn't allow a
homer for the second straight game, and third time overall. He
began the night tied for the league lead with 15 homers allowed. He
yielded 16 all of last season.

<HEADLINE> Expos 10, Reds 4  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Vladimir Guerrero homered twice to jump-start
Montreal's slumping offense and Jose Vidro drove in four runs as
the Expos beat the Cincinnati Reds 10-4 Wednesday, ending a
six-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos' injury-ravaged pitching staff got a boost from
reliever Mike Johnson (1-0), who filled in for Hideki Irabu and
gave up only two hits in five innings. Johnson had a career-high
seven strikeouts and retired his last 13 batters.
</P>
<P>
   Dustin Hermanson took over in the sixth and kept the streak
going, stretching it to 21 Reds retired in order before Aaron Boone
homered in the eighth to start a three-run outburst. Hermanson will
move back into the rotation next week to fill in for Irabu, out for
a month after surgery Wednesday for torn knee cartilage.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching hasn't been the Expos' biggest problem during their
longest losing streak of the season. Injuries, errors and a feeble
offense have done them in on a 2-6 road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal was outscored 42-13 in the first seven games of the
trip, stranding 50 runners. The low point came Tuesday night, when
22 Expos went down in order during a 4-2 series-opening loss to the
Reds.
</P>
<P>
   The offense broke out Wednesday as Guerrero hit solo homers in
the second and ninth innings -- his third multihomer game of the
season -- and Peter Bergeron had the first four-hit game of his
career. Montreal had 16 hits overall, matching its season high.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero got it going with a homer off Steve Parris (2-7)
leading off the second inning, his 14th of the season and his first
since May 18.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Stevens' double and Orlando Cabrera's two-out single put the
Expos ahead to stay 2-1 in the fifth, and Montreal knocked Parris
out of the game with two more runs in the sixth. Vidro doubled home
the first run and Stevens had a run-scoring single off Dennys
Reyes.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos pulled away by batting around for four runs in the
seventh off Elmer Dessens. Vidro's double drove in two more runs
and gave him 23 multihit games, most in the NL. Guerrero added an
RBI double and completed Montreal's scoring with a leadoff homer in
the ninth, raising his average to .386.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in Parris' career that he struggled
against the Expos. He had won his other three starts, allowing only
for runs for a 1.54 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. went 0-for-3 with a pair of strikeouts, leaving
him hitless in his last 14 at-bats. A 4-for-40 skid has dropped his
average to .212.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Hermanson made seven starts before moving into the bullpen
to fill in for injured closer Ugueth Urbina. He threw 40 pitches
Wednesday as manager Felipe Alou tried to get him back into
starting shape. ... In addition to putting Irabu on the 15-day DL,
the Expos called up RHP Matt Skrmetta from Triple-A Ottawa. ... RHP
Mike Thurman will fly to Birmingham, Ala., on Thursday so Dr. James
Andrews can examine his sore right elbow. Thurman went on the DL
May 26. ... Johnson hadn't started a game since last Aug. 13. ...
Montreal has eight pitchers and two catchers on the DL. ... The
Reds will wear their 1975 doubleknit uniforms against the Twins on
Saturday as part of their Big Red Machine reunion. ... The Reds
announced in the ninth that OF Alex Ochoa had been taken to a
hospital for an emergency appendectomy and will be out for three
weeks.

<HEADLINE> Grizzlies Expected To Name Coach  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- The Vancouver Grizzlies
called a news conference for Thursday and were expected to
introduce Sidney Lowe as their new coach.
</P>
<P>
   Grizzlies president Dick Versace has been negotiating with Lowe,
a former NBA player and head coach with the Minnesota Timberwolves,
for the past few weeks. Several reports have said Lowe has agreed
to accept the job.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe was a member of North Carolina State's 1983 national
championship team, then spent parts of four seasons in the NBA
playing for Charlotte, Indiana, Atlanta, Detroit and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last seven seasons, Lowe has spent time as an assistant
coach in Cleveland and Minnesota. He was the Wolves' head coach
from January 1993 until the end of the 1993-94 season. During that
stretch he compiled a 33-102 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Hill was fired as Vancouver's coach in December and was
replaced by Lionel Hollins. The Grizzlies finished with a 22-60
record and managed to set a modest franchise record for wins in a
season. Since their inception, the Grizzlies have a 78-300 record.
</P>
<P>
   The Grizzlies are entering their sixth NBA season, but the first
since Chicago businessman Michael Heisley paid $160 million to buy
the franchise. The team lost an estimated $25 million last season.

<HEADLINE> Hitchcock Out at Least 8 Weeks  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- San Diego Padres opening day starter Sterling
Hitchcock will be out at least eight weeks because of a sprained
ligament in his left elbow.
</P>
<P>
   He might need reconstructive surgery, which would sideline him
for a year or longer.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock got a second opinion on Wednesday from Anaheim Angels
Dr. Lewis Yocum, who recommended surgery, Padres trainer Todd
Hutcheson said.
</P>
<P>
   The three options for treating Hitchcock's injury range from
rehabilitation, which would take about eight weeks; arthroscopic
surgery, which could sideline him for a little longer than eight
weeks; or Tommy John reconstructive surgery, Hutcheson said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors wouldn't know if reconstructive surgery is needed until
they got into the elbow and saw the extent of the damage, Hutcheson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hitch has to make a decision whether he's going to go that
route or have another opinion or have a rehab,'' Hutcheson said.
''Whichever way he goes, it's our job to make sure he gets back as
quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Surgery was one of the options suggested by the Padres' medical
staff.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock, who sprained his ulnar collateral ligament while
pitching against Montreal on Friday night, wasn't available for
comment before Wednesday night's game against Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock's is the latest in a string of injuries that has
ravaged San Diego's staff. He was put on the 15-day disabled list
Wednesday, joining five other pitchers sidelined by injuries.
Another starter, Woody Williams, had an aneurysm in his right
armpit surgically removed on May 4 and isn't expected back until
around the All-Star break. Brian Boehringer, who opened the season
in the rotation, recently came back from the DL and is pitching in
relief.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock, the MVP of San Diego's victory over Atlanta in the
1998 NL Championship Series, is 1-6 with a 4.93 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Hitchcock picks rehab over surgery, he might still need
to have the ligament repaired later, Hutcheson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once the ligament gets stretched, it will heal but it will
never return to its normal length,'' Hutcheson said. ''It will
always be stretched out. The more it stretches, the more the elbow
gaps, and the more it gaps, the more stresses there are on the
other structures, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''So if he decides not to have surgery, there's a greater chance
that it's going to flare up and he'd need to have something done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres promoted two pitchers this week to get them through
the series with Milwaukee. Adam Eaton was brought up from Double-A
Mobile and won his major league debut on Tuesday night, and Rodrigo
Lopez was recalled from Triple-A Las Vegas to start Wednesday
night.

<HEADLINE> Mud Slide Kills 13 in Guatemala  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- A mudslide triggered by torrential rains
swept through a town in northern Guatemala, killing 13 people and
injuring 24 others, Defense Minister Juan Estrada said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The slide on Tuesday buried 21 homes in Senahu, about 75 miles
northeast of Guatemala City.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities called off the search for more victims Wednesday,
saying everyone had been accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada said officials won't know the extent of the damage for
at least a week, and their efforts Wednesday were cut short by
another bout of torrential rains.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any further digging and clean-up might have caused further mud
slides,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers said the slide left Senahu without drinkable
water and with almost no food, but that government supply trucks
dispatched Wednesday morning had trouble reaching the area because
of impassable roads.

Clinton Asked To Name More Monuments
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt today asked President
Clinton to declare four new national monuments, including one at the Hanford
nuclear reservation in Washington state that would protect 200,000 acres. The
other three would protect nearly 351,000 acres of federal land in Oregon,
Colorado and Arizona. If Clinton approves the request, as expected, he will have
used the Antiquities Act to protect nearly 3.7 million acres -- the second most
by a U.S. president.

Philly School Takeover Averted

million through deferred taxes and the city will add $20 million under the plan,
though Street said it was unclear how the city would come up with its share of
the money. The school board approved also about $30 million in cuts today,
primarily in administrative offices, teacher training programs and staffing in a

People who make few or no long-distance calls could see their bills drop by as

<HEADLINE> UN Delegation Heads to Sierra Leone  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- A high-level U.N. delegation is heading to
Sierra Leone to determine why about 500 U.N. peacekeepers were
taken hostage by rebels earlier this month, a U.N. spokesman said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The team led by former assistant secretary-general for
peacekeeping Manfred Eisele was scheduled to leave New York late
Wednesday for Conakry, Guinea, en route to the Sierra Leone
capital, Freetown, said spokesman Fred Eckhard.
</P>
<P>
   Eckhard announced last week that Secretary-General Kofi Annan
was dispatching a delegation to assess problems in the peacekeeping
mission and make recommendations to improve it.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Leone mission -- currently the largest U.N.
peacekeeping operation -- has been criticized for its poorly trained
and badly equipped soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   In a report to the Security Council last week, Annan said
lessons needed to be learned from the operation of the U.N. mission
and the capture of the peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Also hoping to help end the fighting were representatives of six
West African countries who were planning to travel to Sierra Leone
over the weekend to negotiate a cease-fire between government and
rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
   The group will meet leaders of the rebel Revolutionary United
Front at an undisclosed location and try and bring them to the
bargaining table, said Adrienne Diop, spokeswoman of the Economic
Community of West African States.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, rebels freed what were believed to be the last of the
peacekeepers. U.N. officials said four were believed to have died
in fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels killed tens of thousands and intentionally mutilated
many more during an eight-year civil war. A peace agreement signed
last July has been broken repeatedly, and many rebels have refused
to turn in their weapons to U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. force, which Eckhard said currently stands at 11,280
soldiers, had been expected to reach 13,000 troops by the end of
June.
</P>
<P>
   West African leaders agreed Monday to contribute an additional
3,000 soldiers, which would bring the total closer to the 16,500
recommended by Annan.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. delegation which will assess the Sierra Leone
peacekeeping operation also includes Maj. Gen. Timothy Ford of
Australia, a former chief of staff in U.N. peacekeeping operations
in the Middle East; Leonard Kapungu, head of the lessons learned
unit in the U.N. peacekeeping department; Peter Phalen, the
department's chief of logistics; and Margaret Carey, one of the
department's political affairs experts.

<HEADLINE> Babbitt: Name More Monuments  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HUGHES
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt on Wednesday
asked President Clinton to declare four new national monuments,
including one at the Hanford nuclear reservation in Washington
state that would protect 200,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   The other three would protect nearly 351,000 acres of federal
land in Oregon, Colorado and Arizona. If Clinton approves the
request, as expected, he will have used the Antiquities Act to
protect nearly 3.7 million acres -- the second most by a U.S.
president.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are priceless natural landscapes that have somehow
remained almost untouched by exploitation, development and urban
sprawl,'' Babbitt said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he will carefully consider the requests. ''Each of
the areas recommended today represents an exceptional,
irreplaceable piece of America's natural and cultural heritage,''
he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   But some western lawmakers were upset, saying Clinton should go
through Congress if he wants to protect land.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not what the Antiquities Act was intended for,'' said
Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz. ''It was not designed for the creation of
another Yellowstone.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush
criticized the Clinton administration for designating state land
for national monuments without close consultation with state
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it comes to Western states, the president ought to be
consulting with members of the congressional and senatorial
delegations from a state like Arizona before the president moves
unilaterally to remove vast tracts of land,'' Bush said during his
first trip to Arizona since he forced Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
out of the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bill Arthur of the Sierra Club in Seattle said he was
pleased with Babbitt's decision. ''It is a clear indication that
the administration is using the authority that is vested in it to
seek and secure protection for important places,'' Arthur said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hanford Reach National Monument would protect 51 miles of
the Columbia River that is one of the largest, undisturbed river
stretches in the United States and a critical spawning ground for
salmon.
</P>
<P>
   The stretch has been left in pristine condition because it was
part of a security buffer in the 560-square-mile reservation where
the government made plutonium for the nation's nuclear arsenal from
World War II until the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Hanford is also being cleaned up as the nation's most
contaminated nuclear site, but that contaminated area is miles away
from the river stretch proposed for protection.
</P>
<P>
   Other monuments requested by Babbitt include:
</P>
<P>
   --Canyons of the Ancients National Monument, 164,000 acres of
Bureau of Land Management land in Colorado that contains more than
20,000 archaeological sites -- the highest known density of such
sites in the nation. The site's remoteness has helped protect it,
but growing population and tourism requires more protection,
Interior officials said.
</P>
<P>
   --Ironwood Forest National Monument in Arizona, 134,750 acres of
BLM land, includes stands of ironwood trees that can live more than
800 years, along with blue palo verde and saguaro blanket stands.
The area needs protection because of urban expansion in the
southern part of the state, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   --Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument in Oregon, 52,000 acres of
BLM land, including Soda Mountain, is one of the most biologically
diverse areas in North America, home to 100 species of butterflies,
eight species of bats and old growth habitat important for the
threatened northern spotted owl.
</P>
<P>
   The 1906 Antiquities Act allows presidents -- without
congressional approval -- to safeguard objects of historic and
scientific interest. President Theodore Roosevelt used the law to
set aside the Grand Canyon in 1908 and President Carter used it to
create large sections of Alaska wilderness in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   If he approves Babbitt's request, Clinton will have used the Act
to declare or expand 10 monuments during his presidency. Only
Carter has used the Act to protect more acreage, as he set aside 50
million acres in Alaska alone.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Elections May Be Years Off  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Stymied in attempts to free hostages held
inside parliament, Fiji's new military ruler said Wednesday it
might be years before democratic elections could be held.
</P>
<P>
   The military leader, Commodore Frank Bainimarama, accused rebel
leader George Speight of dodging talks on releasing the captives he
has held for 13 days.
</P>
<P>
   ''They keep avoiding the issue,'' Bainimarama said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bainimarama ruled out force to end the standoff, saying,
''we have to think of the lives of the hostages.''
</P>
<P>
   Speight has achieved most of his aims -- the removal of Fiji's
president and prime minister, the scrapping of the constitution,
and a promise of amnesty for himself and his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   But Speight, who says he represents the majority Fijians against
the minority Indians, told an Australian TV interviewer he would
keep the captives ''for as long as is necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   He called the hostages' ''discomfort'' a small price to pay for
the injustices done to Fijians.
</P>
<P>
   Fijians of Indian ancestry make up 44 percent of the population
of 813,000 on the Pacific island, but control much of the nation's
commerce in this country 2,250 miles northeast of Sydney,
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Speight on Thursday challenged the nation's new military leaders
to come to the parliament building and listen to him and tribal
chiefs before making any more decisions about how to end the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ''They really haven't had the talk, the confrontation, the
dialogue with the people that we have had,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speight wants Fiji's tribal chiefs, who hold no constitutional
power but are highly respected in the country, to play a major role
in the appointment of a new government.
</P>
<P>
   Bainimarama on Wednesday named an interim prime minister, Ratu
Epeli Neilatikau, whose wife is among the captives as is the prime
minister at the start of the crisis, Mahendra Chaudhry.
</P>
<P>
   The military leader, however, said he would postpone the
formation of a civilian government. He later said he would not name
new ministers until the hostages are freed.
</P>
<P>
   A military spokesman, Lt. Col. Filipo Tarakinikini, said that
even after the hostage crisis ends, the military leaders might have
to consider what to do about forming a new government.
</P>
<P>
   ''We may run a much more efficient administration with the
military,'' Tarakinikini said.
</P>
<P>
   Bainimarama said an interim government would draw up a new
constitution and prepare for new elections but warned that the
process could take up to three years.
</P>
<P>
   Speight said after talks Wednesday night between his
representatives and the military that the concept of a military
government being in place in Fiji until a new constitution could be
written was unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ''These types of things can take two years, sometimes up to five
years,'' Speight told local radio. ''It is not a concept that we
support.''
</P>
<P>
   Bainimarama told a news conference in the capital, Suva, he had
personally guaranteed that Speight and six gunmen who stormed
parliament on May 19 would receive amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   As Bainimarama spoke, armed supporters of Speight stoned cars
and beat their drivers in the capital outside the Parliament
complex. Police and soldiers did little to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   The violence seemed to target Fiji's Indian minority. Men armed
with automatic rifles and others carrying clubs and knives dragged
drivers out of their cars, robbed them and took the vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing the violence in Suva, the Mormon church said Wednesday
it had evacuated its 65 missionaries from the city and sent them to
the west side of Fiji as a precautionary move. That is one-third of
the church's missionaries on the island, spokesman Dale Bills said
from Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   One hostage was released Wednesday for her sister's funeral. The
woman left the parliamentary complex flanked by two police officers
only after promising to return once the ceremony was over. It was
not immediately clear if she returned.

<HEADLINE> Athletics 8, Yankees 7  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Matt Stairs hit a three-run homer in the first
inning as the Oakland Athletics scored seven runs off David Cone
and went on to beat the New York Yankees 8-7 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Heredia (7-3) struggled after Oakland gave him a 4-0 lead,
but three relievers held off the Yankees, who had the tying run in
scoring position in two of the last three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Isringhausen got five outs for his 11th save.
</P>
<P>
   Heredia, who allowed three-run homers to Chuck Knoblauch and
Ricky Ledee, gave up six runs and seven hits in 5 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Cone (1-5), winless in six starts since April 28, allowed six
earned runs, six hits and four walks in 3 1-3 innings. His ERA rose
from 5.68 to 6.24.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Ledee was 2-for-3 with four RBIs for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Stairs, one of the players considered by the Yankees as a
possible acquisition, put Oakland ahead with his eighth homer.
Terrance Long's sacrifice fly in the second made it 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch hit a three-run homer in the bottom half, but Oakland
knocked out Cone in the fourth when Chavez hit his seventh homer,
Ben Grieve had a sacrifice fly and a run scored on a throwing error
by catcher Jorge Posada on a double steal.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee chased Heredia with two outs in the sixth with his fourth
homer of the season, but Jason Giambi made it 8-6 with an RBI
single in the eighth off Mike Stanton.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Spencer tripled off Jeff Tam in the eighth and scored on
Ledee's double.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Cone has allowed six homers in his last five starts. ...
Knoblauch homered for the second straight game after hitting only
two in his first 34 games. ... Heredia's 5 1-3 innings matched his
shortest outing of the season, May 14 at Seattle. ... Stairs has
three homers in his last seven games. ... Cone threw 81 pitches in
3 1-3 innings and 41 of them were balls.

<HEADLINE> First Castaway Leaves 'Survivor'  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- And then there were 15 survivors.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the willing castaways of CBS' ''Survivor'' sent one
of their party packing at the end of the reality series' premiere
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Kindly Sonja -- a 60-ish musician who had proven not as spry as
the others -- became history in the first lap of this endurance
contest staged on a primitive island near Borneo.
</P>
<P>
   By the 13th weekly installment, just one survivor will remain
from the original 16 -- and be $1 million richer.
</P>
<P>
   But even by the end of the first hour, Sonja had stolen viewers'
hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Go get 'em, you guys,'' she said, gracious even in exile.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the audience need not fret. Next week (which will
cover another three days in the 39-day stay taped earlier this
year), viewers will find the other characters marooned right where
they left them.
</P>
<P>
   Among the carefully selected ''tribesmen,'' truck driver Susan
will likely still be squabbling with Richard, a corporate trainer.
And Rudy, a retired Navy SEAL, will probably be bossing everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they listened to me,'' he told the camera on the first
show, ''they'd all have haircuts. We'd be in formation in the
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, once again, someone will be voted out at the tribal
council meeting. And then there will be 14.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of buildup, ''Survivor'' may have surprised viewers
by resisting the salacious or even sinister tone some observers
were dreading. The show focuses on roughing it in beautiful
surroundings -- and on the stresses and strains the participants go
through.
</P>
<P>
   The diverse characters (who are split into two rival camps) are
quickly identifiable and involving. A few, like biochemist Ramona
and Sean, the doctor with a nipple ring, are also easy on the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   One contestant who is more interesting than either he or the
show's producers might have preferred is Richard Hatch, who, now
back home in Rhode Island, faced a charge of second-degree child
abuse. Last month, he pleaded innocent to allegations he abused his
9-year-old son. The boy said he was forced to go running and his
father wrapped his hands around his neck to move him along when he
tired.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm good to go, survival-wise,'' he confidently told
Wednesday's ''Survivor'' audience. ''People-wise, it'll be a little
more challenging. But I've got the million-dollar check written
already.''
</P>
<P>
   The actual winner, whose identity CBS is jealously guarding, is
yet to be uncovered.

<HEADLINE> Shooting of Teacher Said Accident  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN MEADOWS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE WORTH, Fla. (AP) -- The parents of a 13-year-old boy charged
with fatally shooting a teacher at school said he genuinely liked
the man and they believe the shooting was an accident.
</P>
<P>
   ''He loved Mr. Grunow. They were best friends,'' Nathaniel
Brazill's mother, Polly Powell told The Associated Press in a
telephone interview Wednesday. ''You just don't shoot your best
friends. This was just an accident, a tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she and the boy's father haven't asked him if he was
responsible for English teacher Barry Grunow's death. When they
visit the teen in juvenile detention, they pray and talk about
family, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't talk about what happened,'' said the boy's father,
Nathaniel Brazill, 42, ''We are just trying to comfort him and
assure him we are here for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell said her son had never been in trouble. He was a bookworm
and musician whom she had taught to believe education was his key
to the world, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always told him that he being a black man in this world
today without an education he wouldn't make it very far,'' Powell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Brazill was sent home from school Friday, the last day of
classes, for throwing water balloons. Police say a security shows
him returning later that day with a gun and shooting Grunow when
the 35-year-old teacher refused to let him talk to two girls in his
class.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Wednesday that a female classmate said Nathaniel
told her as he was leaving that he was going to come back and shoot
Lake Worth Community Middle School counselor Kevin Hinds, who
suspended him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just watch, I'll be all over the news,'' he told her,
according to Police Chief William Smith. Smith said the girl, also
13, didn't take him seriously, just as other students had not when
he talked about shooting someone in the days leading up to the
Friday's shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's court-appointed lawyer, Randy Berman, said Nathaniel
knew that Hinds wasn't in Grunow's classroom and that the boy had
gone there to say good-bye to his friends for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he was supposedly so mad, so angry, what's he doing hanging
around Mr. Grunow's classroom,'' Berman said. ''Maybe he wanted to
impress the girls by showing them the gun. When Mr. Grunow
confronted him, he could have pulled it out and it accidentally
went off.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said the gun was believed to have been stolen from the
boy's grandfather's house.
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel, who excelled in class and had dreams of going to
college and becoming a Secret Service agent protecting the
president, is in juvenile detention and in a sort of daze, Berman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He can't believe it happened,'' Berman said. ''He can't really
put his finger on how it all occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy is charged as an adult and could face life in prison
without parole if convicted.

<HEADLINE> Ruling in Elian Case Expected Thur.  </HEADLINE>
By PATRICK REYNA
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A ruling in the Elian Gonzalez case is expected
Thursday from a federal appeals court in Atlanta, police said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Miami police had requested advance notice of the decision to
prepare for possible protests from the Cuban-American community.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's confirmed. There's going to be an announcement of the
decision tomorrow sometime, probably in the morning,'' spokesman
Lt. Bill Schwartz said Wednesday night in a telephone interview
with The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-year-old Cuban boy, who was forcibly taken from the home
of his Miami relatives, has not been allowed to leave the country
until the 11th U.S. District Court of Appeals in Atlanta decides
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Elian and his Cuban family had been living in a secluded
Maryland retreat, but recently moved to a Washington, D.C., estate.
</P>
<P>
   Three appeals court judges are considering whether a child as
young as Elian can seek asylum despite his father's wish to return
with the boy to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was found floating on a tire tube off Florida's east coast
last Thanksgiving after a journey that took the lives of his mother
and 10 other Cubans trying to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's case quickly developed into a legal tug of war between
his Miami relatives, who wanted the boy to stay with them, and the
boy's father, who wants to return to Cuban with his son.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives want the court to force immigration
officials to give Elian an asylum hearing. The government has sided
with Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who says he should be allowed to decide
for the boy as his sole surviving parent.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall Coffey, an attorney representing Elian's Miami
relatives, said he had not received notice about the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   After the April raid by agents from the Immigration and
Naturalization Service and Border Patrol, thousands in Miami's
anti-Castro Cuban exile community took to the streets to express
their outrage. More than 300 people were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz said police would not be out in force Thursday -- rather
the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're taking a very laid back approach, Our intelligence is
not telling us that we have to expect trouble,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> State uses conflicts in trooper statements, experts to back charges </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Prosecutors used conflicting statements
from the troopers involved in a shooting on the New Jersey Turnpike
and detailed forensic evidence that repeatedly discounts the
officers' stories to support attempted murder charges against the
pair.
</P>
<P>
   In two lengthy briefs filed Wednesday, the state outlined its
case against State Police troopers John Hogan and James Kenna,
arguing that grand jury members were right to indict them.
</P>
<P>
   The charges came after an April 23, 1998, motor vehicle stop on
the turnpike. Three of four minorities heading to basketball clinic
in Maryland were shot by Hogan and Kenna during the traffic stop.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan's lawyer asked a judge last month to dismiss the charges.
He said the driver of a van told a grand jury he may have jumped on
the accelerator. The troopers maintain they fired in self-defense,
believing the van was headed for them.
</P>
<P>
   In response to those claims, the state offered statements and
grand jury testimony from all four people in the van who said Kenna
banged a flashlight on the passenger side window, broke it and then
opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''I put my hands straight up. He looked right at me. I thought I
was safe. He saw I had no weapons. He continued to shoot,''
passenger Danny Reyes told the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan told investigators 14 hours after the incident that he was
on the ground and firing as the van rolled back toward him,
according to the court papers.
</P>
<P>
   A state forensics expert also testified that a painstaking
recreation of the shooting using the actual van and patrol car
showed Hogan fired several times at the side of the van, according
to the court papers.
</P>
<P>
   Forensics expert Dr. Henry Lee testified that at some point
during the incident, the van appears to have slipped into reverse,
slowly drifted back and hit the front of the patrol car.
</P>
<P>
   ''This impact was consistent with the van being placed in
reverse and at idle speed,'' Lee is quoted as telling the grand
jury.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence also showed that the van was averaging 7 mph above the
55 mph speed limit and not 19 mph as the troopers, according to the
court papers. Traffic studies performed by investigators indicated
the van could not have been going faster than an average of 62 mph
as it traveled down the turnpike, the papers said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee also testified that the van's wheels could not have spun as
rapidly as Kenna and Hogan claimed they did. The forensic tests
showed that the van could not have been traveling any faster than 4
mph as it went back toward the police car, the court papers said.
</P>
<P>
   In speaking to investigators after the shooting, Kenna said he
did not radio in to supervisors about the traffic stop because
Hogan was using the car's public address system, according to
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hogan told State Police officials that he could not use
the system to tell the driver to pull over, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenna told those officials that he saw the driver put the car in
reverse and back up at a high rate of speed. He then heard Hogan
yelling from behind the van.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan denied that he yelled or shouted during the incident,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan's lawyer, Robert Galuntuci, said prosecutors acted
improperly before the grand jury and jurors were tainted by
allegations of racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings fueled claims that State Police troopers routinely
targeted minority motorists for traffic stops and drug prosecution
on the turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing on the move to dismiss the charges is scheduled for
June 27 before a state Superior Court judge in Mercer County.
</P>
<P>
   Special Prosecutor James J. Gerrow declined to comment Wednesday
on any of the details highlighted in the state's response to
Galuntuci's motion.
</P>
<P>
   ''We said everything in the brief,'' Gerrow said.
</P>
<P>
   In the four-point legal argument, prosecutors said they and the
judge took every step necessary to shield jurors from any bias
related to the racial profiling controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors were repeatedly questioned about media accounts, the
state said. In one case, a juror was dismissed after admitting that
she did not stop reading media accounts of the shooting and
investigation, according to the state's brief.
</P>
<P>
   Driver Keshon Moore, 24, of New York, and the passengers
admitted that they were moving around in the van after the traffic
stop, as Hogan and Kenna claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan, 29, of Florence, and Kenna, 28, of Hamilton Square, have
pleaded innocent to the charges. They have been suspended without
pay, pending the outcome of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Public outcry after the shooting led to widespread allegations
of racial profiling by state troopers and a severely critical
report by the Attorney General's Office detailing the practice.

<HEADLINE> Indians 7, Angels 3  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Chuck Finley treated the Angels just like any
other team, even though they'll always be special to him.
</P>
<P>
   Finley beat the team he spent 14 years with, getting his first
win since April on Wednesday night as the Cleveland Indians hit
five homers in a 7-3 victory over Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Finley (4-4), the winningest pitcher in Angels history, thought
he might spend his entire career with Anaheim. But he left as a
free agent last December, signing a three-year deal with the
Indians in hopes of finally getting a World Series ring.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old left-hander allowed two earned runs and nine
hits in 6 2-3 innings to win for the first time in six starts.
Finley had lost his last four decisions and was winless since April
29. He walked three and struck eight, including Mo Vaughn three
times.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Branyan homered twice in his first game this season and
Roberto Alomar, David Justice and Travis Fryman connected for the
Indians, who hit three homers in a four-run sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Salmon went 4-for-5 with a homer and Keith Luuloa had three
hits for Anaheim, which stranded 14 baserunners.
</P>
<P>
   Seth Etherton (0-1), making his second career start, gave up
just four hits in five-plus innings but was pulled after giving up
Alomar's leadoff homer in the sixth that broke a 2-2 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Justice hit a two-run shot in the sixth off Mike Holtz and
Branyan capped the inning with a solo homer against Al Levine.
Fryman's homer in the seventh put the Indians up 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Elias Sports Bureau, the last pitcher to face
his former team after at least 14 years of service with that club
was Jack Morris. In 1991, Morris lost to Detroit in his first
appearance for Minnesota against the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Finley treated the start just like any other. His pregame
routine was no different than before any of his club record 379
starts with the Angels or 10 this year with the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   He played solitaire at a table near his clubhouse locker, and an
hour before game time went across the hallway into the fitness room
to run on the treadmill and ride a stationary bike.
</P>
<P>
   Finley had just finished his pregame warmup in the Indians'
bullpen when a thunderstorm delayed the start for 57 minutes --
perhaps a sign from the baseball gods that something was amiss.
</P>
<P>
   He gave up a one-out bunt single to Luuloa in the first, and
retired Vaughn on a foul pop before Salmon hit his 12th homer, a
441-foot shot to left.
</P>
<P>
   Branyan, recalled Tuesday from Triple-A Buffalo, tied it in the
second with his second career homer. And just like last year, he
did it in his first at-bat of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Branyan followed a leadoff walk to Fryman by homering into the
right-field seats. In his first at-bat last season, Branyan homered
off David Cone at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   After Finley left to a standing ovation in the seventh, it took
three relievers to close out the win. Steve Karsay got five outs
for his 10th save.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Indians reliever Ricardo Rincon said his elbow isn't any
better, and the left-hander may still have to undergo surgery for
bone spurs. Rincon received a cortisone shot on May 24, but said he
is still feeling pain when he throws a slider -- his best pitch. GM
John Hart said he will consult with Indians doctors who will
re-evaluate Rincon. ... Vaughn, who went 1-for-13 in the series,
has struck out 18 times in 42 career at-bats against Finley. ... Of
Salmon's 208 career homers, 23 have come against the Indians.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox's Valentin Out for Season  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Red Sox third baseman John Valentin is out for the
season, but he should be able to return next year from surgery to
reattach his patellar tendon to his left kneecap.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we have any evidence that this would be
career-ending,'' Red Sox physician Dr. Arthur Pappas said
Wednesday, a day after Valentin blew out his knee trying to field a
routine grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Pappas said he expected David Altcheck, who operated on the same
knee in November, to perform the surgery on Thursday in New York.
Valentin's leg will be immobilized for 4-to-6 weeks and then he
faces 6-to-8 months of rehabilitation before he can try to get into
baseball shape.
</P>
<P>
   The timetable has him ready for spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's get through this first,'' said Red Sox manager Jimy
Williams, who went to visit Valentin at the University of
Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester. ''He's been through
rehabs before. What's one more?''
</P>
<P>
   Other athletes who have sustained major injuries to the patellar
tendon include Houston Rockets forward Charles Barkley, Green Bay
Packers wide receiver Robert Brooks and Brazilian soccer star
Ronaldo. Brooks returned in 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton also tore his patellar tendon in 1997, when he
slipped on steps at golfer Greg Norman's home. Pappas said the
president's injury was less severe.
</P>
<P>
   The injury is rare for baseball players; ''It's common in
jumpers, basketball players, usually,'' Pappas said. Inflammation
of the patellar tendon is known as ''jumper's knee.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin, the longest-tenured member of the Red Sox, had
offseason surgery to to repair torn cartilage in his left knee and
remove scar tissue. He was ready for opening day, but he went on
the disabled list with tendinitis in the same knee and missed 35
games.
</P>
<P>
   He was activated on May 19, but said the knee was not fully
recovered. On Tuesday night, his leg collapsed under him and he
fell to the dirt in obvious pain.
</P>
<P>
   ''He explains it as, 'My knee exploded,'' Pappas said. ''The
connection between the kneecap and tibia was totally disrupted.
This disruption does not permit someone to straighten his leg.''
</P>
<P>
   Pappas said Valentin was disappointed on Tuesday night, but he
was in better spirits on Wednesday as he prepared for the long
rehab.
</P>
<P>
   ''By today, he had accepted what had happened,'' Pappas said.
''He knows what has to be done and he was ready to start the
process.''

   Valentin played in just nine games this season, hitting .257
with two homers and two RBIs in 35 at-bats. He is a lifetime .283
hitter with 120 homers and 523 RBIs in an eight-year-career, all
with the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin, 33, will earn $6.1 million next season. The club has a
2002 option for a $6.4 million or must pay a $600,000 buyout if it
is declined.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox recalled infielder Andy Sheets from Triple-A
Pawtucket to replace Valentin. The team also purchased the contract
of pitcher Hipolito Pichardo and optioned left-hander Tim Young to
Pawtucket, and moved right-hander Bret Saberhagen from the 15- to
the 60-day disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Wilton Veras, who filled in for Valentin during the previous
injuries, was in the lineup Wednesday night at third base.

   ''I don't think there's anybody going to feel sorry for us at
all,'' Williams said. ''We have to go play.''

<HEADLINE> Ochoa Expected To Miss Three Weeks  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Cincinnati Reds backup outfielder Alex Ochoa
is expected to be sidelined for three weeks as he recovers from an
appendectomy.
</P>
<P>
   Ochoa was taken to a hospital shortly before the Reds' 10-4 loss
to Montreal on Wednesday night. Tests found an inflamed appendix,
and Dr. Timothy Kremchek scheduled surgery overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Kremchek said Ochoa told the club he has had stomach problems
for the last 36 hours. Tests found the problem with the appendix.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't want it to burst. That's when you really have
problems,'' Kremchek said.
</P>
<P>
   Ochoa is hitting .305 in 33 games, including nine starts in left
field and one in right. He also has gone 3-for-8 as a pinch hitter.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds will decide on his replacement before a game Thursday
night against Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just found out about it,'' manager Jack McKeon said
following Wednesday's game. ''We'll think about it. We've got all
day. I don't even know who's doing well down there (in Triple-A).''

<HEADLINE> Arizona Gets First Triple Play  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- The Arizona Diamondbacks got their first triple
play -- and Mark McGwire hit into it.
</P>
<P>
   With Arizona leading 3-1 in the fifth inning, the bases were
loaded when McGwire faced Randy Johnson and popped up to Steve
Finley in shallow center field.
</P>
<P>
   Finley threw out Placido Polanco, who tagged up at third and
tried to score. After making the tag play at the plate, catcher
Damian Miller threw to third, where shortstop Tony Womack tagged
out Edgar Renteria, who was trying to advance.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona began play in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth triple play in the majors this year and the
second this week -- Oakland's Randy Velarde turned an unassisted
triple play Monday at New York.

<HEADLINE> Beach Volleyball Stops Beach Access  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Construction of the controversial
Olympic beach volleyball stadium has forced restrictions on public
access to the popular Bondi beach.
</P>
<P>
   Access to the shoreline between the construction site and water
has been temporarily restricted for safety reasons, Olympic
Coordination Authority spokesman Bob Bowden said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He said a combination of high tides, strong wind and a big swell
caused waves to lap against the construction fence.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have agreed to monitor the shoreline as a precaution to see
whether temporary restrictions on access are required for public
safety reasons,'' Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the temporary 10,000-seat stadium has been
dogged by protests from residents, who say it will cause
environmental damage.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've wrecked our beach and turned it into an unsafe, no-go
area,'' said Lenny Kovner, a spokesman for the residents.
</P>
<P>
   ''September is the month of the worst king tides of all. There
is every likelihood there will be days lost during the Olympics
when they won't be able to play volleyball.''
