<HEADLINE> More Nigerian Military Officers Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government Thursday
announced the compulsory retirement of 93 military and police
officers as part of a campaign to restore professionalism into the
country's politicized armed forces and the police.
</P>
<P>
A total of 53 army, 19 naval and 16 air force officers were
swept off in the latest purge of the military, according to a list
of retired officers distributed at a press conference held here by
Doyin Okupe, President Olusegun Obasanjo's special assistant on
media and publicity.
</P>
<P>
Okupe said the retirements were part of the "measures... to
ensure the permanent subordination of the military to civil
authority."
</P>
<P>
The retirements "ensure that the Nigerian armed forces regain
their pride and professionalism," he noted, denying that the
exercise was intended to "cast aspersion on the integrity of the
officers".
</P>
<P>
In future, he stressed, "all officers of our armed forces must
recognize that the ultimate reward for participating or benefiting
from coups will be premature or forced retirements."
</P>
<P>
Among those affected in the latest purge were General Patrick
Aziza, chairman of the 1995 tribunal that sent Obasanjo on a
phantom coup plot, and Brigadier General Mohammed Marwa, the last
military governor of Lagos State.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, 22 air force, eight army and three naval officers
were swept away in the gale of retirement currently sweeping
through the Nigerian armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Those affected in the navy were former Transport Minister Rear
Admiral Festus Porbeni and Rear Admirals P.A. Jerome and D.A.
Onoja, and eight brigadier generals of the army.
</P>
<P>
Air Vice Marshal Idi Musa was the most senior of the officers
retired from the air force.
</P>
<P>
President Obasanjo who took office last month replaced the
heads of the army, navy and air force on his first day in office.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria had been ruled for all but 10 years by military
governments since its independence in 1960.

<HEADLINE> Russia on UN Kosovo Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The significance of the UN
resolution on Kosovo lied in the fact that settlement of the
Kosovo issue had been set to a political track with a central role
of the United Nations, Russia said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before the United Nations Security Council began to
vote on a resolution on Kosovo, Russian Ambassador to the United
Nations Sergey Lavrov said political solution was the only
possible way to overcome the crisis in the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
To end the unlawful action of NATO's military actions against
the Formal Republic of Yugoslavia was an absolution condition to
overcome the humanitarian catastrophe in the region, Lavrov said.
</P>
<P>
Russia strongly condemned NATO's aggression against the
sovereign state which violated the United Nations Charter and
undermined the authority of the Security Council as well as
seriously destabilized the entire system of the international
relations based on the international law, the Ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out humanitarian crisis in Kosovo was transformed by
the NATO bombing into the most serious humanitarian catastrophe
not only in the Kosovo, but in all Yugoslavia and the Balkan states
as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The resolution ended the military actions of NATO and
established the genuine conditions for the return of the refugees
and displaced persons, and the resolution approved the deployment in
Kosovo under the United Nations auspices an international
civil and security presence with clearly formulated and concrete
mandate, Lavrov said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the activities of the both presences would be
carried out under the political control of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The special importance in the resolution was the
neutralization of the so-called Kosovo Liberation Army and other
armed groups of the Kosovo Albanians, and the resolution clearly
defined that as one of its obligations of the United Nations
Security Council said Lavrov, adding that this task must be
carried out clearly with maximum effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
Russia would support and take an active part in an effort to
find a comprehensive approach to the social and economic
reconstruction, stabilization and development of the Balkan
region, Lavrov said.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of the resolution and the consequent adequate
implementation of it would make a central contribution to the
peaceful, just and long-term solution to the Kosovo crisis, the
Ambassador added.

<HEADLINE> Cigar Smokers Face Increased Risks of Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Cigar smokers are twice as
likely as nonsmokers to get cancer of the mouth, throat and lungs,
says a new study Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The study, published in New England Journal of Medicine, was
conducted by Carlos Iribarren, an epidemiologist at the Kaiser
Permanent Medical Care Program in Oakland, California, who
examined the medical records of 1546 regular cigar smokers and
16228 nonsmokers from 1971 through 1995. Most of the cigar smokers
smoked fewer than five a day.
</P>
<P>
The study also found that cigarette smokers have about three
times as high a risk of coronary heart disease as nonsmokers, 10
times the risk of lung cancer and 20 to 25 times the risk of
cardiac lung disease, Iribarren said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Debates Blocking Funds for Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives on Thursday launched a debate on U.S. involvement
in the Balkans and a Republican-backed proposal to block funds for
the mission.
</P>
<P>
The GOPs urged support for a 288 billion U.S. dollars defense
authorisation bill that bars use of fiscal 2000 funds for military
operations in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The republicans said President Bill Clinton must be forced to
stop raiding the day-to-day military budget for indefinite
peacekeeping missions.
</P>
<P>
"The war that I'm concerned about is the next war," said
Representative Duncan Hunter, a California Republican.
</P>
<P>
Hunter said that missions in Kosovo, Bosnia, the Gulf and
elsewhere were stretching the military too thin and depleting
crucial readiness accounts.
</P>
<P>
The House will vote later on whether to remove the provision
from the defense bill.
</P>
<P>
The White House has said it will veto the bill if that
provision remains.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, Clinton would have to send Congress a request
for emergency supplemental funds for the costs of any combat or
peacekeeping operations in Yugoslavia after Sept. 30 of this year.
</P>
<P>
The president could spend money for such an operation only by
citing national security concerns and sending separate legislation
to Congress.
</P>
<P>
"This is a new and perhaps more troubling phase for our
country," said the Armed Services Committee chairman, Rep. Floyd
Spence. "Administration policy has been contentious and confusing,
not only for Congress but for the American people as well."
</P>
<P>
Democratic lawmakers blasted the debate's timing, saying
Republicans were sending a horrible signal to U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
"The question before the House today is whether after winning
the war, we will lose the peace," said Representative Jim Turner,
a Texas Democrat.

<HEADLINE> Rubin Urges Major Economies to Promote Growth in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin said on Thursday he was encouraged by significant signs of
recovery in crisis-ridden emerging economies but warned there
remained big challenges.
</P>
<P>
Laying out his agenda for a meeting of finance ministers from
the Group of Seven major economies this weekend, Rubin also
reiterated calls on Japan and Europe not to let up in their
long-standing efforts to stimulate their own economies.
</P>
<P>
"The first challenge we face is promoting growth and recovery
in the global economy," he told a news briefing. " It is
critically important that all the G7 countries pursue policies
that effectively provide strong domestic demand-led growth and I'm
sure we'll be discussing, in addition to the American economy, the
question of how Japan and Europe have pursued that objective," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said there had been "a significant improvement" in many
Asian economies as well as in Brazil, Latin America's top economy.
But those countries "still face enormous challenges". "It is
absolutely critical that they remain on a path of strong reform,"
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
The weekend gathering will be the last G7 meeting that Rubin
will attend. Rubin plans to step down in early July after more
than four years in his job and hand over the reins to his
designated successor and current deputy, Lawrence Summers.
</P>
<P>
"Our task at this meeting will be to prepare for the following
weekend's Summit in Cologne. We will focus on three basic areas:
continuing the work to reform the international financial
architecture for the 21st century, strengthening the global economy
and promoting balanced growth; and working to accelerate the
provision of relief from ongoing debt problems of the highly
indebted poor countries," the outgoing Treasury Secretary said.
</P>
<P>
But problems such as weak growth in Europe and its ailing
single currency, the euro, as well as the issue of who will pay
for the reconstruction of Kosovo now that the conflict in the
region appears to have ended are sure to feature prominently on
the agenda.
</P>
<P>
"We will discuss our ongoing efforts concerning the economic
consequences of the Kosovo conflict," Rubin added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the U.S. economy itself, Rubin said now in its
ninth year of uninterrupted growth, it was threatened by the
opposing dangers of higher inflation and a slowdown that could
still be caused by relatively weak economic performance elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
"There are risks in both directions," he said. "You always need
to be watchful with respect to inflation, on the other hand...it
is still true that the only major part of the world economy that
has sustained domestic demand-led growth is the United States --
that certainly is not a healthy situation for the long run."
</P>
<P>
Rubin reiterated his long-held view that the "most likely
prospect for the United States is continued solid growth and low
inflation, subject to the usual ups and downs and the risks of the
global economy."
</P>
<P>
But he also warned that the nation's rising trade deficit,
caused by a surge of imports and a fall in exports to ailing
foreign economies, could not be sustained forever.

<TEXT>
<P>
Cologne, Germany,June 10 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the
Group of Eight (G-8) Thursday in Cologne ended their meeting with
a conclusion calling for a "multi-ethnic Kosovo".
</P>
<P>
"We invite all Serb and other minority residents of Kosovo to
contribute to the creation of a democratic, multi-ethnic Kosovo,"
said the conclusion.
</P>
<P>
The planned international civil presence will play a crucial
and urgent role to create security, democracy and economic
reconstruction for all the people of an autonomous Kosovo and more
widely in the region, with the proposed Stability Pact for
Southeastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this day, foreign ministers put forth a statement of
ten "general principles" for the interim stage in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Key point of the statement was to keep the interim Kosovo
government under the control of a steering panel, which will bring
together the EU, the United Nations, and the G-8 members.
</P>
<P>
The interim international civilian presence should be led by a
special representative of the U.N. Security Council, and it should
cooperate closely with the international peacekeeping force
(KFOR), said the statement.
</P>
<P>
G-8 includes seven leading western nations-- U.S., Britain,
Germany, France, Italy, Canada, Japan--and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Later this day, ministers are expected to hold a conference on
the stability of Southeast Europe.

MOSCOW, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Russian and U.S. defense

Ivashov described the talks as proceeding in a constructive way
and against the good background that NATO airstrikes against
Yugoslavia have been halted.
</P>
<P>
Russia has insisted that its troops taking part in the Kosovo
peacekeeping mission would not operate under NATO, while the
transatlantic military block says the mission would be under its
command and control.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said on Thursday that he felt no sense of triumph as Serb troops
began pulling out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"I feel no sense of triumph now," Blair told reporters at his
Downing Street residence while commenting on the end of the air
strikes against Yugoslavia and the withdrawal of Serb troops from
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He said there was no guarantee that some alliance troops, who
will soon go into Kosovo, would not lose their lives.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister, the most hawkish leader among NATO nations,
said NATO peacekeeping troops would enter a province where
hundreds of thousands of landmines have been scattered, and could
even face opposition from Serbs angry at their defeat.
</P>
<P>
"There are real dangers ahead. We cannot guarantee there will
be no loss of life," he said.
</P>
<P>
He again warned the Serb people that they could expect no
funding for reconstruction from the European Union while President
Slobodan Milosevic remained their ruler.

<P>
LONDON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of England cut Thursday
Britain's short-term interest rate by 0.25 percentage point to
5.00 percent, the lowest level since November 1977.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the cut, the bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)
said the reduction was required to ensure that inflation did not
undershoot the government's 2.5 percent target.
</P>
<P>
The rate cut is welcome news for retailers, exporters and home
owner in Britain and came as a surprise for the City of London
where the majority of analysts had predicted no change.
</P>
<P>
Ian Peters, Deputy Director-General of the British Chambers of
Commerce, said the decision "will give the economy a much needed
nudge towards sustainable recovery".
</P>
<P>
Most economists here now believe this reduction is likely to be
the last for a while, with the next move to be a rise as the UK
economy picks up later in the year.
</P>
<P>
Chenceller Gordon Brown said on the same day that the
foundations had now been laid for "higher and stable growth" in
employment.
</P>
<P>
However, UK key interest rates at 5.00 percent are still twice
as high as in the 11-country eurozone.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Resolution Fails to Fully Reflect China's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. draft resolution
on Kosovo has failed to fully reflect China's principled stand and
justified concerns, so it abstained from voting on it, Acting
Permanent Representative to the U.N. Shen Guofang said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The draft makes no mention of disaster caused by NATO bombing
in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), and it has failed to
impose necessary restriction on invoking of Charter VII of the
U.N. Charter, Ambassador Shen told a council meeting on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we have great difficulty with the draft
resolution," he said before the voting process began.
</P>
<P>
As the FRY has already accepted the peace plan, NATO has
suspended its bombing in the FRY, and the draft resolution has
reaffirmed the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter and the
primary responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance
of international peace and security, and so reaffirmed the
commitment of all member states to the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of the FRY, China will abstain from voting on this draft
resolution, he said.
</P>
<P>
NATO's unprecedented and indiscriminate bombing campaign
against FRY in the name of humanitarianism, has produced the
greatest humanitarian catastrophe in the post-World War II Europe
and seriously undermined peace and stability in the Balkans, Shen
said.
</P>
<P>
From the very beginning, China has expressed its firm
opposition to the NATO military actions against Yugoslavia and
demanded that NATO immediately stop all its bombing operations.
</P>
<P>
China stands for peaceful settlement of the question of Kosovo
on the basis of respect for the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of the FRY and the guarantee for the legitimate rights
and interests of all ethnic groups in the Kosovo region, the
ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
"Any proposed solution should take full account of the views of
the FRY," he added.
</P>
<P>
Respect for sovereignty and no-interference in each other's
internal affairs are basic principles of the U.N. Charter, and it
is even more imperative to reaffirm these principles at the turn
of the century, Shen noted.
</P>
<P>
The so-called "human rights over sovereignty" theory serves to
infringe upon the sovereignty of other states and promote
hegemonism under the pretext of human rights, running totally
counter to the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter,
the Chinese envoy said.

He made the promise at a press conference at the International
Conference Center where he presented the new budget to the
Parliament for approval.
</P>
<P>
He said the level of transparency is very high. If the
legislature gives its nod, the budget will be fixed and
expenditures will be done in the next month.
</P>
<P>
The minister also explained why the government has decided to
cut the defense budget to 177 billion shillings (120 million U.S.
dollars) from 193 billion shillings (150 million dollars) of the
previous financial year.
</P>
<P>
The government has done the one-time investment to equip the
army in the current fiscal year. So it doesn't have to buy so
much equipment in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
Uganda planned to keep its defense spending at a level of no
more than 1. 9 percent of the country's gross domestic product
(GDP) in the current financial year, but it turned out to account
for 2.4 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Donors, which contribute almost one third of the government
expenditure, have demanded the government to reduce military
spending before any big disbursement of funds.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund has delayed disbursement of 18
million dollars to the east African country due to the above
concerns.

<HEADLINE> Text of Annan's Statement on Kosovo Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Thursday made a statement on the Security Council resolution
on Kosovo, saying, "With this resolution, the United Nations
Security Council has charted the way towards a better future for
the inhabitants of Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
"Today, we are seeing the beginning of the end of a dark and
desolate chapter in the history of the Balkans. Today, we embark
on the path of peace. This path will be marked by difficulties and
dangers that will require no less encourage and determination than
the events that brought us to this point," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"let no one be in any doubt about the magnitude of our
challenge: after the violence, the human rights abuses, the
expulsions and the devastation of the last year, the task of
restoring Kosovo to a semblance of normal life is immense."
</P>
<P>
"Rebuilding homes, restoring infrastructure, renewing
institutions, and revitalizing civil society will require
sacrifice, dedication and persistence on the part of all who
share responsibility for the future of Kosovo. In planning terms,
winter is fast approaching, and we are in a race against time."
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations is determined to lead the civilian
implementation of the peace effectively and efficiently. But to
do so, we need the cooperation of all parties. And we need the
means to carry out the mandate."
</P>
<P>
"The commitment to peace is not enough. The will to
implement it -- in all its aspects-- is what counts. This
includes tasks for which the United Nations is not responsible,
but which are vital if peace and stability are to be restored."
</P>
<P>
"I have in mind, for example, the need for the full
withdrawal of Serb military, paramilitary and police forces, and
for the demilitarization of the UCK."
</P>
<P>
"I look to those responsible for the security aspects of the
resolution to act swiftly."
</P>
<P>
"There also lies ahead the hard and extremely complex work of
building a durable peace, of reconciling positions which are far
apart. In doing so, we need to deal with the roots of this
crisis."

<HEADLINE> Cologne Conference Passes Southeast Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cologne, Germany, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The international
conference in Cologne Thursday approved a stability pact for
Southeast Europe.
</P>
<P>
The pact raised by the European Union (EU) was aimed at
"durable democrat, peace, and economic development in the region,"
said German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer at the press
conference after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
After the settlement of Kosovo conflicts and a halt to NATO air
strikes against Yugoslavia, the pact was expected to set the basis
of a new EU policy for the Balkan region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Whether to connect the region with the European Union is at
first the question of peace or war, stressed Fischer.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers or representatives from 28 relative
countries, together with representatives from international
organizations, were invited to the conference.
</P>
<P>
Under the pact, seven countries in the region--Albania, Bosnia,
Macedonia, Croatia, Slovenia, Bulgaria, and Romania will get
international aid for regional political and economic development.
</P>
<P>
With part of Yugoslavia, Montenegro, being included in the
pact, Belgrade was ruled out from the list. The country may be
accepted into the pact at the next phase, said Fischer.

<P>
OTTAWA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Canada announced Thursday that it
will contribute one million Canadian dollars(680,000 million U.S.
dollars) to the International Fund for Ireland (IFI) over the next
three years.
</P>
<P>
"This contribution further re-affirms Canada's commitment to
the peace process in Ireland," said Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd
Axworthy in a release.
</P>
<P>
"We are especially pleased that Canada's contribution will be
applied toward the Fund's continued activities, which support
programs for disadvantaged areas and promote intercommmunity links
and dialogue," added the Canadian minister.
</P>
<P>
The Fund is intended to help Ireland build a peaceful and
prosperous future, and is supported by Australia, Canada, New
Zealand, the United States and the European Union, with a view to
promoting the peace process in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
To date, Canada has contributed more than 5 million Canadian
dollars to the IFI since it was established in 1986 by the U.K.
and Irish governments.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Defense Industries to Attend Paris Air </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 10 (Xinhua) -- At least six Israeli defense
industrial companies have decided to send their advanced products
on display at the Paris Air Show scheduled for next week.
</P>
<P>
The Tadiran Spectralink Ltd, a world leader in designing and
manufacturing of advanced datalink systems and products for
airborne platforms and ground installations, announced Thursday
that it will introduce three new products at the show.
</P>
<P>
One of the product, called combat maneuvering data links, can
integrate data links into air, naval and ground systems to
support real-time training, simulation, debriefing and
operational capabilities for personnel and weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry announced Monday that Israel's Arrow
missile defense system will go on display at the show too.
</P>
<P>
The Arrow, Israel's joint product with the U.S., will be
deployed in Israel by the end of 1999 or the beginning of
2000.
</P>
<P>
Its development and deployment cost, estimated to amount 2
billion U.S. dollars, will also be jointly covered by the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Arrow system successfully hit a computer-generated target
in a test flight last August, but project developers admitted that
it will not provide complete protection from ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
This system is supposed to intercept missiles 10 to 40
kilometers above ground, and the effect it will have on a chemical
and biological warhead is unclear.
</P>
<P>
The Arrow project was launched in 1988 as an adjunct of the
U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative. The system was designed to
intercept incoming ballistic missiles, a mission the U.S. Patriot
missile batteries stationed in Israel failed to accomplish in the
1991 Gulf War when Iraq fired dozens of Scuds at Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry said this system is not ready for sale at
the Paris Show.

NICOSIA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government will
protest to the Pakistani government over an "illegal visit" by its
official to the northern part of the island controlled by Turkish
Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot government spokesman Costas Serezis, who is
accompanying President Glafcos Clerides in his state visit to
China, has said that Cypriot Ambassador to Pakistan Loria Markides
has been instructed to make representations to the Pakistani
Foreign Ministry, the Cyprus News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot press has reported that Pakistani
Ambassador to Turkey Karamutullah Khan Ghori and his wife went to
the Turkish Cypriot area last Tuesday to inspect the life of
Pakistani students there.
</P>
<P>
During his stay there, he also met with Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriot-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally in 1983 a breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," which is only recognized by
Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Israel Seeks Release of Arrested Jews in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Israel turned to Germany and
Jordan for help Thursday in a continued effort to seek the
release of 13 Iranian Jews arrested on suspicion of spying for
Israel and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak called German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroder in the day, asking for his
intervention to press Tehran for letting go the Jews, according to
Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Among European countries, Germany maintains the closest ties
with Iran.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said Wednesday that
Bonn is "gravely concerned" about the arrest and will try to
secure the release of the group.
</P>
<P>
Iran Thursday confirmed earlier reports on the arrest of the
13 Jews, saying they will be put on trial for spying.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the U.S. have denied the charges and demanded for
their immediate release.
</P>
<P>
Since the news was first broken Monday, Israel has been urging
United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan and Pope John Paul II
to contact Iran on behalf of the detainees.
</P>
<P>
In a congratulation message to Jordan's King Abdullah II for
his coronation, Chief Rabbi Yisrael Lau appealed Thursday for the
king's help, denying the arrested Iranian Jews have spied for
Israel.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Boeing Rocket Puts Four Satellites Into Orbit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Boeing Company
Thursday used its Delta II rocket to put four satellites into
orbit.
</P>
<P>
The satellites -- worth about 15 million U.S. dollars each --
separated in pairs about an hour after the Boeing rocket carrying
them was launched.
</P>
<P>
The first four satellites in the 3.3 billion U.S. dollars
Globalstar network were launched by Boeing in February 1998. Seven
months later, 12 Globalstar satellites were destroyed shortly
after liftoff when the Ukrainian Zenit rocket carrying them
failed.
</P>
<P>
Boeing's last launch, in early May, ended with the satellite
stranded in the wrong orbit. An investigation continues into the
failure of that Delta III, a larger and upgraded version of the
rocket launched Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Altogether, 48 satellites are planned for the Globalstar
constellation. Boeing Delta II rockets, as well as Russian Soyuz
rockets, will be used to launch the remaining satellites.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's launch was valued at about 115 million U.S. dollars,
including the cost of the satellites and the Delta II rocket. It
was delayed two days because of bad weather.
</P>
<P>
The Globalstar consortium of 12 companies was founded by Loral
Space and Communications Ltd. and Qualcomm Inc.

Cologne, Germany, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the
Group of Eight (G-8) Thursday in Cologne put forth a statement of
ten "general principles" for the interim stage in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Key point of the statement was to keep the interim Kosovo
government under the control of a steering panel, which will bring
together the EU, the United Nations, and the G-8 members.
</P>
<P>
The interim international civilian presence should be led by a
special representative of the U.N. Security Council, and it should
cooperate closely with the international peacekeeping force
(KFOR), said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The G-8 foreign ministers called on the "civilian
implementation structure" to be deployed as rapidly as a secure
environment has been established.
</P>
<P>
They said "particular priority " should be given to the
establishment and deployment of an international police force. And
local police force should be trained to take on responsibility for
civil law.
</P>
<P>
The bloc promised to "play a full part" as early donors for
Kosovo reconstruction task. Ministers wanted an international
conference to be held on that issue.
</P>
<P>
G-8 includes seven leading western nations-- U.S., Britain,
Germany, France, Italy, Canada, Japan--and Russia. Ministers on
Wednesday set a clear timetable for settling the Kosovo crisis.

<P>
PARIS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The French National Assembly voted
on Thursday to recognize the 1956-1962 Algerian War, 37 years
after it ended.
</P>
<P>
France has officially termed the French drive to crush Algerian
independence fighters as an operation of "restoring order," in
which at least 600,000 people -- most of them Algerians -- were
killed.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly adopted with unanimity a draft law
jointly presented by the Socialist Party, the Communist Party and
other parties, officially recognizing the war.
</P>
<P>
The recognition came under the pressure of the veterans
associations which for years have been seeking official
recognition of the "Algerian war."
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, 1,747,000 French soldiers served
in North Africa from 1952 to 1962. About 24,300 of them were
killed in action in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
President Jacques Chirac also served in the French army in
Algeria during the war.
</P>
<P>
Algeria obtained independence after the signing of the Evian
agreement on March 19, 1962.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Allow Political Fund Raising on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Election Commission
(FEC) of the United States voted 6-0 Thursday to allow
presidential candidates to raise money over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The ruling will allow presidential candidates who take credit
card donations on their Web sites to qualify for federal matching
dollars during the primary elections, thus giving a major boost to
political fund raising in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
The ruling will have a sweeping effect for the major
presidential candidates, all of whom have Web sites, observers
here said.
</P>
<P>
The existing FEC regulation had in fact forbidden candidates
from collecting federal matching funds on such donations via
credit card.
</P>
<P>
"We recognize the reality that the Internet is here and a big
part of our life," FEC Chairman Scott Thomas said after the vote.
"We need to let it be used freely."
</P>
<P>
The FEC voted to allow presidential campaigns to begin
collecting credit card donations in anticipation of receiving
matching funds for them next January 1.
</P>
<P>
Barring disapproval from the Congress or the president, the new
regulations would take effect in a few months.
</P>
<P>
The commission, which oversees campaign laws, is made up of six
members split evenly along party lines.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Indian Party Denies Deal With ANC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- South African Minority Front
(MF) leader Amichand Rajbansi Thursday dismissed as "first-class
rubbish" rumors that the African National Congress (ANC) had
offered him a top position in exchange for his support in
KwaZulu-Natal Province
</P>
<P>
Rajbansi said his motivation for supporting the ANC was based
on his party's policy to always support the ruling party, South
African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to claims by some politicians that he was a
"sell-out", he said that "when you identify with the liberated
masses, then you people think you are a sell-out."
</P>
<P>
"We are not an opposition party but a development party which
believes in cooperative co-existence," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"I live for the Indian people and I will die for them," he
said, adding that a "hot line" would be set up between himself and
the ANC to discuss the future of Indians.
</P>
<P>
Rajbansi said he had acted in the best interest of the Indian
community when he joined forces with the ANC and said the alliance
would go a long way to changing the "zebra image" of
KwaZulu-Natal.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed reports that the alliance would lead to the
disbanding of his party.
</P>
<P>
The Majority Front leader said that cooperation with the ruling
party was done without sacrificing his party, its autonomy or its
independence.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made on the understanding that the ANC and the
Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) work together, he said.
</P>
<P>
"If I wanted to ditch the Indians, I could have done it four
years ago when I was offered top positions by three different
parties." Rajbansi said.
</P>
<P>
"But, I didn't and now I am more determined to fight for the
rights of Indians."
</P>
<P>
In KwaZulu-Natal, it was unclear how an alliance between the MF
and the ANC, which has given the ANC grouping an equal number of
seats to the IFP, would affect developments.
</P>
<P>
The ANC and IFP are still negotiating a coalition government
and the ANC- MF alliance could give the ANC more leverage.

<HEADLINE> Angola Bans Imports of Belgian Food Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan ministries of
agriculture and trade decided Thursday to immediately ban
nationwide imports from Belgium of animal products including
chicken meat, eggs, port and beef.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued here, the two ministries announced
that they were banning in Angolan markets the sale of "all meats
or animal products imported from Belgium after January this year"
because they might have been contaminated by certain toxic
chemical.
</P>
<P>
The statement demanded that any sea and air ports should
strengthen monitoring and inspection so as to keep such
contaminated products away from Angola.
</P>
<P>
And it warned the consumers against products made in or
imported from Belgium.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the European Commission last week decided
to ban sale of chicken meat, eggs, pork and beef from Belgium in
its member states because the cancer-causing chemical dioxin had
been found in animal feed in some Belgian poultry farms.
</P>
<P>
Since then, many countries including the two Congos, Sierra
Leone, Guinea, Cote d'Ivoire and some other African states have
decided to ban imports of meat and dairy products from Belgium
because of a scare over dioxin contamination.

<HEADLINE> Russia Insists on Stance on Kosovo Peacekeeping Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Russia will not back down from its
stance on the Kosovo peacekeeping mission, Russia's Balkan envoy
Viktor Chernomyrdin said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin made the remarks following his one-and-a-half-hour
meeting with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who
arrived in Moscow to narrow the difference over the Kosovo
peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
NATO says its forces will be the core of the peacekeeping
operation, but Russia insists that it will not place its troops
under NATO command.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said at a press conference that military
representatives from Russia and U.S. would find a settlement
acceptable to both side within one or two days.
</P>
<P>
Talbott said that the peacekeeping forces in Kosovo should have
a unified command.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, Russia's Duma, or lower house of parliament,
passed a resolution noting that the peacekeeping forces in Kosovo
can only be under the command of the United Nations, never under
NATO, and Russian troops should not be commanded by NATO.

<HEADLINE> Chen Longcan's Day in World Club Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Former Olympic champion Chen
Longcan, now representing Japan's Nissan Motor club, scored a
string of surprise victories on the opening day of the World Table
Tennis Club Championships here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old, who won the men's doubles gold medal for China
in the 1988 Olympic Games, stunned double Olympic champion and
world number one Liu Guoliang of P.L.A. Industrial and Commercial
Bank Club 21-13, 21-14 to pull the tie even at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
He beat Chinese veteran national Wang Tao, also double's
Olympic Champion in 1992, to level the score one-all earlier in
the second match.
</P>
<P>
But his teammate was no match with the players in the Chinese
club in the best-of-five tie, with H. Shibutani losing to Liu
Guoliang 21-13, 21-15, A. Takashi dropping to Ma Lin 21-16, 21-5
and Shibtani being defeated by Wang Tao 21-16, 21-15.
</P>
<P>
"It's very clear that Wang and Liu have been out of practice
for a long time," former Chinese national head coach Xu Shaofa
said.
</P>
<P>
The P.L.A. club entered the final eight by topping Group A with
an unbeatable record. It beat Caen of France 3-1 in its first
group tie.
</P>
<P>
The club, which also consists of rising star Ma Lin, will next
face Roval Charleroi of France in the quarterfinals on Friday.
</P>
<P>
All-time great J.O. Waldner led his Sweden club Team Tetra Pak
through to the last eight, in which they will take on Shanghai
Edelweiss of China.
</P>
<P>
But Waldner, the only player in the world who has won a Grand
Slam titles of World Championships, World Cup and Olympic Games,
was defeated twice in his four matches.
</P>
<P>
He was upset first by F. Hakansson of German club Liebherr
Ochsenhausen 8-21, 24-22, 21-15 and then was overpowered by Yoo
Changjae of South Korean team Samsung Life Insurance 21-19, 21-3.
</P>
<P>
"He has not had a match for a long time," his coach Hans Thalin
said. "But I belive he will play better and better in the next few
days. "

ATHENS -- A convoy of about 1,200-1,500 U.S. marines destined
for the peacekeeping force in Kosovo set out Thursday morning from
the Gritsa port in Litochoro, outside the northern Greek port of
Thessaloniki en route to neighboring Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
The marines, about 2,000 strong, had been waiting for nearly a
week on two warships and a helicopter carrier in the Aegean Sea
because the Greek government had issued a 10-day prohibition on
the passage of NATO troops through Greek territory in the run-up
to the June 13 European Parliament elections. (Greece-U.S.-

<HEADLINE> U.S. Jobless Claims Pick up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Labor Department reported
on Thursday that 323,000 people filed new claims for jobless
benefits last week, up by 14,000 from the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The unexpected big jumps in claims last week pushed them to the
highest level since the week of January 9, when they were at 358,000.
After this increase jobless claims dropped for nearly two months.
They remained below 300,000 for nine straight weeks, the longest
stretch in 26 years.
</P>
<P>
The four-week moving average for jobless claims also was up
slightly to 308,250. That was the highest level since May 1.
</P>
<P>
Even with the increase in jobless claims, the number of people
putting in for unemployment benefits is still low and depicts a
tight labor market.
</P>
<P>
Last week the Department reported that the nation's
unemployment rate edged down to 4.2 percent, returning to a
29-year low.
</P>
<P>
The Thursday's report said that for the week ending May 29, 18
states and territories reported declined in jobless claims while
35 had increases. The state data lags a week behind the national
figures.
</P>
<P>
North Carolina had the biggest declines in benefit
applications, a drop of 1,210, which was attributed to fewer
layoffs in the electrical equipment industry.
</P>
<P>
The state with the largest increase in jobless claims was
Michigan, with a jump of 1,938 applications, an increase that was
blamed on layoffs in the auto industry.

<HEADLINE> Flood in 1998 Costs Bangladesh 6 Pct of GDP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The devastating flood of 1998 cost
Bangladesh about 6 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) and
caused upward pressure in food prices but helped a bountiful
harvest of rice, wheat and potato.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a joint estimate of the Asian Development Bank and the
Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies, Finance Minister Shah
A.M.S. Kibria in his budget speech at the parliament on Thursday
said, "Flood losses constituted about 6 percent of the gross
domestic product."
</P>
<P>
He said the devastating flood from July to September 1998 was
the longest in the history of Bangladesh, inundating 68 percent of
the country's total land.
</P>
<P>
About 31 million people were marooned and 53 out of the
country's 64 district were inundated during the flood, Kibria
said.
</P>
<P>
About half a million houses were washed away, 14,000
educational institutions became unsuitable for normal use, 15,000
kilometers of roads were damaged and thousands of bridges and
culverts were destroyed, he said.
</P>
<P>
"An allocation of 250 million taka (about 5.15 million
dollars) was provided for house building grant to half a million
affected families while 888,000 landless, small and marginal
farmers were provided inputs for agricultural rehabilitation at a
cost of 300 million taka (about 6.19 million dollars)," he said.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister noted that the total outlay on flood
relief exceeded 10 billion taka (about 206.19 million U.S.
dollars) including an additional allocation of 5.82 billion taka
(about 120 million dollars), and because of a large-scale relief
operation, the much-anticipated massive rural to urban migration
did not occur.

<HEADLINE> Party Designated as Official Opposition in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBUR, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The speaker of the Free State
Legislature has formally designated the Democratic Party (DP) as
the official opposition in the Free State legislature.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Thursday, Elzabe Rockman, secretary to
the Legislature, said that Speaker Joel Mafereka had considered
the question of which party should be the official opposition
after the number of seats held by political parties had been
declared in accordance with the election results.
</P>
<P>
As the DP and the New National Party (NNP) had each been
allocated two seats in the Free State Legislature, the question
arose as to which party was the official opposition.
</P>
<P>
Rockman said that the speaker had taken into consideration the
provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa
Third Amendment Act, No. 3 of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Though the act provided for the allocation of undistributed
delegates in a provincial delegation to the National Council of
Provinces in a case where competing surpluses were equal, the
intention of the legislator was clear specifically from section 2
of the act.
</P>
<P>
That section states: "Where competing surpluses are equal, the
number of votes a party recorded in the previous election for a
provincial legislature is the determining factor."
</P>
<P>
The speaker was therefore convinced that the actual number of
votes cast for the two parties in question must be the determining
factor. In the results declared by the Independent Electoral
Commission, the DP obtained 58,171 votes and the NNP got 56,743
votes in the June 2 elections.

<HEADLINE> Russia, China Oppose U.S. Missile Defense Systems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev and Vice-Chairman Zhang Wannian of China's Central
Military Committee have expressed their opposition to U.S. plans
for the development of two missile defense systems.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting Wednesday, Sergeyev and Zhang agreed that
Washington's planned development of National Missile Defense (NMD)
and Theater Missile Defense (TMD) systems would upset regional and
global peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
The two military leaders also condemned the air strikes against
Yugoslavia by the U.S.- led North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
stressing that the air campaign, an aggression against Yugoslavia
defying the norms of international relations, created an
humanitarian disaster as well as an ecological catastrophe in the
Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, who arrived here Monday on an official good-will visit,
also met with Russian Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin and Vladimir
Putin, secretary of Russia's Security Council and director of the
Federal Security Service, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the world is far from being tranquil and that
hegemonism and power politics remain the main sources of threat
against world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said some countries, sticking to a Cold War mentality,
are bent on expanding military alliances and frequently resorting
to the use or threat of force, interfering in the internal affairs
of other countries.
</P>
<P>
Such practices, which not only run against the trend of the
times but also greatly hurt the fundamental interests of the
people of various countries in the world, will face opposition
from all people of the world, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
On Kosovo, Zhang said the brutal air strikes against the
sovereign state of Yugoslavia for more than two months by the U.S.-
led NATO, which bypassed the U.N. Security Council, resulted in
grave disasters for the Balkan country's economy and human
existence.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the missile attack on the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade early May, which killed three Chinese journalists,
wounded over 20 embassy staff members and gravely damaged the
embassy buildings, was a savage violation of Chinese sovereignty
and a blatant trampling on the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic
Relations and other basic principles of international law.
</P>
<P>
The atrocity kindled strong indignation from all peace-loving
states and sharp protests from the Chinese government and people.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Yeltsin and other government and military
leaders also released statements strongly condemning the savage
NATO attack. Zhang expressed profound thanks for their solidarity
with and support for the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
China would continue to consult and cooperate with Russia on
the political settlement of the Kosovo problem to jointly oppose
hegemonism and power politics, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
On the planned U.S. development of NMD and TMD systems, Zhang
said the U.S. move runs against the trend of the times and will
have a major adverse impact on global and regional strategic
balances and stability. China is gravely concerned about the U.S.
efforts in pursuing these systems.
</P>
<P>
"Any country's supply of TMD systems to China's Taiwan province,
or attempt to include Taiwan in its TMD plans in any form, or
directly or indirectly put China's Taiwan into the sphere of Japan-
U.S. security cooperation, will be considered moves that seriously
infringe on China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and
grave interference into China's internal affairs, and will be
confronted with strong opposition from all the Chinese people,"
Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral military ties, Zhang expressed the hope that
military cooperation would progress more intensively and
extensively at many levels and in many fields.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev, for his part, said Russia-China military ties will
surely go forward smoothly.
</P>
<P>
At the end of their meeting, the two sides signed a cooperation
agreement on the training of military personnel.

<HEADLINE> EDS-With Details Chinese FM Spokeswoman on U.N. Security Council Resolution on Kosovo (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Although China has serious
reservations about some contents of a draft resolution on Kosovo
proposed by G-8, it did not obstruct the U.N. Security Council's
passage of the draft resolution but abstained from voting.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue made the
remarks here today after the adoption of the resolution on the
Kosovo issue by United Nations (U.N.) Security Council.
</P>
<P>
She said that the Chinese government's decision was made on the
basis of its independent foreign policy of peace and on the
following three considerations.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the first consideration is that NATO has made an
official announcement on the suspension of its bombing of
Yugoslavia, and, in particular, the Yugoslav government and
parliament have accepted an relevant "peace plan" and hoped that
the U.N. Security Council would adopt the resolution as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
The second consideration is that the draft resolution
recognizes the most important role of the U.N. Security Council in
maintaining international peace and security, and reaffirms the
commitment of all member states to the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Yugoslavia, she added.
</P>
<P>
The third consideration is that the adoption of such a
resolution as soon as possible will help end, at an early date,
the sufferings inflicted on all ethnic groups of Yugoslavia,
including the Albanian ethnic group in Kosovo, by NATO's bombing,
and start the process of a political solution of the Kosovo issue,
the spokeswoman said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Raise Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Finance Minister
Daniel Yona told the National Assembly Thursday that the
government plans to raise a series of taxes in the new fiscal year
starting July 1.
</P>
<P>
In the new personal income tax regime, the minimum taxable
income (threshold) has been proposed for a rise from 20,000
shillings (about 28 U. S. dollars) to 45,000 shillings per month,
Yona told the parliament in the central city Dodoma.
</P>
<P>
It has further been proposed that the highest marginal income
tax rate be reduced from 35 percent to 30 percent to equate it
with the corporate income tax rate of 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
The airport service charge will be increased from 2,000 to
3,000 shillings for domestic flights, a measure which is expected
to generate an additional revenue of 802 million shillings, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Cigarettes manufactured with more than 75 percent Tanzania
tobacco content as raw material, and with length of not more than
70 mm would be charged 3,267 shillings as excise duty instead of
2,970 shillings for every 100 pieces. This is an increase of 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
Cigarettes manufactured with more than 75 percent Tanzania
tobacco with length of more than 70 mm would be charged 7,706
shillings for 1,000 pieces instead of 7,005, an increase of 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
Premium cigarettes made with less than 75 percent of Tanzanian
tobacco content would be charged 1,400 shillings for 1,000 pieces.
</P>
<P>
Excise duty on locally brewed beer and imported beer has been
proposed for harmonization at 200 shillings per liter instead of
the current differential rate of 174 shillings per liter on local
beers, 195 shillings for imported beers from Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and 153 shillings for
imported beer from the non-COMESA countries.
</P>
<P>
On soft drinks, excise rates would be harmonized at 34
shillings per liter for local products and imports. At present,
locally produced soft drinks are charged 34 shillings per liter
while imported soft drinks are charged 140 shillings per liter.
Harmonization of the excise on soft drinks is not expected to have
effect on revenue as imports are negligible.
</P>
<P>
On value added tax, Yona announced a number of amendments with
effect from July 1 for pharmaceutical products, tourist air
charters and aircraft, aircraft engines and spare parts for
aircraft and maintenance.
</P>
<P>
It has been proposed that pharmaceutical products as per the
approved list by the National Pharmacy Board be zero rated so that
producers may get refunds of value added tax (VAT) paid on inputs.
</P>
<P>
Tourist air charters will be exempted from VAT as well as
aircraft, aircraft engines and spares for aircraft and
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's VAT rate, which was adopted on July 1 last year,
stands at 20 percent, which is deemed too high by many
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Yona further informed that with the objective of encouraging
Tanzanians to use computers and in view of the need to be prepared
to tackle the millenium bug, the government has proposed that
computer software and hardware and their accessories be charged
customs duty rate of five percent instead of the current 20
percent.

<HEADLINE> Decline in S. African Manufacturing Output Levels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The two-year decline in South
African manufacturing output is leveling off, Statistics South
Africa reported in Pretoria Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It said production for the three months to April reflected only
a decrease of 0.2 percent, after seasonal adjustment, compared to
the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen of the 27 major manufacturing divisions reported lower
output.
</P>
<P>
The production decrease was mainly due to falls in metal and
non- metallic mineral products as well as machinery product
divisions.
</P>
<P>
Against this were relatively large increases from basic iron
and steel and the petroleum products' divisions.
</P>
<P>
The total value of manufactured products for the three months
to April, after seasonal adjustment, showed an increase of 0.4
percent or 346.6 million rand (56 million U.S. dollars) over the
previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
Large increases were reported from the paper (9.5 percent),
motor vehicle (8.7 percent) and iron and steel (5.9 percent)
sectors.
</P>
<P>
But there was a significant decrease in sales of food
products(-4.2 percent) during the period.

China will, as always, stick to the purposes and principles set
in the UN Charter and continue its unremitting efforts for
safeguarding world peace and stability, she said.
</P>
<P>
From the very beginning of the crisis, Zhang said, China has
expressed its stance for a political settlement and held that the
use of force would only further complicate and deteriorate the
situation there.
</P>
<P>
More that two months ago, without the U.N. Security Council's
authorization, U.S.-led NATO brazenly launched military attacks on
Yugoslavia, which severely violated the U.N. Charter and the norms
of international laws, harmed the U.N. Security Council's
authority, and created a very dangerous precedent in the history
of international relations, she said.

<P>
Zhang stressed that NATO's more-than-two-months' wanton bombing
of Yugoslavia, a war in the name of "safeguarding humanitarianism,
" has caused an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe in the
Balkan region: nearly one million refugees, deaths and injuries of
tens of thousands of innocent civilians, and the destruction of
innumerable civilian establishments. Worse still, NATO went so far
as to take the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia, which is protected
by international conventions, as the target of its attack.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has all along firmly opposed NATO's
military actions against Yugoslavia, stressed the necessity of a
peaceful solution to the crisis through negotiations, supported
the positive role of the United Nations in this regard, and held
that any proposed settlement should take full account of and
respect the views of Yugoslavia, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the Chinese government and leaders have time
and again demanded that NATO immediately stop its bombing of
Yugoslavia so as to create conditions for the U.N. discussion of a
political settlement of the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
China's solemn stance of not seeking its own benefits,
upholding principles, standing for justice, and opposing power
politics has reflected the just voice of the peace-loving people
in the world and been highly valued by the international community.

<P>
ATHENS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
Thursday night voiced his satisfaction with the adoption of an
U.N. Security Council resolution on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Simitis said in a statement that he felt special satisfaction
over this development, which vindicated Greece's position to
insist on political negotiations, on diplomatic initiatives and in
continuous consultations with the parties involved.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Greek government had kept the country out
of military involvement, maintaining its credibility with both
sides, and was now looking forward to participating in the process
of reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
"After the end of the war, we shall formulate with the Balkan
countries, the European Union (EU), and all the interested parties
a policy of participation in the European political and economic
system," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Greece's Economy Minister Yiannos
Papantoniou said Thursday that the signing of the Kosovo peace
agreement by NATO and Yugoslavia meant that the damage incurred by
the Greek economy would be contained at approximately 100 billion
drachmas or 0.2 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in
1999.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Deploy Civil, Security Presence in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council on Thursday decided to deploy international civil and
security presences to Kosovo, a province of the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia (FRY).
</P>
<P>
The decision was embodied in the council's resolution to ensure
peace in FRY following North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)'s
bombing campaign against FRY from March 24 to June 10.
</P>
<P>
The military strikes against a sovereign state without
authorization by the council, has killed over one thousand
civilians, injured thousands and produced nearly one million
displaced persons and refugees.
</P>
<P>
With FRY agreeing to withdraw its forces from Kosovo, NATO
suspended bombing activities on Thursday and a resolution drafted
by 12 countries including the United States, Britain, France,
Germany and Russia was adopted by the council.
</P>
<P>
China, a permanent member of the council, abstained from
voting, on the grounds that the draft did not fully reflect its
stand.
</P>
<P>
The draft did not mention the disaster caused by NATO bombing
and failed to impose necessary restrictions on the invoking of the
Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, China's representative told the
council.
</P>
<P>
The major responsibilities of the international security
presence listed in the resolution include:
</P>
<P>
-- deterring renewed hostilities and maintaining and ensuring
the withdrawal of FRY forces and preventing the return of the
forces into Kosovo,
</P>
<P>
-- Demilitarizing the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), and
</P>
<P>
-- Establishing a secure environment in which refugees can
return home in safety the international civil presence can operate
and a transitional administration can be established.
</P>
<P>
The council authorizes the U.N. Secretary-General to set up an
international civil presence in Kosovo to provide an interim
administration for Kosovo under which the people there can enjoy
"substantial autonomy" with the FRY.
</P>
<P>
The civil presence will support the economic reconstruction and
humanitarian and disaster relief aid.
</P>
<P>
It will also ensure the safe and unimpeded return of all
refugees to their homeland.

But Italian media reported that the bulk of the Italian troops
will be drawn from the Garibaldi Brigade, 2,200 of whom are now in
Macedonia and preparing to cross the border into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Italian force, the fourth largest numerically in the
48,000-strong Kfor, will take control of the western sector of the
province which borders on Montenegro and Albania, one of the five
sectors Kosovo has been divided into for US, British, French,
German and Italian control under a unified command.

Market ears about higher interest rates grew after the Japanese
government reported that the nation's gross domestic product rose
1.9 percent in the first quarter of this year, the first since the
summer of l997, The report made investors in belief that Japanese
demand for more U.S. goods will boost U.S. economy, setting off
inflationary pressure that would prompt the Federal Reserve to
raise interest rates.
</P>
<P>
In an address at a closed-door meeting Wednesday, Federal
Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan gave most people a feeling that a
rate hike is coming, though when is still up in the air. The

<HEADLINE> China to Deepen Study on Earliest Characters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The first comprehensive academic
research into the inscriptions on bones or tortoise shells from
the Shang Dynasty (16th century B.C.-11th century B.C.) is to be
published in book form.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists and linguists have given their approval
for the book which carries details of the 100 year old studies
into the inscriptions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the editors have completed another two academic
books covering the same field.
</P>
<P>
Ancient Chinese people created the characters some 3,500 years
ago and inscribed them onto animal bones and tortoise shells. A
Beijing scholar stumbled upon the bones and tortoise shells with
inscriptions in a drug store in 1899.
</P>
<P>
All the bones and shells record the activities of noble
families during the Shang Dynasty, the archaeologists said.
</P>
<P>
The experts have found about 5,000 ancient words, some 1,000 of
which have been translated so far.
</P>
<P>
Li Xueqin, director of the Institute of History under the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), values the book very
highly.
</P>
<P>
Many research bodies from the United States, Japan, Britain,
Germany and other countries have also thoroughly studied the
inscriptions.

<HEADLINE> UK Calls for Comprehensive Global Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Friday called on nations
from around the world to approve a new round of comprehensive
global trade talks later this year or risk a return to
protectionism.
</P>
<P>
In unveiling Britain's strategy for global trade talks, Trade
Minister Brian Wilson also urged the United States and Europe to
quickly resolve their differences in well-publicised rows over
European imports of bananas and hormone-treated beef.
</P>
<P>
Wilson said Britain will push hard for a new round to tackle
existing problems like tariffs and other technical trade barriers
as well as new issues like applying trade rules for electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
"I think things are static. And my concern is that unless the
momentum is maintained, we would regress to protectionism," he was
quoted as saying in a Reuters report filed from Glasgow, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Trade ministers from some 134 members of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) will meet in Seattle in late November to plan
trade talks and possibly embark on a so-called Millennium Round of
global talks to lower trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
Referring to U.S. and European trade rows, Wilson said he was
also dismayed by growing calls in the U.S. Congress for curbs on
steel imports.
</P>
<P>
"(Progress on trade) is quite finely balanced at the moment
because of the difficult situation in southeast Asia and political
pressures in America, where they are under a lot of pressure for
protectionism," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wilson said the EU should immediately reform its contentious
banana import regime that protects former colonies in Africa and
Latin America and which the World Trade Organization (WTO) has
said breaches global trade rules.
</P>
<P>
"You have to accept the referee's decision. The EU should move
as quickly as possible to comply with the WTO resolution," he was
quoted as telling a trade seminar.
</P>
<P>
Europe has said it wants to talk to the United States about
bringing its banana import regime in line with WTO rules, but to
date has not changed the law.
</P>
<P>
Wilson also echoed previous comments by Britain that the EU's
ban on U.S. and Canadian beef grown with hormones, which Europe
says might be harmful to human health, was not backed up by
scientific evidence and amounted to protectionism.
</P>
<P>
"The scientific evidence has to be reasessed, but shouldn't be
used as a delaying tactic," he said.
</P>
<P>
The row escalated recently with the EU threatening to ban all
imports of U.S. beef because much of its contained hormone
residues.
</P>
<P>
After winning a WTO ruling on the case, both Washington and
Ottowa have threatened to impose punitive duties on EU exports,
similar to a U.S. tactic in the banana row that targetted
industries unrelated to the dispute and angered Europeans.
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. officials have signaled they would consider EU
proposals offering it expanded access to certain markets as
compensation instead of unilateral punitive trade sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"There are some indications the Americans don't want another
Banana-type incident," Wilson said.

<HEADLINE> Arrested Iranian Jews Might Receive Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Head of the Iranian judiciary
Mohammad Yazdi said on Friday the 13 Iranian Jews arrested on
espionage charges will stand trial soon and should receive capital
punishment.
</P>
<P>
Yazdi, judicial supervisor-general of the Iranian Majlis
(parliament), made the remarks at the Friday prayers congregation
on the campus of Tehran University.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came in response to the efforts made by Israel and
the United States to urge Iran to release the 13 people, who were
accused of spying for the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Yazi accused the group of having sold out the rights of 60
million Iranians to Israel, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
He rejected the remarks by certain circles that the trial of
the Iranian Jews would be considered as being against the
principles of the human rights.
</P>
<P>
All of the suspects would be tried in consistence with the
criminal procedures in Iran and the public would be kept informed
of the proceedings, the hard-line judiciary official said.
</P>
<P>
Iran on Thursday confirmed the arrest of 13 Iranian Jews
several weeks ago in the southern Far province, after the new was
broken by Israeli and American media.
</P>
<P>
Expressing concerns over the arrest, both the U.S. and Israel
denied that the Iranian Jews had any links with their intelligence
services and called for their release.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM to Visit Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
will head a delegation to pay an official visit to the Philippines
on June 13-15 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the
establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Akapol Sorasuchart announced here Friday
that during his visit, Chuan is expected to discuss with President
Joseph Estrada ways to expand trade and investment between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is now promoting the Subic area as an economic
zone, a tax-free port and international airport where Thai
companies such as Shinawatra Group, Ital-Thai, Bangkok Bank and
Thai Petrochemical have invested.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the two sides will hold talks on opening the
market of agricultural products, as the Philippines still has tax
barriers for Thai products.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines earlier agreed to import Thai rice, but a deal
has yet to be reached.
</P>
<P>
Chuan is also expected to meet representatives of the Thai
community in the Philippines and preside over the opening ceremony
of the Thailand-Philippines Friendship Week.
</P>
<P>
He will also see the name of a street in Manila being changed
from "Rada Street" to "Thailand Street."
</P>
<P>
Chuan's entourage will include Deputy Prime Minister and
Commerce Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi, Foreign Minister Surin
Pitsuwan, Industry Minister Suwat Liptapanlop and Minister of the

representatives as well.

BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Following are highlights of
diplomatic news released by Xinhua today:
</P>
<P>
 FM Spokeswoman on U.N. Security Council Kosovo Resolution
</P>
<P>
Although China has serious reservations about some contents of
a draft resolution on Kosovo proposed by G-8, it did not obstruct
the U.N. Security Council's passage of the draft resolution but
abstained from voting.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue made the
remarks here today after the adoption of the resolution on the
Kosovo issue by United Nations (U.N.) Security Council.
</P>
<P>
She said that the Chinese government's decision was made on the
basis of its independent foreign policy of peace and on the
following three considerations.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the first consideration is that NATO has made an
official announcement on the suspension of its bombing of
Yugoslavia, and, in particular, the Yugoslav government and
parliament have accepted a relevant "peace plan" and hoped that
the U.N. Security Council would adopt the resolution as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
The second consideration is that the draft resolution
recognizes the most important role of the U.N. Security Council in
maintaining international peace and security, and reaffirms the
commitment of all member states to the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Yugoslavia, she added.
</P>
<P>
The third consideration is that the adoption of such a
resolution as soon as possible will help end, at an early date,
the sufferings inflicted on all ethnic groups of Yugoslavia,
including the Albanian ethnic group in Kosovo, by NATO's bombing,
and start the process of a political solution of the Kosovo issue,
the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
 Chinese Leaders Meet Monaco Crown Prince
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin met with Crown Prince Albert of
the Principality of Monaco at the Diaoyutai State Guest House here
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that although it is not long since China and Monaco
established diplomatic relations, the Chinese people know much
about the European state.
</P>
<P>
"China attaches great importance to relations with Monaco, and
is willing to develop friendly cooperation with Monaco and other
countries based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed the conviction that through the
efforts of both sides, bilateral cooperation in various fields
will surely move forward.
</P>
<P>
Vice-President Hu Jintao presided over a welcoming ceremony to
Albert and his party, and afterwards the two sides exchanged views
on bilateral relations as well as world and regional situation.

<P>
China's top legislator Li Peng said here today that the U.S.-
led NATO failed to conquer the Yugoslav people but eventually had
to seek a political solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz, Li
said that this proves that the use of force is not the way to
solve such problems, and that hegemonism and power politics go
nowhere.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the development of the Kosovo crisis has caused
deep concern across the world. He pointed out that the U.S.-led
NATO, with its enormous military advantage, had engaged in the
wanton bombing of Yugoslavia over the past 70 days and more,
resulting in enormous losses of life in Yugoslavia and severely
affecting peace and stability of Europe.
</P>
<P>
He said that both Pakistan and India are important countries in
South Asia, and China sincerely hopes they would prevent the
Kashmir situation from deteriorating in order to maintain peace
and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Aziz briefed Li on the recent armed conflict between Pakistan
and India in Kashmir region.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan hopes to seek a peaceful solution to the problem by
resuming dialogue with India, Aziz added.
</P>
<P>
Chinese, Pakistani Foreign Ministers On Kashmir Issue
</P>
<P>
China hopes that Pakistan and India will find an effective
approach for political solution to the Kashmir issue through
negotiations and consultations, Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan told
his Pakistani counterpart Sartaj Aziz here today.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers discussed the current situation in
South Asia and Tang said that the recent conflict in Kashmir has
caused great concern among the international community. The
Kashmir issue is a complicated affair with a long history that
should be and could only be solved through peaceful means.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes G-8 FMs' Agreement on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Friday welcomed an
agreement reached on Thursday in Cologne, Germany by the foreign
ministers of G-8 (seven most industrialized countries plus Russia)
on the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The G-8 ministers reiterated the support for the United
Nations' efforts to reach a comprehensive settlement on Cyprus
issue "on the basis of the relevant resolutions of the
U.N. Security Council."
</P>
<P>
They recommended the G-8 summit, to be held next week in
Cologne, to urge U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to invite the
leaders of the two communities in Cyprus "to enter into
comprehensive negotiations without preconditions."
</P>
<P>
They urged all concerned parties to avoid any actions that
might increase tensions on the island.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot acting government spokesman Spyros Arotis, in a written
statement, expressed Cyprus' readiness to proceed to negotiations
to reach a comprehensive solution on Cyprus issue based on
U.N. principles.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in
the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to settle the Cyprus issue hit a stalemate in 1997 when
the Turkish Cypriot side demanded international recognition of
their breakaway state in the north, unilaterally declared in 1983
and recognized only by Ankara.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Retail Sales Rise 1 Percent in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. retail sales rose by 1
percent in May to a seasonally adjusted 242.2 billion dollars, the
Commerce Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Following an April rise at a revised 0.4 percent, the May jump
was better than initially estimated, the Department said.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales have climbed or held steady for 10 months running
and were 7.8 percent higher than May of last year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said low unemployment, steady income growth and stock
market gains are main factors to whet people's appetite for
shopping.
</P>
<P>
However, a 0.7 percent rise in consumer prices in April, the
most in nearly nine years, has some analysts wary that if
inflation continues, consumers might begin to trim their spending
in response.
</P>
<P>
Gas prices have jumped most sharply, and sales at gasoline
service stations did drop in May, by 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
But most other retail categories showed strong increases in
sales last month.
</P>
<P>
Sales of durable goods picked up 1.8 percent in May, after
slipping in March and April.
</P>
<P>
Automotive sales, up a big 2.5 percent, were a major factor.
However, even without the often volatile autos category, total
retail sales climbed 0.5 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
Sales of nondurable goods, such as food and fuel, were up 0.3
percent in May.
</P>
<P>
Food and grocery store sales were up 0.7 percent in May, while
bar and restaurant patronage held steady. At drug and other
proprietary stores, sales increased 0.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> GE Sees Potential in Chinese Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- General Electric (GE) Asia-Pacific
wound up its seasonal chief executives meeting here today, the
first it has held in China.
</P>
<P>
"China is a huge potential market and with GE and China working
together we are in a win-win scenario," said Goran Malm,
President of GE Asia Pacific, in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The company's top man in the region, Malm arranged the meeting
in Beijing so that GE's Asian-Pacific executives could take a look
at the Chinese market with their own eyes.
</P>
<P>
The market, as Malm defined it, is not confined to big cities
such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, but also includes a wide
range from coastal areas to inland areas.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Malm had led a delegation of GE's various groups to
west China's Shannxi province in May, and decided to purchase 18
million U.S. dollars worth of products from the Xi'an Aero Engine
Corporation this year.
</P>
<P>
Last September, he also headed a delegation of GE's senior
officials to tour Chengdu, Chongqing, Xiamen, Qingdao and Shenyang.
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is not only to sell GE products to China, but also
build manufacturing centers here and hire local talents," said
Malm.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based GE Hangwei Medical Systems Co., Ltd. has been
successfully selling a kind of CT machine all over the world, and
has replaced Japan as GE's global manufacturing and supply center
for that kind of machine.
</P>
<P>
"We are very supportive of China's WTO entry, and believe it
will generate good business opportunities for both Chinese and U.S.
enterprises," said Malm.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that the NTR between U.S. and China
will become permanent.

<HEADLINE> China Plays Positive Role in Political Solution to Kosovo: Article </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- China played a positive role in
bringing the Kosovo crisis back to a political solution, said here
Thursday a signed article entitled Upholding Justice and Defending
Peace.
</P>
<P>
The article, written by Guo Jisi, said the adoption of a draft
resolution on Kosovo by the UN. Security Council Thursday after
the U.S.-led NATO officially suspended its bombing of Yugoslavia
indicated that the alliance's 78-day wanton bombardment had not
worked and that the Kosovo crisis had ultimately be brought back
to the track of political settlement.
</P>
<P>
China has all along unequivocally opposed to the use of force
and insisted on a political solution to the Kosovo conflict. Now,
its stance has proven to be the only right way out of the crisis,
the article noted.
</P>
<P>
On the midnight of March 24, a tragic day for the whole world,
the calmness and peace prevailing Yugoslavia was broken by the
barbaric air attack launched by the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization led by the United States. The attack was staged under
the pretext of safeguarding humanitarianism and NATO bypassed the
United Nations Security Council, the only international
organization having the mandate to keep world peace, the article
went on.
</P>
<P>
The aggressive act severely violated the UN Charter and norms
governing international relations, undermined the authority of the
Security Council and created a very dangerous precedent in the
history of international relations, it said.
</P>
<P>
China, proceeding from its persistent position of maintaining
world peace, had made swift response to NATO's brutal move, the
article pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders, including President Jiang Zeming, Chairman of
the NPC Standing Committee Li Peng and Premier Zhu Rongji,
solemnly and repeatedly made clear China's stance on the matter.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry issued a statement on the same day,
opposing NATO's military action against Yugoslavia. It stressed
that the air campaign could only serve to complicate the situation
in Kosovo, a Serbian province mostly inhabited by ethnic Albanians
seeking independence, and strongly demanded the military bloc
immediately stop its operation, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Also on the day, China prompted the Security Council to call an
urgent meeting, at which Chinese permanent Representative to UN
Qin Huasun reaffirmed China's opposition to NATO's inhumane act in
Yugoslavia and demanded an immediate stop to the act.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government emphasized all along once that the
Kosovo issue should be solved fairly through negotiations on the
basis of respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Yugoslavia and guarantee the rights of all ethnic groups in the
province. It pointed out that resorting to military forces could
only make the situation there more complex.
</P>
<P>
Thus, China had pointed out a right way for the international
community to settle the Kosovo problem, the article said.
</P>
<P>
But regrettably, NATO intensified its air bombardment step by
step, expanding its targets to civilian facilities in disregard
of an outcry of the international community. During the 78-day air
campaign, NATO warplanes struck factories, bridges, schools and
hospitals, leaving more than 1000 civilians dead, thousands of
others injured and nearly one million displaced. NATO warplanes
even bombed convoys carrying refugees returning to Kosovo, and the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, which is protected by international
convention.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, the war, which was staged under the pretext of '
defending humanity,' produced the worst humanitarian catastrophe
in Europe after World War II and seriously undermined peace and
stability in the Balkans and the rest of the world," the article
said. "Such consequences proved how absurd the pretext is!"
</P>
<P>
In face of strong opposition against the military operation
from the Chinese people and other peace-loving peoples, rift
emerged within NATO. Related countries had to start seeking a
political settlement. On May 6, foreign ministers of the Group of
Seven and Russia issued a statement on the principles for a
political solution of the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
At this crucial moment, China intensified its efforts to help
end the conflict through political means. Chinese leaders
repeatedly underlined that the Kosovo issue should be resolved
peacefully through negotiations with Yugoslavia's sovereignty and
territorial integrity respected and the rights of all peoples in
the region guaranteed. China supported the United Nations to play
an active role in solving the crisis. It also maintained that any
political settlement should take the view of Yugoslavia into
consideration and demanded NATO immediately halt its bombing.
</P>
<P>
"China's status and role in seeking a political solution was
increasingly recognized by parties concerned as China is a
permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and a
responsible country sticking to principles," the article noted.
</P>
<P>
To urge NATO to halt its airstrikes and diminish the
casualties and property damages in Yugoslavia and to safeguard its
sovereignty and territorial integrity, Chinese leaders contacted
relevant foreign leaders to reaffirm China's stand that NATO
should immediately halt the bombings to create necessary
conditions and an atmosphere for the UN. Security Council to
peacefully settle the Kosovo issue. They stressed once again that
a UN. Security Council resolution should sufficiently reflect the
stands of all parties, especially the view from Yugoslavia, the
article said.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin held telephone conversations with his
Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin, exchanged messages with French
President Jacques Chirac and expressed Chinese stand to Russian
Kosovo envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin and EU Kosovo coordinator,
Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee Chairman Li Peng and Premier Zhu
Rongji also held talks or consultations with foreign leaders on
the Kosovo issue, said the article.
</P>
<P>
Germany, France, Finland and other related countries informed
China on the development of the issue or sought Chinese view on
the draft UN. resolution on Kosovo. To protect the interest of the
Yugoslav people and the authority and solemnity of the security
council, China insisted that NATO immediately stop its military
actions to set conditions for a formal discussion of the UN.
Security Council on the draft.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure from China, the NATO countries had to
repeatedly indicate that they would seriously consider China's
stand, and finally decided to pause its airstrikes at 21:20 June
10 before the security council started to discuss the draft.
</P>
<P>
In an amendment to the draft resolution, China emphasized that
the council should take the safeguarding of international peace
and security as its top duty and should respect the sovereignty
and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia. China is the only
Security Council member to put forth such an amendment which was
included in the final resolution.
</P>
<P>
Considering the facts that the Yugoslav government could accept
the "peace plan" and hoped it could be adopted as soon as possible,
China did not block the passage of the draft resolution by
abstaining from the voting while reserving its disagreement with
some items in an effort to end the huge disasters brought by NATO
bombing to all Yugoslav ethnic groups, including ethnic Albanians.
China's position won appreciation from all sides.
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the century, mankind is facing the fundamental
question of what kind of world will be brought into the new
millennium. The disgusting nature of the NATO military operation
against Yugoslavia, the severe destruction it brought about and
the absurd excuse used by NATO are all rarely seen in post cold
war era. Apart from Yugoslavia which is the direct victim, the UN
Charter, the international norms, the peace and stability in
Europe and the world as a whole have all been severely jeopardized.
The phenomenon provides food for thinking.
</P>
<P>
History has repeatedly proven that we cannot safeguard world
peace and stability without pursuing the principles of the UN
Charter, the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence and other
international norms. Otherwise, there will be no peace in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The article pledged that China, as a permanent member of the
Security Council, will work unremittingly to maintain UN's
credibility and authority and to safeguard the world peace and
stability, as it always does.
</P>
<P>
History will again prove that the peace trend is irresistible
and the righteous course is invincible, the article concluded.

<HEADLINE> Financial Sector Operates Smoothly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Statistics released today by the
People's Bank of China (PBOC), the central bank, show that China's
financial sector maintained smooth operations in May.
</P>
<P>
This featured a stable growth of money supply, increased
withdrawal of money from circulation, increased lending and
deposits, as well as a stable currency.
</P>
<P>
By the end of May, the outstanding amount of broad money (M2)
was 11.06 trillion yuan, up 17.2 percent from the same month last
year but a drop of 0.7 percentage points from last month.
</P>
<P>
The outstanding amount of narrow money (M1) was 3.8 trillion
yuan, up 13.3 percent but down 0.8 percentage points from last
month. While the outstanding amount of money in circulation (M0)
was 1.09 trillion yuan, up 9.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the PBOC said that increased withdrawal of
money from circulation was the major reason for the slowing growth
of money supply. The amount of money withdrawn from circulation in
May was 33.6 billion yuan, an increase of 14.8 billion yuan from
the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
Also by the end of May, the amount of outstanding loans in all
financial institutions was 8.9 trillion yuan, up 15.1 percent.
Total loans in the first five months increased to 263.3 billion
yuan, 35.3 billion yuan more than the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In the period the amount of outstanding deposits was 10.14
trillion yuan, up 17.8 percent; of which corporate deposits
reached 3.3 trillion yuan, up 16.3 percent; while individual
deposits hit 5.9 trillion yuan, up 18.6 percent. Total deposits
increased to 559.9 billion yuan in the first five months.
</P>
<P>

S. dollar for 8.2786 RMB.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Top Legislator on Kosovo Issue (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator Li Peng
said here today that the U.S.-led NATO failed to conquer the
Yugoslav people but eventually had to seek a political solution to
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Pakistan Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz, Li
said that this proves that the use of force is not the way to
solve such problems, and that hegemonism and power politics go
nowhere.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the development of the Kosovo crisis has caused
deep concern across the world. He pointed out that the U.S.-led
NATO, with its enormous military advantage, had engaged in the
wanton bombing of Yugoslavia over the past 70 days and more,
resulting in enormous losses of life in Yugoslavia and severely
affecting peace and stability of Europe.
</P>
<P>
Facts have enabled people to see more clearly the true nature
of the fallacy of "human rights above sovereignty", and be more
vigilant against the forces of hegemonism. "There is also the
issue over attempts to interfere in and invade other countries
under the pretext of human rights and we need to be more aware of
the necessity and urgency of the establishment of a just and
reasonable new international order," added Li, who is chairman of
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Journalists in Yugoslavia Hailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Wu Jieping, president of the
Western Returned Students' Association (WRSA), has hailed Chinese
journalists in Yugoslavia for their timely, objective and fair
reporting of the news events and for spreading the truth from
there.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who is also a vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of
the National People's Congress, made the remarks at a conference
of the WRSA held here today.
</P>
<P>
He said while faithfully carrying out their duties, the Chinese
journalists have uncovered the crimes committed by the U.S.-led
NATO in Yugoslavia and revealed their ambitions for expanding
hegemony under the mask of "protecting human rights".
</P>
<P>
He paid his respect to Shao Yunhuan, Xu Xinghu and Zhu Ying,
the three Chinese journalists killed in May during NATO's bombing
of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, saying that they had given
their lives to justice and would always be the pride of the
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The association at today's conference donated notebook
computers to Chinese journalists now working in Yugoslavia.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
said on Friday he was surprised that Russian troops had already
moved into Yugoslavia, but added that Moscow had assured they
would not move into Kosovo unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the Russian movement into Yugoslavia, Gore said, "
We didn't know they were going to go right there."
</P>
<P>
On a program of the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), Gore
stressed that the Russian army is not moving into Kosovo. "We have
been absolutely assured that they are not going to do that."
</P>
<P>
"They haven't entered Kosovo and they've given us assurances
that they're not going to enter Kosovo, at least not until
arrangements have been worked out for their participation under
agreed terms within a unified command," Gore said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Top Legislator on Kosovo Issue (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Meanwhile, Li reiterated China's principled stance on the
Kosovo crisis, saying that China has been firm in opposing the U.S.
-led NATO's brazen violations of the basic norms governing
international relations, and its act of bypassing the United
Nations (U.N.)and launching military attacks against a sovereign
state.
</P>
<P>
"China has also stood out for a political solution of the
Kosovo issue through peaceful negotiations on many occasions and
through various channels," Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said that under the prerequisite of an end to NATO's bombing,
the U.N. Security Council discussed a resolution concerning the
Kosovo issue Thursday, adding that although China has serious
reservations about some contents of the draft resolution, it did
not bloc its approval by abstaining from voting because it
carefully considered the general situation and Yugoslavia's
acceptance of a peace plan.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that Pakistan's leaders have expressed indignation
over NATO's bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade and offered
sympathy for the casualties and loss of property.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader went on to say that the ethnic issue has
always been a complicated and sensitive one in the Balkans region.
He said he also believed that ethnic issues are essentially the
internal affairs of a country and external forces have no right to
interfere.
</P>
<P>
"All countries should formulate a correct ethnic policy
according to their own national conditions," Li said, adding that
this will help maintain ethnic unity, social stability and
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Li also recalled his April visit to
Pakistan, and expressed his heart-felt thanks to Pakistan's
President, Prime Minister and Parliamentary leaders for the warm
welcome and hospitality he received during the visit.

<HEADLINE> China Pushing Environmental Protection Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- China will push development of
technology and equipment for environmental protection to better
prevent and control pollution, according to Song Ruixiang, a vice-
director of the State Environmental Protection Administration (
SEPA).
</P>
<P>
Song told a symposium on environmental protection equipment
today that China faces serious environmental problems and the
government has made environmental protection a major investment
area.
</P>
<P>
He said that the development will focus on urban sewage, air
pollution, industrial waste, and monitoring equipment. A special
coordination group was recently set up by the State Development
Planning Commission, the Construction and Science and Technology
ministries, and the SEPA.
</P>
<P>
China has more than 9,000 companies involved in environmental
protection, employing over 1.7 million people, and doing 52
billion yuan (about 6.3 billion U.S. dollars) worth of business.
But, analysts say, these companies are mainly in developed areas
in eastern China and their production is irregular. In addition,
less than 4 percent of China' major machinery products for
environmental protection are at a very advanced level.

<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- China's State Administration of
Cultural Heritage has decided to standardize information on
cultural relics in the nation's museums.
</P>
<P>
It will establish an information database for cultural relics
in museums, according to Dong Baohua, vice-director of the
Administration.
</P>
<P>
China has a wealth of cultural relics and fossils but its
museums are using backward management methods. Although 60 or so
are linked to the worldwide web, only a few like the Henan Museum
and Qufu Confucius Museum have their own web-sites.
</P>
<P>
Most have wasted time developing repetitive software for
linking up with the Internet, Dong says, and the databases they
established are not uniform.
</P>
<P>
In April, the Administration decided to overhaul the
information on cultural relics, world heritage sites, and
important archaeological digs.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Develop Textile-Related Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC), the private-sector investment affiliate of the
World Bank, has reversed an earlier decision and agreed to help
develop textile-related industries in Bangladesh, the BSS news
agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The change of the IFC stand came in the wake of criticism from
the media and local industrialists who favor the development of
the so-called backward linkage industries, which include dyeing,
spinning and weaving and the making of buttons and zippers.
</P>
<P>
The development plan may start with dyeing and finishing units,
the IFC was quoted as saying on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Salman F. Rahman, chairman of the Bangladesh
Textile Mills Association (BTMA), urged the government to be aware
of an "international conspiracy" against the industrialization of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Rahman, who censured a recent IFC study on Bangladesh's textile
sector, stressed the importance of establishing an adequate number
of such textile-related industries to ensure the success of the
country's garment and textile industries after the year 2004.
</P>
<P>
The study said the country does not need such industries and
the consultants of the report asked the IFC not to invest in
Bangladesh for the purpose, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The BSS quoted Eric Cruikshank, manager of IFC's South Asia
Department, as saying it was neither IFC's role nor its intention
to use the study for the purpose of extending formal advice on
industrial policy or strategy, either to the Bangladesh
authorities or to industry associations.
</P>
<P>
The textile sector has become the country's largest foreign
exchange earner, accounting for about 70 percent of the country's
total export earnings.

<HEADLINE> China to Strengthen Control Over Explosives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to crack down hard on
crimes involving explosives China's Ministry of Public Security is
planning a nationwide campaign to check and confiscate such
products.
</P>
<P>
A large amount of explosives have found their way into society
and criminal hands due to the poor management of enterprises
involved in manufacturing or selling them. There is also the
problem of illegal sales of explosives and fire-crackers by a
number of small companies, according to a ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has consequently ordered all enterprises in
possession of explosives to tighten their controls, and urged
local public security departments to check them out. Any
mismanagement discovered during the examination will lead to the
revoking of the enterprises' licenses.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, public security departments nationwide will
make an all out push to halt the illegal production and sales of
explosives and will impose severe punishments on those who break
the law.
</P>
<P>
A major publicity drive will be linked to the campaign to warn
the public against stockpiling explosives, according to the
ministry.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Securities Firms to Renew Licenses for Overseas-listed Stocks Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The China Securities Regulatory
Commission (CSRC) today urged securities firms to renew their
licenses for B share and overseas-listed stocks businesses.
</P>
<P>
The securities market watchdog said most of the licenses issued
by it in 1997 have now expired and urged the securities firms to
apply for new licenses within six months of the notice.
</P>
<P>
It said securities firms in China should apply through their
local CSRC offices, while overseas securities firms should apply
to the CSRC headquarters in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
According to regulations set by the CSRC, securities firms must
hold licenses for brokerage, underwriting and other businesses
connected with stocks open to overseas investors, including the B
shares listed at the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges but
reserved for overseas investors, H shares listed in Hong Kong and
other shares listed in overseas stock markets.

<HEADLINE> Russia Does Not Commit on Reports of Troops in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The headquarters of the Russian
airborne troops has not denied or confirmed reports that some of
its units in Bosnia have moved into Yugoslavia for possible
deployment in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We neither deny nor confirm these reports," the Itar-Tass news
agency quoted sources in the headquarters as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
Russian television stations have already shown footage of
Russian armored vehicles moving inside Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Five jeeps, 15 armored vehicles and trucks with Russian flags
and KFOR, acronym for Kosovo peacekeeping force, arrived from
Uglevic, Bosnia, in Belgrade Friday morning and are standing by
for their possible dispatching to Kosovo, Tass said in a report
from the Yugoslav capital, quoting diplomatic sources.
</P>
<P>
Several warplanes with Russian peacekeepers aboard are expected
to come from Moscow to Belgrade soon, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
Nikolai Staskov, chief of the Russian airborne troops
headquarters, refused to comment on the matter. He only said that
some 2,500 Russian peacekeepers were "being prepared" for a
possible moving for the Kosovo area.
</P>
<P>
"If there is a decision, we are ready to fulfill this task in
any time," Staskov said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, talks in Moscow between Russian and U.S.
military experts, which hit a deadlock on Russia's peacekeeping
role in Kosovo, were adjourned indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
"We and the Americans disagree on the role that the Russian
peacekeeping contingent will play in Kosovo," said Leonid Ivashov,
head of the Russian Defense Ministry's International Military
Cooperation Department.
</P>
<P>
"NATO has already divided the Kosovo area into sectors to be
controlled by NATO units commanded by NATO generals," Ivashov said.
</P>
<P>
Russia is supposed to have its units in those sectors under
NATO command, "which is inconsistent with the position of this
country," Ivashov said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Moscow's stance that its units will be involved
in peacekeeping activities in Kosovo in close contact with NATO
units but not under NATO command.
</P>
<P>
The Russian delegation suggested that the Russian contingent
look after northern Kosovo, since it is largely populated by
ethnic Serbs who "still trust Russia," the Interfax news agency
quoted Ivashov as saying.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side, however, did not accept this proposal, and they
will brief U.S. and NATO leaders later Friday on the results of
the Moscow talks, which started Thursday.
</P>
<P>
There were no words on the time and venue of further talks. "We
are waiting for a signal from the other side," Ivashov said.
</P>
<P>
In another related development, Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev convened an emergency meeting of top military officials
at 16:10 local time (12:10 GMT), Tass reported, quoting the
ministry staff.
</P>
<P>
The meeting may have been caused by "a sharp change in the
situation around Kosovo which shaped out in the last hours,"
according to the staff.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of China (BOC), the
largest state foreign exchange bank in China, has been increasing
services for overseas-funded enterprises in China and loans for
them.
</P>
<P>
By the end of April, some 300 of the world's top 500
multinationals had invested in China and the BOC had business ties
with 180 of them and had loaned 28.4 billion yuan and 700 million
U.S. dollars to companies they funded.
</P>
<P>
The BOC is the first state-owned commercial bank to make loans
to overseas-funded enterprises in China. Last year, it adopted a
policy of giving special credit support to enterprises funded by
prominent multinationals.
</P>
<P>
Among the companies that received this support in 1998 are
those funded by the U.S.'s Motorola, Sweden's Ericsson, Nehterland

<HEADLINE> Russia-U.S. Military Talks Adjourned Indefinitely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Talks here between Russian and U.S.
military officials on Russia's peacekeeping role in Kosovo were
adjourned indefinitely Friday, Leonid Ivashov, head of the Russian
Defense Ministry's International Military Cooperation Department
said.
</P>
<P>
"We and the Americans disagree on the role that the Russian
peacekeeping contingent will play in Kosovo," Ivashov said.
</P>
<P>
"NATO has already divided the Kosovo area into sectors to be

the Moscow talks, which started Thursday.
</P>
<P>
There were no words on the time and venue of more such talks.
"We are waiting for a signal from the other side," Ivashov said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side, meanwhile, said it had not expected any
breakthrough in the Moscow talks and that making agreements at
this stage "wouldn't have been ethical, because there are other
countries and organizations that are involved in the negotiation
process on Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
Strobe Talbott, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State who
participated in the talks, said Russia had not yet made up its
mind whether to take part in the future peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
He repeated Washington's position that NATO troops should make
up the core of the force and that NATO's presence in each sector
will be essential to make the peacekeeping mission effective.
</P>
<P>
Talking about a plan to divide Kosovo into four sectors,
Talbott said the proposed division was not based on ethnic
principles, adding that ethnically based division would represent
"Balkanization in its worst form."
</P>
<P>
In another related development, Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said Friday that it would be "at least immoral" to speak of
a victory in Yugoslavia, because "this is a case of everybody
losing."
</P>
<P>
"It was an aggression against a sovereign country in which
people, masses of refugees and a country suffered," Interfax
quoted Ivanov as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I doubt that anybody can claim victory," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
He also insisted that Russian peacekeeping contingents in
Kosovo "will not be subordinated to anybody."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Funds For Laidoff Workers Being Used Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Funds intended for employees who
were laid off by China's state-owned enterprises were better used
last year in spite of some minor management problems, according to
the National Audit Office.
</P>
<P>
It came to this conclusion after its latest audit of the 11.8
billion yuan (1.4 billion U.S. dollars) managed by provinces,
autonomous regions, municipalities, and central government
departments.
</P>
<P>
Of that amount, 8.3 billion yuan came from the central
government and the remainder from companies and elsewhere in
society. NAO officials say that the proportion of these funds was
not as good as was intended, with the government making up the
major part. The ideal mix would be government, enterprises, and
society each contributing a third.
</P>
<P>
The audit showed that last year 5.8 billion yuan was spent on
basic needs and finding work for laid-off employees in 17
provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, and 891 million
yuan was distributed to government administered industries.
</P>
<P>
And, 5.1 billion yuan was not used, thanks mainly to the
delayed allocation of government financing. The audit also found
225 million yuan being misused and spent on purposes other than
for laid-off employees and finding new jobs for them.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Government Issues Anti-Corruption Decree </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government Friday
issued a 10-point code of conduct for public servants due to
mounting public criticism over the recent scandals and other forms
of official corruption.
</P>
<P>
At a cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Kim Jong-pil,
the anti-corruption decree was adopted to govern officials'
behavior on the basis of an outline prepared by the Government
Administration-Home Affairs Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Under the decree, public servants are banned from receiving
gifts worth more than 50,000 won (some 40 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
They are also banned from sending invitation cards for weddings
or funerals to private bodies and companies, and from accepting
money or gifts from them.
</P>
<P>
The presentation of wreaths or potted plants, timed with
funerals or inauguration ceremonies, will also be subject to the
ban.
</P>
<P>
The act of receiving "money envelopes" will not be allowed.
</P>
<P>
The use of official cars, especially by high-ranking officials,
for individual purposes will be strictly forbidden while they will
be also barred from using hotels or other luxurious places for the
wedding ceremonies of their children.
</P>
<P>
Government officials will be banned from joining supporting
associations of politicians along with making donations to them.
</P>
<P>
The government made it clear that those violating the code of
conduct will be subject to punishment in connection with their
promotions and transfers. Their direct superiors will also face
disciplinary penalty.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the decree also calls for the abolition of wives
associations of high-ranking government officials.
</P>
<P>
The behavior of ministers' wives has come under criticism for
creating an environment leading to the "dress graft" scandal in
which the wife of an incarcerated tycoon attempted to bribe the
wives of high-ranking officials with high-quality dresses.
</P>
<P>
Along with the decree, the government is seeking to devise a
comprehensive program to root out the corruption within
officialdom next month by inaugurating a corruption prevention
policy committee and opening the way for civil organizations to
step up their functions as the watchdogs of officials'
irregularities.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Analysts Say Assets Management Corporations Critical To Risk Problem (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Assets management corporations
that handle non-performing assets of state-owned commercial banks
are critical to keeping financial risks at a minimum, according to
Chinese and foreign financial analysts.
</P>
<P>
Handing commercial banks' bad loans over to assets management
corporations is the latest reform move in China's banking sector.
A pilot corporation, Cinda Assets Management Corp., was
established April 20 to handle non-performing loans from the China
Construction Bank (CCB).
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China (PBOC), the central bank, has
announced that 3 more corporations will be set up this year to
handle bad loans of the 3 other major state-owned commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
The bank's Prof. Tang Xu says that since China implemented its
opening up and reform policies 20 years ago, assets of banks have
grown sharply with the rapid economic development, but banks'
capital adequacy has declined at the same time.
</P>
<P>
The corporations can both handle the banks' bad loans and
reduce their total assets, thus bringing their capital adequacy
rate to a higher level and largely increasing their ability to pay,
Tang says.

<P>
MANILA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A fire caused by a gas leak struck
the Pasong Diablo River in Muntinlupa City of Metro Manila on
Friday, killing one person and gutted 140 houses.
</P>
<P>
Muntinlupa City Mayor Jaime Fresnedi said the gas leak occurred
after the drilling rig of the Geotechnics Phils. Corporation hit
the main gas pipeline in the Pasong Diablo River Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The gasoline fuel leaked with great pressure and began mixing
with the river water. In the early morning on Friday, the gasoline
fuel eventually ignited fire and burned down houses near the
river.
</P>
<P>
Fresnedi has ordered the evacuation and rescue of the affected
families on the fire scene.
</P>
<P>
By now, some 30 families have been evacuated and a school
nearby will be used as an additional evacuation center in case
more victims of the fire come.

<HEADLINE> China Plans To Increase Steel Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- China will increase efforts to
produce quality steel products this year to reduce dependence on
imports and to boost exports.
</P>
<P>
The industry expects to reduce steel imports by 3 million tons
this year and to increase hi-tech and value-added product output
by 1 million tons, according to a State Administration of
Metallurgical Industries official.
</P>
<P>
If that goal is reached, China's iron and steel industry will
increase revenues by 2 billion yuan, he says. To encourage exports,
the government has raised export rebates from 11 percent to 13
percent, he says, and asks iron and steel companies to look for
new markets and to increase their share of the global market.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that continued low steel prices on the
global market put pressure on China.
</P>
<P>
The industry wants to hold steel imports to below 700 million
tons this year.
</P>
<P>
Shi Wanpeng, vice-minister with the State Economic and Trade
Commission, recently asked government departments and enterprises
to phase out outdated equipment, stop producing shoddy steel
products, reduce imports, and help stop the smuggling of steel.
</P>
<P>
Because of efforts to stop smuggling earlier this year, the
price of some domestic steel products picked up in the second
quarter.

<HEADLINE> EU Allocates 52 Million Dollars For Kosovo Refugees Return Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said here
Friday that it has allocated 50 million euros (52 million US
dollars) for a plan for the return of refugees to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The funding comes from an 150-million-euro reserve earmarked
for the Kosovo crisis in a May 12 decision made by the European
Commission, the EU's executive body.
</P>
<P>
The allocation, which would be carried out by the EU executive'
s humanitarian office, covers humanitarian needs for the first 60
to 90 days of the return process, and will ensure that those
returning will get packages enabling them to carry out emergency
repairs to their homes.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 30 million euros (31.2 million US dollars) will
go to non-governmental organizations that, under the coordination
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), will
carry out the distribution of the shelter packages and the
domestic items, the EU commission said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 10 million euros (10.4 million US dollars) will go
to UNHCR, bringing the total EU contribution this year to UNHCR
for the Kosovo crisis to 33.3 million euros (34.63 million US
dollars), the commission said.
</P>
<P>
And the remaining 10 million euros (10.4 million US dollars)
will go to projects for Kosovar refugees, who are likely to remain
in Albania and Macedonia over the winter, to prepare for cold
weather, the EU's executive added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Analysts Say Assets Management Corporations Critical To Risk Problem (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Davin Mackenzie, the International Finance Corporation's chief
representative in China, says that Cinda's taking over the non-
performing CCB loans is a big step forward by the government in
tackling the bad debt problem of China's state-owned banks.
</P>
<P>
This took CCB's bad loans off its books, freeing it up so that
it could concentrate on better quality assets and issue loans on a
commercial basis rather for government policy-directed lending, he
says.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank economist for China Kathie Krumm says that the
corporation is an important step by the government to address
weaknesses in the financial sector, but other efforts are as
critical to further minimizing financial risks.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the four large state-owned commercial banks
constitute the major part of China's banking industry and that
solving their problems in non-performing loans will make a more
solid foundation for financial stability in China.
</P>
<P>
The PBOC's Vice-Governor Yan Haiwang said he is confident in
the assets management corporations' prospects and that they will
become a powerful force for minimizing financial risk, improving
the quality of credit, and reforming state-owned enterprises.

<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua)-- China is ready to work with Monaco
to expand friendly cooperation in various areas and to push
bilateral relations to a higher level, Chinese Vice-President Hu
Jintao said here today.
</P>
<P>
Hu made the remark in talks with visiting Crown Prince Albert
of the Principality of Monaco this afternoon. He said China and
Monaco had maintained a sound momentum of bilateral relations
since they established diplomatic ties in 1995, enjoying increased
exchanges and cooperation in the economic, trade, cultural and art
fields.
</P>
<P>
China believes that all countries, big or small, rich or poor
and strong or weak, as equal members of the international
community, should develop friendly cooperation on the basis of the
Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"China and Monaco, although having different national
conditions, share a common desire to increase mutual understanding
and friendship," he said.
</P>
<P>
Albert, on behalf of Prince Rainier III, Monaco's head of
state, and all delegation members, thanked the Chinese government
for its warm reception because it demonstrated the existing sound
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that Monaco is ready to increase cooperation with
China in economic, cultural and sports areas. The crown prince
also invited Hu to pay a visit to Monaco, for which Hu was very
thankful.
</P>
<P>
In their talks, Hu briefed the visitors on China's reform and
opening up drive, economic development and its opinions on current
international situation.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the talks, Hu presided over a welcoming ceremony for
Albert and his party, who arrived here this morning.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Academics Provide Advice To Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The State Economic and Trade
Commission's and Chinese Academy of Engineering's Academic Project
has solved key technical issues for 7 state-run enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The project began last year to get the academics together to
act as technical consultants for medium-sized and large state-own
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
So far nearly 100 academics have provided technical support to
large enterprises, not all of whose problems are sophisticated. A
simple lack of information has kept some advanced technology away
from enterprises, while a shortage of trained personnel has led to
a lack of guidance in making use of new technology even after it
is brought in.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Report: Russia Deploys Troops on Kosovo Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Some 500 airborne Russian troops
were moved Friday from Bosnia-Herzegovina to Yugoslavia Friday,
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Russian military contingent will be deployed on the Kosovo
administrative border, Interfax quoted sources in Moscow as saying,
adding that the Russian troops are equipped with rifles and
armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The troops will remain in the concentration area, which was
not specified, until a decision is made about their participation
in the Kosovo peacekeeping operation, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
In another report, Interfax said about 1,000 Russian troops
will be flown into Kosovo on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers, that will include 300 airborne troops, will make
preparations for the arrival of the principal Russian contingent
that will be part of a future international peacekeeping force,
Interfax said, quoting what it called well-informed sources in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The Russian troops will fly to the Yugoslav towns of Pec,
Slatina and Pristina aboard six Il-76 transport planes expected to
take off around 14:00 Moscow time (10:00 GMT) from the Russian
cities of Ryazan, Ivanovo and Pskov, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
"The units are already on the airfields and are waiting for
orders to take off," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The principal Russian contingent will be taken to Kosovo
either by air, aboard An-22, Il-76 or An-124 transport planes, or
by rail or by sea, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, talks between Russian and U.S. military experts,
which hit a deadlock Friday on Russia's peacekeeping role in
Kosovo, were adjourned indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
"We and the Americans disagree on the role that the Russian
peacekeeping contingent will play in Kosovo," said Leonid Ivashov,
head of the Russian Defense Ministry's International Military
Cooperation Department.
</P>
<P>
"NATO has already divided the Kosovo area into sectors to be
controlled by NATO units commanded by NATO generals," Ivashov said.
</P>
<P>
Russia is supposed to have its units in those sectors under
NATO command, "which is inconsistent with the position of this
country," Ivashov said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Moscow's stance that its units will be involved
in peacekeeping activities in Kosovo in close contact with NATO
units but not under NATO command.
</P>
<P>
The Russian delegation suggested that the Russian contingent
look after northern Kosovo, since it is largely populated by
ethnic Serbs who "still trust Russia," the Interfax news agency
quoted Ivashov as saying.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side, however, did not accept this proposal. They
will brief U.S. and NATO leaders later Friday on the results of
the Moscow talks, which started Thursday.
</P>
<P>
There were no words on the time and venue of more such talks.
"We are waiting for a signal from the other side," Ivashov said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian PDI-P Still Leads in Vote Count: Antara </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Democratic Party of
Struggle (PDI-P) maintained its lead in the preliminary results of
the June 7 election as 45.08 percent of the votes were counted
Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to results collected by the official Antara News
Agency from provincial chapters of the Indonesian Election
Committee (PPI), by Friday afternoon, the PDI-P led by Megawati
Soekarnoputri, daughter of Indonesia's founding President
Soekarno, got more than 19.1 million votes. It was followed by the
Golkar Party with more than 12.4 million votes.
</P>
<P>
Of the 57,518,377 counted ballots, or 45.08 percent of the
registered voters, PDI-P got 19,100,102, Golkar 12,432,772, the
National Awakening Party (PKB) 9,016,124, the United Development
Party (PPP) 5,506,395 and the National Mandate Party (PAN)
4,105,318.
</P>
<P>
The PDI-P was leading in 11 provinces, namely in North
Sumatera, South Sumatera, Lampung, Jakarta, West Java, Central
Java, East Java, Yogyakarta, Bali, East Kalimantan and Central
Kalimantan.
</P>
<P>
Golkar was dominant in 14 provinces, namely Riau, Jambi,
Bengkulu, West Nusa Tenggara, East Nusa Tenggara, East Timor,
South Kalimantan, West Kalimantan, North Sulawesi, South Sulawesi,
Central Sulawesi, Southeast Sulawesi, Maluku and Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
In Aceh, the PPP was in the lead with 200,549 votes while in
West Sumatera, PAN took the lead with 259,578 votes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, provincial results of vote counting at the national
level given by the National General Election Commission (KPU) as
of 19:00 local time (11:00 GMT) showed that PDI-P has received
6,672,997, followed by PKB with 3,479,453, Golkar Party 2,787,616,
PPP 1,607,706 and PAN 1,144,370.
</P>
<P>
According to Antara, 18 of 39 political parties contesting in
the general election in North Sulawesi Province have refused to
acknowledge the results on the pretext of arrogance and vulgarity
on the part of Golkar and the bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique signed by their leaders on Friday, the 18
parties demanded a new polling on condition that Golkar be
disqualified.
</P>
<P>
Around 100 million of the country's 127 million eligible voters
cast their votes at about 320,000 polling stations on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The balloting was witnessed by more than 500,000 election
monitors, including 500 from abroad, with former U.S. President
Jimmy Carter among them.
</P>
<P>
A total of 48 political parties, most of them newly formed,
contested the country's eighth general election since Indonesia
gained independence in 1945.
</P>
<P>
The election chooses 462 members of the 500-seat House of
Representatives (DPR). The remaining 38 seats have been allotted
to the military, whose members do not vote.
</P>
<P>
The 48 parties fielded 10,500 candidates for the DPR, as well
as provincial and district legislative assemblies.

<P>
NEW DELHI, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The sensitive index on the
Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) market Friday lost 87.11 points to
3,969.36 as against Thursday's close of 4,056.47.
</P>
<P>
The national index also dropped by 33.52 points to 1,727.57

and 152.03 compared with the last close of 401.11 and 155.23

</P>
<P>
Equities on the BSE Friday suffered a sharp setback due to
heavy selling pressure and lack of fresh purchases from foreign
funds.
</P>
<P>
Operators preferred to square up their positions at the weekend
as well as on the eve of crucial talks between India and Pakistan
Saturday to defuse the Kargil crisis, market sources said.

<HEADLINE> China Keeps Careful Eye on Junior Volleyball Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- China did not exult long in the
excitement for the gold medal they won at the second Asian under-
17 volleyball championship as they shed light on its own
shortcomings and remained somber-minded on the prospect.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jiaqin, head coach of the China Under-17 Volleyball squad,
said Friday here that China, with an average height of 1.82 meters,
displayed fully their dominance on the net and upset the holders
Japanese for the title of the Under-17 event which concluded on
Wednesday at Singapore.
</P>
<P>
China came to a shaky start in the final as they trailed 25-27,
16-25 but they turned the tables by becoming stronger in blocks
and held off the charge of the defending champions 25-16, 25-20,
16-14 in the following three sets.
</P>
<P>
"We are on the same par with the other three teams including
Japan, South Korea and Chinese Taipei, but we carry off the palm
chiefly for our edge on the net." said Wang.
</P>
<P>
But Wang turned circumspect as she said of the strong points of
Japan, South Korea and Chinese Taipei, which are the main hurdles
for China in the eight-team regional competition.
</P>
<P>
"Japan and South Korea are better in basics, and their skills
are more balanced, highlighted by their well-done back-court
defence and spike" said Wang, who was also the assistant coach
when China claimed the title in the first World Youth Games in
Moscow last year.
</P>
<P>
Wang's views were echoed by Yu Guangyan, an offcial with the
Chinese Volleyball Management Center, who said that the well-
balanced skills of Japan and South Korea related to their high-
level coaching.
</P>
<P>
"They gave adequate attention to junior volleyball by demanding
high-level coaching. China is yet to put more into the junior
volleyball development."
</P>
<P>
Yu played down the chances for China in the World Under-17
Championships in September, for which the top four teams of the
Asian event qualified.
</P>
<P>
"We did not want to make the Under-17 side feel pressure. Most
of them will attend the City Games in September and their form
would thus be affected." Yu said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Firmer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed in
Sydney Friday at 66.28 U.S. cents from 66.11 U.S. cents Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Weaker gold prices and the threat of higher U.S. interest rates
are waning as influences on the Australian dollar, according to
Colonial State Bank chief economist Craig James.
</P>
<P>
At the close, the Australian dollar was buying 63.08 euro from
63.16 euro Thursday and 78.67 Japanese yen from 78.10 yen.

<HEADLINE> Australian Sharemarket Finishes Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Australian sharemarket
finished lower Friday in Sydney as renewed interest rate fears
weighed on Wall Street and local investors.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark all ordinaries index finished 28.4 points lower
at 2950.2.
</P>
<P>
Leading the decline were key blue chip and banking stocks,
which pushed the all industrials index down 94.0 points to 5145.5.
In contrast, the all resources index gained 41.0 points to 1213.9.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's news of a better performing Japanese economy caused
fresh concern in the U.S. that the unfettered growth there would
cause the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. That put
pressure on interest rate sensitive bank stocks on the Australian
market, with the banking index losing 186.9 points to 6520.4.
</P>
<P>
Among the major banks, the National Australia Bank shed 72
cents to 25.40 Australian dollars, the Commonwealth bank lost 93.1
cents to 24.20 Australian dollars, Westpac bank fell 33 cents to
9.97 Australian dollars and the ANZ bank dropped 18.9 cents to
10.91 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, resource and gold stocks staged a strong recovery
from a heavy sell-down in recent days as firming commodity prices
and positive economic data from Japan boosted sentiment.
</P>
<P>
Mining giants Rio Tinto and BHP led the way, with Rio Tinto
adding a massive 1.55 Australian dollars to 24.30 Australian
dollars and BHP up 47 cents at 17.50 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The gold index added 3.19 percent or 25.3 points to 818.4.
</P>
<P>
National turnover on the stock exchange reached 428.88 million
shares traded valued at 835.13 million U.S. dollars, with 744
falls outnumbering 617 rises and 460 stocks steady.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Productivity to Grow by 3.3 Percent in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's overall
productivity is expected to grow by 3.3 percent in 1999, amidst an
expected 1.0 percent growth in the economy, the National
Productivity Corporation (NPC) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In its 1998 Annual Report, the corporation said the government
has outlined several strategic thrusts through the National
Economic Recovery Plan (NERP) to enhance the stimulation of
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
These include stabilizing the ringgit, the country's currency,
restoring market confidence, maintaining financial market
stability, strengthening economic fundamentals, continuing the
equity and socio-economic agenda, and revitalizing the affected
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The NPC also pointed out that the implementation of the NERP
and the 1999 budget have laid the foundation for a sustainable
economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the manufacturing sector's productivity is expected to
improve by 4.6 percent, while the easing of monetary policy
coupled with the strengthening of regulatory framework and greater
use of local ports have stimulated the growth of the transport
sector.
</P>
<P>
Productivity of the transport sector in 1999 is expected to
grow by 1.4 percent, where output is expected to expand by 4.8
percent while employment would grow by 3.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the agriculture sector is expected to register a
positive growth in output and employment, while its productivity
is expected to rise by 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The favorable growth would be due to increase in production of
major commodities, particularly rubber and palm oil. Strong demand
will provide impetus for the sector to grow.
</P>
<P>
The NPC believes that the construction sector would continue to
feel the effect of the economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
Output in the sector is expected to decline by 1.7 percent,
employment to drop by 1.5 percent while productivity to ease by
0.2 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A Search and rescue team has begun
tracing the path of the missing Russian helicopter which was
chartered to carry rice aid to Mulia, capital of Puncak Jaya
district in Indonesia's Irian Jaya province.
</P>
<P>
The Kamov 3029 helicopter went missing Friday morning, Antara
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The team consists of officers of the mobile brigade, the
district police and the Wamena district military command, official
of the provincial transportation office Sukardjo Widjojo said.
</P>
<P>
The chopper, piloted by Russian Capt. Anatoly Vladimir, took
off from Wamena at 8:10 a.m. local time and the last contact with
the pilot was at 8:15 a.m.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Vladimir, the chopper was carrying three crew
members, two Indonesian passengers and three tons of rice.
</P>
<P>
Authorities at the Wamena airport tasked a Cessna airplane of
the Mission Aviation Fellowship to trace the Kamov 3029 upon its
failure to return at 11:00 a.m. Another Russian chopper, a Kamov
021, was also tasked to trace the missing helicopter but they
failed to find it.

<HEADLINE> Sao Tome's Biggest Cocoa Farm Go on Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Workers at Sao Tome &AMP; Principe's
biggest state-run farming and animal husbandry firm, St. Margarida
company, started general strike Thursday to demand wage increase.
</P>
<P>
The workers, whose average monthly wage are about 11 U.S.
dollars, are demanding a 350 percent wage rise, while the
employers agreed on a 175 percent increase, with the factory
owners agreeing on a 27 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
The strike is worrying the Sao Tome authorities as the factory
is a major producer of cocoa, the staple export item and major
source of foreign income.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some government institutions, like the criminal
investigation department of the police force, are also considering
going to street, demanding for higher wage, improved health care
and work condition.
</P>
<P>
Journalists have also sent a memorandum, warning that the
government should give enough attention to the demand for higher
wage in the society.
</P>
<P>
Sao Tome, one of the poorest country in the world, is an
agricultural country with cash crops like cocoa as its main
product. The island country started its economic reform since
1987 in accordance with the demand by the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund.

<HEADLINE> India Says Kashmir Line of Control Not Negotiable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Indian caretaker Prime Minister
Atal Behari Vajpayee Friday said that the Line of Control (LOC)
between India and Pakistan in the Kashmir area is not negotiable.
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen in Lucknow, 497 kilometers southeast of New
Delhi, Vajpayee said, "The LOC is clearly defined and is marked on
the maps which bear the signatures of the representatives of both
the countries."
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India (PTI) Thursday said that Pakistan
might propose re-demarcation of the LOC during the visit of its
Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz to India on Saturday. This indication
was given by Sartaj Aziz himself in an interview with BBC Thursday
during which he suggested that the marking in the mountainous area
was not much accurate.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee said that Pakistan's attempts to "re-demarcate" the
LOC would not yield any results.
</P>
<P>
"It remains to be seen what attitude Pakistan adopts at
tomorrow's talks," he said, adding that Islamabad's "armed
intrusion" in Jammu and Kashmir would be the only agenda of
Saturday's proposed talks between External Affairs Minister
Jaswant Singh and Sartaj Aziz.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether India would consider full-fledged military
operations against Pakistan, Vajpayee said that India's forces
were ready to defend the country if the situation so arose.
</P>
<P>
The Indian army is planning to launch a major offensive soon
against the positions held by "Pakistan-backed infiltrators" near
Drass and Batalik in the Kargil sector of Kashmir where a military
operation had been launched over two weeks ago, the PTI said
Friday.

BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- China will increase efforts to
improve the building materials industry by closing down small
cement plants and glass factories, according to a senior State
Building Materials Industry Administration official.
</P>
<P>
He says that nearly 2,000 unlicensed cement and 250 small glass
operations will be shut down, and a large number of outdated
cement and glass production lines will be closed.
</P>
<P>
This will help reduce production capacity by 100 million tons
of cement and a considerable amount of glass by the end of next
year, or a seventh of the total production capacity of the two
sectors.
</P>
<P>
No new glass producers or cement plants will be allowed to open,

<HEADLINE> China's Hexi Corridor Becoming Leading Grain Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, June 11 (Xinhua) -- China has spent a billion yuan on
12 grain production centers in the Hexi Corridor on the old Silk
Road in north central China in Gansu Province over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
The 12 grain centers produce 1.1 billion kg of commodity grain
annually, accounting for 70 percent the province's total.
</P>
<P>
The Hexi Corridor has four million people and plentiful water,
mineral, tourism, animal, plant, and solar energy resources. It
has 19 percent of Gansu's farmland, but produces 99 percent of its
cotton, 35 percent of its oil-bearing crops, and 92 percent of its
sugarbeets.
</P>
<P>
It has the second greatest amount of sunshine in China after
the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and has put a lot of effort into
developing sunshine-intense, water-conserving agriculture. Corn,
wheat, sugarbeets, vegetables, and fruit are grown under plastic
sheeting.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers have also planted drought-resistant trees and
bushes in sandy areas and when they get big enough to serve as
windbreaks they can harbor grapes, vegetables, cotton, flowers,
and fruit and be used to protect pigs, sheep, and fishponds.
</P>
<P>
Per capita annual income of farmers averaged 2,273 yuan last
year, one of the highest in the province.

<HEADLINE> China Plays Positive Role in Political Solution to Kosovo: Article </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- China played a positive role in
bringing the Kosovo crisis back to a political solution, said here
Thursday a signed article entitled Upholding Justice and Defending
Peace.
</P>
<P>
The article, written by Guo Jisi, said the adoption of a draft
resolution on Kosovo by the UN. Security Council Thursday after
the U.S.-led NATO officially suspended its bombing of Yugoslavia
indicated that the alliance's 78-day wanton bombardment had not
worked and that the Kosovo crisis had ultimately be brought back
to the track of political settlement.
</P>
<P>
China has all along unequivocally opposed to the use of force
and insisted on a political solution to the Kosovo conflict. Now,
its stance has proven to be the only right way out of the crisis,
the article noted.
</P>
<P>
On the midnight of March 24, a tragic day for the whole world,
the calmness and peace prevailing Yugoslavia was broken by the
barbaric air attack launched by the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization led by the United States. The attack was staged under
the pretext of safeguarding humanitarianism and NATO bypassed the
United Nations Security Council, the only international
organization having the mandate to keep world peace, the article
went on.
</P>
<P>
The aggressive act severely violated the UN Charter and norms
governing international relations, undermined the authority of the
Security Council and created a very dangerous precedent in the
history of international relations, it said.
</P>
<P>
China, proceeding from its persistent position of maintaining
world peace, had made swift response to NATO's brutal move, the
article pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders, including President Jiang Zeming, Chairman of
the CPC Standing Committee Li Peng and Premier Zhu Rongji,
solemnly and repeatedly made clear China's stance on the matter.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry issued a statement on the same day,
opposing NATO's military action against Yugoslavia. It stressed
that the air campaign could only serve to complicate the situation
in Kosovo, a Serbian province mostly inhabited by ethnic Albanians
seeking independence, and strongly demanded the military bloc
immediately stop its operation, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Also on the day, China prompted the Security Council to call an
urgent meeting, at which Chinese permanent Representative to UN
Qin Huasun reaffirmed China's opposition to NATO's inhumane act in
Yugoslavia and demanded an immediate stop to the act.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government emphasized all along once that the
Kosovo issue should be solved fairly through negotiations on the
basis of respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Yugoslavia and guarantee the rights of all ethnic groups in the
province. It pointed out that resorting to military forces could
only make the situation there more complex.
</P>
<P>
Thus, China had pointed out a right way for the international
community to settle the Kosovo problem, the article said.
</P>
<P>
But regrettably, NATO intensified its air bombardment step by
step, expanding its targets to civilian facilities in disregard
of an outcry of the international community. During the 78-day air
campaign, NATO warplanes struck factories, bridges, schools and
hospitals, leaving more than 1000 civilians dead, thousands of
others injured and nearly one million displaced. NATO warplanes
even bombed convoys carrying refugees returning to Kosovo, and the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, which is protected by international
convention.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, the war, which was staged under the pretext of '
defending humanity,' produced the worst humanitarian catastrophe
in Europe after World War II and seriously undermined peace and
stability in the Balkans and the rest of the world," the article
said. "Such consequences proved how absurd the pretext is!"
</P>
<P>
In face of strong opposition against the military operation
from the Chinese people and other peace-loving peoples, rift
emerged within NATO. Related countries had to start seeking a
political settlement. On May 6, foreign ministers of the Group of
Seven and Russia issued a statement on the principles for a
political solution of the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
At this crucial moment, China intensified its efforts to help
end the conflict through political means. Chinese leaders
repeatedly underlined that the Kosovo issue should be resolved
peacefully through negotiations with Yugoslavia's sovereignty and
territorial integrity respected and the rights of all peoples in
the region guaranteed. China supported the United Nations to play
an active role in solving the crisis. It also maintained that any
political settlement should take the view of Yugoslavia into
consideration and demanded NATO immediately halt its bombing.
</P>
<P>
"China's status and role in seeking a political solution was
increasingly recognized by parties concerned as China is a
permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and a
responsible country sticking to principles," the article noted.
</P>
<P>
To urge NATO to halt its airstrikes and diminish the
casualties and property damages in Yugoslavia and to safeguard its
sovereignty and territorial integrity, Chinese leaders contacted
relevant foreign leaders to reaffirm China's stand that NATO
should immediately halt the bombings to create necessary
conditions and an atmosphere for the UN. Security Council to
peacefully settle the Kosovo issue. They stressed once again that
a UN. Security Council resolution should sufficiently reflect the
stands of all parties, especially the view from Yugoslavia, the
article said.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin held telephone conversations with his
Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin, exchanged messages with French
President Jacques Chirac and expressed Chinese stand to Russian
Kosovo envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin and EU Kosovo coordinator,
Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari.
</P>
<P>
The CPC Standing Committee Chairman Li Peng and Premier Zhu
Rongji also held talks or consultations with foreign leaders on
the Kosovo issue, said the article.
</P>
<P>
Germany, France, Finland and other related countries informed
China on the development of the issue or sought Chinese view on
the draft UN. resolution on Kosovo. To protect the interest of the
Yugoslav people and the authority and solemnity of the security
council, China insisted that NATO immediately stop its military
actions to set conditions for a formal discussion of the UN.
Security Council on the draft.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure from China, the NATO countries had to
repeatedly indicate that they would seriously consider China's
stand, and finally decided to pause its airstrikes at 21:20 June
10 before the security council started to discuss the draft.
</P>
<P>
In an amendment to the draft resolution, China emphasized that
the council should take the safeguarding of international peace
and security as its top duty and should respect the sovereignty
and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia. China is the only
Security Council member to put forth such an amendment which was
included in the final resolution.
</P>
<P>
Considering the facts that the Yugoslav government could accept
the "peace plan" and hoped it could be adopted as soon as possible,
China did not block the passage of the draft resolution by
abstaining from the voting while reserving its disagreement with
some items in an effort to end the huge disasters brought by NATO
bombing to all Yugoslav ethnic groups, including ethnic Albanians.
China's position won appreciation from all sides.
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the century, mankind is facing the fundamental
question of what kind of world will be brought into the new
millennium. The disgusting nature of the NATO military operation
against Yugoslavia, the severe destruction it brought about and
the absurd excuse used by NATO are all rarely seen in post cold
war era. Apart from Yugoslavia which is the direct victim, the UN
Charter, the international norms, the peace and stability in
Europe and the world as a whole have all been severely jeopardized.
The phenomenon provides food for thinking.
</P>
<P>
History has repeatedly proven that we cannot safeguard world
peace and stability without pursuing the principles of the UN
Charter, the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence and other
international norms. Otherwise, there will be no peace in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The article pledged that China, as a permanent member of the
Security Council, will work unremittingly to maintain UN's
credibility and authority and to safeguard the world peace and
stability, as it always does.
</P>
<P>
History will again prove that the peace trend is irresistible
and the righteous course is invincible, the article concluded.

<HEADLINE> Mixed Reaction to Kenya's 1999-2000 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The official Kenya Times Friday carried an article, saying that
ordinary people of Nairobi expressed pessimism on the budget
proposal.
</P>
<P>
They argued that in the past the government had not implemented
 proposals recommended by the budget, according to the article.
</P>
<P>
The article quoted a citizen as saying that politicians only
think about themselves, leaving the common people in cold.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan best-selling newspaper Daily Nation Friday gave some
case studies over the reaction to the new budget, arguing that
peddlers are happy with the Value-Added-Tax cut by one percent in
the budget, which makes their stocks slightly cheaper than they
were before.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan farmers feel a little relieved for the budget proposed
to raise the duties on imported agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, World Bank Representative to Kenya Harold Wackman
said Thursday that the budget was not balanced as had been
expected, giving not much hope to the investors.
</P>
<P>
But the Central Organization of Trade Unions in Kenya dismissed
it as a public relations budget to please investors without any
regard to the plight of Kenyans.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Concerns Over Russia's Direct Talks With Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott on Friday expressed concern over Moscow's intention
to talk directly with Yugoslavia on Russian peacekeepers' zone of
responsibility in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Talbott made the remarks here following a Russian Defense
Ministry official's suggestion early Friday that Russia conduct
direct talks with Belgrade on its peacekeeping role in Kosovo
province.
</P>
<P>
The exchange came after talks hit a deadlock Friday between
Russia and the United States on Russian troops' peacekeeping role
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Our positions on the role of the Russian military contingent
in the Kosovo operation differ. The Americans have taken a timeout,
" said Russian delegation leader Leonid Ivashov, director of the
Defense Ministry's International Military Cooperation Department.
</P>
<P>
Russia has insisted that its troops taking part in the Kosovo
peacekeeping mission not operate under NATO, while the
transatlantic military bloc says the mission would be under its
command and control.
</P>
<P>
Despite the deadlock, Talbott expressed the hope that "the
Russian Federation and the United States will together move
forward in the negotiating process," the Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
He said if Russia unilaterally agrees with Yugoslavia on a
separate sector, it will contradict not only the spirit of today's
talks between the Russian and American military, but it will
harbor a danger.
</P>
<P>
Talbott, who was to meet with Vladimir Putin, secretary of the
Russian Security Council, a top advisory body, in the Kremlin for
a "clearer (Russian) position," will fly to Brussels later Friday.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Economy Grows by 4% </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's ecomonic growth
rate of this fiscal year is expected to arrive at four percent,
higher than the target of 3.5 percent and last year's 3.3 percent,
the government has announced.
</P>
<P>
During the 1998/99 fiscal year which is to end this month, the
government has managed to bring inflation rate down to 8.9 percent
by the end of April, the lowest in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
With tight monetary and fiscal policy, the government aims to
further keep it down to 7.5 percent by the end of this month and
five percent by the end of June 2000, the Minister of State
Nassoro Malocho said in a speech fully published by newspapers
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Nassoro, who was addressing the parliament in the central city
of Dodoma Thursday, said that the government over the past year
has continued with its efforts to provide an enabling environment
for investors and gain confidence from donors.
</P>
<P>
During the year, agriculture has been adversely affected by
severe drought. The sector, including crops, livestock, fisheries
and hunting, contributed to 49.1 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Other sectors which contributed significantly to the GDP have
been mining and tourism, he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister, however, said the four percent growth rate is
still too low considering the population growth rate of 2.8
percent and widespread poverty.
</P>
<P>
Looking to the future, Malocho said Tanzania will strive to
achieve an economic growth rate of 4.9 percent in the year 1999
and six percent in 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's National Assembly, or its
parliament, Thursday set up a 12-man committee to look into the
Warri Crisis, reported Nigerian media Friday.
</P>
<P>
The assembly also urged the federal government to take definite
decision to end the crisis, said Nigerian daily the Daily Times.
</P>
<P>
The assembly, in a unanimously adopted motion implored
government to urgently dispatch law enforcement agents to the
troubled region to quell the carnage, while humanitarian aid
should be sent to the victims.
</P>
<P>
President Olusegun Obasanjo is expected to arrive at Osubi
early this morning before visiting the battered Warri City and
talking with warring ethnic group leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Warri region was largely calm Thursday, though sporadic gun
shoots could be heard from time to time.
</P>
<P>
Delta State government had urged Warri residents to go out of
their doors in daytime to resume business and their work, despite
a dusk to down curfew is still in effect.
</P>
<P>
The curfew was announced by the Delta State Governor Chief
James Ibori Monday to curb the rampant violence in the Nigerian
oil city.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers were also ordered to shoot a sight any violators of
the curfew making Warri street completely deserted.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of violence in Warri and its environs has
claimed nearly 3000 lives, making about hundreds of thousands of
people fleeing their homes.
</P>
<P>
The crisis began weeks ago when militant Ijaw youths torched an
entire Itsekiri village in Warri region, killing more than 100
people.
</P>
<P>
The Itsekiris then fought back in the same ferocious manner
killing people including Ijaws and Urhobos who are suspected to
have harbored the Ijaws.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pak Economic Performance Remains Dismal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's overall economic
performance in the outgoing fiscal year of 1998-99 remains dismal
as all major economic indictors fell short of the budget
forecasts.
</P>
<P>
The economic survey released Thursday for the outgoing fiscal
year ending June 30 shows that Pakistan's economy in 1998-99 is to
end up at just 3.1 percent growth rate against the projected 6
percent.
</P>
<P>
While releasing the economic survey, known as the pre-budget
document, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar conceded that the government
had failed to achieve the required growth rate of gross domestic
product (GDP) during the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The economic survey cited various reasons for the poor GDP
growth rate which include the Asian currency crisis, the global
economic recession and most importantly, the economic sanctions
imposed on Pakistan by some western countries after its nuclear
tests in May last year.
</P>
<P>
The current fiscal year witnessed the full impact of the
economic sanctions on Pakistan's domestic economy as well as the
continuation of deepening global economic recession with
consequential impact on its external sector.
</P>
<P>
The economic survey says that these two factors not only
precipitated a balance of payments crisis but also damaged the
gains achieved in the previous fiscal year, and most importantly,
interrupted the pace of implementation of structural and
stabilization measures.
</P>
<P>
"We never expected to have that serious impact of the sanctions
against Pakistan and that is why the GDP growth rate ended up at
3.1 percent in 1998-99 against 4.3 percent of last year," Dar
said.
</P>
<P>
However, the most encouraging thing, according to Dar, is that
Pakistan has been able to reduce the budget deficit rate of GDP to
4.7 percent from 5.4 percent in the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Economists here are of the view that the major reason, among
others, which contributed to the lower than expected GDP growth
rate is the poor performance of agriculture, manufacturing and
services sectors.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture, which has long been the mainstay of Pakistan's
economy, grew by only 0.35 percent against the budget forecast of
5.4 percent. The agriculture sector achieved a 3.8 percent growth
rate in the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The economic survey attributed the setback in the growth of
agriculture sector to unfavorable weather conditions and virus
attack.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the manufacturing and services sectors registered
growth rates of 4.7 percent and 4.1 percent respectively, much
lower than those achieved in the last fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's wheat production in 1998-99 remained at 18 million
tons against the target of 19 million tons, a drop of 5.3 percent.
Similarly, cotton crop did not perform well and its production was
only 8.8 million bales against the target of 10.5 million bales,
declining more than 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government may also find it difficult to realize
its revenue target for the current fiscal year. Official figures
show that during the first 10 months, the Central Board of Revenue
has collected only 229.6 billion rupees (4.44 billion U.S.
dollars) which is about 76 percent of the revised annual target of
303 billion dollars (5.86 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Because of the poor domestic economic performance, the
government lowered the annual revenue target five times in the
year from original 354.6 billion rupees to 303 billion rupees.
</P>
<P>
As a result of prudent fiscal management by the present
government, the domestic debt in relation to GDP has declined to
40.5 percent in 1998-99 from an average high of 44 percent during
the first seven years of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
However, the mounting debt servicing has emerged as the most
serious fiscal problem over the years. The debt servicing in
1998-99 has increased to 341.4 billion rupees (6.6 billion
dollars) from 285.8 billion rupees (5.5 billion dollars) in the
previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pakistan's outstanding external debt (medium and
long term) is close to 23 billion dollars in the outgoing fiscal
year, registering an increase of 1.6 percent over the last fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
Economists here believe that the current fiscal year is to be
remembered as the most difficult and challenging year for
Pakistan's economy which has been struggling for recovery.
</P>
<P>
As the pace of economic recovery was hampered by the
inhospitable domestic and international environment, Pakistan will
have to face another tough fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Government Maintains Pressure on Soccer Club </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
reiterated that it does not recognize Football Association of
Zambia (FAZ) led by Teddy Mulonga and said the government
ministers who grace FAZ functions do so in their personal
capacities.
</P>
<P>
Chief government spokesman and Information Minister Newstead
Zimba said here Thursday that the government stands firm on its
earlier decision to withhold financial and logistical support to
FAZ until a more accountable and transparent executives is put
into office.
</P>
<P>
He said Energy and Water Development Minister Ben Mwila who was
guest of honour at the BP final between Power Dynamos and Nkana
two weeks ago and at last weekend's Africa Cup qualifier between
Zambia and Madagascar where Sports Deputy Minister Cristopher
Chawinga was also present were not representing government.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the ministers were serving their individual
interests as sport arouses interest from fans of all walks of life.
"
</P>
<P>
FAZ has said it has no money to hold elections to choose its
new leadership as being demanded by the government.
</P>
<P>
Mulong's executive has been under government squeeze since
April last year when his executive was dissolved by Sports Council
of Zambia(SCZ) over allegations that it had misapplied 577 million
kwacha (about 230,000 U.S. dollars at current exchange rate) of a
government grant given to it for last year's Africa Cup of Nations
finals in Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
The FAZ has been going through financial difficulties since the
government withdrew support to show its displeasure with the
association's national executive led by Mulonga.
</P>
<P>
Following Zambia's poor performance at the Africa Cup finals in
Burkina Faso in February of 1998 the FAZ executive was removed two
months later on the charge of misapplication of the money the
government released for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
FIFA, reacting to what it saw as government interference in the
running of soccer, was on the verge of banning Zambia from
international football activities when the government reluctantly
restored in office the FAZ executive led by Mulonga.
</P>
<P>
The government allowed in September in 1998 Mulonga and his
team back in office but it imposed a financial squeeze on the
association in a bid to force the current executive out.
</P>
<P>
In March this year Zimba said that the government was waiting
for a new FAZ executive to be elected before it could once again
begin to provide the financial, moral and logistical support it
withdrew from the FAZ last year.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Ex-Heads of State Enjoy Wide Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A Nigerian government gazette issued
to the public Friday indicates that all past retired heads of
state can receive a monthly pension of 350,000 naira (about 3,725
U.S. dollars) plus other numerous benefits.
</P>
<P>
The gazette, released by the Federal Ministry of Justice, said
that the deputies of the head of states can get a sum of 250,000
(about 2,660 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The privileges they enjoy include a life-time diplomatic
passport, presidential protocol, three cars renewable every four
years, and a confidential secretary not below the rank of Grade
level 12 in the federal civil service.
</P>
<P>
Other benefits include free medical allowance within and
outside Nigeria, and an annual vacation abroad for a period of one
month.
</P>
<P>
They are also to be given a five-bedroom furnished bungalow,
according to the gazette, signed by the former head of state,
Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar and taking effect from this January.
</P>
<P>
Under the new constitution promulgated earlier this year,
former presidents and vice presidents as well as their
equivalents in the military administration are entitled to earn a
pension at a same rate equivalent to the incumbent office holders.
</P>
<P>
The constitution, however, states that former leaders would
only enjoy the pension "provided such person was not removed from
office by the process of impeachment or for breach of any
provisions of the constitution. "

State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) Lieutenant-General Khin
Nyunt returned here Friday from a five-day official visit to China
at the invitation of Chinese State Councilor Luo Gan.
</P>
<P>
Khin Nyunt's main entourage -- Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of Military Affairs Lieutenant-General Tin Hla, Foreign
Minister U Win Aung and seven other ministers -- also came back

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Sack Village Chief (1) (RPT) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WENZHOU, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Pan Hongcong, a village chief in a
coastal Chinese city that came to be known as "the capital of
China's private economy" certainly didn't expect such a
disgraceful end to his three-year term -- Pan is being kicked out
of office by villagers.
</P>
<P>
According to a Civil Affairs Ministry official in Beijing, Pan
may have become the first village chief in China to be ousted by
villagers before completing his time in office.
</P>
<P>
In the past, village officials who caused a lot of complaints
by farmers either were dismissed by superiors or stayed in office
until the next election.
</P>
<P>
But, on May 24, in the village of Liaodong near the city of
Wenzhou in Zhejiang Province, 1,290 of the 1,351 eligible voters
met to decide Pan's fate. He was director of the Liaodong
Villagers Committee and 1,122 villagers voted against him.
</P>
<P>
Pan had been chosen for the post in May of 1996 by a majority
vote of the same villagers. He had never held a village post
before that.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, China's hundreds of millions of farmers were given the
right to choose their own village leaders, who were formerly
appointed by township-level or higher governments, when the
Organic Villagers Committee Law went into effect on a trial basis.
Since then, most of the country's nearly one million villages have
held at least three direct elections.
</P>
<P>
In November of 1998, after soliciting opinions from the
countryside, the National People's Congress, China's top
legislature, amended the Organic Law and formally approved it.
</P>
<P>
The trial version only mentioned farmers' rights to recall a
leader with one simple sentence, but the new law made it more
explicit, one Beijing legal scholar explains.
</P>
<P>
The law says that if at least a fifth of a village's eligible
voters have a justifiable reason, they can ask for the recall of
any village officials, and any official who fails to get half the
votes of all eligible voters in the village will be removed
immediately.
</P>
<P>
In Liaodong, 494 people got together to ask for Pan's removal,
accusing him of abusing power and of bad management.

MAPUTO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Independent judicial systems were
urged in all Portuguese-speaking states, according to a judges'
meeting of the Portuguese-Speaking Community, which ended here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued after the three-day judges' conference said
that the legitimate rights of judical processes should be
independent of politics and other behaviors.
</P>
<P>
The communique also said that judges at the conference hope
that courts should continue to be independent and serve as a
guarantee for citizens' basic rights and freedom, the Noticias
daily newspaper reported Friday.
</P>

The communique passed by about 50 representatives from
Portugal, Angola, Brazil, Mozambique, Cape Verde, Sao Tome &AMP;

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges U.N. to Defend Principles of its </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has called upon the U.N. to
live up to its legal and ethical responsibility for defending
principles of its Charter and countering attempts of undermining
territorial integrity and independence of its member states.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Iraqi
Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said that the anti-Iraq
U.S. aggressive acts and statements represented additional
negative development imposed by the U.S. on the relations among
states, the Iraqi News Agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that this negative development
necessitates the international community to reply to the
U.S. hegemony.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf referred to a legislation by the U.S. Congress on
September 28, 1998, designed to "finance and arm terrorist groups
to destabilize Iraq's security and stability and threaten its
national unity" with the allocation of 97 million U.S. dollars for
this aggressive purpose.
</P>
<P>
He said that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has
met a group of mercenaries "who let down their country" with a
view to using them as tools to conspire on Iraq and threaten its
security and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged the U.N. to reject the U.S. deviate policy
aimed at dragging the international community into the "code of
jungle" and the spread of the brute force.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Unemployment Rate Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippines' unemployment rate
drops to 11.8 percent in April, 1.5 percent lower than the 13.3
percent of the same month in 1998, a report of the Philippine
National Statistics Office said Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the labor force population or the
economically active population increased by 4.2 percent from
32.111 million in April 1998 to 33.444 million in April 1999,
partly due to the new graduates entering the labor force.
</P>
<P>
The estimated labor force participation rate this April 1999
was 69.6 percent compared to the 68.6 percent registered a year
ago, the report said. This participation rate is the highest since
April 1991.
</P>
<P>
Along with the increasing labor force population, employment
level increased by 5.9 percent from 27.8 million in April 1998 to
29.5 million in April 1999.
</P>
<P>
Correspondingly, the employment rate increased by 1.5 percent
points to 88.2 percent in April 1999 from 86.7 percent in April
1998.
</P>
<P>
Of the 29.5 million persons employed, the agriculture, fishery
and forestry sector absorbed 12.1 million in April 1999, 15.9
percent higher than the 10.4 million of April 1998.
</P>
<P>
The number of workers in the services sector also increased by
1.3 percent from April 1998 to April 1999, but the industry sector
suffered losses with all classes of workers posting decreases.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Talks between the United States and
Russia over Moscow's peacekeeping role in Kosovo became deadlocked
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"No final breakthrough has been reached, and no agreements
have yet been signed," U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott told reporters following talks in the Russian Foreign
Ministry, which started Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether more talks will be held on the issue
between military experts of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Talbott was to meet with Vladimir Putin, secretary of the
Security Council, a top Russian advisory body, in the Kremlin
later Friday before leaving for Brussels, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"I expect that the meeting with Putin will provide a clearer
position. I hope for a clearer understanding of the problem on his
part," Talbott said.
</P>
<P>
Russia has insisted that its troops taking part in the Kosovo
peacekeeping mission would not operate under NATO, while the
transatlantic military bloc says the mission would be under its
command and control.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin: Russian Ties With NATO Remain Frozen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 11 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin said Friday
that Russia's relations with NATO were still frozen, and Moscow "
sees" what happens later.
</P>
<P>
Before his working meeting with Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov,
Yeltsin said, "relations with NATO are frozen for the time being.
As for the future, let's wait and see."
</P>
<P>
Russia has done its bit in restoring the peace in the Balkans
and now it is the NATO's countries turn to do so, said Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's stance was backed by many officials here in Moscow,
which has all along condemned NATO aggression against Yugoslavia
and its bypassing the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The announced pause in missile and air attacks against
Yugoslavia is no justification for renewal of relations with NATO,
a senior Foreign Ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
The remark came after statements made by NATO leaders about
the need to resume the contacts that had been frozen due to the
start of the 11-week air campaign on March 24.
</P>
<P>
"First, the military operation must stop completely,
announcing a pause is not good enough," the Interfax news agency
quoted the official as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said, "the Russian-NATO Founding Act will need rethinking"
in the wake of the NATO bombing of the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
"We still believe that by starting the operation against
Yugoslavia the North Atlantic Alliance unilaterally violated the
Founding Act," the official said.
</P>
<P>
"Until the situation has been re-evaluated, there will be no
resumption of relations with the alliance; in particular, Russian
representatives will not return to Brussels," the official said.
</P>
<P>
At the Defense Ministry, officials also said that resumption
of ties with NATO "is not on the list of priorities now," Interfax
reported.

HANGZHOU, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The more than 50 development
zones established over the last two decades in east China's
Zhejiang Province have become a major source of help for the
economy.
</P>
<P>
The zones have more than 25,800 enterprises, 2,793 of them
funded by overseas investors, and last year they had a GDP worth
28.6 billion yuan, or 5.6 percent of Zhejiang's total GDP.
</P>
<P>
Their exports were worth 1.76 billion U.S. dollars and
accounted for 14.6 percent of the province's total exports.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts attribute the growth to their rapidly improving
business environment. They have spent billions of yuan on
infrastructure and have implemented a series of policies favorable
to overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
The Hangzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone, a
major state-level zone, has put 1.68 billion yuan into
infrastructure since it was designated in 1993. Japanese, American,
Singaporean, and other investors have established 113 joint
ventures or solely-funded ventures in the zone, with capital

already been lost as white-collar crime took its toll on the
government and banking sectors.
</P>
<P>
National crime statistics show that 856 cases of fraud were
dealt with by the fraud squad in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two and half years, the government has lost over
330 million Zimbabwean dollars (8.6 million U.S.dollars) to
fraudulent activities and corruption.
</P>
<P>
In an interview in Harare Thursday, head of interpol
sub-regional bureau for southern Africa Senior Assistant
Commissioner Frank Mautu said economic inequality, poor
management, poor working conditions, lack of supervision, poor
remuneration and opportunity were factors making the environment
fertile for corruption and fraud to grow.

<HEADLINE> Access from Foreign Domains Nearly Half Internet Traffic in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Internet access via foreign
domains has reached nearly half of all Web traffic in the United
States, according to a report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On June 6, for instance, about 44 percent of U.S. Web traffic
was from foreign domains, nearly matching the traffic from
commercial (.com network organizations (.net), educational (.edu),
organization (.org military organizations (.mil) and government (.
gov) domains combined.
</P>
<P>
The information published on StatMark, a provider of global
data on domain usage, reflected real-time data gathered from some
28 million U.S. daily visitors to more than 86,000 Web sites.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to note that America Online and other non-
country-code-specific Internet service providers moving into
global markets affect the representation of foreign domains,"
StatMark said.
</P>
<P>
The countries whose domains most frequently serfed by Americans
include Japan, Canada, Australia and some European countries.
</P>
<P>
As far as U.S. domains are concerned, commercial and network
organizations Web sites attracted most visitors, while military
organizations and government domains were the least visited.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Raps Donors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Finance Minister Edith
Nawakwi has criticized donors for their continued attacks on the
Zambian government and for their continued policies unhelpful to
the country's economic and social status.
</P>
<P>
During the second day of consultative talks held here Thursday
with a Danish delegation, she said that the donors are
responsible for the poor performance of the education and health
sectors in her country, Zambia Daily Mail reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
She said that it is not fair for the donors to criticize the
government on how it utilized aid and at the same time pressing
for debt repayment without looking at the situation on the ground.
</P>
<P>
Nawakwi was reacting to the remarks by Ole Moesby, head of the
delegation, who said that Denmark is concerned with poverty
levels and that the government is not doing enough to coordinate
the economic reforms well.
</P>
<P>
Nawakwi said "government has explained its position to the
donors. You had been calling for the independence of the
Anti-Corruption Commission which we did, and in Pairs, you
admitted that you did not have enough information on these issues
yet you still insist on the same things."
</P>
<P>
"As government, we feel and are aware of the suffering of the
people but then I still have to serve the debts. If only we could
be assisted with this burden, government can make lives of people
much easier in the shortest possible time," she told the
delegation.
</P>
<P>
The minister took the Danish delegation on an unplanned tour of
the University Teaching Hospital and the School of Medicine in
Lusaka which she said are some of the areas the donors should
consider as priority when providing funds.
</P>
<P>
Moesby maintained that the whole program of the health delivery
system is not well designed because it is assumed that all the aid
from the donors is to be directed to primary health care.
</P>
<P>
However, Moesby said the situation is difficult and that there
should be more dialog between the donors and the government.
</P>
<P>
He said there is need for more assistance and pledged Denmark's
 continued assistance to Zambia.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Resuscitate Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government Thursday
introduced tough measures expected to protect local industries
and goods, win investors confidence and subsequently jump-start
its collapsed economy.
</P>
<P>
In his annual budget speech addressed to the National Assembly,
Finance Minister Francis Masakhalia announced the government's
plan to revive the dwindling tourism industry through a reduction
of taxations and the protection of locally manufactured goods
from unfair competition from outside.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the target, the minister announced a five-point
economic reform framework which are crucial in efforts to
resuscitate the economy.
</P>
<P>
They include the sustained macro-economic stability to ensure
that the government expenditure programs match revenue, improve
the economic governance by ensuring the operation of the Kenya
Anti-corruption Authority, accelerate privatization of public
enterprises, downsize the public service to remove duplications
and increase public campaigns to prevent contraction of HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Masakhalia noted the budget aimed to reverse the declining
trend in economic growth, alleviate poverty and create
employment.

<HEADLINE> Qinghai to Upgrade Rural Power Grids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Qinghai Province
is expected to invest 1.3 billion yuan (146.9 million US dollars)
to build and upgrade rural power grids by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Planning Commission has approved the
province's construction project for the building and upgrading of
rural power grids.
</P>
<P>
A provincial official said that the power price in rural areas
in Qinghai is much higher than the urban areas because of
antiquated rural power grids and poor management.
</P>
<P>
"Many farmers and herdsmen in rural areas could not afford the
high price and have to light candles at night," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The project is aimed at cutting down rural power prices so as
to match the urban power levels," the official added.
</P>
<P>
So far, the province has carried out half of the total building
and upgrading construction of the rural power grids and some 116
low pressure electricity nets and 400 km of power circuitry have
been upgraded.

<HEADLINE> Japan Pessimistic on Investment in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kenya does not offer the right mix of investment incentives to
pull Japan to Kenya, Japanese Ambassador to Kenya Morihisa Aoki
told the press Thursday, according to Friday's Kenya Times.
</P>
<P>
"You can't invest in a country where you cannot go out in the
dark, " said Aoki.
</P>
<P>
He said besides being late comers in the country, Japan was
unable to compete with smuggled goods, which are 48 percent
cheaper because of tax evasions.
</P>
<P>
This is why Sanyo, a Japanese company which had invested in
Kenya, had to close and it was definitely due to smuggled
television sets and radios, Aoki said. Japan came to Kenya after
Europe and America had invested heavily.

TIANJIN, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A seven-stringed instrument from
the Song Dynasty (960-1279) will be sold at auction by the Tianjin
International Auction Co. Ltd. in July.
</P>
<P>
Sources say it will be the oldest object of its kind to be sold

<P>
This instrument is 129 cm long. Zheng Minzhong, a stringed

collector of classical stringed musical instruments.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin is second only to Beijing and Shanghai as one of the

<HEADLINE> NATO Destroys Confidence Between Russia, West: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- NATO has destroyed the fragile
confidence between Russia and the West after the end of the Cold
War by its military intervention in Yugoslavia, Russian Ambassador
to Ankara Alexander Lebedev has said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the local Daily News published on Friday,
Lebedev said that the very fragile confidence that was built with
great difficulty between Russia and NATO countries will suffer for
a long time, hopefully not forever.
</P>
<P>
He added that NATO's air campaign against Yugoslavia will also
affect the Turco-Russian relations.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's active participation in the air strikes on Yugoslavia
has poisoned the political climate, said the Russian diplomat.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has sent 11 F-16 warplanes to join in NATO's military
operations in Yugoslavia which started on March 24 and Turkey is
ready to send 987 soldiers to Kosovo to join an international
peacekeeping force to be deployed there under a peace accord
reached between NATO and Yugoslavia Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that it would require "fantastic efforts" to restore
the atmosphere of cooperation between Russia and NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
Despite negative effect of the Kosovo crisis on the political
dialog between Turkey and Russia, the two countries are trying
to save what has already been achieved, said Lebedev.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Sack Village Chief (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WENZHOU, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Pan Hongcong, a village chief in a
coastal Chinese city that came to be known as "the capital of
China's private economy" certainly didn't expect such a
disgraceful end to his three-year term -- Pan is being kicked out
of office by villagers.
</P>
<P>
According to a Civil Affairs Ministry official in Beijing, Pan
may have become the first village chief in China to be ousted by
villagers before completing his time in office.
</P>
<P>
In the past, village officials who caused a lot of complaints
by farmers either were dismissed by superiors or stayed in office
until the next election.
</P>
<P>
But, on May 24, in the village of Liaodong near the city of
Wenzhou in Zhejiang Province, 1,290 of the 1,351 eligible voters
met to decide Pan's fate. He was director of the Liaodong Village
Committee and 1,122 villagers voted against him.
</P>
<P>
Pan had been chosen for the post in May of 1996 by a majority
vote of the same villagers. He had never held a village post
before that.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, China's hundreds of millions of farmers were given the
right to choose their own village leaders, who were formerly
appointed by township-level or higher governments, when the
Organic Village Committee Law went into effect on a trial basis.
Since then, most of the country's nearly one million villages have
held at least three direct elections.
</P>
<P>
In November of 1998, after soliciting opinions from the
countryside, the National People's Congress, China's top
legislature, amended the Organic Law and formally approved it.
</P>
<P>
The trial version only mentioned farmers' rights to recall a
leader with one simple sentence, but the new law made it more
explicit, one Beijing legal scholar explains.
</P>
<P>
The law says that if at least a fifth of a village's eligible
voters have a justifiable reason, they can ask for the recall of
any village officials, and any official who fails to get half the
votes of all eligible voters in the village will be removed
immediately.
</P>
<P>
In Liaodong, 494 people got together to ask for Pan's removal,
accusing him of abusing power and of bad management.

<HEADLINE> County In North Central Home Of Rare Fossils </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Hezheng County in China's Gansu
Province has turned out to be a treasure house of valuable fossils
for Chinese archeologists.
</P>
<P>
The county's museum houses 1,055 ancient animal fossils
collected by various individuals. They come from 53 types of
carnivores like the saber-toothed tiger, three-toed horse, big-
lipped rhinoceros, and a giraffe. Most are from animals believed
to be living about 10 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
Qiu Zhanxiang, a vertebrate paleontologist and
paleoanthropologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, says that
the county's fossils have helped fill in research gaps in the
study of prehistoric mammals. This is because many of the fossils
found in nearby Shanxi Province and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region during the 1920s were taken abroad, causing a great deal of
difficulty in research here.
</P>
<P>
The Hezheng County fossils offer new information for the study
of the geographical and climatic evolution of the late tertiary
period, Qiu says.

<P>
NICOSIA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus stock market exhibited
a similar picture to that of the previous week, a weekly market
review said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The review, issued by the Cyprus Investment and Securities
Corporation Limited (CISCO), said that the market Tuesday took a
dive of 25.8 points or 3.5 percent amidst high volumes - 11.2
million Cyprus pounds (22.4 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, the market quickly resumed its energy and bounced
back on the following day.
</P>
<P>
The CISCO All-Share Index closed on Thursday at 749
points.
</P>
<P>
Volume of transactions was also at very similar level to that
of last week, with the daily average of this week standing at
10.36 million pounds (20.72 million dollars), slightly down from
10.38 million pounds (20.76 million dollars) the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The total volume of transactions this week (5 trading
sessions) reached 51.8 million pounds (103.6 million dollars), as
compared to 41.5 million pounds (83 million dollars) the week
before (4 trading sessions).

Department reports showed that for 3 years the 48-year-old Pan
and other members of the Liaodong Villagers Committee had spent
some 660,000 yuan (about 80,000 U.S. dollars) of the village's
funds, nearly a quarter of its total, on themselves.
</P>
<P>
Pan was given a chance to defend himself and he listed the
achievements of his time in office, which included building a
primary school and a road and buying insurance for people above
the age of 50. But the villagers didn't buy it.
</P>
<P>
As soon as the ballot counting was done, the Villagers
Committee, which presided over the meeting, announced that Pan was
out.
</P>
<P>
"What could I say when so many people went against me? I
understand it is their right to dismiss me," said a frustrated Pan,
adding that he had learned a "profound lesson" from this failure
and would try to do something good for the village in the future.
</P>
<P>
One villager who gave his name as Wang said that it was because
they had the backing of the law that ordinary farmers could be so
powerful. Chinese farmers have long been regarded as the country's
most obedient people and they seldom dared directly challenge
authority.
</P>
<P>
A group of provincial and Wenzhou People's Congress officials
and civil affairs officials attended the Liaodong meeting, but
only as observers. One of them, Chen Zhanke, the deputy director
of the Wenzhou Ouhai District People's Congress, said that he was
deeply impressed by the fact that the farmers could remove a
leader in strict accordance with the law in a smooth and orderly
manner.
</P>
<P>
Li Xiaojin, the head of Zhejiang's Civil Affairs Department,
said that Liaodong gave him a sense of urgency in training more
village officials to be competent.
</P>
<P>
The right is a supreme form of villagers' democratic power and
Liaodong represents another major step forward in Chinese farmers'
understanding of democracy, said Zhan Chengfu, a Civil Affairs
Ministry Grass-roots Political Power Department official. He added
that the ministry expects an increase in the number of these
meetings in China's vast countryside because the past decade of
village elections has left farmers with a deep impression of
democracy.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Zambian government is to enact
legislation which will introduce comprehensive food labelling
requirements based on international standards, local media
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Post newspaper quoted Commerce, Trade and Industry Deputy
Minister Jazzman Chikwakwa as saying that the standards have been
established by the joint committee of the World Health
Organization and the Food and Agricultural Organization.
</P>
<P>
Chikwakwa warned that under the new legislation, no
pre-packaged foods will be allowed on the Zambian market unless
they comply fully with the requirements.
</P>
<P>
Chikwakwa said the government had been concerned about the
actions of some importers who have been bringing in food whose
quality was doubtful.
</P>
<P>
He warned that once the instrument was in force, food importers
found breaking the regulations will face stiff penalties including
prison terms and heavy fines as well as compensation for consumers
after the food has been recalled.
</P>
<P>
"Government will prosecute all those selling expired goods
under various legislation of different ministries and so all those
in the food industry should take the issue of food safety
seriously," he said.
</P>
<P>
Food processing industries should in turn take the issue of
food safety seriously and institute measures which would guarantee
safe food for consumers, he added.

<HEADLINE> Cholera Claims 13 in Western Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- At least 13 people have died
following a fresh outbreak of cholera in the displaced people's
camps in the district of Bundibugyo in western Uganda.
</P>
<P>
This brings the toll due to the cholera to well over 50 since
the disease was first reported in the district more than one year
ago.
</P>
<P>
About 26 others suffering from the deadly disease are still in
hospital, the New Vision newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Health workers, however, were quoted as putting the figure of
the cholera patients admitted at 60.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the district was also running out of
cholera drugs. But the district authorities are doing all they can
to contain the situation.
</P>
<P>
Resident District Commissioner Edward Masiga dismissed reports
that the death toll was much above the mentioned figure.
</P>
<P>
He said that the district had set up a task force to deal with

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Shenyang, an old industrial base
and capital city of the northeastern province of Liaoning, has
been selected by the State Economic and Trade Commission as one of
the four cities for trial development of an environmental
protection sector in the next century.
</P>
<P>
The four cities are expected to receive policy incentives and
state funds to develop the emerging sector, which is to become a
new pillar of the national economy during the next century.
</P>
<P>
Although this old industrial base has become mired in
difficulties during the transition to a market economy, its sound
foundation in heavy industry is enabling it to take an advantage
in machinery building and tap the environmental sector.
</P>
<P>
In 1998 alone, the sector created for the city 1.48 billion
yuan in output value and turned in profits tax worth 263 million
yuan. The nation's only listed company in the environmental
industry is also based in Shenyang.
</P>
<P>
The output value of the city's environment sector is expected
to hit 10 billion yuan by the end of this century, predicted an
official in charge of the city's environmental sector.

<HEADLINE> Barak to Start Portfolio Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister-elect
Ehud Barak will start early next week the arduous task of
distributing portfolios to One Israel's likely coalition
partners, senior One Israel sources said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Barak is going to run the portfolio talks at the same time as
the ones on the coalition policy guidelines, because ongoing
difficulties with likely partners such as Meretz, the National
Religious Party (NRP) and United Torah Judaism (UTJ) prevented
the completion of the guideline negotiations, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Meretz, One Israel's sister party, still refused to let the
Shas party to join the coalition, saying it will never sit in a
government with Shas, because its leader Aryeh Deri was sentenced
to a four-year prison term for fraud and bribe-taking.
</P>
<P>
Meretz's leader Yossi Sarid raised a compromise proposal
Thursday that Meretz stay out of the coalition for some six to 18
months to give Shas time to distance itself fully from its
convicted leader Deri. But the party executive committee still
voted 34-8 Thursday night against joining a coalition in which
Shas is a partner.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Barak's policy of drafting religious students into
the army was still rejected by religious parties, despite One
Israel's proposal for forming a committee later to discuss the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Barak will handle all those issues, including the portfolio
distributions next week when he meets face to face with all
parties leaders, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Barak met Thursday night with Avi Ravitzky, whose Meimad
formed the alliance with One Israel before the May 17
elections. And Meimad faction has been promised a ministry
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
David Levy, whose Gesher party also joined the One Israel in
the elections, is also guaranteed a top job in the new
government. He is widely tipped as the favorite for the Foreign
Ministry portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Barak still has three weeks to form his government under the
election law, but progress made so far in the coalition talks
showed that it will not be easy for him to distribute the cabinet
portfolios as each partner wants to get an important cabinet
post.

<HEADLINE> South Central China Intensifying Fight Against Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Marine police in China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region have been waging an intensified fight
against smugglers since the start of the year and have foiled 18
smuggling attempts at sea, arrested 105 suspects, and confiscated
six million yuan worth of contraband goods.
</P>
<P>
Smugglers have been developing more sophisticated ways by
dividing up cargo like diesel oil, rubber, and cars into separate
shipments and using small boats to transport them, according to
police officers, and they can escape police because only a small
part of them are intercepted.
</P>
<P>
At Beibu Bay, police caught three smugglers earlier this month
who attempted to bring in 155 cartons of "555" cigarettes but many
more smugglers are just waiting for the chance to slip across the
border and police need to stay on full alert and deal harsher with
smuggling, says one smuggling office official.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes NATO-Yugoslav Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus welcomed the end of the
Kosovo conflict and the signing of a peace accord between NATO and
Yugoslavia, local media reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking from Shanghai, China, Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides said the signing of the agreement should be hailed as a
step in the right direction and a step towards peace.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides is accompanying Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides on
a state visit to China.
</P>
<P>
He said Cyprus welcomed the dispatch of a peace-keeping force
under U.N. aegis and the involvement of the G-8 group (seven most
industrialized countries plus Russia).
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides also welcomed the fact that the U.N. Security
Council will issue a resolution on the end of the conflict, a move
which would place the entire process under the aegis of the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
He said that this may signal "some positive developments for
Cyprus" as well.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO, without the authorization of the Security
Council, unilaterally launched air strikes against Yugoslav Serb
targets on March 24 after the Serb-led government refused to
accept a peace agreement to grant greater autonomy to the
independence-seeking ethnic Albanians in the Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Yugoslav and NATO commanders signed an
agreement in Macedonia on a Serb troop withdrawal from Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> More Handheld Device Users Expected in Asia-Pacific </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, June 10 (Xinhua) -- By 2003, the market for smart
handheld devices (SHD) in the Asia-Pacific region excluding Japan
is expected to exceed 3 million units, according to a forecast
report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The regional SHD market generated 37.5 percent annual growth to
reach almost 158,000 unit shipments in 1998, despite the economic
crisis that shackled other information technology industry
segments, said U.S. market research firm International Data
Corporation (IDC).
</P>
<P>
As far as 1998 is concerned, IDC said, the primary market
driver was the emergence of the personal companion market
throughout Asia. Personal companions are small shirt pocket-sized
devices, such as the 3Com Palm Pilot, that use a plastic pen as
the input method and synchronizer to a desktop or notebook PC.
</P>
<P>
The regional personal companion market surged 18-percent in
1998 to claim 56 percent of the overall SHD market. Growth for
this segment was bolstered by the release of Windows CE, a version
of Windows from Microsoft for handheld PCs and consumer electronic
devices. "Windows CE has enabled a variety of vendors to offer
products for the Asian marketplace," IDC said. "The result has
been greater product awareness, more product availability, and
extended channels of distribution throughout the region."
</P>
<P>
According to IDC's research, Australia represented the largest
SHD market in the region in 1998, followed by Singapore and Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
China, the largest PC market in Asia-Pacific excluding Japan,
accounted for a small portion of the market. But volumes in the
Chinese market started to step up at the end of 1998 and into the
beginning of 1999. IDC said that the principal market accelerator
in China was Microsoft's release of a Chinese version of Windows
CE in December 1998. As a result of recent vendor investment in
China and the availability of a localized operating system, the
Chinese SHD market is expected to surge over the next five years,
IDC said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to operating systems, Palm OS and Windows CE
represented the largest regional SHD platforms in 1998. Each
operating system accounted for roughly one-third of total 1998 SHD
shipments in Asia-Pacific excluding Japan.

ISLAMABAD, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government Friday

</P>
<P>
The shipment of medicines, blankets, sweaters, shoes and black

UNHCR Deputy Chief of Mission for Afghanistan Yusaka Hanyu.

From 1997, the Chinese government has been contributing the
same type of donation to Afghanistan through the UNHCR. "This

NANJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Sales of world maps have grown by
a big margin in Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province,

"I want to know where the NATO bombers take off from and about

Maps are also a good choice for decoration in living rooms,
according to a young couple who have decided to hang a world map
and a map of China in their new apartment.
</P>

Peddlers selling maps on streets and in alleys have also seen a
surge in business these days. "We can now sell twenty maps a day
without difficulty while in the past we could only manage two or
three at best," said a hawker peddling world maps downtown.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Fueled by surging demand for
wooden interior decorations material, China's imports of U.S.
hardwood are booming.
</P>
<P>
Hardwood imports from the U.S. increased to 34 million U.S.
dollars in the first quarter of this year, 20 percent up on the
same period last year, the American Hardwood Export Council (AHEC),
a leading trade association for the U.S. hardwood industry, was
quoted as saying by today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The elimination of import duties on logs and lumber at the
beginning of this year has offered enormous business opportunities
and growth potential to AHEC member companies.

"We stand firmly behind China's bid to join the World Trade
Organization (WTO) and its plan to make affordable, privately
owned housing available to its citizens," said Richard Conti,
chairman of AHEC at the council's fourth Southeast Asia convention
that opened in Beijing Thursday.

<P>
JAKARTA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian second stringer
shuttlers, who are being groomed for the 20th Southeast Asian (SEA)
Games in Brunei Darussalam in August, will warm up at the Malaysia
and Thailand Open tournaments.
</P>
<P>
The Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI) has submitted 14
names to the National Sports Council (KONI).
</P>
<P>
"But the names still can be changed, depending on the results
of the selection. If our nominee fails, we must replace him or her
with another player," said the national training director
Christian Hadinata on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The PBSI has from Wednesday to Friday been staging a three-day
selection round to select the competitors in both Grand Prix
series events.
</P>
<P>
The 14 shuttlers are men's singles Jeffer Rosobin, Ronny
Agustinus, Johan Hadikusuma, men's doubles specialists Flandy
Limpele, Eng Hian, Agung Wahyu and Halim Heryanto, women's singles
Ellen Angelina, Meiluawati and Yuli Marfuah and women's doubles
specialists Etty Tantri, Cynthia Tuwankotta, Vita Marissa and Emma
Ermawati.
</P>
<P>
Christian said the women's and men's doubles players must also
play in the mixed doubles event.
</P>
<P>
"There's no other way because we have a quota on each
participating country," he said.
</P>
<P>
The five-star Malaysia Open will take place from June 30 to
July 4, while the four-star Thailand Open starts on July 7 and
ends on July 11.
</P>
<P>
Christian said some key players would also go to Malaysia, and
that PBSI told them to aim to win the event.
</P>
<P>
"We just lost in two major tournaments. It's really important
for us to win a title in a Grand Prix series. If we continue to
fail, it's really hard for us to get back on our feet again," he
was quoted by The Jakarta Post Friday as saying.

BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Nine "gold dragons" were placed on
exhibition in the Museum of Chinese History on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The miniature dragons, "riding" a piece of ornate red
sandalwood, owed their places in the museum to Beijing Huajiang
Artwork Co., according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
To herald the China '99 World Philatelic Exhibition, scheduled
for August 21 to 30 in Beijing, the company has designed a special
memento - a "Nine-Dragon Screen" carved in a one-ounce gold plate.
</P>
<P>
The gold plate, with a relief of nine exquisite dragons, is
mounted on a piece of red sandalwood.
</P>
<P>
Experts at China Mint. Co, the plate's manufacturer, said that
the artwork represented the highest standard of gold coining and
pressing in the country, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Dragons and sandalwood both symbolize prosperity and
auspiciousness in Chinese traditional culture.
</P>
<P>
Some 9,000 "nine-dragon screens" will be available as souvenirs
during the last world philatelic show this century, according to
Chen Shaoshu, director of Huajiang.
</P>
<P>
Experts forcast a lively market for the gold gifts as a result
of their high value and artistry.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Seven of the 24 Indonesian soccer
players in training for the 20th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games are
in below-standard physical condition, the officials said here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The physical condition of 30 percent of the 24 players is
below our minimum standard," said the national training director
Imron Z.S.
</P>
<P>
He said the National Sports Council (KONI) would discuss the
matter with German coach Bernhard Schumm.
</P>
<P>
The soccer team underwent a one-day physical test on Tuesday,
conducted by KONI's sports science commission.
</P>
<P>
Schumm also was invited to discuss the athletes' physical
fitness with the council's consultants on physical training Paulus
Pasurney and M. Moeslim.
</P>
<P>
Schumm said he was not surprised by the poor results because
his players trained hard before their physicals.
</P>
<P>
However, he was irritated by Imron's disclosure and said he
should not have discussed the results with the media before
talking to him.
</P>
<P>
Imron said overseas training in Europe was delayed from June 15
to June 25. The SEA Games will be held in Brunei in August.
</P>
<P>
"I have to make sure if they are going to Europe as preparation
for the SEA Games or for something else," he was quoted by The
Jakarta Post Friday as saying.

<P>
On Thursday, KONI received 4.5 billion rupiah, as promised by

The training program started in early May and KONI has spent
nearly 500 million rupiah from its budget to cover expenses during
the training period.

<P>
Wismoyo also said KONI would receive 5.5 billion rupiah
allocated from the state budget from the National Development
Planning Board on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Asks Foreign Banks to Cut Lending Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand (BOT), the
country's central bank, is expected to ask foreign banks here to
cut their lending rates to help narrow the wide spreads between
their lending and deposit rates, The Nation said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted BOT Deputy Governor Kitti Patpong-pibul as
saying that interest rates spreads of foreign banks are twice as
high in cases over the local banks level.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the spread between an average lending rate and the
three-month fixed deposit rate of 21 foreign banks is as high as
8.21 percent, a level well above the average of 5.17 percent found
in Thai banks.
</P>
<P>
The deputy governor expected to get good cooperation from the
foreign banks. However, if foreign banks refuse to bring down
their lending rates, the BOT might come out with some tough
warning measures.
</P>
<P>
Kitti said that foreign banks should also play a role in
helping support Thai economy and that is why they should narrow
the spread.
</P>
<P>
However, some foreign bankers argued that with high operating
costs of running foreign branches, the retail-oriented banks need
to maintain a wide spread.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign bank branches here experienced losses in the last
year since they have high costs of operation and are coping with
bad debts from the retail lending sector, they said.

</P>
<P>
The News:
</P>

<HEADLINE> Harvesting of Wheat Half Done </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- China has harvested more than half
of its wheat-growing area, the Ministry of Agriculture was quoted
as saying by today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The country has reaped more than 15.26 million hectares, or 52.
6 percent of its total wheat-growing acreage, the ministry's
latest statistics indicated.
</P>
<P>
Ministry officials said that they expected the country's summer
grain output to exceed last year's mark of 113.1 million tons
although the country's grain crops' growing area will shrink
marginally from last year's level to stand at 112 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
This is because the land planted with high quality early rice
strains has expanded this year, and the increase in the yield per-
unit area will be well able to offset the reduction in acreage,
they said.
</P>
<P>
Wheat and early rice are the major summer grain crops in China.
</P>
<P>
About 80,000 combine harvesters, or 44 percent of the country's
total, are expected to harvest wheat on an area of 10 million
hectares from June till August, Niu Dun, director of the ministry
Agricultural Mechanization Management Department, said earlier.
</P>
<P>
Agronomists said that China should also increase the acreage
for higher grade wheat varieties.

<HEADLINE> Dollarization Not Viable in Nicaragua: IDB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Dollarization is not viable in
Nicaragua, as this works only in countries with a high level of
economic development, head of the Interamerican Development Bank (
IDB) Martin Stabile said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Dollarization only works in economies like Argentina or Brazil,
Stabile said.
</P>
<P>
To begin a dollarization process, macroeconomic policies and
tax measures must be taken along with the countries in the Central
American region, he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
"If you talk of dollarization, you must first speak about a
regional integration of the Central American economies," said
Stabile.
</P>
<P>
The idea of dollarizing Latin America's economies was put
forward by Argentine President Carlos Menem.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Crack Down on Smuggled Vehicles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar authorities will crack
down on un-licensed motor vehicles smuggled from the country's
border regions to inland areas, the state-run Myanma News Agency
(MNA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We will expose them by all means and take action against them
according to the existing law," the MNA quoted the Directorate of
Road Transport (DRT) as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the MNA, there are un-licensed motor vehicles
being illegally imported through Myanmar's border areas and some
of these have even reached Yangon, the capital of the country.
</P>
<P>
The authorities are urging motor vehicle owners to identify
their vehicles at hands if they are officially registered at the
DRT.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Myanmar authorities have banned use of cars
imported under the transit trade system since September 1997,
saying that cars imported under the system could only be
transported across Myanmar to a third country.
</P>
<P>
The authorities have also prohibited enterprises doing business
in the country from re-selling their motor vehicles imported with
tax relief and tax exemption beginning November 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the number of motor vehicles
operating in Myanmar totaled 403,677 at the end of February this
year, an increase of 25,889 as compared with a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> High Returns, Stability, Good Environment Lure Investors Into China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Both Chinese and foreign
economists agree that nothing but high financial returns, stable
markets and a consistently improving investment environment are
the main factors that have led more and more overseas investors to
China.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that more than two thirds of the 30 top
companies in the United States such as GM, GE, Motorola, IBM,
Lucent, Hewllet Packard, Du Pont and Prector &AMP; Gamble have
invested in 180 projects in China.
</P>
<P>
"Investment returns stand at about 10-20 percent in the Chinese
market," according to a researcher from the Foreign Economy
Institute under the State Development Planning Commission, "There
is no other country like China with such high returns," he added.
</P>
<P>
The average yields in sales and assets for the top 500 overseas-
funded enterprises in China have reached seven percent,
respectively, while the average yields in sales and assets for the
50 largest U.S.-funded in the country have both reached two digit
figures.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that overseas investors are regarding China,
on its way from a developing country to a medium-level developed
one, as a nation with the largest market potential in the world.
</P>
<P>
Although the current financial crisis is lingering in parts of
Asia and the world, many international giants including Motorola
and Mitsubishi are likely to expand their business presence in
China.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's 1999 Poll Violations Down From 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Police chief

than the 1997 elections under former president Soeharto's New
Order regime.
</P>
<P>
Roesmanhadi said here Thursday that there were 5,618 cases of
violations of election rules during Monday's polls, contested by
48 parties, while there were 9,087 violations when only three
parties took part in 1997, Antara News Agency reported Friday.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Account Surplus Soars to All-time High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippines' current account soared
to an all-time high of 1.324 billion U.S. dollars in the first
quarter, completing obliterating an 85-million U.S. dollar deficit
a year ago, Business World said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The paper attributed the increase mainly to the solid
performance in the exports of the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Exports of the country registered 7.853 billion U.S. dollar for
the first quarter, much higher than the 6.816 billion U.S. dollar
reported in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
From January to March, imports remained in the 7.3 billion U.S.
dollar level compared with the 8 billion U.S dollar in the
corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a report of the Philippine Central Bank as
saying that the account surplus was equivalent to 7.1 percent of
the country's gross national product.
</P>
<P>
The current account represents the inflow and outflow of
dollars--exporting and importing, income earned from investments
abroad, money paid to foreign investors, and transactions on which
the government expects no return.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, analysts refused to jump up and down in
jubilation on the surplus, saying they are waiting for the
recovery in imports, which would tend to indicate that the
Philippine business cycle is finally on the mend.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Opening up to Rest of World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region in
southwest China, with its abundant resources in tourism, mineral,
energy and biology, has pushed for an all round opening up to the
rest of the world over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
South Asian nations have been put on top of the agenda as Tibet
's partners in foreign trade and economic cooperation, while
investors and tourists from other parts of the world have also
been attracted to the "Roof of the World".
</P>
<P>
Local observers have attributed the rapid gains in these fields
to the preferential state policies and broad range opening up in
Tibet as well as the government's efforts in developing
communications and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Road networks have covered most parts of Tibet, while airports
are linking up major cities like Lhasa, the regional capital, and
Shigaze, the second largest town in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Fiber optic cables and programmable telephone services and
satellite ground stations have been widely-used in this remote
autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
Border trade has been a main form of foreign trade in Tibet,
which has traditional trade points along its borders with South
Asian countries. In 1999, the border trade is expected to top 35
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the period 1995-98, its total foreign trade stood at 400
million U.S. dollars, with imports and exports ranging from raw
materials to finished products from machinery, electronics,
chemicals and petrochemical goods. Tibet is now doing business
with 26 foreign countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The number one beneficiary in Tibet is its fledgling tourism
industry. Last year, some 96,400 overseas travelers visited Tibet
and brought in 33 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Domestic and overseas investors are granted favorable policies
and are free to make their own decisions regarding their
investment and ventures. Overseas investors have been involved in
all sectors including agriculture, livestock, textiles, mining,
machinery, light industry, health, food and tourism.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, foreign investors have begun to participate in
infrastructure projects in Tibet, such as power, culture and
education, medical services, telecommunications, energy, water
conservation, and integrated agricultural, animal-husbandry and
forestry projects.
</P>
<P>
So far, Tibet has welcomed 94 overseas-funded companies with a
contractual overseas capital of 85.48 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin: End to Bombing Welcomed, But Not Enough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
regards the NATO decision to halt its air campaign against
Yugoslavia as "a first step in the right direction."
</P>
<P>
"On the very first day of the aggression against Yugoslavia,
March 24, I denounced it and demanded its immediate cessation,"
Yeltsin said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"As before, we regard a complete end to the missile and
airstrikes against Yugoslavia as the chief priority. A pause is
good but not good enough now. The process of political settlement
must be urgently revitalized with full respect for Yugoslavia's
sovereignty and territorial integrity, while efforts should be
concentrated on the economic rebuilding of the region, and above
all, Yugoslavia itself," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
The president said he has "instructed the Russian diplomatic
service to continue making vigorous efforts towards the
implementation of the U.N. Security Council's resolution aimed at
resolving the Kosovo problem and establishing solid peace and
stability in the Balkans," the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The end of the NATO missile and airstrikes is an important
step in the right direction. Now the world community's top
priority is to coordinate its efforts in keeping the peace in
Kosovo and in post-crisis settlement," Yeltsin's statement said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, U.S. President Bill Clinton
telephoned Yeltsin Thursday to thank Russia for its efforts
towards a peaceful resolution of the Kosovo problem.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin told Clinton that the Kosovo crisis had put a very
heavy strain on Russia-U.S. ties, but said that the potential
accumulated in the relations must be preserved, the Kremlin's
Deputy Chief of Staff Sergei Prikhodko said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian and U.S. military delegations discussed the
role and positioning of a Russian contingent in the future Kosovo
peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
The talks will continue Friday with Finnish officials joining
in, a Russian official said.
</P>
<P>
While Russia insists its troops not be operating under NATO,
the transatlantic military alliance calls for the peacekeeping
mission under its command and control.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will have to discuss a joint command for the
military presence in Kosovo, meaning a single military chain of
command for all forces present in the region, U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott said in an interview with the
local Ekho Moskvy.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. and its allies also have certain requirements (for
countries planning to participate), the most important of which is

<HEADLINE> Brazil Expresses Concerns Over EU Trade Barriers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Brazil warned Thursday that the
European Union's maintaining of tariff and non-tariff trade
barriers may obstruct the establishment of a free trade area
between the EU and the South American Common Market (Mercosur) by
the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Development, Industry and Trade Celso Lafer made
the warning at the "Dialogue for the Millennium" in Sao Paulo, a
preparatory seminar for the summit between Latin America, the
Caribbean and the EU scheduled for June 28-29 in Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
Celso recalled that in the 10 years to 1997, Brazil's imports
from Europe shot by more than 300 percent while its exports to the
region grew by a minimal 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Europe's exports to Mercosur
countries expanded by 340 percent between 1990 and 1997 while its
imports from the South American trade block increased by only 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
Celso also said that free trade negotiations between Mercosur
and the EU should not affect the process to create the Free Trade
Area of the Americas (FTAA).
</P>
<P>
Calling them "two parallel movements," he said that "as for us,
we are interested in both tables of negotiation."
</P>
<P>
In addition to its interests in the FTAA, Brazil is competitive
in the agriculture business, the minister said, noting that "we
want to play with all these cards through this diplomatic and
trade challenge we have before us."

<HEADLINE> China Discovers Oil in Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, June 11 (Xinhua) -- China has discovered an oil field
with an estimated reserve of 20 million tons in the Hulun Buir
grassland of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Bo Wenzhong, head of the Geology and Mineral Resources Bureau
of the Hulun Buir League, said the oil here is of very high
quality with low sulphur and asphalt content.
</P>
<P>
He said the Daqing Petroleum Administration has started
installing equipment for the drilling of test wells, while an
expanded survey is going on.
</P>
<P>
According to regional petroleum officials, Inner Mongolia's 13
basins may boast two to three billions tons of oil reserve and 270
billion to 1,000 billion cubic meters of natural gas reserve.
</P>
<P>
The region now has three oil fields in operation. They produced
1.2 million tons of crude oil in 1998.

PARIS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Frenchman Laurent Desbiens won the
fourth stage of the Dauphine Libere cycling race by more than a

<HEADLINE> Queen's Birthday Called to be scraped as Public Holiday in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Australian Republicans Friday
called on Australians to decide whether to scrap the Queen's
birthday public holiday.
</P>
<P>
All Australian states except Western Australia will celebrate
the Queen's Birthday with a public holiday next Monday. In Western
Australia, the holiday is on September 27.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Republican Movement (ARM), a powerful
non-governmental organization behind the cause for a republican
Australia, said this year's holiday should be the last long
weekend to celebrate the Queen's birthday.
</P>
<P>
ARM Deputy Chairwoman Wendy Machin said if Australians voted
for a republic in a national referendum on November 6 this year,
it would be time to consider how to celebrate the establishment of
an Australian republic.
</P>
<P>
The Australian government under Prime Minister John Howard, who
is a monarchist, delivered its election promise by agreeing to
hold the referendum later this year.
</P>
<P>
"If this is indeed the last Queen's birthday weekend in
Australia, then we should be thinking about how we can celebrate
the establishment of an Australian republic," Machin said.
</P>
<P>
But Australians for Constitutional Monarchy Director Kerry
Jones accused republicans of trying to abandon Australia's
heritage.
</P>
<P>
"The Queen's birthday holiday is a 200-year-old tradition and
an appropriate time for all Australians to take stock of our past
while focusing on our future," she said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Uruguay's Manufacture Industry Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, June 10 (Xinhua)-- Uruguay's manufacture industry
fell an average of 6.1 percent in the first quarter from the same
period of 1998, according to figures released Thursday by the
National Institute of Statistics (INE).
</P>
<P>
With a cutback of 28.7 percent, the textile and clothing sector
was hardest hit, followed by non-metallic minerals, machinery and
equipment, with 11.8 percent and 7.9 percent down, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The sectors of food procession, drinks and tobacco were also
affected.
</P>
<P>
The processing of gold, copper and aluminum is the only
exceptional sector that saw a strong rise of 10.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The decrease in manufacture industry in the first quarter was
caused by a slowdown in export. Compared to the first quarter in
1998, Uruguay's export volume fell 25 percent to 501.7 million
dollars, explained the INE.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Uruguay's exports to the Southern Common
Market (Mercosur), its main trading partner, fell 35.6 percent
after Brazil devaluated its currency.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Banks Well on Way to Y2K Compliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's banks are well on the
way toward becoming Y2K compliant despite their efforts to survive
the country's economic meltdown, The Indonesian Observer reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
MasterCard International Vice President for Operation and
System Richard Hartung said that banks and other financial
institutions seem to be at the forefront of Y2K readiness.
</P>
<P>
"Banks and financial institutions are much more aware of the
issue than other sectors and there is a lot of pressure on banks
to become Y2K compliant," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sources said earlier in Jakarta that the country's banks have
paid scant heed to the Y2K issue because the debt-laden banks
might not be able to afford to prepare computers against the
millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
Of the 28 listed banks, only 13 have taken steps to deal with
the Y2K concern, a source said.
</P>
<P>
Hartung cited time and funds as constraints in Y2K projects but
"banks recognize the importance of this and they have allocated
their budget in the Y2K project".
</P>
<P>
MasterCard members in Indonesia include ANZ Panin Bank, Bank
Bali, Bank Central Asia, Lippo Bank, Bank International Indonesia,
Bank Niaga, Citibank, Bank Tamara and Bank Universal.
</P>
<P>
All banks, directly connected to the MasterCard network, have
to conduct online testing as part of the association's efforts to
tackle the Y2K issue.
</P>
<P>
"This year we are doing a lot of online testing for members to
make sure that transaction go well. Banks in Indonesia are on
track with this testing. At this point they are progressing well
for that deadline," he said.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for being Y2K compliant is a long way away but
"everything has to be completed by December 31, 1999," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K problem stems from the common practice of using only
two digits to show the year in dates -- 99 for 1999. With 2000,
some computers and microchips used in machines may read 00 as
1900, causing them to produce flawed data or even crash.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Expects Record Litchi Harvest This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 11 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong Province
will harvest some 600,000 tons of litchi this year, 200,000 tons
more than the record year of 1997, according to the provincial
agricultural department.
</P>
<P>
Maoming City, the largest litchi production base in Guangdong,
has now 63,000 ha of litchi. Its litchi output is expected to
reach 240,000 tons this year, almost equaling that of the entire
province last year.
</P>
<P>
Despite the harvest, farmers are worried about the marketing of
litchis. The neighboring province of Fujian and Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region also report high litchi harvests, but little
efforts have been made to expand the market, local officials said,
adding that the technology to process litchi and keep them fresh
lags behind.
</P>
<P>
The price of litchis have already gone down so far this year, a
local source said.

GUANGZHOU, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Guangzhou Municipal
Government, capital of south China's Guangdong Province, has
signed a deal with China Telecom Guangdong Branch to open an
Internet website for its daily operations.
</P>
<P>
After linking to the net, its daily work will be open to public
scrutiny. All Internet users will be able to refer to the website
for details of how things are going on inside government offices.
</P>
<P>
People from business circles, especially those from overseas-
funded businesses often complain about low working efficiency and
some underhand operations inside local government departments that
hinder the smooth running of some economic projects.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to insert more operating transparency and
efficiency, the central government has urged government
departments to open websites by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
So far, 57 government websites can be found on the net, where
Internet users can easily get access to such information as
project approvals and taxation indices, something that they must
get from civil servants otherwise.
</P>
<P>
The country has witnessed a vigorous growth in Internet use
over the past few years with the number of subscribers reaching 1.
5 million. However, people are complaining about the lack of
updated domestic news on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The government websites are expected to expand the sources of
official information released on the Internet and accelerate the
network information growth in the country, according to Chinese
government officials.
</P>
<P>
Some local governments have learned to use their websites as an
electronic bulletin to publish their local strategy and economic
advantages.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Five security guards working for a
prominent political clan in Philippines' central Occidental
Mindoro province were killed Thursday in an ambush staged Thursday
by suspected New People's Army (NPA), Malaya reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted local police as saying that all of the
five security guards are belonged to Pilipinas Security Agency
detailed at the Golden Country Farms Inc, owned by the family of
Ricardo Quintos, a delegate to the 1971 Constitutional Convention.
</P>
<P>
Police said the ambush site is a known NPA lair and a bystander
was wounded during the crossfire.
</P>
<P>
The victims were on a routine patrol on a pickup truck when
they were waylaid be at least 15 rebels around 8 a.m., the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the rebels earlier warned residents to
stay away from the farm for they might be caught in the crossfire.
</P>
<P>
Manila police have also been alerted to brace for
"destabilization" efforts from left-leaning groups sympathetic to
the NPA's armed struggle.
</P>
<P>
The NPA strengthened its activities after the Philippine Senate
ratified the controversial Visiting Forces Agreement on May 27
which will allow the U.S. and the Philippines to resume
large-scale military exercises in the country.

<HEADLINE> Industry Production Level Down in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's metal, machinery,
electronics and multifarious companies operated at only 58 percent
of their total production capacity in the first four months this
year, an official source said.
</P>
<P>
A report issued Thursday by the Ministry of Industry and trade
said, the figure was far below the pre-crisis level of 76 percent,
although it was better than the average production level of 48
percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The country's prolonged economic crisis has hit most of the
companies involved in the metal, machinery and electronics-related
industries. This has forced them to use only half of their
production capacity," the Jakarta Post daily Friday quoted the
report as saying.
</P>
<P>
The highest utilized production level from January to April was
recorded by the textile industry (70 percent), followed by
electronics (61 percent), machinery (51 percent), metal (49
percent) and transportation equipment (44 percent).
</P>
<P>
Before the crisis hit the country in July 1997, the utilized
production level of the local textile industry was 82 percent,
machinery 75 percent, metal and electronics 70 percent and
transportation 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Despite the poor performance, exports of goods produced by
metal, machinery, electronics and multifarious industries recorded
an increase of 4.7 percent to 13.67 billion U.S. dollars in 1998,
compared to 13 billion U.S. dollars in 1997, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Lawyers Protest against Indictment against Milosevic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnam Lawyers' Association
(VLA) issues a statement on Thursday, strongly protesting against
the International Criminal Tribunal's May 27 indictment against
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and four other Yugoslav
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese lawyers said in the statement that the tribunal's
indictment and its recent warning to arrest S. Milosevic if he
flies to South Africa for president-elect Thabo Mbeki's
inauguration have grossly violated international law's basic
principles on the respect of national sovereignty, and
non-interference into other nations' internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The acts will also further complicate and worsen the Kosovo
tension, thus spoiling international efforts for a peaceful
solution to the Kosovo crisis, stressed the association.
</P>
<P>
The VLA once more demands an immediate halt to NATO's military
attacks against Yugoslavia and urges for resumption of
negotiations for an early just and peaceful solution to the Kosovo
crisis in an effort to safeguard the territorial integrity of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the statement concluded.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A study was launched Friday in
Melbourne to find out why diabetes among Chinese Australians is
suspected to be three times greater than the rest of the
Australian community.
</P>
<P>
The study was launched in the second biggest city of Australia
by Australian Federal Health Minister Michael Wooldridge.
</P>
<P>
The project, designed by the Chinese Health Foundation, aims to
find those at risk of diabetes and to develop treatment and
prevention techniques.
</P>
<P>
Ways of assessing and improving the health of Chinese
Australians will also be investigated under the so-called Chinese
Australian Better Health Research Project.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Bridget Hsu-Hage, foundation president and chief
investigator of the research project, Friday described the planned
study as unique.
</P>
<P>
"The program will investigate the high incidence of H. pylori
(a bacterium which is the leading cause of peptic ulcer disease)
in the community, as well as implement treatment programs designed

<HEADLINE> Commentary: China Plays Crucial Role in Upholding U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Thursday adopted a draft resolution on the Kosovo crisis, bringing
the Kosovo peace process back into the U.N. framework.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO, without the authorisation of the Security
Council, unilaterally launched air strikes on Yugoslavia, a
sovereign and independent member of the U.N. family, thus
violating the U.N. Charter and international law.
</P>
<P>
When the draft resolution, hammered out by Russia and seven
major Western countries, was presented to the Security Council for
approval early this week, the move has actually sent a strong
signal to the world community that NATO's policy of force can
bring no peace to the Balkans, long considered "the powder keg in
Europe."
</P>
<P>
Numerous facts have shown that the NATO bombing, in the name of
humanitarianism, has in reality created the most serious
humanitarian catastrophe in Europe since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
One of the five permanent members with veto power on the
15-nation body, China, who voted in abstention, has undertaken
pains-taking efforts to safeguard the U.N. Charter and the
authority of the Security Council, which has the primary
responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security in the
world at large.
</P>
<P>
First, China has made it clear that only after the end of NATO
bombing can the Security Council start its deliberation on the
proposed resolution. In fact, the Chinese demand was completely
met because the Security Council members debated and voted on the
draft following the NATO announcement of its decision to suspend
its air campaign.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, several NATO members, who are also Security members,
at first intended to impose "a freeze" on the draft, arguing that
no change can be made to even a single word of the text before the
voting. In their viewpoint, the Security Council should adopt the
original draft as it is.
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang, acting Chinese permanent representative to the
United Nations, made a clear-cut statement that "the Security
Council is not a rubber stamp," saying that not only should the
draft be amended, but it should be subjected to full consideration
in order to mirror every Council member's major concerns.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the Chinese efforts, an amendment was finally
incorporated in the resolution, stating that the Security Council
should bear in mind the principles and purposes of the U.N.
Charter, including the primary responsibility of the Security
Council for the maintenance of international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
The amendment, put in the very first paragraph of the
just-adopted resolution text, foils the attempt by the U.S.-led
NATO to get a green light from the Security Council for its
further unilateral use of force in the world.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the world has attached great importance to the Chinese
stance on the Kosovo crisis. For example, the special envoys of
Russia and the European Union have paid separate visits to Beijing
for talks with Chinese leaders in a bid to solicit opinions of the
Chinese Government on how to solve the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Last but not least, the Chinese stand was largely echoed by
many developing countries, whose representatives, at the United
Nations, have voiced their thanks for China's successful efforts
to safeguard the U.N. Charter and uphold justice in the world
community.
</P>
<P>
However, the resolution made no mention of the disaster caused
by NATO bombing in Yugoslavia, which led to numerous civilian
deaths and the wanton destruction of a lot of civilian facilities,
such as bridges, factories, schools, hospitals and even refugee
camps.
</P>
<P>
The flames of war which have been raging for 79 days on the
soil of Yugoslavia have finally died out, but the damages NATO has
inflicted on the Balkans and the sufferings it has brought to the
people in the region could not possibly disappear soon. At the
same time, the NATO move will give the world a lot to ponder over
for a long time to come.
</P>
<P>
It is widely accepted that to adopt a resolution is one thing,
but its full implementation is another. Now that the U.S.-led
NATO, in the binding resolution, has recognised the authority of
the Security Council, its future deeds in carrying out the
resolution should be strictly guided by the universally-accepted
U.N. Charter.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Rejects Measure to Bar Funds for Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives on Thursday rejected an effort by conservative
Republicans to bar funds for the U.S. forces which is to be
deployed in Kosovo beyond September 30.
</P>
<P>
The House voted 270-155 to approve an amendment stripping
language from a 288 billion U.S. dollars defense authorization
bill for fiscal 2000 that prohibited use of funds for any combat
or peacekeeping operations in Yugoslavia after September 30 of
this year.
</P>
<P>
The vote came after President Bill Clinton promised the
Republican-led Congress to seek express approval for a
peacekeeping force in Kosovo and to manage it without harming
military readiness.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, the House rejected by a vote of 328-97 a
separate amendment offered by Republican Representative Mark
Souder of Indiana that would have prohibited even emergency funds
from being used for the peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
About 7,000 U.S. troops are expected to participate in a
50,000-strong peacekeeping force in Kosovo, with the vanguard
expected to move into the Serbian province on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"This is certainly no victory," Souder said, adding the Kosovo
bombing had destabilized the region and U.S. relations with China
and Russia while depleting the military and setting questionable
foreign policy precedents.
</P>
<P>
"If this is a victory, what would defeat look like?" Souder
asked.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The New York Knicks beat the
Indiana Pacers 101-94 in the NBA Eastern Conference finals Game 5
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The victory takes the Knicks to lead 3-2 in the best-of-seven
series. The Paces that was within one game of the NBA Finals last
year is now one game away from elimination as it returns to New
York for Game 6 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I try to install a lot of confidence in them," Bird said. "It'
s too bad for us that some guys talk it and they don't walk it."
</P>
<P>
The Pacers have blown fourth-quarter leads in every loss.
Center Rik Smits has given them only one good game.
</P>
<P>
After a strong first quarter, the Pacers looked like a bunch of
guys with different ideas on how to win. They had only 12 assists,
their lowest total in the 1999 playoffs, and only one in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Reggis Miller scored 30 points, Dale Davis got 18 rebounds, but
Jalen Rose only scored six points.
</P>
<P>
Latrell Sprewell scored 29 points for the Knicks, Marcus Camby
added 21 points and 13 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
The Pacers came out like they wanted to end it, scoring the
first nine points. Then New York came back with 10 straight points
to take the lead with 5 minutes left in the first quarter. The
Knicks scored only for more points and the Pacers led comfortably
28-14 at the end of the period.
</P>
<P>
In the second period, Miller appeared more interested in
drawing fouls than trying to score, and his array of wild shots
missed badly.
</P>
<P>
They lost their 14-point lead and went into halftime tied at
42.

<HEADLINE> Fowler Pledges to Stay with Liverpool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- England striker Robbie Fowler has
returned from England duty to immediately pledge his future to
Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
Anfield boss Gerard Houllier flew in from his French holiday
for top level talks with Fowler and executive vice-chairman Peter
Robinson to put an end to the constant speculation that the
striker wanted to quit the club.
</P>
<P>
Houllier met Fowler just hours after the 23-year-old striker
had returned with the England squad from Bulgaria following the
disappointing 1-1 draw.
</P>
<P>
Fowler didn't arrive in England until 2.00 am but was at
Anfield first thing this morning for the pre-arranged meeting.
</P>
<P>
A Liverpool source said: "The fact that Gerard broke his
holiday to meet Fowler shows just how seriously he viewed the
situation."
</P>
<P>
It is believed Arsenal have been planning a 12 million pounds
bid for some time, and that Fowler was aware of the interest from
Highbury.
</P>
<P>
Houllier was clearly also aware of the interest from fellow
countryman Arsene Wenger, and so decided to confront Fowler with
the situation before the prolific forward started his own holiday
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Fowler said: "I am fed up with the constant
rumors that I want to leave Liverpool, which is why I wanted to
see the manager as soon as I could and put the record straight."

<HEADLINE> Sampras Regains No. 1 Ranking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Pete Sampras of the United States
regained the world number position in ATP rankings when the new
list is issued on Monday, after defeating Australian Wayne Arthurs
7-5,6-3 here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
With the win, Sampras also moved into the quarter-finals of the
London grasscourt championships, a traditional pre-Wimbledon event.
</P>
<P>
The American five-times Wimbledon champion now will have topped
the rankings for 268 weeks -- just two less than the record 270
set by Ivan Lendl.
</P>
<P>
But it was not all plain sailing on Court One for Sampras. He
had to overcome a shoulder injury which required courtside
treatment from the tournament doctor before imposing his will on
qualifier Arthurs to advance in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
"My shoulder hurt and I took some painkillers. It didn't get
worse but it wasn't great, but I will be playing tomorrow whatever
happens," the American said.
</P>
<P>
"Of course I'd be lying if I said I didn't care about the
rankings. That record is very important to me.
</P>
<P>
"But I figure I'm going to be around for many more years and
right now I am more pleased with the way I am playing."
</P>
<P>
Sampras's match was rescheduled from Center Court to Court One
amid fears about the light fading.
</P>
<P>
"There are some strange decisions at this tournament," Sampras
said. "Playing on Court One is a bit different. The atmosphere is
not the same and there are often nasty surprises out there.
</P>
<P>
"But anyway, I got through. They should start this tournament
two hours earlier though if they want to get through four matches
on Center."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, seventh-seed Greg Rusedski survived a second-set scare
to beat Wayne Ferreira 7-5, 4-6, 6-3 and ease into the quarters.
</P>
<P>
The Briton was joined by sixth-seeded Slovak Karol Kucera, who
beat former Wimbledon semifinalist Jason Stoltenberg 6-3,6-3, and
1997 Wimbledon finalist Cedric Pioline who saved a match point to
beat Todd Martin 1-6, 6-3, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Scott Draper, seeded 15, was not so
fortunate though. He was comprehensively beaten by Armenian Sargis
Sargsian, conqueror of world number one Yevgeny Kafelnikov on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Fourth seed Mark Philippoussis was also a third round casualty.
The 1997 champion was beaten by 14th-seeded compatriot Lleyton
Hewitt 6-7, 6-3, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Goran Ivanisevic, seeded eight, squeezed through in three sets
6-4, 6-7, 6-4 against Sebastien Lareau while third-seed Tim Henman
dispatched of Zimbabwe's 13th seed Byron Black with the minimum of
effort.
</P>
<P>
The world number six ran through Black 6-1, 6-4 on Center Court.

<HEADLINE> Soccer Star Hagi Awarded by Sports Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Ministry of Youth and
Sports on Thursday awarded soccer star Gheorghe Hagi the Trophy
and Diploma of Soccer Excellence.
</P>
<P>
Minister Crin Antonescu praised Hagi as a living legend
deserving to be recorded next to other famous names of the
Romanian sports, such as gymnast Nadia Comaneci, tennis player
Ilie Nastase, rowing champion Ivan Patzaichin and mentioned that
he admired his professionalism, personality and all his
achievements.
</P>
<P>
"Hagi is one of the Romanians, who, next to his national team
colleagues, showed love for the country and succeeded in making
people come to the streets during the '98 World Cup in France and
the recent match against Hungary, in the European Championships
qualifiers", Antonescu said at the festivity.
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad that a player could provide an example to the whole
Romanian society by his outstanding career, as well as by his
decision to join again the national team in a difficult moment.
This is why the Ministry of Youth and Sports decided to grant him
the Trophy and Diploma of Soccer Excellence", he added.
</P>
<P>
Thanking for the distinctions, Hagi said that it was a great
honor and that he was proud to be chosen among Romania's best
sports people. "The merit is not only mine, but also of my
colleagues and national team coaches", he stressed.
</P>
<P>
President of the Romanian Soccer Federation Mircea Sandu
suggested that Romania's President might grant him the "Star of
Romania" order.
</P>
<P>
The national team coach Victor Piturca voiced his wish for Hagi
to play 4-5 more years. "Hagi can stay the course by his 37s. I
thank him for having come back to the national team, who needed
him", Piturca said.
</P>
<P>
Nicknamed "Maradona of the Carpathians", Hagi has been a soccer
star for 16 years playing in three World Cup finals. For 116 times,
he capped for the national team with 33 goals. Romania had the
best World Cup tour when Hagi was in the national squad in 1994 as
it reached the quarterfinal in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The 34 year-old soccer retired from the national team last year
after World Cup finals in France, but returned last Saturday for
the match vs Hungary when Romanian team beat the opponent 2-0,
winning its first victory against Hungary in 63 years. Two days
ago, Hagi announced that he would continue his career with Romania
's national team till the final tournament of the European Cup in
2000.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Force Commander Pledges "Even-handedness" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SKOPJE, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Kosovo Force Commander Lt. General
Mike Jackson pledged Thursday to implement the peace plan for
Kosovo "even-handedly."
</P>
<P>
In a press conference at the NATO Press Information Center
here, the British general said: "What we do in Kosovo, I ensure
you, will be robust and completely even-handed."
</P>
<P>
This even-handedness is vital for the international security
force to implement the peace plan in the southern Serbian province
of Yugoslavia, he said.
</P>
<P>
The military technical agreement signed between Jackson and
Yugoslav representatives Wednesday night provides for a "phased,
verifiable and orderly" withdrawal of all Serb forces from Kosovo
within 11 days.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that Yugoslavia started troops pullout at midday
Thursday and accordingly NATO Secretary General Javier Solana has
ordered NATO supreme commander Wesley Clark to suspend the 79-day
airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He said that the relevant U.N. Security Council resolution on
the Kosovo conflict has called for demilitarization of all armed
ethnic Albanian groups in Kosovo and that under the Ramboullet
agreement, the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) is required to lay
down weapons and disband. As a signatory to the Ramboullet
agreement, it still holds good for the KLA, he added.
</P>
<P>
The British general warned KLA against attempting to attack
Serb forces who are pulling out of Kosovo, saying any such acts
will not be "tolerated."
</P>
<P>
He said that the technical agreement has provided "a clear
legal base" for setting up the international security presence
known as Kosovo Force or KFOR to establish a secure environment in
the province.
</P>
<P>
The commander designated three main tasks for KFOR --
monitoring, verifying and implementing the compliance of the
agreements, assisting the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) to facilitate the safe return of the war refugees and
providing a "basic" law and order where people in Kosovo can have
confidence to start a normal life.
</P>
<P>
He said the KFOR will provide peace and stability for all
people of Kosovo whatever background they come from, which means
that the international force will also protect the 300,000 Serbs
living there.
</P>
<P>
The major threats for KFOR soldiers in Kosovo which the
commander said are concerning him are mines, demolitions, booby
traps and unexploded ordnance.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved on
Thursday 325 million U.S. dollars in loans for two private sector
reform projects in Romania to support the government's reform
program needed to sustain macroeconomic stabilization and to
increase the efficiency of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The money is composed of a 300-million-dollar Private Sector
Adjustment Loan and a loan of 25 million dollars for the Private

The Private Sector Adjustment Loan will provide support in the
following areas: financial sector restructuring, enterprise
divestiture, improvement of the business environment, and
mitigation of social costs.
</P>

The Private Sector Institution Building Project is aimed to
enhance the private sector's role in the economy and will help
improve the business environment for the private sector growth.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Italian FM Meets With KLA Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The international community expects
the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) to demonstrate its sense of
responsibility in helping to restore peace to that Serb province,
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini told KLA leader Hashim
Thaqi here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This sense of responsibility is necessary, Dini stressed, "to
re-establish in Kosovo that balance needed to achieve peaceful
co-existence in the region."
</P>
<P>
Thaqi reiterated to Dini that the KLA will respect its
commitment made to the international community and "will not
attack Serb troops". However, he added, the KLA "reserves the
right to self-defense"' for its people.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press after their talks, Dini said that "I
underscored to Thaqi that peace now will be very strong, almost as
strong as the bombing, to restore democracy to Serbia."
</P>
<P>
The Serb people, he added, "must now be helped to restore a
healthy democratic party system." The problem of returning Kosovar
refugees to their homes, Dini observed, "is not one which can be
resolved in a few days or some weeks" and they will continue to
need support and humanitarian aid.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Supports Coal Industry Restructuring in Poland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved on
Thursday a Hard Coal Sector Adjustment Loan totaling 300 million
U.S. dollars to support the Polish government's hard coal sector
restructuring program and to help the country transform a major
state-owned industry into a competitive and profitable sector.
</P>
<P>
The loan will facilitate structural reform and the start of
privatization process, assist in improvement of corporate
governance arrangements in the sector, and help mitigate the
adverse social effects of the industry reform on local
communities, the bank said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank, Poland's hard coal sector, which
provides over 60 percent of total primary energy consumption in
Poland and accounts for almost 4 percent of gross domestic
product, is experiencing a difficult period of transition.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the sector has suffered very large and
increasing losses and has become a burden on the government budget
as it failed to adjust to shrinking domestic demand and sharply
declining export sales and prices.
</P>
<P>
To stop the increasing losses and to prepare the sector to
compete within the European Union, the government of Poland has
made the reform of the sector one of its highest priorities and
put in place a comprehensive Hard Coal Sector Restructuring
Program, which was approved in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
The loan is repayable in 15 years, including a five-year grace
period, at the bank's standard interest rate for LIBOR-based,
single currency loans. The loan will be released in two tranches;
the first tranche of 70 million dollars is expected in July 1999
and the second tranche of 230 million dollars in early 2000.
