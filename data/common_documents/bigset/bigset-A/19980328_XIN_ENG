<HEADLINE> German Troupe Perform ``White Rose'' in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- A German opera troupe headed by
famous composer Udo Zimmermann is on a three-day tour in the
French city of Lyon to perform "White Rose," a story about two
young Germans executed in Munich in 1943 for condemning Hitler.
</P>
<P>
They chose Lyon for the performance because the city used to be
the base of the notorious German Gestapo chief in France, Klaus
Barbie, during the Occupation.
</P>
<P>
It was a place of torture and execution of many French
Resistance fighters.
</P>
<P>
The troupe consists of singer-dancers Marie Devellereau and
Laurent Alvaro, who play brother and sister Hans and Sophie
Scholl, and 15 musicians.
</P>
<P>
The opera recalls the last night in the cell of the pair, two
University of Munich students, before they were decapitated by axe
in a Munich prison in an early February morning during the darkest
era of German history.

BONN, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Germany's powerful central bank on
Friday gave the green light for the single European currency, the
euro, saying that its planned launch on January 1, 1999 "seems to
be justifiable now in terms of stability".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the German government on Friday also approved the
recommendation of the European Union Commission two days ago to
launch the euro in 1999 with the participation of 11 EU members
except Greece, Britain, Sweden and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
However, the German central bank, known as the Bundesbank,
stressed that it had "serious concerns" about the sustainability
of fiscal consolidation in Italy and Belgium which have public
debts of more than 120 percent of gross domestic product (GDP),
more than double the 60-percent ceiling set by the European Union
Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
In its report on European economic convergence, which was
submitted to the German cabinet on Friday, the Bundesbank said
both Italy and Belgium would have to make additional binding
commitments to cut their debt levels before entering the euro.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji Addresses Reemployment Issues (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zhu stressed that enterprises must squarely face issues related
to bankruptcies, mergers, redirecting laid-off workers and
introducing reemployment programs.
</P>
<P>
He urged local governments and enterprises to establish
reemployment centers and provide basic subsistence allowances and
medical insurance services for laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
He also urged laid-off workers to alter their concepts concerning
employment and seek opportunities in the service industry, a
sector with vast development potential.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that problems with the grain circulation system have
harmed the interests of farmers and noted that the system has
failed to meet the need for development of the socialist market
economy.
</P>
<P>
He said major problems with the grain circulation system
include outdated operational mechanisms, a large number of surplus
workers, poor management and the misappropriation of
funds earmarked for grain purchases.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the proper direction for reform of the grain
circulation system centers on assigning responsibilities for grain
enterprises to localities.
</P>
<P>
He called for a clear division between the responsibilities of
the central and local governments in the sector, with the former
retaining responsibility for macro-controls related to grain and
the management of special grain reserves and the latter bearing
responsibility for responsible for grain production.
</P>
<P>
He said that grain enterprises will be required to eliminate
losses and urged the Agricultural Development Bank to enhance the
management of the grain purchase funds.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo briefed officials on State Council
circulars related to redirecting laid-off workers to other sectors
and reemployment projects.
</P>
<P>
The two senior leaders visited the Changchun Reemployment
Service Center on March 25 and talked with both staffers and
laid-off workers, and conveyed them regards from Jiang Zemin,
general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee
and president of the country.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji Addresses Reemployment Issues (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji has
urged governments at all levels to adopt effective measures to
help laid-off workers find new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Zhu told leading officials from Liaoning, Jilin and
Heilongjiang provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
that the reemployment project for laid-off workers is directly
related to the overall status of the nation's reforms, development
and stability.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), dispatched Zhu to Changchun, the
capital of northeast China's Jilin Province, to attend a related
forum held between March 24-26.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, also member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, listened to suggestions
concerning the reemployment of laid-off workers and deepening
reforms of China's grain circulation system.
</P>
<P>
He said that the CPC Central Committee and State Council have
decided to extricate most medium- and large-sized state-owned
enterprises from existing difficult situations by carrying out a
three-year program centered on reforms, restructuring, technology
upgrades and improved management.
</P>
<P>
He said a modern enterprises system will be established within
three years and expressed confidence that all objectives will be
realized.
</P>
<P>
"The key problem for realization of the goals lies in the
arrangement and reemployment of laid-off workers," said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
The current round of layoffs will result in temporary
difficulties for workers, but will fundamentally benefit economic
development and social progress, said Zhu, adding that related
efforts will benefit the long-term interests of the working class.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to help laid-off workers overcome
difficulties and find reemployment.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that the government bears the responsibility for
helping workers solve problems, and added that ensuring the
livelihood of laid-off workers and reemployment issues are vitally
important for both the reform of state-owned enterprises and
social stability.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the key for extricating loss-making state-owned
enterprises from difficulties lies in reducing redundant employees.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that adopting administrative measures to protect
loss-making enterprises would hinder development of the socialist
market economy and expanded opening-up.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Announces New Education Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan announced Friday a new
education policy under which its literacy rate will increase to 70
percent by 2010 from about 39 percent at present.
</P>
<P>
An important feature of the policy is its built-in capacity to
absorb any innovative measure that will carry positive
implications during its implementation, said Education Minister
Syed Ghous Ali Shah while announcing the policy here, according to
the Associated Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Ghous said that about 709 billion rupees (around 16.1 billion
U.S. dollars) will be required for educational expansion and
reforms in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The estimates are based on annual growth rate of 6 percent of
gross domestic product, he added.
</P>
<P>
Under the new policy, primary education will be made compulsory
through a legislation. About 45,000 new primary and 20,000 masjid
(mosque) schools will be established.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 75,000 non-formal basic education schools will be
initiated during the five years. Evening shift will be introduced
in 20,000 primary schools.
</P>
<P>
Some 45,000 primary schools will be upgraded to middle level
and 30,000 new secondary schools will be opened.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 100,000 new teachers will be recruited for primary,
middle and secondary schools.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Needs No Foreign Food Aid: Says Senior </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Hunger is already a thing of
the past and it has in fact been eliminated in Ethiopia,
Ethiopian Deputy Prime Minister Kassu Illala said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Efoyta, a local Amharic monthly,
Kassu who is deputy prime minister in charge of economic affairs,
said that Ethiopia is currently self-sufficient in food and that
food security will be realized in the next five years. His
interview was published in the latest issue of the Efoyta.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia harvested only 8.8 million tons of grains in 1997 due
to the El Nino effect, 25 percent and nine percent lower than
that of 1996 and 1995 respectively. After harvesting a record
11.7 million tons of grains in 1996, Ethiopia exported 100,000
tons of grains to its neighbouring countries.
</P>
<P>
Kassu admitted that the El Nino has caused problems, but the
number of the drought-affected population has been revised
downwards from the initial estimate of about 4 million.
</P>
<P>
The overall agricultural development plan envisages an annual
surplus of 100,000 tons of grains beyond food self- sufficiency,
said the deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the situation will better this year," said Kassu,
predicting that in the next few years Ethiopia will need
no foreign food assistance.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pledges to Look at African Debt Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Friday that he intended to look at proposals aimed at
lightening the burden of debt on impoverished countries in
Africa, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint news conference with South African
President Nelson Mandela in Cape Town, Clinton said there was a
proposal on the table which would permit African countries
pursuing economic reforms to get debt relief of up to 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
"And I think it's a sound proposal... if it's properly
administered by the international authorities."
</P>
<P>
After talking to Mandela and other leaders he had met in
Africa, he had pledged to take a look at how the proposal would
work and see what he could do to ensure that as much aid as
possible was given.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. president said there should be conditions
attached to the debt relief.
</P>
<P>
"But I do think it is legitimate to say, if you want debt
relief to unleash the economic potential (of a ) country so that
you can take the burden off it, then when it's all said and
done... two things have to exist," the U.S. president said.
</P>
<P>
"Number one, you've got to have a set of policies that will
produce better results in the future than you had in the past, in
any country. And number two, the country has to be able to
attract investment, both private and public investment, in the
future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that there would be no guarantee of better
policies if uncritical 100 percent debt relief was granted.
</P>
<P>
This did not apply to South Africa, which had a good, strong
economic policy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for not granting 100 percent debt relief was
that people would be reluctant to loan money in future because
they would think they would never get any of their money back.
</P>
<P>
"So I think the trick is to get enough debt relief to
countries to get their debt burden down so they can grow, and
they're not just crushed and kept from making any progress, but
to do it in a way so that the debt relief produces longer-term
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
"And that's my goal," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and visiting U.S. Middle East Peace Envoy
Dennis Ross held talks here Friday for more than four hours to
discuss the next Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Ross first held one-to-one talks for an hour and
a half in the prime minister's office and then were joined by
Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh and U.S. ambassador to
Israel Ned Walker.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, neither Netanyahu nor Ross made any comments
to reporters.
</P>
<P>
But Israel Radio quoted sources in the prime minister's office
as saying that although the percentage figure for redeployment was
not discussed during the talks, Netanyahu did stress the principle
of reciprocity in implementing the agreement and maintaining
security.
</P>
<P>
The sources said there was no assurance that the U.S. will not
release its peace plan at Israeli request, which called for
Israeli redeployment in more than 13 percent of West Bank in order
to break the deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The sources stressed that Israel continues opposing a second
redeployment of 13 percent and would not agree to "any initiative
which will endanger its national security."
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have been stalled for a year
over Jewish settlement expansion in occupied lands and the scope
of Israeli pullback from West Bank. The new U.S. initiative to get
peace wheel running again was rejected by Netanyahu, who disputed
that more than 9 percent withdrawal will put Israeli in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
Both right wing and left wing demonstrators gathered outside
the prime minister's office when the Netanyahu-Ross talks were in
progress.
</P>
<P>
A dozen members of Israel's Peace Now Movement waved banners
which read "peace is greater than 13 percent," calling on
Netanyahu to accept the U.S. plan. While the settlers from West
Bank protested against any redeployment in the territories.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who began his Middle East trip Thursday night, is
scheduled to hold talks with the Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat on Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Ross will travel to Cairo for talks with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and ask Egyptian leaders to pressure the
Palestinians into accepting the U.S. proposal for advancing the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ross will return here Saturday evening for a second meeting
with Netanyahu.

<P>
LONDON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The British government announced
on Friday that all four-year-olds in England will have access to a
free nursery education beginning in September.
</P>
<P>
The Education secretary David Blunkett said a planned new
partnership between the state, private and voluntary sectors would
deliver 650,000 nursery places from the start of the new school
year.
</P>
<P>
"When we were elected, we promised to provide a free nursery
place fro all four-year-olds and we are delivering the goods," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Blunkett added that the number of places created was 60,000
more than had been created under the Conservative government's
nursery scheme, which was scrapped when Labor came to power in
May, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The education secretary acknowledged that there were concerns
that large numbers of children would be taken into school
reception classes supervised by just one teacher, ending the
traditionally small nursery groups.
</P>
<P>
But he maintained that if those in the private and voluntary
sectors worked with local educators, the problem could be
overcome.

MOGADISHU, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Heavy rains and an outbreak of
cholera have created a great deal of fear in southern Somalia,
said radio reports monitored here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
At a time when the international humanitarian efforts are
running smoothly, reports of alarming renewed heavy rains and an
outbreak of cholera in Southern Somalia created a great deal of
fear among the communities of Lower and Middle Jubba regions.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, rains and cholera are especially
concentrated around major towns of Jilib, and Kismaio, the
Southern port town, and the villages surrounding them.
</P>
<P>
The rains lasting for three days in the
area of Jilib have already ruined the very few muddy roads which
hardly opened for the commercial traffic last month, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
Even though there have been no floods at this early stage, the
community elders in Jilib expressed their concern that more rains
during the Gu' season will be catastrophic.
</P>
<P>
They said that all water reservoirs and water channels were
destroyed by floods late last year.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, they have been especially terrified by the rising
water levels in the rivers.
</P>
<P>
The breakout of cholera in Jilib town and its surrounding
villages also posed threat to the helpless Somalis who were
displaced by floods last year.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that more than 35 people died in the town and
its surrounding villages since the beginning of the week, while
nearly a hundred others are now in critical conditions.
</P>
<P>
The elders in the area complained about lack of medicine,
rehydration solution and potable water.
</P>
<P>
The cholera alarms are ringing in southern Somalia at a time
when Mogadishu and its surrounding towns are on the brink of
closing up their few quarantines opened for the disease during
its climax early in the year.
</P>
<P>
According to local doctors in the capital, cholera is now
under full control in Mogadishu and its surrounding towns of
Balad and Afgoe. There are only 24 cholera patients in the
largest quarantine facility of Mogadishu at the moment.
</P>
<P>
The floods in southern Somalia late last year claimed lives of
more than 20,000 people and erased more than 60,000 hectares of
farm lands and swept away more than 35,000 heads of cattle, goats
and camels.
</P>
<P>
Those floods affected nearly a million people, making about
250,000 people homeless.

<HEADLINE> London Oil Price up, Concerns Still Remain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 27 (Xinhua) - Oil price on the London market
edged tentatively up Friday, lifted by news that OPEC would hold
an emergency meeting next Monday to ratify a pact to cut oil
production to boost international oil prices which fell to
nine-year low earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
World benchmark, Brent blend crude, whose price slipped to
under 12 US dollars last week, was trading at 15.55 US dollars a
barrel by 1411 GMT, 11 cents higher on Thursday's close.
</P>
<P>
However, concerns over the future trend of oil prices still
remain, with the International Energy Agency (IEA) casting doubt
on the rescue deal, saying that the planned cuts by both OPEC and
non-OPEC oil producers would not be enought to offset the excess
oil supply on the world markets and prices may resume falling.
</P>
<P>
Oil price on the London market rose sharply earlier this week
and now stands 3.60 dollars a barrel above the nine-year lows hit
earlier this month. The price has risen more than two dollars
since last weekend when the production-cut pact reached in the
Saudi Arabian capital of Riyadh was first announced.
</P>
<P>
Robert Priddle, the executive director of IEA, the West's
oil-watchdog, was quoted by Reuters as saying that world oil
market will still be very amply oversupplied even if this cut
takes place.
</P>
<P>
He added that the deal has shot up world oil price
significantly but the price will tend to drift down again because
there is still more oil available than the market is demanding.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a possible rise in Iraqi oil exports also added to
concerns over oil prices as the U.N. Security Council last Friday
approved a measure which more than doubled the amount of oil Iraq
can sell over six months.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that oil markets will endure downward pressure as
rising Iraqi oil exports will coincide with a seasonal fall in
Western oil demand.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Has to Export More Oil at Low Prices: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iraqi official said
Friday that low prices on world oil market have led to an increase
in the amount of oil Iraq has to export to meet the quota under
its oil-for-food deal with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency quoted Saddam Zeban al-Hassan,
director-general of the State Oil Marketing Organization as
saying that his organization has acted quickly to conclude deals
to sell additional oil to fill in the gap caused by low prices.
</P>
<P>
Hassan said Iraq has concluded a total of 48 contracts with
foreign oil companies under the third phase of oil-for-food deal,
under which Iraq is allowed to sell 5.2 billion dollars worth of
oil to buy food, medicine and to meet other humanitarian needs.
</P>
<P>
However, he complained that Iraq's contracts with foreign
companies for the purchase of spare parts to repair the
Iraqi-Turkish oil pipeline are still suspended and have not been
approved by the U.N. Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been accusing the U.S. representative with the
U.N. Sanctions Committee of blocking the approval of some of the
contracts struck by Iraq and foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council last month adopted a new resolution
raising the oil-for-food deal to 5.2 billion dollars in the third
phase, from 2 billion in the first and second phases, to alleviate
humanitarian crisis in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi government informed the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
during his visit to Baghdad last month that the country lacks the
technical capacity to export more than 4 billion dollars worth of
oil in six-month time.

<HEADLINE> Riddles A Novel Way to Teach Children Reading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- British psychologists have found
that training children to understand and make up riddles can
improve their reading in the crucial first years of primary
school, The Independent newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Using riddles for half an hour a day for three weeks can
advance the reading age of seven-to nine-year-olds by up to 12
months, Dr Nicola Yuill and colleagues, from Sussex University,
told the British Psychological Society's Conference.
</P>
<P>
Riddles, resting on a double meaning which requires
sophisticated skills of comprehension, could help children who had
difficulty in making the transition from reading words to
understanding sentences, researchers suggested.
</P>
<P>
"Children can tell riddles before they know how to read. They
are a natural aural form of language play. Children don't have to
be taught to use them and they enjoy them." Dr Yuill was quoted as
saying.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pleased With Senate Approval of IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President
Bill Clinton said Friday that he was pleased with the U.S.
Senate's approval of new funding for International Monetary Fund
(IMF) coffers depleted by the Asian economic crisis, South
African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased that the Senate has approved important
legislation" to inject 17.9 billion U.S. dollars into the IMF,
Clinton said, while expressing dismay over the absence of action
to pay up U.S. arrears to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued in Cape Town, where Clinton arrived
Thursday on the fourth leg of his six-nation African tour, the
U.S. president said: "The crisis in Asia poses a threat to
American jobs and exports."
</P>
<P>
Thursday's 84-16 vote in the Senate came on an amendment to an
Emergency Spending Bill. The IMF funding still requires approval
by the House of Representatives, which as the Senate is dominated
by opposition Republicans.
</P>
<P>
House Republican leaders have said that they would not include
the IMF amendment in their version of the Emergency Spending
Bill, which also covers funding for U.S. troops in Bosnia and the
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Clinton urged in the communique: "To ensure that the American
economy continues on the path of steady growth, Congress must
make sure that the IMF is strong enough to respond to any
broadening of the current crisis."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president said he was also pleased with the Senate's
approval of funding for the U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
However, he added: "At the same time, I remain concerned that
the Senate bill does not address the matter of United Nations
arrears," which Clinton said, "continues to undercut our global
leadership."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate on Wednesday night adopted a non-binding
measure by a vote of 90-10, calling on the U.N. to immediately
reduce the U.S. share of the costs of peacekeeping operations from
about 30 percent to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Jesse Helms, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, told the Senate that U.S. costs in the Gulf and Bosnia
far surpass the arrears in U.N. dues, which he called "money which
we do not owe and should never pay."

JOHANNESBURG, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Visitng U.S. President Bill
Clinton said Friday that both South Africa and the United States
were committed to preventing the expansion of weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Cape Town, Clinton said this
was a conclusion he and South African counterpart Nelson Mandela
had reached in the talks early this morning which included
security issues.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also said the U.S. Defense Department would buy new
South African de-mining vehicles to help remove landmines.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and South Africa were at the forefront of the efforts
to eliminate the scourge of landmines in the world, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Military sources said the South Africa-made de-mining vehicles
would help to remove mines more quickly, safely, more
effectively.
</P>
<P>
Describing landmine as "a terrible problem the world over",
Clinton said, "the new South African (de-mining) technology will
help us immensely".
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has come under fire from a number of world
organizations for not signing an international treaty banning the
production and sale of landmines.

LONDON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Britain hailed the proposed
initiative of creating a unified European aerospace and defense
group Friday, but warned that there is still much to do in
restructuring the European defense industry.
</P>
<P>
It was reported the four members of the Europe's Airbus
consortium, including Britain, Germany, France and Spain,
announced in a joint report early Friday that they had agreed in
principle to establish such an integrated defense group.

British Defense Secretary George Robertson and British

measure of agreement that has been reached between the partners".
</P>
<P>
"The UK government remains convinced that the urgent
restructuring of Europe's aerospace industry is essential if it is
to be efficient and globally competitive," the joint statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The two British government ministers also warned there "are
still a number of measures that require further work" and they
stressed that Britain also welcomed the involvement of other

<HEADLINE> Fifth of UK Households Have no Insurance Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- About 20 percent of households in
Britain are not insured as millions of people living in deprived
areas can not afford to purchase cover, according to a report
published Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report by the Institute for Public Policy Research said
that many of those who cannot afford cover are young families,
lone parents and the unemployed, who tend to be tenants rather
than home-owners.
</P>
<P>
The main reasons for their having no insurance protection are
that premiums are prohibitively high and policy terms are too
restrictive, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, payment options are also prohibitive as few
companies accept cash.
</P>
<P>
The think-tank pointed out that most insurance companies target
marketing efforts at those already insured and the mainstream
products on offer are often inappropriate for people on low
income.
</P>
<P>
It suggested that some of the revenues from Insurance Premium
Tax, levied on the sale of non-life policies, should be channeled
into a fund to improve home security in deprived areas.
</P>
<P>
The Association of British Insurers, which represents 440
companies, denied that they prefer not to insure those on lower
incomes, saying it is studying ways the industry can offer
insurance more widely and is reviewing payment systems.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Support Shipping Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government is
determined to support the shipping industry and maintain it as a
major service domain on the island, a ranking official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a commerce meeting, Cypriot Minister of
Communications and Works Leontios Ierodiaconou expressed
confidence that Cyprus can maintain its competitive position in
international shipping and overcome "hostile actions" like the
Turkish embargo.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus ranks fifth on the list of world merchant shipping,
with 2,733 vessels under the Cypriot flag and a total of 26.15
million gross tonnage, behind Panama, Liberia, Greece and the
Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
Ierodiaconou said recent appointment of additional marine
surveyors and inspectors has considerably strengthened state
control of the island's shipping flag and contributed to the
improvement of its image.
</P>
<P>
The results are already obvious, Ierodiaconou noted, the number
of Cyprus ships detained on account of deficiencies in 1997
decreased by 7 to 12 percent from that in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
He reassured that the government will try to maintain shipping
incentives to boost the even after Cyprus' accession into the
European Union.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Swazi
parliament Thursday urged Justice Minister Chief Simelane to make
an urgent appointment of a hangman to carry out death sentences.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association Friday quoted sources reaching
here as reporting that nine of 15 convicted murderers sentenced
to death over the past few years in Swaziland were on death row
at Matsapa Central Prison, waiting to be hanged at Sidwashini
Prison in Mbabane, the capital of the country.
</P>
<P>
The remaining six had their sentences commuted to life
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The gallows have been kept in working order since the last
hanging of a woman ritual murderer in 1983.
</P>
<P>
Hanging in Swaziland came to a halt after the last hangman
left the country.
</P>
<P>
The parliament members said only carrying out the death
sentences without delay would deter potential killers.
</P>
<P>
Hanging the killers would help console the relatives of the
victims, parliament member Sibengwane Ndzimandze said.
</P>
<P>
In respones, Simelane said his ministry was already screening
a large number of applicants for the post, including two female
candidates.
</P>
<P>
The post was a very sensitive one and great care had to be
taken in selecting right person, he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Bill Unacceptable to S. Africa: Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States' Africa Growth
and Opportunity Bill, which indicates a shift in U.S. Africa policy
from aid to trade, was unacceptable to South Africa in its current
form, South African President Nelson Mandela said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"It is better sometimes to say this is a matter over which we have
serious reservations, this legislation - to us it is not acceptable,"
South African Press Association quoted Mandela as telling a joint news
briefing with visiting U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The bill, already endorsed by the U.S. House of Representatives and
now must go to the senate, proposes opening of African markets and
better U.S. market access for African exports, as well as the creation
of an African infrastructure fund linked to political and market
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said the United States and South Africa accepted each
other's integrity and were discussing the matter.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who was on a four-day state visit here, defended the bill,
saying it would increase the access of all African nations to the
American market -- without conditions.
</P>
<P>
He said the bill "strikes the right kind of balance" in promising
greater market access to those countries which make greater strides
towards democracy, human rights and economic reform.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki told a French
magazine that the U.S. shift from aid to trade "is wrong", as Africa,
including South Africa, needed both.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley later told a press conference
he had been told by other African leaders that they were happy with
the legislation.
</P>
<P>
Asked if it could be amended in light of South Africa's
reservations, he said it was a working document that still had to be
passed by the U.S. senate before being signed into law by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, on the fourth leg of his six-nation African tour, visited
Robben Island Friday afternoon in Mandela's company. The island was
the prison where President Nelson Mandela was incarcerated for 18
years.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Calls for Unity for EU Accession Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government Friday
called on all Greek Cypriot political parties to unite and
cooperate for a successful completion of Cyprus' European Union
(EU) accession negotiations scheduled to start on March 31.
</P>
<P>
The government considers "an historic event the forthcoming
accession negotiations between the EU and the Cyprus Republic,"
government spokesman Christos Stylianides said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
As of March 31, "a new era starts for both the country's
political and social life," the statement said. "In this difficult
course, the people of Cyprus will have the constant support from
the Greek government and the whole political leadership of Greece,
for which we are very thankful."
</P>
<P>
It made a special reference of President Glafcos Clerides'
proposal for Turkish Cypriots' participation in the negotiating
team, saying this indicates the firm wish of Cypriot government
for the Turkish Cypriot community's involvement in this historic
challenge.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that the Cypriot government will keep an
eye on Turkish reactions, in view of the start of Cyprus-EU
accession talks.
</P>
<P>
The EU decided last December to invite Cyprus, along with
Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia and Estonia, for
membership talks in the union's first expansion into Eastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, angered by not being included in the envisaged
expansion, has threatened to integrate with the Turkish
Cypriot-controlled northern part of Cyprus should the EU go ahead
with entry talks with the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash also cut off
bicommunal contacts and refused to attend peace negotiations with
the Greek Cypriot side in retaliation for EU's decision.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a short-lived pro-Athens coup.

<HEADLINE> Europe, Africa Seek Closer Coop in Mining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- African and European mining and
financial companies are striving to strengthen cooperation in
tapping and exploiting the rich mineral resources in Africa.
</P>
<P>
As a fresh effort to this end, they will meet at the Mining
Forum to be held between March 30 and April 2 in Accra, capital
of Ghana, to promote long-term cooperation agreements.
</P>
<P>
The forum, the first of its kind, is jointly organized by the
European Commission and the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS), according to the Center for the Development of
Industry (CDI) based in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
In its latest information bulletin "Partnership", the CDI said
about 100 projects have been selected in order to ensure the
meeting will be effective and bring about concrete results in the
very short term in west and central Africa.
</P>
<P>
The types of projects concerned include the exploitation of
resources, the improvement of performance, the transformation of
products from raw materials to finished products, or even the
extension of existing mining sites.
</P>
<P>
According to the CDI, many projects are viable in the long run
because the selection criteria are based on the prior existence
of a market, the promoter's experience and its financial
capacity.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the participants will be able to take part
in three workshops on financing in the mining sector, exploration
techniques and the development of perspectives of the dimension
stone market.
</P>
<P>
The African mining sector experienced serious difficulties
from 1970 to 1990, while Latin America and Asian production
expanded considerably.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the majority of the African mining countries
(except South Africa) have only contributed eight percent of the
global mining production.
</P>
<P>
This compares sharply with the continent's rich resources. To
name a few, Africa holds 77 percent of the global reserves of
platinum group elements, 71 percent of the phosphates reserves and
42 percent of diamond reserves.
</P>
<P>
Even so, the mining sector in 11 west and central African
countries generates 50 percent of the export revenues, with the
proportion up to 80-90 percent in Guinea, Ghana and Sierra Leone
before its civil war.
</P>
<P>
The Accra Mining Forum, under such circumstances, is seen as a
key opportunity for these countries to attract investment and
technology from Europe to develop the mining industry.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Prince Meets Clinton, Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabian ambassador to
the United States, Prince Bandar Bin Sultan, Friday met with South
African President Nelson Mandela and visiting U.S. President Bill
Clinton, but South Africa played down the presence of the
prince, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
SAPA said Director-General of the South African presidential
office, Jakes Gerwel, had confirmed that Bandar, who is a member
of the Saudi royal family, had met Clinton and Mandela after
their 90-minute talks in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
" He's here as a private guest of the (South African)
president. He will be the president's special guest at the
banquet (in Clinton's honor ) tonight. I can quite categorically
say it has nothing to do with the Middle East or anything of that
nature," Gerwel said.
</P>
<P>
South African Presidential aide Parks Mankahlana said Bandar
was a "special friend" of Mandela and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said there were no formal discussions between the three
men.
</P>
<P>
However, SAPA said, the prince will not be attending the
function in Clinton's honor at the Vergelegen wine estate.
</P>
<P>
Organizers confirmed that Bandar would not be there, although
the president's office did not know the reason for the
last-minute cancellation.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is an important ally of the U.S. in the Middle
East, and is negotiating a huge, but controversial arms deal with
South Africa worth billions of Rand (U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> U.S. Did Shore up Apartheid: Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President
Bill Clinton has admitted that the American government had helped
shore up apartheid in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the remarks in an interview with a U.S.
television station Thursday in Cape Town, which was released to
South African media Friday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "While it is true the American government for
many years... was complicit in the apartheid in South Africa, by
the cooperation with and support of the previous South African
government, it's also true that Americans had a lot to do with
ending apartheid here by the sanctions... that the Congress
eventually put forward at national level."
</P>
<P>
"I think (South African President) Mr. (Nelson) Mandela would
say that Americans of all racial and ethnic backgrounds had a lot
to do with the international climate of opposition to apartheid
in South Africa," claimed the U.S. president.
</P>
<P>
Although both South Africa and the United States were still
dealing with the legacy of apartheid, slavery and racial
discrimination, the focus needed to be on the future, said
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"The only way we can liberate people from the problems of the
past is to focus on tomorrow," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Clinton did not deal with the issue of America's complicity in
shoring up apartheid in his address to parliament Thursday, and
did not address it directly when questioned at a joint press
conference with Mandela Friday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived in Cape Town Thursday morning for a four-day
state visit to South Africa.

<HEADLINE> China to Strengthen Implementation of Taxation Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- China's State Council recently
issued a circular requiring local governments and departments to
strengthen tax administration and carry out state taxation laws to
the letter.
</P>
<P>
The circular stipulated that legislative power over taxation,
both central and local taxes, is the sole domain of the central
government, and no local government or department has the
authority to stipulate or explain taxation policies, nor approve
tax reductions.
</P>
<P>
Administrative power over taxation is under the jurisdiction of
the central government, with the exception of taxes related to
slaughtering animals, banquets and animal husbandry which are
relegated to the jurisdiction of local governments.
</P>
<P>
Local governments are strictly prohibited from changing or
readjusting state taxation laws and policies, and are prohibited
from adopting flexibility when carrying out measures beyond their
defined power for tax administration, according to the circular.
</P>
<P>
Preferential tax collection policies drafted by ethnic
autonomous regions within their realm of authority must be
reported to the appropriate State Council department for the
record and must be in line with the state taxation laws.
</P>
<P>
The circular emphasized that any unit found to be reducing or
exempting taxes without approval, as well all parties and
officials responsible for the case are subject to punishments,
with taxpayers bearing the responsibility to remit unpaid
taxes.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Azerbaijan Agree on Caspian Bed Division </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Azerbaijan and Russia agree that
the oil-rich Caspian Sea bed should be divided, President of
Azerbaijan Geidar Aliyev disclosed Friday, Interfax Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Aliyev said this was achieved through discussions on the legal
status of the Caspian Sea between him and Russian First Deputy
Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov in Baku, Azerbaijan's capital.
</P>
<P>
He also said he backed in principle plans to lay oil
pipeline across the Caspian bed from Azerbaijan and Turkey to the
Mediterranean port of Ceyhan.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Pastukhov hoped that the division could be made
soon so as to avoid any possible negative effect on
investment in the strategic projects in the Sea.
</P>
<P>
Although moving closer to Azerbaijan on the status issue,
Russia still holds different position on oil pipeline building.
</P>
<P>
Pastukhov noted his country is strongly opposed to any plan to
build oil pipelines across the Caspian bed, saying it is equal to
a pirate's act harmful to the economy and ecology.
</P>
<P>
There have been many meetings among leaders of the five Caspian
littoral nations -- Russia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan
and Iran -- over the status issue, but no results have been
achieved so far.
</P>
<P>
All the five claim rights to the oil fields and fishing grounds
of the inland sea.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Significance Attatched to Investment Funds Offering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The recent offering of Kaiyuan
and Jintai closed-end securities investment funds, the first of
their kind in China, was oversubscribed by a factor of 40
as a result of enthusiastic investor response.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts said the successful launch of the new funds
is an indication of the maturation of China's securities market.
</P>
<P>
The two funds, each of which is capitalized at two billion yuan
(240.96 million US dollars), will be invested in shares and
treasury bonds at a ratio of 80:20.
</P>
<P>
An analyst with the Hua-Xia Securities Research Institute said
managers of the funds will protect the interests of investors
above all else. He noted that the new issue has ushered in a
standardized beginning for investment funds in China.
</P>
<P>
Another expert pointed out the new funds not only provide a
good investment opportunity for retail investors, but also
represent a new direction by allowing Party and government
officials to invest.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the China Securities Regulatory Committee said
the new funds will boost the national economy and promote the
sound development of the securities market.
</P>
<P>
The 700-odd companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock
exchanges involve total capitalization approaching 500 billion
yuan, a level which provides a prerequisite for forming a
securities investment fund market.
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth in both individual income levels and savings
deposits has nurtured a strong desire to invest in securities,
and has also provided a strong economic base for investment funds,
according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
The fact that State enterprises will require increased funding
during the process of restructuring will also provide new
opportunities for development of the securities market.
</P>
<P>
Analysts expect the emergence of even more securities
investment funds as conditions mature.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Clinton Meets Sharp Criticism Amid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Liu Yegang Zhao Yi)
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Visiting United States
President Bill Clinton, the first American top leader to visit
South Africa, is probably finding himself in an unexpected
environment surrounded by both hospitality and criticism.
</P>
<P>
Ever since Clinton Thursday landed in Cape Town, the
legislative capital of South Africa, he has enjoyed red-carpet
welcome, a glittering state banquet and received the Order of
Good Hopes, the highest civilian award from South African
President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Mandela spoke highly of Clinton's trip to Africa, which was
described as "historic" and a "high-water mark" in a long list of
visits by foreign heads of state and government leaders.
</P>
<P>
In terms of concrete result of the visit, Clinton said that he
had reached an agreement with Mandela on issues of mass
destruction weapons.
</P>
<P>
Besides, an arms deal between the two countries is also
underway, with the U.S. Defense Department being ready to buy new
South Africa-made de-mining vehicles, which, Clinton said, would
help the United States "immensely".
</P>
<P>
Clinton himself may believe that he has made well preparations
for the African trip. He said that his current visit to Africa
marked a change in U.S. attitude towards this continent from the
handouts of the past to cooperative development in the future.
</P>
<P>
In all speeches made during his stay in Africa so far, Clinton
attached most importance to the U.S.'s Africa Growth and
Opportunity Bill, saying it would increase the access of all
African nations to the American market -- "without conditions".
</P>
<P>
However, looking back on response from top leaders of South
Africa, Clinton's so-called new stance on Africa is far from
being fully appreciated.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.'s Africa Growth And Opportunity Bill, which indicates
a shift in U.S.'s Africa policy from aid to trade, was
unacceptable to South Africa in its current form, Mandela said in
an outspoken speech in a joint press conference with Clinton on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. bill is interpreted by Pretoria leaders that only
countries pursuing free-market economics and democratic politics
will be eligible for the enhanced access to the U.S. market which
it offers.
</P>
<P>
Local press said Mandela apparently told Clinton that although
South Africa would qualify, these provisions could harm African
countries that had less institutional capacity.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to criticize American foreign policy Friday,
Mandela also urged the Clinton Administration to sit down with
its enemies and talk peace, saying "the United States, as the
leader of the world, should set an example to all of us and
eliminate tension throughout the world."
</P>
<P>
Referring to South African foreign policy, Mandela reiterated
that his country would remain loyal to those who had supported
the fight against apartheid, including Cuba, Iran and Libya,
which are regarded by Washington as sponsors of international
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"I am not going to betray the trust of those who helped,"
Mandela said, "anyone who criticized his friendship with Libya
and Cuba could go and jump in the pool."
</P>
<P>
On the eve of Clinton's South African journey, Mandela's
deputy Thabo Mbeki also publicly attacked U.S.'s Africa policy,
saying that a shift in U.S.'s Africa policy from aid to trade,
embodied in the Africa Growth And Opportunity Bill, is wrong.
</P>
<P>
Africa, including South Africa, needed both trade and aid,
Mbeki stressed. The continent needs investment which would allow
its economies to increase their capacity to produce exportable
goods rather than just raw materials.
</P>
<P>
The strategic objective of sustainable development meant that
aid could not be excluded from any framework. South Africa and a
overwhelming majority of African countries still needed
development assistance, Mbeki noted.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Karie Mbuende, Executive Secretary of the Southern
African Development Community said Africa's share of U.S. direct
foreign investment was two percent. There was no justification at
all for such a low figure, given the continent's population and
resources, he said.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here said that what Mandela and Mbeki said
has not only reflected viewpoints of the South African
government, but also that of other countries in the African
continent.
</P>
<P>
The reason for this simple: trade indeed benefits both parties
as they strive to improve the quantity or quality of their
products or services, but how it is possible for the weak and
poor African countries to compete equally with the world's
greatest power before they have obtained minimum financial
support and free themselves from poverty?
</P>
<P>
It is generally believed that South Africa, a political,
economic and military superpower in the continent, is the only
country with the power to keep Clinton's mission in check.
</P>
<P>
In certain sense, success and failure of the U.S. African
policy will be closely related to the attitude of South Africa
towards the policy.
</P>
<P>
It is true that there are differences between Pretoria and
Washington, but one fact should never be ignored, that is both
the U.S. and South Africa expect cooperation.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that there are some 3,000 American companies
doing business in South Africa. The American enterprises have
invested more than two billion U.S. dollars in the country since
demise of apartheid in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Clinton was absolutely right to say that Africa
needs the world while the world needs Africa. But the problem is
that the only superpower in the world must treat other countries,
including all African countries equally and sincerely if it does
not want its "strategic partnership with Africa" to be a wishful
thinking.
</P>
<P>
Observers believed that the U.S.-designed new partnership with
African countries on the surface is claimed to boost development
of the continent, but behind its claims, the White House is
gearing up to compete with other western partners to grab the
biggest political and economic interests in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. global strategy, or rather an ambition, they
asserted, will never be accepted by either African countries or
anyone in other part of the world.

According to the program, an intersectoral group would be
tasked to ensure that legislation on child labor was enforced,
including provisions in the constitution, the Basic Conditions of
Employment Act, and the international Convention on the Rights of
Children.
</P>
<P>
The South African Child Labor Action Program, endorsed by
various government departments, labor unions and businesses
earlier this month, would be ratified in June, The Citizen paper
Saturday quoted labor Chief Director Lisa Seftel as saying.
</P>
<P>
Unveiling the program a day before the Global March Against
Child Labor, Seftel said here on Friday that the task
team, under the Labor Department, will work to assure children
access to education, provide poverty-striken families with
adequate social security, and promote public awareness of the
dangers of child labor.
</P>
<P>
Priority would be given to the immediate removal of children
from the most abusive forms of child labor, such as prostitution
and working on farms.
</P>
<P>
The program defined child labor as work by children under 18
which is exploitative, hazardous or inappropriate for their age,
detrimental to their schooling, or social, physical, mental and
moral development.
</P>
<P>
"Use of child labor slows down economic growth and social
development and reduces employment opportunities for adults,"
Seftel said.
</P>
<P>
The program would also establish rehabilitation programs for
children withdrawn from work.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Provides Assistance to Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations (U.N.) has
pledged an assistance of 12 million U.S. Dollars for food,
shelter, medicine and other needs of people displaced by the war
in Sierra Leone, said a report reaching here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The money will also be used for the repatriation,
rehabilitation and resettlement of refugees, said Francis Okello,
the U.N. secretary-general's special envoy to Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The special envoy said the U.N. has identified various areas
of assistance and has called on various donors to contribute to
the rebuilding of the infrastructure and economy of the
war-ravaged west African country.
</P>
<P>
He, however, stressed that "the immediate concern of the U.N.
is to respond to the basic needs of the people".
</P>
<P>
For the same purpose, the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
has established a Voluntary Trust Fund for Sierra Leone, to which
the United Kingdom has donated two million Pounds Sterling.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Sierra Leonean government
announced Thursday that it is ready to prosecute about 1,400
officials and suspected accomplices of the ousted military junta
of Johnny Paul Koroma.
</P>
<P>
Attorney-General Solomon Berewa said the trial will start
Friday or at the latest, Monday.
</P>
<P>
Berewa said that the Sierra Leonean government has asked the
British to provide the judges for the trial and that "all the
indications from the British government show that they will
provide the judges".
</P>
<P>
In driving out the Koroma regime, the West African
sub-regional peace-keeping force known as ECOMOG has arrested
most members of the Koroma junta.
</P>
<P>
Former S.Leonean President Joseph Momoh, believed to the
mastermind behind Koroma's coup last May, was also arrested in
mid-February.
</P>
<P>
Restored civilian president Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, who promised
national reconciliation upon resuming office on March 10, has
denied the accusation of witchhunting, and assured the prevalence
of justice at the trials.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Calls for Oil Output Cut to Stabilize Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's new Oil Minister
Sheikh Saud Nasser Al-Sabah asserted Saturday that the cut of oil
production is the only way out to stabilize the prices in the
world market.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that our prime objective is to slash production in
order to secure further increases in prices of oil," he said in a
statement to journalists on the eve of leaving for Vienna Sunday
to take part in an emergency OPEC (Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries) meeting.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Saud, who was named Oil Minister in the newly-formed
Kuwaiti government, said in the statement on sidelines of a
parliamentary session that "if we succeed in cutting production
further, the prices of oil will improve further."
</P>
<P>
OPEC members Saudi Arabia and Venezuela as well as non-OPEC
Mexico agreed last Sunday to cut oil production starting on April
1 till the end of this year by 1.6 million to 2 million barrels
per day to boost prices that fell to a nine-year low.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and a number of other OPEC members followed suit in
declaring to cut their oil output in a joint effort to wrest the
price slide. Kuwait, whose OPEC quota was raised to 2.19 million
barrels per day from the start of this year decided to cut oil
production by 125,000 barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices in the world market were reportedly up by two
U.S. dollars a barrel following the joint efforts.
</P>
<P>
OPEC Secretary General Rilwanu Lukman said in London Wednesday
that 11 members from Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle
East would meet as "part of efforts to stabilize the oil market"
following painful price losses in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Saud expressed hope that a policy of decreasing
production would be maintained at the emergency meeting.
</P>
<P>
He also warned the producers against excessive production,
saying "if they produce more oil, they will get less revenues and
this will negatively affect their economy."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait takes up 3 percent of the world oil supply.

<HEADLINE> Model PLA Soldier Remains Respected by Chinese People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- "I would have married Lei Feng if
I had been born several decades earlier," according to an entry a
young Beijing girl named Yang Xiaoxin wrote in the guest book
during a visit to an exhibition on Lei Feng, China's most famous
model of altruism during the 1960s and 1970s.
</P>
<P>
"The Eternal Spirit of Lei Feng Exhibition," considered to be
the largest of its kind over the past three decades, closed here
today after receiving nearly 200,000 domestic and foreign guests
on a one month period.
</P>
<P>
Organizers from northeast China's Liaoning Province readily
acknowledge that the overwhelmingly warm reception from citizens
in the Chinese capital was totally unexpected.
</P>
<P>
They arranged to prolong the exhibition by one day to
symbolically reward local enthusiasm, but contracts in a dozen
other large cities, including Chongqing, Shanghai and Guangzhou,
prevented any further extension of exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Lei Feng, an ordinary soldier of the Chinese People's
Liberation Army (PLA), devoted most of his spare time to helping
others. In 1963, Chairman Mao Zedong wrote an inscription calling
for the entire nation to "Learn From Comrade Lei Feng." Mao penned
the inscription one year after Lei's tragic accidental death at
age 22.
</P>
<P>
China has launched a series of activities during 1998 to mark
the 35th anniversary of Mao's inscription. The popularity of
related activities readily shows that Lei Feng remains as one of
the most respected and adored heroes in the hearts of Chinese
people.
</P>
<P>
A Beijing sociologist noted that, in spite of the great
improvements in the material well-being of Chinese people, the
"Lei Feng Spirit" which underlines altruism and selfless
dedication has gained increasing importance, rather becoming
outdated.
</P>
<P>
"Today's Chinese hope that the spirit of Lei Feng can bring
solutions to some current social problems, such as people's
indifference to each other, confusion in moral standards and
distortion of social values. They also hope that Lei's spirit of
sacrifice and dedication can keep people adversely affected by
reforms and restructuring in a good mood and help avoid social
contradictions," according to the sociologist.
</P>
<P>
His analysis was substantiated by a written message left by a
worker from the Beijing Capital Steel Corporation who visited
"The Eternal Spirit of Lei Feng" exhibition in early March.
</P>
<P>
"In an era of rapid economic growth, it's more important for us
to carry forward the spirit of Lei Feng and fill the world with
care and love," according to the message.
</P>
<P>
One exhibition organizer noted that a large proportion of
the 200,000 visitors were teenagers, with many young students
writing highly emotional entries in the guest book.
</P>
<P>
"Lei Feng will live in our hearts forever. As masters of a new
century, we hope we won't let him down," wrote a middle school
student named Gong Wenting. Gong described herself as "a permanent
learner from Lei Feng."

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Registers Eight Percent Growth Last </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, march 28 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique registered a growth of
eight percent last year and an inflation rate of 5.8 percent,
Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal Mocumbi said.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi made the statement Friday in Maputo, saying that the
figures are seen in the preliminary result of the statistics,
which will be officially made public by the end of April,
Noticias daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Bureaucracy which hampers the effective running of government
machines, is still on the rise, thus affecting the implementation
of the development plan, Mocumbi said.
</P>
<P>
He promised that the reform in the government's public sector,
which slowed down last year, will be speeded up by reshuffling
the government institutions, restructuring the provincial and
central government institutions, and readjusting the wage systems
to give more incentives to civil servants.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the government failed to offer enough help to
the small-and-medium sized enterprises last year and farmers were
neglected in government's programs.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister described external debt as one of the
factors which hampered the economic development of the country.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the international community will
give a positive signal in reducing or remitting debt of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique's debt is reportedly to reach 11 billion U.S.
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank said that even if Mozambique's external debt is
remitted to a targeted 80 percent, the ratio between debt service
and export will remain 25 percent by 2005, which means that the
country should have to depend on external aid in its importation
and budget.
</P>
<P>
Last year Mozambique's export stands at 234 million U.S.
Dollars and import at 1.073 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Suffer Drought Several Months More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Most parts of Vietnam will suffer
from drought for several months more, the Vietnam News reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted an official of the Central Bureau for
Hydro-Meteorology and Weather Forecast as saying that water levels
throughout the country are measuring their lowest in about 20
years, both in rivers and reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
The official said increasing salination of parts of the central
coast and the Mekong Delta and forest fires, combined with the
continuing drought would further threaten the national economy.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, northern farmers are temporarily relieved by
the first showers of the rainy season on Thursday night and Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The current abnormal weather in Vietnam was believed to be
caused by El Nino phenomenon, and the rainy season is expected to
come at least two weeks later than usual.

CAMBERRA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Brazil was humiliated by
Australia again when it lost to the host team 2-1 in Perth,
Australia on Saturday night, the third straight defeat in eight
days in an under-23 series.
</P>
<P>
But Brazil's head coach, Toninho Barroso, put on a smiling face
after his team's loss to Australia, which had won the two earlier
engagements 2-1 and 3-2 in Sydney and Adelaide respectively.
</P>
<P>
"The idea was to play three matches to give our players some
international experience," Barroso said.
</P>
<P>
"We always knew that, with limited preparation, defeat was a
possibility. But it was a great learning experience for the team."
</P>
<P>
Barroso rated the Australians highly, saying coach Raul Blanco
had put together a very good team which could do well in the 2000
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Brazil were only in the early stages of their preparation for
the Olympics and they would become a force, Blanco warned.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 28 (Xinhua) - The Irish National Liberation Army
(INLA) on Saturday admitted murdering former policeman Cyril
Stewart Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The 52-year-old ex-policeman was shot dead by masked gunmen
outside a supermarket car park in the city of Armagh, 50
kilometers southwest of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
The splinter Irish nationalist militant group, which has never
joined in the ceasefire called by Northern Ireland's main
Republican and Protestant guerrilla groups, has been responsible
for a series of bomb and mortar attacks in Armagh in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen people have been murdered since Christmas in
Northern Ireland by rival dissident forces in the divided province.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam called the killing
contemptible and said the murderers would be hunted down.
</P>
<P>
Seamus Mallon, a Catholic nationalist negotiator in the
peace talks, said the killing was designed to provoke the Unionists
into leaving the peace process. He urged the entire community to
condemn the "cowardly act of murder."

<HEADLINE> Turkey Vows to Fight Against Islamic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's National Security
Council (NSC) has reiterated its determination to fight against
Islamic fundamentalist activities in a bid to protect the secular
system in the country.
</P>
<P>
An NSC statement issued late Friday night after a six-hour-long
meeting, which was attended by government high-ranking officials
and military generals, said that "there was necessary good
intention and existing will for the struggle against the mentality
of a group of people who wish to condemn the Turkish people to a
backward day of life."
</P>
<P>
It said the Turkish government and military have reached a
consensus of opinion that religious feelings could not intervene
in state affairs and politics.
</P>
<P>
"It is everybody's duty to protect the basic principles of the
Turkish Republic and even the slightest of concessions in this
matter is out of the question," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
It said that the struggle against the fundamentalist
activities should be carried out within the principles of a
democratic and secular legal state.
</P>
<P>
The military generals reportedly asked Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz to issue governmental decrees to remove fundamentalist
local authorities who are currently serving in their posts.
</P>
<P>
The generals gave Yilmaz a list of those fundamentalist
officials in state organizations, including some governors,
sub-governors, judges and prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
For the past two weeks, the military and Yilmaz had been at
odds over the prime minister's statement that fighting against
fundamentalism was the duty of the civilian rulers of the country
and not the task of the military.
</P>
<P>
However, Yilmaz made a U-turn recently, saying that he would
fight against fundamentalism by preparing draft bills to be sent
to the parliament.

DAR ES SALAAM, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The newly-established Dar
es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE) will start trading shares of
Tanzania Oxygen Limited (TOL) on April 15, local newspaper Dail
Mail said Saturday.

corporations since the end of last year. A share goes at 500
shillings and the minimum one can buy are 10 shares.
</P>
<P>
The listing of TOL, the first company to be registered with
the DSE, will enable shareholders to sell their shares and new
ones to come in through acquisitions at the exchange, Massawe
said.

<P>
The council noted that TOL will start distributing share
certificates to shareholders beginning next Tuesday through
agents who have received application forms from investors. The

NAIROBI, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Kenya Airways has signed a
co-operation agreement with U.S. Northwest Airlines to strengthen
its presence in North America, the Daily Nation quoted an
aviation official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Brian Davies, Managing Director of Kenya Airways, said in a

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Children Call for POWs Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Small girls and boys
representing Kuwaiti children from 14 kindergartens all over
Kuwait Saturday urged the international community to press for
the release of Kuwait's POWs in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In their message to various foreign embassies here, delivered
with yellow flowers symbolizing the absence of their loved ones,
the kindergarten children said it was a "cry to the world for
care and protection."
</P>
<P>
The message said that "we cry loudly to the whole world and
write to them" and "we have a right to care and protection
from fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters who have been
taken away from us for years."
</P>
<P>
The event was organized by an educational forum opened here
last Monday, according to the Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The message urged the world community to work for for the
release and return of those taken away from Kuwait during the
Iraqi invasion in 1990-91.
</P>
<P>
Some of the embassies visited by the children who were
accompanied by their teachers are Saudi Arabia, France,
China, Russia, the United States, Britain, Germany, Syria, Oman,
Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait insisted that 625 people went missing in the final days
of Iraq's seven-month occupation. But Iraq denies it still holds
any POWs it detained at that time.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats from some of the embassies which have received the
message expressed their grave concern over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Ambassador Abou Shneif called on Iraq to solve this
humanitarian issue and comply with all the U.N. Security Council
resolutions, while a French embassy spokesman said that "we are
extending all our efforts to solve this question."
</P>
<P>
There is a specified U.N. resolution concerning the release
of all POWs before the sanctions on Iraq can be lifted.
</P>
<P>
The issue of POWs has been the most emotional one for the
Kuwaitis. So far other bilateral Iraq-Kuwait issues arising from
the occupation, namely, the Iraqi recognition of the
U.N.-demarcated Iraq-Kuwait border and paying compensations
through U.N.-monitored Iraqi oil-sales, have been solved.

<P>
KAMPALA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- New varieties of cocoa have
been bred in Uganda, ''The Monitor'' reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Technical Officer of the cocoa development project, Joseph
Kimera said that the new varieties can produce twice the yield
than traditional ones, such as Upper Amazon and Ameranado, under
Uganda's climate conditions.
</P>
<P>
The traditional varieties usually produce 500 kilograms of
cocoa beans with 1,000 trees on one hectare, while the new
varieties produce 1,000 kilograms, Kimera said. But the density
of the plants of the new varieties must be higher than the
traditional ones, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Kimera, the new varieties prodece bigger beans,
higher butter content and lower shell percentage than the
traditional ones, and ''this enables them to compete favourably
with other varieties on the international market.''

<P>
LAGOS, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's military leader, General

"If he stands for election, we hope that he will stand as a
civilian," Clinton said.

He continued that "there are many military leaders who have
taken over chaotic situations in African countries, but have
moved towards democracy and that can happen in Nigeria. This is
purely and simply what we want to happen."

Clinton's remarks cleared for the first time his country's

<HEADLINE> Russia Readjusts Transportation Fee to Support Oil Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Russia announced Friday that it
will readjust oil transportation fee in a bid to support Russian
oil companies suffering from low world oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Starting from April 1, oil for domestic use will be exempted
from transportation fees, while that for export will only pay half.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government places a number of taxes and fees on oil
producers, including a charge of 3.8 rubles (about 60 cents) for
pumping a ton of oil through 1,000 kilometers of trunk pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Recently, company executives petitioned President Yeltsin to
defer 19 billion rubles (3.2 billion U.S. dollars) in tax leviable
for the first half year to the second half.
</P>
<P>
World oil prices have lately been fluctuating between 15 and 16
U.S. dollars a barrel, down from 19 dollars just a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
Russia, the world's third largest oil producer, after Saudi
Arabia and the United States, has been affected greatly by
decreased oil prices since early 1997.
</P>
<P>
But on Wednesday, Russian Acting Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko rejected an OPEC's suggestion to cut daily oil
production by 13,000 tons in an effort to boost prices.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Gerd Muller, top scorer in the
German 1974 World Cup-winning side, predicted here on Saturday
that defending champions Brazil will not make the final in this
Summer's World Cup finals in France.
</P>
<P>
Muller, on a business tour in China, forcasted that the 1998
World Cup trophy will be vied between European champions Germany
and host nation France.
</P>
<P>
"My intuition told me Brazil would flounder while France will
go crazy. The host team boasts a handful of star players," said
the most prolific striker in the World Cup history.
</P>
<P>
Alongside France and Germany, other two former champions,
England and Italy, would wrap up the last four.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands and Norway, if they have fourtune on their
side, they will go as far as into the semis, Muller said.
</P>
<P>
Muller insisted German have a strong claim for the title,
despite their 1-2 warmpup defeat by Brazil last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As for German captain Jurgen Klinsmann, who is in a poor form
and was brought off in the German-Brazil match, Muller had a high
evaluation.
</P>
<P>
"Klinsmann is still the number one in the current German
soccer. What he need is the time to take a rest and then to prove
that in this summer."

Technical Officer of the cocoa development project, Joseph

than traditional ones, such as Upper Amazon and Ameranado, under
Uganda's climate condItions.
</P>
<P>
The traditional varieties usually produce 500 kilograms of
cocoa beans with 1,000 trees oN one hectare, while the new
varieties produce 1,000 kilograms, Kimera said. But the density
of the plants of the new varieties must be hiGher than the
traditional ones, he addeD.
</P>
<P>
According to Kimera, the new varieties prodece bigger beans,
higher butter content and lower shell percentage t`an the
traditional ones, and ''this enables them to compete favourably
with othep varieties on the international market.'' EnditeM

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Hopes OPEC Meeting Would Stabilize Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia hopes that the
extraordinary meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) in Vienna on March 30 would result in the
stabilization of the world oil market, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
The world oil price will rise to a higher level if a balance
between oil demand and supply could be achieved, Minister for
Mines and Energy Kuntoro Mangkusubroto said here before leaving
for Vienna Saturday evening to attend the OPEC meeting.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, which will also be attended by representatives
of non-OPEC oil producing nations, would try to lower their
production quotas in order to boost the oil price which has
dropped to a record low of 10 U.S. dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
On Indonesia's position on the price level, Kuntoro said he
could not expect any drastic increase as the price would be set by
a market mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has set its price at 17 U.S. dollars per barrel for
the state budget calculation. "If the price could reach above 17
U.S. dollars per barrel, then it would benefit Indonesia," said
the minister.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Kuntoro announced that Indonesia had decided to
cut its oil output by 70,000 barrel per day (bpd) to 1.39 million
bpd starting April 1.
</P>
<P>
OPEC members had earlier agreed to lower their oil output to
25.033 million bpd from 27.5 million bpd as agreed upon at the
Jakarta meeting last November.
</P>
<P>
The announcement has made oil prices soar to 16 dollars per
barrel.
</P>
<P>
OPEC oil supplies now account for about 40 percent of the
world's total output of 75 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
OPEC members are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya,
Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and
Venezuela.

<HEADLINE> 107 Detained in Malaysia for Fight over Temple- </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Police have detained 107
people for interrogation following the fight Friday over the
temple and mosque issue in Kampung Rawa in Pulau Pinang, police
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Following the incident, police seized 28 molotov cocktails and
30 pieces of sharp weapons and choppers in several areas near the
scene, Pulau Pinang State Police Chief Abdul Hamid Mustapha told a
news conference Saturday in Pulau Pinang, according to the
Malaysian national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Hamid said that there was no loss of lives as claimed and
only nine people were reported injured in the incident which
involved a group from the mosque and another from the adjacent
temple.
</P>
<P>
The residents of Kampung Rawa reportedly fought over proximity
of an extended temple to the local mosque.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Hamid urged outsiders not to go there to participate,
watch or sympathize with any of the parties involved.
</P>
<P>
Police beefed up security in the state. The public was
prohibited from assembling in areas around mosques, chapels and
temples with any reason to avoid any misconception, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said police had canceled permits to hold rallies and those
intending to do so should shelve their plans until such time as
the situation permitted it.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who rushed to
the state Friday after being informed of the fight, said the
matter had been settled.
</P>
<P>
Anwar has reminded Malaysians not to be dictated by "laws of
the jungle" when erecting places of worship in their respective
communities.
</P>
<P>
Construction of mosques, temples and shrines would require
approval of the authorities, Anwar said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to Bernama, Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Saturday in Grik in the northern state of
Perak, that the situation in Malaysia was calm and peaceful
despite some misunderstanding between two races in Pulau Pinang
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir, who is also Home Minister, said communal problems in
Malaysia were confined to certain places only and did not involve
people from other areas.
</P>
<P>
"We value the peace and harmony prevailing in this country
although we have people from various races," he was quoted as
saying.

<HEADLINE> HK Enhances Action to Reintegrate Young Offenders into Community </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 28 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong government official
said here Saturday that the government has adopted an action plan
to implement a package of recommendations proposed by a
consultancy study to help young inmates reintegrate into the
community as law-abiding citizens.
</P>
<P>
Chang King-yiu, deputy secretary for security of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR), said that the plan gives an
impetus to the rehabilitation programs and services run by the
Correctional Services Department (CSD) and the Social Welfare
Department (SWD).
</P>
<P>
The 30 sets of recommendations were commissioned by the
Standing Committee on Young Offenders under the Fight Crime
Committee and conducted by the City University of Hong Kong. It
was completed last August.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations cover a wide range of services by CSD and
SWD including educational and vocational training, service for
families of young offenders, community reintegration,
through-care, probation service, community service order, half-way
house, community support service scheme and a proposed short-term
residential treatment program.
</P>
<P>
"It is hoped that the implementation of the recommendations
would enhance our rehabilitation programs and services and help
young offenders reintegrate into society as law-abiding citizens,"
Chang said.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Enjoys High Degree of Autonomy: Secretary for Home Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 28 (Xinhua) -- All signs since Hong Kong's
return to China have indicated that Hong Kong is successfully
realizing the concept of "Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong" and a
high degree of autonomy, a senior Hong Kong government official
said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
David Lam, secretary for home affairs of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR), said Saturday in a letter to his son
that the SAR government deserves a pat on the back as Financial
Secretary Donald Tsang was able to announce last month the most
generous budget in Hong Kong's history while the neighboring
countries were struggling just to stay afloat due to the recent
Asian financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
In his "Letter from Hong Kong" broadcast Saturday at the Hong
Kong Radio Television to his son Kenneth who is now in Japan, Lam
said that the SAR government is now putting more stock in
cultivating, especially among the young, a sense of belonging to
Hong Kong and feeling for the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The government takes every opportunity to encourage the
citizenry to acquaint themselves with the Basic Law and how its
provisions relate to their daily lives, Lam said.
</P>
<P>
"We are re-establishing our roots while strictly maintaining
the policy of 'one country, two systems' and 'Hong Kong people
ruling Hong Kong'," he added.
</P>
<P>
Lam recalled that before the handover, the media were awash
with warnings and predictions of curtailment on the human rights
front and that the days for Hong Kong's way of life are numbered.
</P>
<P>
"But events since then have given the lie to such pessimism and
it's not likely that we would ever need to put a single
pro-democracy or human rights in jail for their beliefs," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Lam said that whatever doubts the human rights activists might
still harbor should reasonably be dispelled to a large extent by a
milestone development last November when the Central Government
declared that it would allow Hong Kong to submit its own reports
to the United Nations under the International Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights.
</P>
<P>
"To me, a more meaningful litmus test as to how we measure up
is the first Legislative Council elections of the SAR on May 24.
Again, I have been in the thick of things to ensure its success,"
Lam said.
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt that we should demonstrate to the world at
large our undoubted ability to run our own affairs independently
and efficiently, and win over more critics who still harbor any
foreboding regarding our individual rights and freedoms," Lam
concluded.

<HEADLINE> GCC to Review Formation of Body for Power Grid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 28 (Xinhua) -- A GCC committee is expected
to offer options in September for the formation of an authority
overseeing the integration of the power grids of the six members,
the Kuwaiti News Agency reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The committee will submit its options to a ministerial meeting
of the Gulf Cooperation Council due in September to discuss the
issue, Saudi Minister of Industry and Electricity Hashim Bin
Abdullah Bin Hashim Yamani was quoted by the news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
But he did not specify the options proposed by the committee.
</P>
<P>
The power grid link-up project aimed at lowering the costs
in economic operations of the six states was initially agreed upon
in the 1995 GCC summit and finally endorsed in the 1997 summit.
</P>
<P>
The project of integrating the power grids of the six states,
namely Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain and the United
Arab Emirates, is expected to be completed in two stages over six
years.
</P>
<P>
In the first stage over four years, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
Bahrain and Qatar will link up their power networks, while the UAE
and Oman will go with them in the second stage.
</P>
<P>
The fund of the project's first phase is estimated at 1.78
billion U.S. dollars, of which 35 percent will be from by the
governments of the four states, while the rest will be obtained
through bank loans.
</P>
<P>
The first stage will start after the authority is set up, the
Saudi minister said.

<HEADLINE> Inspections of Iraq's Northern Presidential Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 28 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Arms inspectors and senior
diplomats set out Saturday morning for Iraq's northern province
Salahuddin to continue their inspection mission, diplomatic
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Inspectors and diplomats will spend three days in Salahuddin,
President Saddam Hussein's home province, inspecting three
presidential sites there, namely, Tikrit, Tharthar and Jabal
Makhul, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
After that, they will go further northward to inspect Mosul
presidential site.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday and Friday, U.N. inspectors, accompanied by senior
diplomats from different countries, inspected the Radwaniyah
presidential palace in the suburb of Baghdad, where they received
full cooperation from the Iraqi side.
</P>
<P>
So far, they have found no prohibited weapons in the
Radwaniyah presidential site, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz last month, Iraq
agrees to open its eight presidential sites previously off-limits
to U.N. inspections.
</P>
<P>
A special group of senior diplomats appointed by Annan and
arms experts from the U.N. Special Commission in charge of
eliminating weapons of mass destruction in Iraq (UNSCOM) and the
International Atomic Energy Agency, headed by Sri Lankan Jayanatha
Dhanapala, was assigned to carry out the mission.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. surveyors, all the eight Iraqi presidential
sites cover an area of 31.5 square kilometers, including 10
square kilometers of water surface.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler said there are 1,058 buildings
in the eight presidential sites, and the first round of
inspections of these sites would take about two weeks.

LONDON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Irish republican guerrillas are
suspected to have shot dead a former police officer in the
Northern Ireland city of Armagh, police said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Police said Cyril Stewart, who retired from a 18-year police
service last year, was shot Friday with several bullets in close
range while leaving a supermarket with his wife.
</P>
<P>
No body has claimed responsibility so far but suspicion fell on
the breakaway Irish militants who oppose current efforts to end
the 30 years of conflict in the British-ruled province.

Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam, who described
Stewart's killing as contemptible, pledged that the gunmen would
be vigorously pursued.

Feuding pro-Irish and pro-British guerrilla factions have
carried out a dozen of revenge killings since last Christmas,

<P>
TEHRAN, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi left here Saturday for Damascus for a four-day official
visit to Syria and Lebanon, the Iranian official news agency IRNA
reported.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Damascus and Beirut, Kharrazi is to discuss
the latest regional developments as well as bilateral relations
with senior Syrian and Lebanese officials, the report said,
adding that he would focus his talks on "Israeli aggression
against regional countries and the critical situation in southern
Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
Tension increased between Israel and its Arab neighbors, as the
Middle East peace process has been stalled for more than one year
due to the hard-line stance of the Israeli Likud government.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government recently put forward its proposal of
conditional withdrawal from Lebanon, but it was rejected by
Lebanon which stressed for unconditional Israeli withdrawal from
south Lebanon under U.N. Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
Iran has observed its opposition against the Middle East peace
process though it announced not to intervene in the process.
However, observers believed that during his visit, Kharrazi would
try to urge Syria and Lebanon not to come to terms with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Tehran claimed that it was no use to talk with Israel because
it "naturally pursues aggressive and expansionist policy against
Muslim nations."

COLOMBO, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan Government plans
to import coconuts from Thailand for local consumption since Thai
coconuts are now cheaper consequent to the depreciation of the
Thai Baht.
</P>
<P>
The government also plans to increase the desiccated coconut
production to earn foreign exchange for the country while reducing
the consumption of local coconut, according to the Plantation
Industries Ministry sources here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka is the only country that produces high quality
desiccated coconut, said the sources, adding that this is the
right time for the country to exploit the market to earn more
foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Coconut, tea and rubber are three leading export items of Sri
Lanka, but desiccated coconut production has decreased recently
years.
</P>
<P>
Under a coconut developing program, more than 11,000 acres have
been cultivated which will help increase coconut production, the
sources added.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Completion of Program Review For </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has approved the completion of the final review of a program
supported by a financing arrangement under the Extended Fund
Facility for the Philippines, the Presidential Office said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, the office said that the IMF made
the approval Friday in Washington, and with the completion of the
final review, the Philippines will be able to get a disbursement
of 245.95 million SDR (special drawing rights) (331.4 million U.S.
dollars) in IMF resources on April 1.
</P>
<P>
Parallel financing from Japan Eximbank will also be made
available, it said.
</P>
<P>
These resources will be used to build up the international
reserves of the central bank which had declined following efforts
to stem severe pressure on the peso in the wake of the Asian
financial crisis, the office said.
</P>
<P>
The financing arrangement, which was approved on June 24, 1994,
was originally due to expire in June 1997, but had to be extended
to allow the completion of the comprehensive tax reform package
and the restoration of the deregulation of the oil sector.
</P>
<P>
These reforms are now being implemented and with macro-economic
performance also broadly on track, all conditions for the final
review were observed, the presidential office said.
</P>
<P>
Expressing full support to the country's 1998-99 economic
program, the IMF also approved the country's request for a
two-year precautionary stand-by arrangement, the office said,
</P>
<P>
Under the new arrangement, the government is authorized to draw
on a stand-by credit equivalent to 1,021 million SDR (1.371
million dollars) over a two-year period, the office said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the government intends to use the credit only if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
The most immediate objective of the 1998-99 program is to
restore confidence in the peso and to contain the impact of the
Asian crisis on the economy.

<HEADLINE> Ross Presents Modification of U.S. Peace Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Middle East Peace Envoy
Dennis Ross has offered modification of a U.S. peace plan aimed at
breaking the deadlock in the peace talks between the Israelis and
Palestinians, according to the Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Ross met with Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President
Yasser Arafat for three hours late Friday night in the West Bank
city of Ramallah after he held four-hour talks with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem earlier.
</P>
<P>
After the meetings, Ross told reporters that some modifications
of the plan have been made and presented to Netanyahu and
Arafat. But he did not specify the modifications.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has reportedly outlined an initiative calling on
Israel to pull back troops from 13.1 percent of the West Bank in
several phases over three months, with each withdrawal to be met
by Palestinian fulfillment of commitments to fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
But Israel has said the withdrawal scope set in the U.S. plan
is unacceptable and that it would hand over no more than 9 percent
of the West Bank to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinians have called for a far-reaching and
significant Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, insisting that
under a U.S. mediated agreement, Israel should have three
pullbacks by summer this year.
</P>
<P>
Ross arrived here Thursday night to persuade Israel and the
Palestinians to accept the U.S. initiative. He will hold a second
meeting with Netanyahu Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Two Records Fall at Speed Skating Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CALGARY, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Olympic gold medalists Gianni
Romme and Gunda Niemann-Stirnemann bettered their world records on
the first day of the world single distance speed skating
championships here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Romme, who won two golds in world record time at last month's
Nagano Games, shaved 0.71 of a second off his 5,000 meters mark.
</P>
<P>
In the women's 3,000 meters, Niemann-Stirnemann of Germany
slashed more than three seconds off the record she set two weeks
ago in Heerenveen, the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
In the other championship decided, Canadian Catriona LeMay-Doan
won the 500 meters to cap a brilliant season.
</P>
<P>
Romme opted to reign in his normally aggressive start after
watching Dutch teammate Rintje Ritsma and Bart Veldkamp of Belgium
fade in an earlier pairing after fast starts.
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't my usual type of race, but it worked out," said
Romme, who clocked 6:21.49 to lower his old mark of 6:22.20.
</P>
<P>
Ritsma was second in 6:25.55 with Veldkamp taking third.
</P>
<P>
Niemann-Stirnemann, skating in the last pairing with teammate
Claudia Pechstein, watched another German, Anni Friesinger, come
within 0.78 of a second of matching her record before she stepped
to the start line herself.
</P>
<P>
"That was motivation for me," said Niemann-Stirnemann, who led
a German 1-2-3 sweep with a stunning time of 4:01.67 to smash her
mark of 4:05.08. Pechstein was second in 4:04.78, with Friesinger
third in 4:05.86.
</P>
<P>
In the women's 500, LeMay-Doan added the world championship
title to her Olympic and World Cup crowns with a combined time of
1:15.59 despite a false start in her first race.
</P>
<P>
Svetlana Zhurova of Russia was second in 1:16.65, with Japan's
Tomomi Okazaki third in 1:16.68.
</P>
<P>
Olympic silver medalist Susan Auch had to settle for fourth
after a faulty starter's gun failed to signal a false start before
Auch, paired with LeMay-Doan in the first race, had skated 30
meters down the ice.
</P>
<P>
LeMay-Doan stopped sooner when she heard the official's
substitute whistle.
</P>
<P>
Auch placed sixth in the first race, but rebounded in the
second to pull up to fourth.

of clear directions following the uncertainties in the currency
movement.
</P>
<P>
March south expired on Thursday and ended at 2,210 ringgit
(about 620.78 U.S. dollars) per ton and April south ended at 2,220
ringgit (about 623.59 U.S. dollars) per ton on Friday.
</P>
<P>
March south ended last week at 2,265 ringgit (about 636.23 U.S.
dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
The CPO physicals is anticipated to hover around the current
level due to the currency factor, with prices unlikely to drop as
the commodity was still enjoying good demand, a dealer said.

barely changed with thin volume traded and most of the tin
absorbed by local players.

dollars) and 19.85 ringgit (about 5.57 U.S. dollars) per kg, and

closing price.
</P>
<P>
Accumulated turnover declined to 184 tons against last week's
turnover of 294 tons.
</P>
<P>
The tin price on KLTM is anticipated to hover around the
current level next week influenced by the ringgit factor as well
as the London Metal Exchange performance (LME), a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
Next week will also likely see foreign players returning to the
market, the dealer added, anticipating the LME to trend higher
next week.
</P>
<P>
On the local rubber market this week, there were lack of
demands in anticipation of buyers seeking for SMR 20 from
Indonesia and Thailand which were offering cheaper rubber.
</P>
<P>
Small quantities of SMR 20 were seen traded to places such as
Dubai, Europe, Taipei and South Korea this week.
</P>
<P>
April RSS One ended the week at 269.50 sen (about 75.70 U.S.
cents) per kg against last week's close at 279.00 sen (about 78.37
U.S. cents) per kg while SMR 20 closed at 266.50 sen (about 74.86
U.S. cents) per kg against last week's close at 271.50 sen (about

Malaysia/Singapore cents per kg against 191 cents per kg on March
19.
</P>
<P>
The five-day moving average stood at 188.32 cents against
193.85 cents last week.
</P>
<P>
Rubber prices will undergo some technical adjustments next week
in order to make the local rubber more attractive to buyers, a
dealer said.

</P>
<P>
The program consists of three parts, namely, a short and
medium-term economic plan, a plan for administrative reforms and a
plan for adopting EU standards throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
It has not only defined Romania's priorities in short and

Romania forwarded its application in June 1996 for EU
membership, and was incorporated into EU expansion process last
December.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Kuala Lumpur Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Share prices on the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) closed the week lower as investors
did not respond that well to the new measures announced by the
government to revive the Malaysian economy.
</P>
<P>
The economic package to stimulate the economy announced by
Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on Tuesday and State Bank's
1997 Annual Report released on Wednesday failed to spark further
market activities.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said investors had expected a further belt
tightening measures from the government.
</P>
<P>
This week, the Composite Index closed 3.62 points lower at
727.62, the all Main Board Emas Index eased 1.47 points to 184.09,
the Industrial Index shed 1.76 points to 1,306.11, and the second
board index fell 3.5 points to 181.71.
</P>
<P>
The main board turnover shrunk to 857.898 million shares worth
2.152 billion ringgit (about 603.646 million U.S. dollars) from
1.022 billion shares valued at 2.594 billion ringgit (about
727.629 million U.S. dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
The second board volume declined to 91.094 million shares worth
246.792 million ringgit (about 69.226 million U.S. dollars) from
last week's 109.982 million shares valued at 280.501 million
ringgit (about 78.682 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Off-market turnover also fell to 53.994 million shares worth
202.994 million ringgit (about 56.94 million U.S. dollars) from
last week's 59.387 million shares valued at 185.039 million
ringgit (about 51.904 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Two counters were listed on the KLSE second board this week.
Jeweler Habib Corporation recorded a premium of 18 sen from its
offer price of 2.60 ringgit and closed the week at 2.37 ringgit
while engineering-based Astral Asia which opened at par with its
offer price of 2.50 ringgit closed the week at 2.59 ringgit.
</P>
<P>
On a sectorial basis, consumer products accounted for 32.855
million shares traded on the main board, industrial 72.991 million
shares, construction 114.151 million shares, trading/services
189.207 million shares, infrastructure 4.211 million shares,
finance 208.332 million shares, hotels 1.978 million shares,
properties 78.058 million shares, plantations 23.292 million
shares, mining 4.822 million shares, trusts 493,003 shares,
closed/fund 421,000 shares, loans 20.087 million shares and
Transferable Subscription Rights/warrant 106.997 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the KLSE is anticipated to stabilize next week
following the trend of the steadier ringgit which closed the week
at 3.5650/6150 against the U.S. dollar from last week's close at
3.6450/50.
</P>
<P>
They said the market would look at the stabilized ringgit for
leads and interest would be focused on companies which are
anticipated to announce more corporate exercises.
</P>
<P>
However, the analysts said investors are cautious on whether
State Bank's plan for the merger of finance companies would be
realized ahead of the March 31 deadline.

<HEADLINE> More Tourists Visit Bangladesh Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Over 182,000 tourists came to
Bangladesh last year, representing an increase of 9.97 percent
over that of the previous year, press reports said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange earnings from tourism during the first seven
months of 1997 were recorded at 1.123 billion taka (about 24.4
million U.S. dollars) as against 1.401 billion taka (about 30.4
million dollars) during the whole year of 1996.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the growth in tourist arrivals was 6.18 percent, and
in foreign exchange earnings from the sector was 46.69 percent.
</P>
<P>
Nearly one-third of the tourists coming to Bangladesh last year
were from India, with the rest from Britain with some 28,000
visitors, the United States with over 12,000 visitors, and some
other countries.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation, the country's
major tourism service, attributed the growth in tourist arrivals
to increased exposure of the country in the world through economic
and trade links, and its relatively stable political climate.
</P>
<P>
The government has planned to invest 2 billion taka (about 43.5
million dollars) to build hotels, restaurants, and other tourist
facilities in the country's southeastern hill districts following
the end of an over two-decade insurgency there. It is also
planning to develop exclusive tourist zones in several prospective
sites for foreign tourists, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Hopes to Resume OSCE Membership Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia hopes to resume full membership in OSCE, and is ready
to cooperate equally with the organization, Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic spoke with visiting Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw
Geremek, who is also the current chairman of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Tanjug news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Answering Geremek's question on whether Belgrade will welcome
the visit by the OSCE special envoy, former Spanish Premier Felipe
Gonzalez, Milosevic said it depends on his mission.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade will refuse to accept the special envoy if he comes
for the Kosovo issue, which Milosevic called an internal affair of
Serbia. But Gonzalez will be welcome if he comes to fence-mend the
Yugoslav-OSCE relations, Milosevic said.
</P>
<P>
Geremek also met with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin
Yovanovic and the Yugoslav parliamentary foreign affairs
commission Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the news conference following the meeting, Geremek described
his trip as preparation for the coming visit of Gonzalez, on
behalf of the OSCE, to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The mission of Gonzalez, Geremek said, is to help Yugoslavia
return to the international community and rehabilitate its
membership in the OSCE.
</P>
<P>
On the Kosovo issue, Geremek said the OSCE considers dialogue
the only choice. He added that he will convey the OSCE's viewpoint
to ethnic Albanians when he meets Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova.

according to a Myanmar official information sheet released
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Venezula Urges OPEC to Revoke Quotas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan Energy and Mines
Minister Erwin Arrieta Friday urged the Organization of Petrol
Exporting Countries (OPEC) to revoke the quota system at the
special ministerial meeting next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Describing the system as obsolete in a televised speech, the
minister pressed OPEC to study the fact that 70 percent of oil
exports are under the control of non-OPEC countries.
</P>
<P>
The non-OPEC oil producers have a growing impact on
international oil trade and the recent oil price collapse is
evidence, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the the upcoming special ministerial meeting will most
probably work out measures to raise OPEC oil prices to 16-18
U.S. dollars per barrel this year and to 21 dollars per barrel
within a few years.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and non-OPEC member Mexico signed an
agreement on March 20 in order to cut the world oil output by 1.6
million to two million barrels a day to raise oil prices. A
barrel of crude oil rose to over 15 dollars just after the
announcement of the deal.

<HEADLINE> Forest Fires Threaten Elephants in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Forest fires are threatening
elephants at the elephant hospital and conservation center in
Lampang, northern Thailand, a newspaper report said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lampang Governor Chalermphol Pratheepavanich said officials
concerned were standing on high alert to protect Doi Khun Tarn
National Park where the elephant hospital and conservation center
are situated.
</P>
<P>
"They have made firebreaks surrounding the places. There should
be no problem if there is fire in the national park," Chalermphol
said.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that the real concern stemmed from the drought
which was drying up both natural and man-made water resources
necessary for elephants.
</P>
<P>
"Water resources which used to survive elephants through summer
are drying up quickly and this is supposed to affect the animals,"
the Bangkok Post quoted Chalermphol as saying.
</P>
<P>
The elephant conservation center is keeping over 50 elephants
and the hospital is treating seven.
</P>
<P>
The heat resulting from the fires had raised the day
temperature above 40 degrees Celsius in the area and could cause
sudden death of elephants, especially those that once dragged logs
in forests.
</P>
<P>
The fires that have been raging for nearly a month were
damaging the once-dense forests and also affecting other animals
like deer and hornbills, conservationists said.

<HEADLINE> Lithuania: Joining NATO Is Guarantee to Its Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 27 (Xinhua) -- It is a fundamental guarantee of
security for Lithuania to join the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus told
Interfax news agency Friday.
</P>
<P>
Adamkus made the remark when he received troops and military
officials from Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia for a joint military
exercise in northwest Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
There will be a guarantee of security for Lithuania only when
the Baltic and Europe are at peace and stable, he said.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining good and friendly ties with neighboring countries,
particularly with Russia, is essential to Lithuania's security,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Adamkus said the country should further strengthen its own
military armed forces to protect its sovereignty and territorial
integrity.
</P>
<P>
The one-week joint Baltic military drill involving hundreds of
military personnel started on March 22.

<HEADLINE> Cuba to Reject U.S. Aid If Sanctions Remain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto
Robaina said Friday that Havana would reject all U.S. humanitarian
aid as long as Washington maintained its sanctions on Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The visiting minister told Italy's ANSA news agency Friday that
it was unacceptable to receive U.S. humanitarian assistance while
sanctions on Havana remained in place.
</P>
<P>
To do so, he said, would be "humiliating for our people."
</P>
<P>
He added that the only way toward genuine humanitarian aid was
to lift the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton announced on March 20 that
Washington would permit a resumption of direct humanitarian
charter flights to Cuba as part of measures easing sanctions
imposed on Cuba in 1959.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Robaina held talks with Italian Foreign
Minister Lamberto Dini on bilateral relations. Dini voiced his
appreciation for Havana's recent moves to strengthen ties with
other Latin American countries.

<HEADLINE> China to Strengthen Checks on Logging Quota </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The State Forestry Administration
will put forward a scheme before May to tighten annual checks over
the implementation of logging quotas, according to today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
It is also drafting a set of regulations on logging control
which is expected to be enacted next year by the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Logging quotas were introduced in 1987. But random checks in
1995 and 1996 and a formal check last year indicated that
enforcement was loose.
</P>
<P>
The new scheme, involving random checks, is intended to ensure
that the real situation is reported.
</P>
<P>
The administration is trying to raise funds for the checks,
which will cost six to seven million yuan a year.
</P>
<P>
The regulations being drafted are expected to add punitive
measures.
</P>
<P>
The local government, not just forestry departments, will be
responsible for the implementation of the quota.
</P>
<P>
China now gives equal attention to afforestation and
preservation, rather than formerly focusing solely on
afforestation.
</P>
<P>
Checks last year showed that unlicensed logging is common.
Fewer than 20 percent of loggers had licenses in seven of the 12
counties which were checked.

<P>
PANAMA CITY, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IADB) has granted an 18.9 million U.S. dollar
loan to Panama to improve its judicial services and guarantee the
independence of judicial power.
</P>
<P>
The bank announced Friday that the Supreme Court, the Attorney
General's office and the Procuratorship of the Administration of
Panama will use the funds to finance programs to guarantee due
process of law and remove barriers preventing public access to
justice.
</P>
<P>
The Procuratorship of the Administration will receive the
necessary assistance to hasten institutional changes, expand
services, provide training and implement reform in administrative
guidelines, and to improve staff quality, efficiency and fairness.
</P>
<P>
The program will strengthen investigative capabilities of the
attorney general's office, reduce the number of pending cases,
improve judicial careers and provide training for judges.
</P>
<P>
The bank also plans to turn judicial courts of San Miguelito in
the province of Panama and in the province of Chiriqui in the
southwest of the country, into model regional units that will
provide juridical assistance to the victims of crimes.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian judicial system has been criticized by the U.S.
State Department in its yearly report to the Congress. It claims
the Panamanian judicial system is inefficient and slow, and
operates under political pressure and influence.

<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- International Finance Corp.
(IFC), the World Bank's private-sector financing arm, Friday
signed an unprecedented cooperation project involving a Chinese
non-State financing house.
</P>
<P>
The deal covers a 30-million US dollars loan arranged by IFC

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Albanians Agree to Talk With Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova agreed Friday to start unconditional dialogues with the
government of the Republic of Serbia in the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim, leader of the Democratic Alliance of Kosovo, said at a
news conference in Pristina, Kosovo's capital, that he accepts the
Contact Group's proposal to start unconditional talks with
Belgrade to prevent the situation from deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
The international community has been deeply concerned over the
bloody conflict in Kosovo between the Albanian separatist "Kosovo
Liberation Army" and the Serbian police since February.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of the six-nation Contact Group met on March
9 in London and March 25 in Bonn. They urged the Serbian and
Yugoslav federal authorities to solve the disputes with ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo through political talks.
</P>
<P>
Rugova previously refused to talk with the Serbian government
delegation, which arrived in Pristina on March 12. He said he
would never give up the struggle for the independence of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and other Western countries have put pressure on
Serbia and Yugoslavia, which encouraged the Kosovo Albanian
leaders to take a tough position on the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
Rugova's acceptance of political talks is the result of the
change of position in Western countries, which have softened their
attitude to Belgrade and are now putting pressure on both Belgrade
and Pristina.
</P>
<P>
Albanian-dominated Kosovo is situated in the southern part of
the Serbian section of Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Army Sides With Belgrade Over Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav army is firmly
behind Belgrade in all efforts it makes to solve the Kosovo issue,
a press chief of the army said Friday.
</P>
<P>
General Gradimir Zivanovic told a news conference that
Yugolavia believes the problem of Kosovo "must be resolved by
political means, by dialogue and exclusively within a Serbian
framework."
</P>
<P>
The army's intervention coincided with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic's refusal to a mediation effort by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
Zivanovic said the Serbian authorities constitute a legitimate
framework for the settlement of the Kosovo problem without foreign
meddling.
</P>
<P>
He rejected any "secession of modification of the frontiers of
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
The general also condemned the "terrorism" in Kosovo. He said
the army supported "all activities deployed with the intention of
eradicating terrorism in Kosovo, the same way it is done
throughout the world -- energetically and without mercy. "
</P>
<P>
He said the Yugoslav army did not join the Serb Interior
Ministry in its crackdown on the "terrorism" in Kosovo because the
Constitution has not authorized the army to do so.
</P>
<P>
Albanian-dominated Kosovo is located in the southern part of
the Serbian section of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Serb police four weeks ago began a "crackdown" on ethnic
Albanians who have been seeking independence or at least a much
larger measure of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade is now under mounting pressure from U.S.-led
international community to resolve the Kosovo problem.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Gov't Okays Megawati's Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
given the green light to the ousted leader of the Indonesian
Democratic Party (PDI) Megawati Sukarnoputri to re-contest the
party's leadership at a congress next June, official Antara News
Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Home Affairs Minister R. Hartono said here Friday: "go ahead."
</P>
<P>
Many PDI members have been widely tipped to replace incumbent
PDI leader Soerjadi who is not ready to be re-elected.
</P>
<P>
Megawati, elder daughter of late Indonesian President Sukarno,
was elected PDI chief for the 1993-1998 term at a congress in
Jakarta in December 1993, but was later ousted from the top post
at a controversial congress in Medan, North Sumatra, on June
20-22, 1996, which elected Soerjadi the party's chief.
</P>
<P>
The move to oust Megawati by Soerjadi and some other PDI
members got strong support from the government.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the government only recognized the Soerjadi-led PDI
which suffered a disastrous defeat in the general election last
may.
</P>
<P>
Hartono said the government ensured that the PDI's planned
congress would proceed smoothly.
</P>
<P>
"What kind of help it (PDI) wants, we will give, but the help
should not necessarily mean intervention," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also gave assurances that there would be no pressures or
directives from state officials to the participants of the
forthcoming congress.

<HEADLINE> 40 Rebels killed in northern Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Government troops have killed
around 40 Tamil rebels in Mankulam town in Northern Province of
Sri Lanka during the past four days, the official Daily News
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Field commanders involved in the operations told the paper
Friday that only seven soldiers of the "Jaya Sikuru" (Sure of
Victory) troops had suffered minor injuries in the operations.
</P>
<P>
The commander said the morale of the troops was very high.
Towards the east of Mankulam town, the troops had proceeded nine
kilometers north of the town, he added.
</P>
<P>
The troops who launched the Jaya Sikuru operations in an effort
to capture the highway that links the government-held Vavuniya to
kilinochchi in further north, a vital supply route to the north,
had proceeded nine kilometers north of Mankulam town.
</P>
<P>
According army sources, there were around 600-700 rebels
entrenched in the town, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said it was to government troops' advantage if the
rebels continued to defend the town, as the military would then be
in a position to inflict more casualties in the rebel camp.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels have been fighting for a 15-year war against
the government for a separate state in the north and east of the
country.

MANILA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- At least 27 forest fires were
raging in the southwest Philippine province of Palawan and
hundreds of hectares of forest have been eaten up, reports by the
Philippine press said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Manila Bulletin newspaper reported that the origin of the
fires is still unknown but environmental officials said they were
probably caused by poor slash-and-burn farmers who lost control
over the flames due to the dry season.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that some fires in Palawan were reported last
week while other fires started this week.
</P>
<P>
Government and private organizations have joined hands in
fighting the fires which have already eaten up hundreds of
hectares of forest, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Manila Standard newspaper quoted local officials as saying
that the fires have affected at least 1,000 to 1,500 hectares of
forest and five mountain villages in the province.
</P>
<P>
The fires are also threatening some of the world's rarest and
most endangered animals on the island of Palawan, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Palawan Island is home to some of the most endangered species
of animals such as the mouse deer, the bear cat and the tarsier,
the world's smallest primates.

LONDON -- British scientists have identified blood cells in the

Researchers from Britain's Oxford University have shown that
the more of the fighter cells, known as cytotoxic T-lymphocytes
(CTLs), there are in the blood, the lower the levels of HIV will
be.

HIV infects white blood cells normally protecting people
against disease. It weakens the immune system to such an extent
that patients often die of infections they would normally be able
to fight off. (UK-AIDS-Fighter Cell)

MOSCOW -- A number of Russian deputy prime ministers,
ministries and other federal agencies will be cut, acting Deputy
Prime Minister Ivan Rybkin said Friday.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the reason of government's reduction is
that the functions of several government structures overlap with
the Prosecutor General's Office and the Justice Ministry.
</P>
<P>
According to him, after the reform of the government, the
ministers will bear the bulk of the responsibility. All the deputy
secretaries of the Russian Security Council will be dismissed in
the near future, a well-informed source said. (Russia-Reform)

<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Beijing, the Chinese capital,
began today the construction of its first "green ecology"
residential zone.
</P>
<P>
The Beiluchun zone, which is located to the northwestern
satellite city of Liangxiang in the Fangshan District, will
feature a total floor space of some 160,000 square meters, and of
which the housing floor space of 110,000 sq.m. will be enough to
accommodate 4,200 people.
</P>
<P>
Designated grassland in the zone covers 15,700 sq m.
</P>
<P>
Beiluchun will be a pilot zone featuring purified air, water
recycling and both waste and noise control.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has constructed 200 small residential zones in recent
years and of which 17 are pilot ones with a combined total floor
space of over four million sq.m., accounting for 20 percent of the
total that under construction.
</P>
<P>
Beijing completed housing projects with an annual average of
eight million sq.m. in recent years, according to Zhang Yansheng,

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Olympic silver medallist
Frankie Fredericks won the men's 100m sprint in 9.96 seconds at
the All-Africa Invitational Athletics Meeting here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Fredericks cruised over the last 30 meters and finished
comfortably ahead of second placed Deji Aliu of Nigeria in 10.22
and Antoine Boussombe of Gabon in 10.26.
</P>
<P>
The meeting's biggest shock came in the men's 3,000 meters when
South Africa's Shadrack Hoff surged away from Kenya's Moses
Kiptanui in the final straight to win in seven minutes 56.31
seconds.
</P>
<P>
With 150 meters to go, the Kenyan looked to have the race under
control but the diminutive Hoff produced a powerful finish to
shock Kiptanui.
</P>
<P>
The men's 800 meters proved equally exciting as South Africa's
Hendrik Mokganyetsi also held his best for last, grabbing victory
from compatriot Johan Botha and Josef Tengelei of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
It was clear, however, from the opening event -- the women's
100 meters hurdles -- that few records would come under threat
because of the weather.
</P>
<P>
Angela Atede of Nigeria won the meeting opener in 12.98 seconds
with the Ukraine's Tatyana Tereshchuk and South Africa's Corien
Botha second and third.

<HEADLINE> China Releases Film On Attempt to Assassinate Mao Zedong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- A new Chinese film opens with a
scene showing three Chinese policemen arresting a middle-aged man
who failed in an attempt to assassinate Chairman Mao Zedong at the
Guangzhou Railway Station in 1949.
</P>
<P>
The secret agent film, which opened Friday throughout the
nation, is the first to depict the notorious mission and would-be
assassin Duan Yunpeng.
</P>
<P>
Duan, born in Hebei Province in 1904, gained fame as a master
burglar in Beijing and neighboring Tianjin city. The key spy for
the Kuomintang regime fled to Taiwan in 1949. Duan was arrested
following the assassination attempt in northeast and later
executed.
</P>
<P>
The film -- "Rising Sun, Sudden Clap of Thunder" -- was
produced by the Changchun Film Studio. The film in based
declassified secret files provided by the Ministry of State
Security.
</P>
<P>
"The basic plot revolved around authentic historical
records," according to a ministry official.
</P>
<P>
Chairman Mao visited the former Soviet Union in 1949 and the
Kuomintang regime led by Chiang Kai-shek conspired with US secret
agents to assassinate the nation's top leader.
</P>
<P>
Documents reveal that Vice-Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou
Enlai and Shanghai Mayor Chen Yi were also marked for
assassination.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the founding of the People's Republic of China on
October 1, 1949, Chiang ordered aircraft to drop armed spies in
remote hilly areas in the Changbai Mountains in northeast China's
Jilin Province. Mao immediately deployed police and Chinese agents
to safeguard the country, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Release of the documents marks the first time that China had
secret files concerning plots to assassinate Chinese leaders,
according to the official.
</P>
<P>
He said the Ministry is considering the possibility of
releasing various other classified documents to assist film
producers and enhance general public awareness of the importance
of national security.

ATHENS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Greece's jobless rate in 1997

<HEADLINE> German Government Backs Euro Launch with 11 Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The German government decided Friday
to follow a European Union recommendation two days ago to launch
the single European currency as planned in 1999 with 11 member
states despite "serious concern" voiced by the German central bank
about the participation of Italy and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
The German government made the decision at a cabinet session
Friday after examining an assessment of EU nations' performance on
economic convergence submitted on the same day by the German
central bank, known as the Bundesbank.
</P>
<P>
While giving its blessing to a punctual start of the single
currency euro, the Bundesbank has proved to be quite outspoken in
its report by highlighting the risks of euro and failure of Italy
and Belgium to cut down their massive public debts which run twice
as high as the 60-percent-of-GDP ceiling set by the EU Maastricht
Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Both Italy and Belgium would have to make binding commitments
to cut their debt levels before entering the euro club, the
Bundesbank said.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the Bundesbank report, German Finance Minister
Theo Waigel Friday called on Italy and Belgium to make the
commitments sought by the Bundesbank. He added that he would press
the demand at the EU summit on May 2 which will make the final
decision on which countries will be allowed to join euro in the
first wave.
</P>
<P>
However, Italy and Belgium are not the only countries subject
to Bundesbank criticism. It also called upon other countries like
Germany and France to make big efforts to ensure the
sustainability of their fiscal discipline.
</P>
<P>
Most EU member states would still need to make further efforts
if a stable currency were to be created, the Bundesbank said.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the Bundesbank assessment, the German government
said Friday that the EU convergence reports issue Wednesday had
clearly proved that a high degree of sustained economic
convergence required by the Maastricht Treaty had been reached and
a culture of fiscal stability had been developed in Europe with
the implementation of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
For these reasons, the German government said it was planning
to follow the EU commission's recommendation to launch euro in
1999 with 11 members, which include all EU members except Greece,
which is far from reaching the fiscal standards required by the
Maastricht Treaty, and Denmark, Britain and Sweden, all of which
have opted not to join euro in the first wave.

ATHENS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Greece Friday urged the parties
concerned in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo to begin an immediate
dialogue in order to settle the Kosovo problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting in Athens on the crisis in Kosovo where
ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of its nearly 2 million
population and demand Kosovo's independence from Yugoslavia, Greek
Foreign Undersecretary Yiannos Kranidiotis stressed the need of an
immediate dialogue without preconditions between the Yugoslav
government and representatives of the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo
elected after elections in the province Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that any solution of the Kosovo crisis must not
lead to the change of existing borders of Yugoslavia and
accompanied by respect for minority rights.
</P>
<P>
A further worsening of the Kosovo crisis, he warned, would
greatly affect the whole Balkans, particularly the countries such
as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Albania and Greece.
</P>
<P>
The minister also urged the European Union and the Western
European Union to exercise the preventive but positive and
creative diplomacy to help resolve the Kosovo issue.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Identify Fighter Cells Against HIV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- British scientists have identified
blood cells in the human immune system which can fight back
against HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, BBC reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from Britain's Oxford University have shown that
the more of the fighter cells, known as cytotoxic T-lymphocytes
(CTLs), there are in the blood, the lower the levels of HIV will
be.
</P>
<P>
HIV infects white blood cells normally protecting people
against disease. It weakens the immune system to such an extent
that patients often die of infections they would normally be able
to fight off.
</P>
<P>
The Oxford scientists found that CTLs, which are not infected
by the HIV virus, can identify and destroy infected cells, killing
the virus at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Researchers are now working on new types of treatment designed
to stimulate CTLs, which they hope will eventually lead to more
effective drugs and vaccines for AIDS.
</P>
<P>
However, they said that their study is still in its early
stages and human trials are some years away.

MOSCOW, March 27 (Xinhua) -- A number of Russian deputy prime
ministers, ministries and other federal agencies will be cut,
acting Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Rybkin said Friday.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the reason of government's reduction is
that the functions of several government structures overlap with
the Prosecutor General's Office and the Justice Ministry.
</P>
<P>
According to him, after the reform of the government, the
ministers will bear the bulk of the responsibility. All the deputy
secretaries of the Russian Security Council will be dismissed in
the near future, a well-informed source said.
</P>
<P>
The source said there will be one first deputy secretary and
five deputy secretaries in the Security Council's new structure.
</P>
<P>
The deputy secretaries appointed when the Security Council was
led by Ivan Rybkin will go because of changing priorities in the
work of the agency and the merger between the Security Council,
the Defense Council and the Main Military Inspectorate, the
source said.

<HEADLINE> 50 Percent of Children Die from Malnutrition: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- 50 percent of chHldren in the
world died from malnutrition each year, according to the 1998
report issued by the U. N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Shahida Azfar, Director for East and Southern Africa of
UNICEF, issued the annual report which estimated that 200 million
children under five years old suffer from malnutrition in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The report said that iron-deficiency anemia is one of the most
serious problems facing the malnourished children. Children under
two suffering from iron-deficiency anemia have troubles in
action-coordination and body-balancing. They are usually
absent-minded and slow in reaction, therefore, retarded in
development.
</P>
<P>
Azfar said that UNICEF regards malnutrition as abuse of
children's rights. It said in the report that this is a problem
endangering millions of lives and jeopardizing social
development, to which an urgent solution should be found.
</P>
<P>
However, Azfar said, international public opinions pay more
attention to stock markets than to our children.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF's report said that malnutrition facing children around
the world are mainly caused by lack of food, natural disasters
and deficiency of Vitamin A, iron and iodine in their bodies.
</P>
<P>
Azfar held talks with Angolan minister of social welfare,
discussing their cooperation in improving life of children.
UNICEF will gradually turn the emergency plans into development
programs.
</P>
<P>
Azfar said the U.N. institution will spend 75 million U.S.
Dollars in implementing its programs in Angola.

<HEADLINE> CBI Warns Of UK's Deteriorating Economic Position </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 27 (Xinhua) - The soaring pound and declining
exports to South-east Asia sent Britain's trade deficit increasing
in February.
</P>
<P>
The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned Friday of
UK's deteriorating economic position on news that exports to
Thailand, South Korea and Malaysia halved over the past year.
</P>
<P>
Sales of British goods to Thailand were down by 60 percent, to
South Korea by 51 percent and to Malaysia by 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
The loss of markets there, combined with a 9 percent jump in
imports since early 1997, means the trade balance with these
countries has risen by about 150 million pounds (240 million US
dollars) per month from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics also
showed that last month Britain was in the red of 1.6 billion
pounds (2.56 billion US dollars) with countries outside the EU.
</P>
<P>
With sterling surging to a nine-year high Thursday of 3.0746
German marks, Treasury officials admitted that they were unable to
bring any respite to exporters through a cheaper currency.
</P>
<P>
Factories are cutting prices to find customers for their goods,
according to CBI monthly industrial trends survey released here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows export volumes are still up by 6% on a year
ago, but almost all the increase occurred in the first few months
of 1997, while import volumes, by contrast, rising steadily.
</P>
<P>
Sudhir Junankar, the CBI's associate director of economic
analysis, said: "These are difficult times for British
manufacturers."
</P>
<P>
"Sterling's continued strength and concerns about the impact of
the Asian economic crises are undoubtedly having a dampening
effect on export demand," he added.

LAGOS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The west African ECOMOG force and
its pro-government ally known as the Kamajors in Sierra Leone
have recaptured Dairo barracks and the town itself from remnants
of the dislodged military junta operating in east Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Dairo barracks served for more than six weeks as the base of

<HEADLINE> E. African States Speed up Regional Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda
have accelerated the pace of regional integration, Francis
Muthaura, executive secretary of the East African Cooperation
(EAC), has said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to British Minister for Foreign and Commonwealth
Affairs Tony Lloyd, who Thursday visited northern Tanzanian town
Arusha where the EAC secretariat is based, Muthaura said the flow
of people, goods and services across the borders of the three
countries is on the increase.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the time spent at the border has been
considerably reduced, and major border points are manned on a
24-hour basis, according to a news dispatch reaching here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The three EA member states are currently emphasizing on the
area of monetary stability, Muthaura said, adding that various
policies in critical sectors have been harmonized in a short
period of two years.
</P>
<P>
"Immediate focus is on the development of regional
infrastructure, especially telecommunications, transport and
energy," he said, and added that a 67.1-million-US-Dollar EA
digital transmission project is under way.
</P>
<P>
The EAC chief has also appealed to Britain to extend direct
financial aid to infrastructure development projects in east
Africa, which has far reaching impact on regional development.
</P>
<P>
Lloyd commended EAC's efforts in promoting economic
integration in the region, noting that Britain viewed the
regional markets, such as EAC, as the building blocks for global
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The British minister said his country will look into the EAC
program more closely and plan to assist necessary infrastructural
development projects and fund the EAC secretariat's management
and information systems.
</P>
<P>
A donors' conference will be held in Arusha in May to speed up
regional integration and development, Muthaura said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Visits Mandela's Cell on Robben Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 27 (Xinhua) -- United States President
Bill Clinton Friday visited the cell on Robben Island where South
African President Nelson Mandela was incarcerated for 18 years.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents arrived on the island in separate
helicopters and drove past the lime quarry where Mandela was
forced to do hard labor and the home of Robert Sobukwe, leader of
the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC), before stopping at
the prison itself.
</P>
<P>
The two heads of state listened to a briefing by Ahmed
Kathrada, chairman of the Robben Island Museum Committee, and
then walked into the cell block with their arms around each
other.
</P>
<P>
Mandela explained what conditions there had been like, and the
two leaders stood looking out of the window, with their hands on
the bars, as Mandela told how a four-meter wall had been erected
across the courtyard outside to cut political prisoners off from
those convicted of common-law crimes.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told reporters that Mandela's example was a good
object lesson for all young people, most of whom would never face
a challenge like the one the South African leader had in prison.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, asked by an American reporter to talk about his
experiences in the cell, said, "There were pleasant and
unpleasant experiences, and it depends on how you look at the
situation."
</P>
<P>
"Right down the centuries, in many parts of the world, there
are men and women who are able to turn disasters that would crash
many people into victory," said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is in South Africa for a four-day state visit.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Help Israel Third Anti-Missile Battery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States will help
Israel deploy a third anti-missile defense battery because of
"growing missile proliferation" in the Middle East, Defense
Secretary William Cohen announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
Cohen made the announcement after his talks with visiting
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzak Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
"There is growing missile proliferation in the region," Cohen
told reporters at a joint press conference with Mordechai. "There
is a need for three batteries to protect much of the country.... A
third Arrow battery is needed."
</P>
<P>
Israel asked the United States to expand the Arrow anti-missile
project during the recent Iraqi crisis when the Israelis were
worried that Iraq might launch Scud missile attacks if it was
bombed by the American forces.
</P>
<P>
The United States has so far contributed about 250 million
dollars to fund the joint U.S.-Israeli Arrow 2 anti-ballistic
missile program.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the two defense ministers took place on the
eve of the 50th anniversary of the state of Israel and Cohen
pledged continuation of strong relationship between the United
States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the relationship with the U.S. and Israel will be as
strong in the next 50 years as it has been in the past 50 years,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said he was grateful for the "strong cooperation"
between the two countries to guarantee the Jewish state's
security.

<HEADLINE> CBI Warns Of UK's Deteriorating Economic Position </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The soaring pound and declining
exports to South-east Asia sent Britain's trade deficit increasing
February.
</P>
<P>
The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned Friday of
UK's deteriorating economic position on news that exports to
Thailand, South Korea and Malaysia halved over the past year.
</P>
<P>
Sales of British goods to Thailand were down by 60 percent, to
South Korea by 51 percent and to Malaysia by 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
The loss of markets there, combined with a 9 percent jump in
imports since early 1997, means the trade balance with these
countries has risen by about 150 million pounds (240 million U.S.
dollars) per month from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics also
showed that last month Britain was in the red of 1.6 billion
pounds (2.56 billion U.S. dollars) with countries outside the EU.
</P>
<P>
With sterling surging to a nine-year high Thursday of 3.0746
German marks, Treasury officials admitted that they were unable to
bring any respite to exporters through a cheaper currency.
</P>
<P>
Factories are cutting prices to find customers for their goods,
according to CBI monthly industrial trends survey released here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows export volumes are still up by 6 percent on a
year ago, but almost all the increase occurred in the first few
months of 1997, while import volumes, by contrast, are rising
steadily.
</P>
<P>
Sudhir Junankar, the CBI's associate director of economic
analysis, said: "These are difficult times for British
manufacturers."
</P>
<P>
"Sterling's continued strength and concerns about the impact of
the Asian economic crises are undoubtedly having a dampening
effect on export demand," he added.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Gives Clinton "Order of Good Hope" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting United States
President Bill Clinton was awarded the Order of Good Hope Friday
by South African President Nelson Mandela, the country's highest
civilian award.
</P>
<P>
He was given the honor at a private ceremony at the historic
Vergelegen wine estate outside Somerset West, near Cape Town,
where a state banquet was later held in his honor, South African
Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The same award had been presented to Libyan leader Muammar
Gaddafi, Clinton's arch foe, by Mandela last year when he visited
Libya.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he could not imagine anyone else from whom he
would have wanted to receive this award than Mandela.
</P>
<P>
In an unexpected incident, the glittering banquet held for
Clinton on Friday evening was plunged into darkness three times
before dinner was served.
</P>
<P>
Officials shouted in the dark for candles during the three
20-second blackouts.
</P>
<P>
Proposing a toast, Clinton told Mandela that when he toured
Robben Island with him in the afternoon, Mandela made him realize
that he had opened people's minds during his long imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, sharing the VIP stage with dignitaries including
Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) Chairman Desmond Tutu,
said South Africa was a monument to the power of reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
"Tonight we celebrate all that you have accomplished," he told
the gathering of 750 political leaders, diplomats and business
leaders under a giant marquee.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he remembered when the first black South African
won a medal at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, the United
States, he dedicated his victory to South Africa and to President
Mandela.
</P>
<P>
"President Mandela has won a great victory in what has been
the longest marathon of the 20th century," Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Urges Parties to Push Mideast Peace Forward </HEADLINE>

<P>
ANKARA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel on Friday urged Palestinians and Israelis to double their
efforts to make the Middle East peace process a success,
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"This is a golden opportunity for peace and it should not be
lost," Demirel said in a meeting with Ahmed Qureia, President of
the Palestinian Council, and his delegation.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said that Turkey has always been supporting
Palestinian brothers in their just struggle from the very
beginning, adding that Turkish people "sincerely wish for the
success of the peace process."
</P>
<P>
"We also told this to Israel, which is a party to the
process. All obstacles should be abolished," the Turkish president
said.
</P>
<P>
Qureia, on his part, said that Palestine attaches importance to
Turkey's role in the region, hoping that Ankara could continue to
play an active part in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
On the recent Turkish-Israeli military cooperation, Qureia said
that Palestinians are not concerned about it for such a
relationship is of bilateral nature instead of being directed at
other countries.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's military ties with Israel has prompted grave concern
among the Arab countries, which fear that Turkey is trying to
form an alliance with the Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Records 200,000 New TB Case Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has an estimated 200,000
new cases of tuberculosis (TB) annually, the Ministry of Health
has disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Among the cases, about half were highly infectious and about
30,000 patients were likely to die of the disease annually if
left untreated, said Minister of State for Health Iyorwuese
Hagher, quoted by This Day newspaper Friday.
</P>
<P>
Describing the TB threat as "very alarming and of great
concern to this administration," Hager said the government had
since 1992 adopted the method specified by the World Health
Organization (WHO) as the best for TB.
</P>
<P>
The treatment course, he explained earlier this week in the
capital Abuja, involved political commitment, microscopy
services, drug supplies, monitoring systems and direct
observation of treatment.
</P>
<P>
WHO's Directly Observed Treatment Short Course thus adopted
had proved to be cost effective in combating the spread of TB, he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The minister gave an assurance that the government would
strive to provide free treatment for TB patients in the country.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriots Reiterate Principles for Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash reiterated Friday that the Cyprus issue should be
settled on the basis of recognizing equal status of the two
communities on the divided island.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Istanbul international airport before his
departure for Geneva, Switzerland, where he will meet
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, Denktash stressed that the
international community must be aware of such a fact that to date
there is no legitimate government representing the whole Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"We want to continue the negotiations under the equal
conditions, that is to say, the negotiations should be held
between the two republics," said Denktash, according to
semi-official Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops intervened and took over the northern third of the island
in the wake of a pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared the so-called
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" which only enjoys the
recognition of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
As for Cyprus' bid to enter the European Union (EU), Denktash
reaffirmed that the Cypriot government does not have legal right
to apply for the membership on behalf of the whole island.
</P>
<P>
"We have never accept the Greek Cypriots as our government and
we will not support their efforts to that effect," the Turkish
Cypriot leader told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The EU summit in Luxembourg last December officially invited
Cyprus to the EU enlargement process, bitterly annoying both
Turkish Cypriots and their supporter, Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Denktash said that he would introduce to Annan the real
situation of Cyprus and the practical principles for the
settlement during their talks in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and international community have spared no effort to
solve this thorny problem, but so far no substantial progress has
been made due to differences between Greek and Turkish
Cypriots.
