<HEADLINE> U.N.: Environmental Efforts Urgent  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Despite improvements in the last 30 years,
efforts to keep the globe eco-friendly remain the world's ''urgent,
unfinished agenda,'' the deputy U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech Wednesday to environment ministers attending a U.N.
conference on sustainable development -- the term for
environmentally sound economic growth -- Deputy Secretary-General
Louise Frechette called for a new ethic of conservation and
stewardship to guide development in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no denying the environmental achievements of the past
three decades,'' Frechette said, listing the creation of government
environment ministries and landmark treaties on climate change,
biodiversity and the depletion of the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   ''However,'' she said, ''we must acknowledge the presence of an
urgent, unfinished agenda: humans continue to plunder the global
environment, unsustainable practices remain deeply embedded in the
fabric of our daily lives, and despite some honorable exceptions,
our responses to the challenges of sustainability have been too
few, too little and too late.''
</P>
<P>
   The environment conference of the U.N. Commission on Sustainable
Development is meeting at U.N. headquarters to prepare for the 10th
anniversary of the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, where world leaders
adopted a broad agenda to protect forests, clean up water, reverse
atmospheric pollution, alleviate poverty and address other
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The environment group Greenpeace pointed out that the conference
was occurring at U.N. headquarters at the same time as a monthlong
review of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ''In one room, the rich few will argue that they have no money
to spare for sustainable development, in the other they will
struggle to maintain and further develop their multibillion dollar
nuclear arsenal,'' said Remi Parmentier, head of Greenpeace's
international political unit.
</P>
<P>
   ''If only a portion of what is spent by the nuclear weapons
states to maintain and further develop their nuclear weapons was
re-routed towards the protection of the environment, sustainable
development could become a reality,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Japan Nuke Accident Claims 2d Victim  </HEADLINE>
By JOJI SAKURAI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A worker exposed to radiation in Japan's worst
nuclear accident died Thursday morning, becoming the second
fatality in a disaster that shook the nation's faith in nuclear
energy.
</P>
<P>
   Masato Shinohara, 40, died of multiple organ failure, the
University of Tokyo Hospital said.
</P>
<P>
   Shinohara's condition had improved after the accident, but began
to deteriorate rapidly in mid-April as respiratory and kidney
functions began to fail, said hospital spokesman Akiyoshi Iitsuka.
</P>
<P>
   Shinohara had been at the University of Tokyo Hospital since
April 10 after being transferred from another medical facility run
by the university. He had been on a respirator since February.
</P>
<P>
   He was the second plant worker to die since the Sept. 30
accident at a uranium-processing facility in Tokaimura, 70 miles
northeast of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Hisashi Ouchi, 35, died of multiple organ failure on Dec. 21
after having been exposed to a massive amount of radiation. He was
the first person in Japan to die as a result of a nuclear plant
accident.
</P>
<P>
   A third worker, Yutaka Yokokawa, was also hospitalized for
exposure to a lesser amount of radiation, but was discharged in
December.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing of Shinohara's death, Japanese officials vowed renewed
efforts to restore trust in the country's nuclear energy program.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will redouble efforts to strengthen safety and disaster
prevention measures,'' said Masaru Hashimoto, the governor of
Ibaraki Prefecture, where Tokaimura is located.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori expressed his condolences
and said the government will work hard to ensure that a similar
accident does not happen again, national broadcaster NHK reported.
</P>
<P>
   Shinohara's death came on the same day that a Japanese atomic
power association opened a symposium in Tokyo on regaining trust in
nuclear power. The conference was to move to Tokaimura on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The accident was triggered when the three workers used too much
uranium to make fuel and set off an uncontrolled atomic reaction.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 439 people, including nearby residents, were believed
to have been exposed to radiation.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation found that workers at the plant, run by JCO
Co., routinely violated safety procedures, including mixing uranium
in buckets to get work done quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Resource poor Japan relies on nuclear power for 30 percent of
its electricity. But the accident at Tokaimura and others in recent
years have called into question government assurances that the
country's nuclear facilities are safely run.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the government revoked the license of JCO, the first
plant operator to face the penalty under Japanese law regulating
nuclear fuel, materials and reactors.

<HEADLINE> European Interest Rates Debated  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- It seemed so clear two weeks ago. The head of the
European Central Bank indicated an interest rate increase was just
around the corner, aimed at putting the brakes on inflation in the
11 countries that use the euro.
</P>
<P>
   But with the euro's nosedive against the dollar this week, those
at the ECB's meeting today are in a bit of a bind. Raising rates
now -- the same week the euro hit a new all-time low since its
launch last year -- could be interpreted as panicking. Not doing
anything at all could make them look like they don't care.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are split on when the rate hike will come. Last week,
the feeling was that the bank would hold off until its next meeting
in early May. But with the euro's drop to below 93 cents for the
first time in a steep selloff Tuesday that saw it dip as low as
91.62 cents, more market watchers now feel the bank will move
sooner rather than later to bump up its benchmark lending rate,
currently at 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Petra Koehler, a senior economist at Dresdner Bank, said she
expects a quarter-point rate increase, which would come on the back
of a similar increase in March.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's some time distance now from the last step,'' she said,
adding that inflation figures have also edged slightly over 2
percent -- the ECB's top limit under its own rules for keeping
prices stable.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank, said raising
rates now gives the impression that the ECB is trying to stop the
euro's plunge -- something it really can't control through interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   ''Reacting to this instantaneously would create the impression
in the markets that you react nervously,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There has been talk of the ECB buying euros to prop up the
currency, although that also isn't seen as a long-term solution for
the currency's woes.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is almost imperative,'' said Neil Parker, chief economist
at the Royal Bank of Scotland. ''You need the ECB to step in and
stop the decline before it gets out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   The euro has plunged almost 23 percent since January 1999, when
it was launched amid hopes that it would one day rival the dollar
as a global reserve currency.
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk about interest rates, experts still say the
real reason for the euro's decline remains Europe's sluggishness on
streamlining its economy and the unstoppable U.S. economic
juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reason for the euro's fall is the very bad sentiment about
what is happening structurally in Euroland, compared with what is
happening in the United States,'' Commerzbank's Schubert said. ''If
that sentiment doesn't change, there will be no change in the
direction of the euro-dollar rate.''
</P>
<P>
   The weak currency has been particularly worrisome to British
companies that export to continental Europe or compete with imports
priced in euros.
</P>
<P>
   The Confederation of British Industry released a quarterly
survey Wednesday showing that exports among Britain's manufacturers
have fallen, with more companies recording a downturn in overseas
orders.
</P>
<P>
   Americans investing in shares of European companies also are
taking a beating. Swelling regional stock valuations look a lot
less impressive once those shares are converted from euros into
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's Xetra Dax index of blue-chip shares listed on the
Frankfurt stock exchange has increased by 7.8 percent since the
start of the year. The Paris CAC 40 stock index has risen 4.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, after euro-denominated shares are converted into
dollars, the Xetra Dax index showed no increase for the year, while
the Paris CAC 40 actually lost 2.9 percent of its value in dollars.

<HEADLINE> Sex Molest Suspect Jumps Off Bridge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAUSALITO, Calif. (AP) -- A man suspected of molesting a child
jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge Wednesday as police chased and
tried to arrest him, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Officers were waiting for Brian Alexander Ward, 39, near the
Sausalito home where he worked as a gardener. He was suspected of
molesting a 4-year-old boy who lived at the house and faced three
counts of lewd and lascivious acts with a child, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Ward spotted officers and fled in his truck, according to
Sausalito police. He was pursued by Marin County sheriff's deputies
and by Sausalito and Mill Valley officers.
</P>
<P>
   When he got onto the bridge, heading toward San Francisco, he
crossed into oncoming traffic, got out of the car and jumped into
the water.
</P>
<P>
   The tide was running out to the Pacific and Ward's body was not
found. Falls from the bridge are nearly always fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Ward was a high-risk sex offender with previous
convictions.

<HEADLINE> Guatemala Marks Bishop's Murder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- With a march and masses, human rights
groups and the Roman Catholic Church marked the second anniversary
of the still-unsolved killing of Bishop Juan Gerardi.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 people marched Wednesday from the crypt where
Gerardi is buried in Guatemala's Metropolitan Cathedral to a nearby
church where a bronze plaque bearing his image was unveiled.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Mission in Guatemala, which helped oversee peace
accords that put an end to the nation's 36-year civil war, issued a
statement calling Gerardi ''one of the most outstanding defenders
of human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerardi, 75, was bludgeoned to death in his home April 26, 1998,
two days after he delivered a report blaming Guatemala's military
for the vast majority of the atrocities in the civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Frustration has grown with the slow pace, and frequent
interruptions, in the investigation of his killing.
</P>
<P>
   On April 17, a recently emerged witness implicated a former
presidential guard. Gilberto Gomez told a judge that former guard
Jose Obdulio Villanueva checked himself out of the prison where the
two men were held on the day of the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Villanueva, a convicted murderer, had been a prime suspect but
was released after he claimed he was in jail in another city at the
time of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Mission stressed ''the existence of new evidence about
the possible involvement in the crime of people linked to illegal
or underground security agencies.''

<HEADLINE> Oklahoma Executes Cop Killer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   McALESTER, Okla. (AP) -- A man convicted of killing an Oklahoma
City police officer in 1986 was executed by injection early
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Keith Boyd, 43, was pronounced dead at 12:21 a.m. after
receiving a lethal dose of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd was found guilty in the Jan. 7, 1986, shooting of Oklahoma
City police Master Patrolman Richard Oldham Riggs.
</P>
<P>
   Riggs, 32, was shot twice as he approached Boyd, who was on a
pay phone outside a van at a service station.
</P>
<P>
   The officer had seen the van, which matched the description of a
vehicle used in an armed robbery at a nearby store minutes earlier.
Riggs was hit in the chest and abdomen and managed to return fire,
along with his rookie partner, who was not injured.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd claimed a hitchhiker took the gun from his knapsack and
shot Riggs. He said there was no gunpowder residue on his hands.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors said Boyd was arrested a day after Riggs was
killed and had ample time to wash his hands. They also cited
testimony from eyewitnesses and expert witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''I promised Richard as I stood over his coffin that I would
live to see this day,'' Riggs' mother, Betty Riggs, said hours
before the execution. ''I had to keep my promise to Richard and now
I can go to the cemetery and I'll tell him.''

<HEADLINE> Grain Storage Program Moving Slow  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MacDONALD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FARGO, N.D. (AP) -- A program intended to help farmers find more
room for their grain may not be in place in time for many of them
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Stofferahn, North Dakota's director of the federal Farm
Service Agency, said officials do not expect the farm storage
facility loan program to be set up until at least early June. He
worries that may be too late for most North Dakota farmers to take
advantage of it this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think everybody is pushing really hard to get it going, but
the process of moving such a program forward takes a lot of time,''
Stofferahn said. ''And that may end up being frustrating for some
farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Agriculture Department is resurrecting the farm storage
facility loan program, which enables farmers to get low-interest
government loans to build new grain storage facilities on their
farms.
</P>
<P>
   The program was discontinued 18 years ago after studies found
enough storage available. But the USDA said that has changed and
the need for new storage facilities is growing.
</P>
<P>
   Without enough storage space, farmers must sometimes sell crops
when commodity prices are low rather than hanging on to the crops
until prices recover.
</P>
<P>
   ''Judging from the calls we've received in our offices and from
what I've heard elsewhere in the country, I think there is a really
sizable demand for the program out there right now,'' Stofferahn
said.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said earlier this
month that the department is working on rules for the program and
expected to issue them in time for this year's crop.
</P>
<P>
   But the USDA has already come under fire from some lawmakers for
not moving quickly enough.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Witnesses and members of a federal trade
panel disagreed among themselves over trade issues Wednesday, in a
hearing on whether wide-open markets or a more cautious approach
would be best for American agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Harry Cleberg, Farmland Industries chairman and chief
executive officer, told members of the U.S. Trade Deficit Review
Commission that American farmers need the help of a normal trade
relationship with China.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to approve permanent normal trade relations, Cleberg
said during a hearing at the Federal Reserve Bank, would mean that
''we will have done nothing to redress our trade deficit with China
and, worse, we will damage our reputation as a reliable supplier of
goods and services to China and the world.''
</P>
<P>
   And Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan said development of export
markets was crucial because his state's farm economy was
struggling.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is backing a bill in the House that
would bring China into the World Trade Organization and make
China's normal trade status with the United States permanent.
Currently, China's trade status is reviewed each year.
</P>
<P>
   The trade bill that the House is expected to take up next month
would ensure China the low-tariff access to U.S. markets that other
trading partners enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   But committee member C. Richard D'Amato, a Maryland state
legislator, praised what he called the ''radical'' idea that the
U.S. should enforce its existing trade pacts before entering any
new ones.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing is one of four to be held around the country. The
committee will report to the White House and Congress after the
hearings.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Candidate Calls for Reforms  </HEADLINE>
By SUZAN FRASER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey's main presidential candidate is
calling for democratic reforms and the right to free expression,
proposals that could anger the nation's powerful military.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmet Necdet Sezer is running against 10 candidates in the first
round of presidential elections in parliament today, but already
has received the backing of all the parties in parliament. Turkish
presidents are elected by parliament and no other candidate has any
party backing, leaving Sezer's election a near certainty.
</P>
<P>
   Sezer, chief justice of the constitutional court, Turkey's
highest court, has called for reforms to the constitution drawn up
during the 1980-1983 military rule, saying it restricts basic
rights and freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   He also has questioned the military's annual purge of officers
suspected of links with Islamic groups or political parties. The
decisions are made behind closed doors and the sacked officers have
no right of appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union, which Turkey hopes to join, is likely to be
pleased with Sezer's nomination, which came about after intense
bargaining between Turkey's main parties. So is the far-right
Nationalist Action Party, a key member of the governing coalition,
which has strong support among the religious.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit appears relieved that his coalition
government found a compromise candidate and avoided a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamic Virtue Party, which faces being banned for
threatening Turkey's secular regime, has praised Sezer's
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ''When Sezer's candidacy was announced, Virtue experienced the
greatest happiness,'' wrote Emin Colasan, a commentator for
Hurriyet newspaper. ''Sezer is a democracy victory for Virtue.''
</P>
<P>
   That has raised fears that Sezer may not support the military's
relentless fight against what the generals call one of Turkey's
greatest threats, political Islam.
</P>
<P>
   None of Turkey's top generals attended a reception earlier this
week hosted by Sezer, sparking speculation that the powerful
military was not happy with his nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ''According to some, the new presidential candidate is not as
secular and republican as he is made out to be,'' said Bekir
Coskun, who also writes for Hurriyet.
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit rushed to Sezer's defense Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Chief of Staff and the Turkish Armed Forces are highly
sensitive to the issue of secularism,'' Ecevit said. ''There won't
be any problems on that aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper reports have claimed that Virtue is also supporting
Sezer in the hope that when he leaves the court his seat will be
filled by his deputy, who is reputed to be close to the Islamic
party.
</P>
<P>
   That also might anger the military, which regards itself as the
guarantor of the nation's secular system. The army has seized power
three times since 1960 and once forced an Islamic party from power.

<HEADLINE> Jailed Market Guru To Defend Himself  </HEADLINE>
By NOELLE KNOX, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Famed market forecaster Martin Armstrong will be
allowed to defend himself against securities fraud charges, a
ruling that as some wondering if he can get a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   In a closed hearing Monday, U.S. District Judge Richard Owen
ruled that Armstrong, who has no formal legal training, will be
allowed to represent himself in court against accusations by U.S.
regulators that he defrauded Japanese investors out of $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   However, Armstrong is in a cell in the Metropolitan Correctional
Center in New York for contempt of court, his assets have been
frozen and he has no money to pay a lawyer to help him in the civil
case.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given his circumstances, he is in a very difficult position.
It is a very complex case and it is going to be very difficult for
him to prepare for a trial,'' said Martin Unger, the lawyer who
represented Armstrong until this week.
</P>
<P>
   Unger withdrew from the case because of disagreements with
Armstrong and because Armstrong couldn't pay him.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who founded Princeton Economics International,
allegedly sold $3 billion worth of securities to Japanese
companies, pledging to repay them with interest. Instead of putting
the money in conservative bonds as promised, he made risky bets on
currencies and other investments.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with mounting losses, he tried to hide the truth from
investors by giving them false account statements, said
authorities, who raided his offices last September. Armstrong
repaid $2 billion, but still owes $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   He is being sued civilly by the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and in a
separate criminal case by the U.S. attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong has pleaded innocent and blames executives at Republic
Bank (recently acquired by HSBC), where the funds were held.
</P>
<P>
   The judge has maintained that Armstrong can get out of prison
anytime he wants by handing over the missing documents and
valuables.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, however, said in the interview, ''I'm in here to keep
me quiet. ... I will never receive a fair trial before Judge Owen.
There's a hidden agenda going on here.''

<HEADLINE> Parks Buck Trend of Cleaner Air  </HEADLINE>
By LEON DROUIN KEITH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The nation's air-quality picture improved
overall in the 1990s except for many national parks, according to a
report released by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The report covering 1989 to 1998 found that ozone levels rose
significantly in seven of 24 national parks measured, from the
Great Smoky Mountains in North Carolina and Tennessee to Denali in
Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The ozone news was better for Southern Californians, who breathe
some of the nation's dirtiest air but saw pollution trends move in
a positive direction.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Southern California metropolitan areas had less than
half as many poor-air-quality days as they did in 1989. Overall,
ozone levels across the United State dropped by about 4 percent
during this period, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   David Mintz, the report's team leader, said that while the news
is good for Southern California, the area still leads the way in
air pollution, with the Los Angeles and Riverside areas seeing
about 80 poor air-quality days in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, rates fell for all six ''criteria pollutants'' --
carbon monoxide, lead, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter
and sulfur dioxide. Ozone saw the smallest decrease.
</P>
<P>
   Among national parks, ozone problems worsened the most in Great
Smoky Mountains and Shenandoah in Virginia, with each seeing
increases of more than 30 percent over the span of the report,
Mintz said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He said two reasons for the ozone increase in rural areas are
pollution migrating from urban areas and emissions from power
plants.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the long term, we're doing better,'' Mintz said. ''But as
you start looking regionally ... there's cause for concern.''

<HEADLINE> Infectious Diseases Get Stronger  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   The outbreaks are unusual -- a farm boy sickened by
drug-resistant salmonella, hundreds of Italian schoolchildren
affected by a contaminated salad. The four outbreaks detailed in
research published today illustrate the surprising potential of new
microbes to emerge and old ones to return with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   ''On a good day, we hold them at bay. On a bad day, they're
winning,'' said Dr. Michael Osterholm of ican Inc. of Eden Prairie,
Minn., an Internet information company focusing on infectious
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Osterholm, who was Minnesota's state epidemiologist for 24
years, wrote an editorial on emerging infections in today's New
England Journal of Medicine, which carried reports on the
outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   The cases include the Nebraska child who caught the salmonella
from infected cows that apparently had been given antibiotics;
Malaysian pig farmers killed by microbes caught from their animals;
and the Italian children sickened by the cold corn salad. Finally,
a diabetic Atlanta boy needed bowel surgery twice for a severe
bacterial infection after eating a holiday chitterlings feast.
</P>
<P>
   ''The microbes are challenging us in ways we wouldn't have
imagined 10 years ago and for which we're not prepared,'' said Dr.
James Hughes, director of the National Center for Infectious
Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Bacteria and viruses multiply quickly, and can therefore evolve
rapidly into more aggressive strains.
</P>
<P>
   While Osterholm said it is impossible to predict what will be
''the next HIV,'' another deadly microbe is inevitable. Likewise,
Hughes said it is only a matter of time until another deadly flu
epidemic hits the world.
</P>
<P>
   Infectious diseases are the world's No. 1 killer, claiming 13
million lives annually.
</P>
<P>
   The deadly microbes appearing in the last quarter-century
include: Legionnaires' disease, toxic shock syndrome, AIDS,
rodent-borne hantaviruses, the airborne Ebola virus, Lyme disease,
a fatal brain disease in England caught from eating ''mad cows,''
West Nile encephalitis in the New York City area and new,
drug-resistant tuberculosis strains in many cities.
</P>
<P>
   The experts cite numerous factors for the emergence -- and
re-emergence -- of deadly germs, including:
</P>
<P>
   --increased international travel and shipment of food.
</P>
<P>
   --unprecedented population growth cramming people together in
unsanitary conditions.
</P>
<P>
   --changes in how food is grown and handled.
</P>
<P>
   --decaying public health infrastructure in many areas.
</P>
<P>
   --more people living with immune systems suppressed by AIDS,
cancer, diabetes and organ transplants.
</P>
<P>
   --increased use of antibiotics in people and livestock, which
contributes to germs' growing resistance to antibiotics.
Potentially deadly staph infections are becoming resistant to even
the antibiotic of last choice.
</P>
<P>
   ''Imagine trying to deal with all those at one time,'' Osterholm
said. ''It's like a city fire department trying to put out 30 fires
at one time with one truck.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1992 Institute of Medicine report spelled out those threats
and the international implications, spurring the CDC and the World
Health Organization to tackle some of the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said food safety has been improved, a computerized CDC
network can quickly spot emerging disease outbreaks, and the agency
has a comprehensive plan to address the other threats, but Congress
has only funded half of it.

<HEADLINE> 11 Candidates for Indiana Seat  </HEADLINE>
By AMY FORLITI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A congressional seat that was held by the
Democrats for 20 years before the Republican Revolution six years
ago is up for grabs in a wide-open, 11-candidate primary.
</P>
<P>
   By November, both parties could spend $2 million on the House
seat, now held by conservative third-term Rep. David McIntosh.
McIntosh is leaving to run for governor of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Republicans in Washington do not want to lose this
district and are going to target this district,'' said Ray Scheele,
a political science professor at Ball State University.
</P>
<P>
   While 23 Republicans are leaving Congress this year, only seven
Democrats are stepping down. Democrats say that boosts their
chances of recapturing the House, where Republicans have a six-seat
majority.
</P>
<P>
   If the Democrats ''think for one minute they've got a shot at
this district, there's no end to the amount of money that will be
pumped in,'' Republican National Committee spokesman Mike Collins
said.
</P>
<P>
   Six Republicans and five Democrats are vying for their parties'
nomination May 2. The GOP front-runners are former radio host Mike
Pence, who has strong name recognition, and Jeff Linder, a state
representative. Pence leads in fund raising, with more than
$291,000 as of March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Davidoff, Indiana Democratic Party spokesman, said there is
no clear front-runner in his party.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties consider the district a high priority.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a competitive open seat that we have a real shot at
winning,'' said John Del Cecato, spokesman for the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee. ''Open seats are a real
battleground.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indiana district leans Republican, but come November the GOP
faces a potentially major complication. Bill Frazier, a former
Republican candidate who lost to McIntosh in 1994 by fewer than 400
votes in the primary, intends to run as an independent and could
siphon votes from the GOP.

<HEADLINE> Texas Lockheed Machinists End Strike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- After a 17-day strike, Lockheed Martin
machinists in Fort Worth have overwhelmingly approved a new
contract and agreed to return to the assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't get what we wanted, but it's better than a poke in
the eye,'' said Terry Faulkner, 45, a 20-year employee.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Local 776 of the Machinists union voted 1,514 to 246
for the new contract, and many expected to return to work today.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think both sides are pretty happy in the way it turned
out,'' Lockheed Martin spokesman Joe Stout said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth facility is Lockheed's largest manufacturer of
F-16 fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
   The striking workers complained that their pay is lower than
that received by fellow machinist union members at Boeing Co.,
another major contractor for tactical fighter aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new contract, the workers will get 3 percent raises
this year and next and a 4 percent raise in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Even though production at the mile-long assembly line has been
hampered by the strike, Lockheed executives maintain that they will
deliver four F-16 fighter jets as scheduled this month, and are
ready to deliver two more in May.

<HEADLINE> More Than 40 Charged in Stock Fraud  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- More than 40 employees of a securities firm have
been charged with promoting worthless stock that cost investors
more than $83 million.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said Tuesday that 22 people
pleaded guilty and 20 others have been indicted on charges of lying
to 16,000 investors about themselves, their firm and the stock they
were selling.
</P>
<P>
   The firm, Meyers Pollock Robbins Inc., was charged with
enterprise corruption. The brokerage had offices in New York, Las
Vegas and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The brokerage was shut down by regulators in 1997. Prosecutors
said some of its salesmen took bribes from mobsters to promote
certain stocks and drive up their prices.
</P>
<P>
   One Meyers Pollock victim was a nursing home resident who lost
more than $100,000 after the company's brokers made unauthorized
trades, Morgenthau said. He said she lost 95 percent of her money
and her son-in-law had to take a second job so that she could stay
in the nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau said the indictment covers frauds in which investors
lost $83 million, but he estimated that the total lost during the
company's existence from 1992 until 1997 was about $176 million.
Meyers Pollock brokers allegedly pushed almost two dozen worthless
stocks, none of which are traded now.

<HEADLINE> Census Begins Home Visits  </HEADLINE>
BY GENARO C. ARMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHANTILLY, Va. (AP) -- If you live in one of the 42 million
households that haven't mailed back a census form yet, you can
expect someone like Charlie Owings to be knocking on your front
door soon.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Census Bureau begins its 10-week operation of sending
out some 440,000 census-takers to visit those homes and gather
information considered vital to getting an accurate snapshot of the
country's population.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of greeting Owings will get at the doorstep remains to
be seen. Census director Kenneth Prewitt says he isn't sure how
recent criticism over the intrusiveness of the 53-question long
form will affect what kind of cooperation enumerators get.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess some people could feel like their privacy is being
invaded,'' said Owings, who took the part-time job in suburban
Virginia to supplement his income. ''If they didn't want to give
the information, I guess I would just record it and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   About 78 million of the 120 million mailed forms were returned
to the Census Bureau. Now, it's up to people like Owings to get
information on the missing millions, and Census officials have been
busy training them this week on how to go about it.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt knows it will be a tough task, but is optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ''The enumerators are what this whole enterprise rests upon now
-- the quality of work they do,'' Prewitt said. ''But it's hard to
tell right now just how many households will not cooperate.''
</P>
<P>
   The job may be more difficult in rural areas, where more people
got a long form. The gap in the response rate between the long and
short form is 12 percent, twice as much as in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Most census-takers will be sent out alone, assigned to locate
people in a specific area. In places where safety may be an issue,
they will be sent in teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau made a big advertising push earlier this year
to recruit workers for the part-time jobs, which pay $8.25 to
$18.50 per hour. Prewitt said they wanted to ensure there were
enough census-takers who were familiar with specific areas, instead
of sending a stranger into an unfamiliar neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Some are government retirees like Phil Vargas, of Falls Church,
Va., who is looking to fill his spare time while writing a book.
Others, like Peggy Washington, a nurse's assistant also from Falls
Church, are mainly seeking extra income.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did my civic duty and I think everyone should, too,''
Washington said.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Romero of Santa Fe, N.M., retired from his government
consulting job recently to become a painter but decided to take a
census job first. After enumerating rural areas for the last couple
of months in a separate census operation, he will serve as a field
supervisor in the Santa Fe County census office.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most census-takers are aware they may come across
uncooperative people but aren't intimidated by it,'' Romero said.
</P>
<P>
   This phase of the census is one of the costliest chunks of the
$6.8 billion operation, the most ever spent on the once-a-decade
count. For the most part, the at-home visits are getting support
from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one congressman, Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., is
encouraging people concerned about privacy to ''politely decline''
to answer a census worker's questions they believe are intrusive.
</P>
<P>
   If they come across an uncooperative person, Romero said ''we
train them to be as polite and courteous as possible. My personal
advice is not to take it personally and keep smiling.''

<HEADLINE> Trader Rubdowns Rise in Popularity  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN POPE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- The Dow is falling and voices are rising on the
trading floor at Adams, Harkness, and Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Equity trading director Ben Marsh is shouting ''At 20~ I'm a
buyer!'' and ''Smith Barney's hitting it!'' across the trading room
floor. The daily wave of stress is about to crash.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, Jim Kilcoyne is on duty. He's an onsite massage
therapist.
</P>
<P>
   ''Up higher, on the back of my neck,'' Marsh tells him during a
brief pause in the action.
</P>
<P>
   Practitioners of onsite chair-massage say the recent stock
market volatility has ratcheted up stress and been a boon for
business.
</P>
<P>
   Companies, some of which subsidize the costs, get more relaxed
employees. And Kilcoyne and his fellow massage therapists get
access to their dream demographic: highly stressed people with
money to burn.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a 15-minute rubdown,'' said Marsh, who brought the idea
to Adams, Harkness and Hill's Boston office when he moved from New
York. ''It's like a boxer going back to his corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Kilcoyne -- oddly the only man in the trading room in a tie on
Wednesday -- unfolds a portable stand that props up Marsh at his
desk. A hole in the mask allows Marsh to breathe and see normally,
and he keeps right on trading through the rubdown. It's the closest
thing to a break he can afford.
</P>
<P>
   Once Kilcoyne finishes with Marsh, other traders get their
chance. The cost is $1 a minute.
</P>
<P>
   At the adjacent desk, trader Jeanne McCloskie said she hoped to
indulge later in the day, but only if she wasn't too busy to enjoy
it.
</P>
<P>
   ''The uncertainty of the markets can make you crazed,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kilcoyne is a laid-back, low-stress kind of guy. But after
realizing that a lot of other people aren't, he's making a pretty
good living off them. He hits several companies a week, sometimes
for as long as eight straight hours.
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Atkinson likewise says her Boston business, Backbeat, has
boomed amid the recent market volatility. She got into the onsite
massage business three years ago after several years of ''on the
table'' massage work.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think with all the mergers, people are just being asked to
do an unreasonable amount of work under a lot of pressure,'' said
Atkinson, who has several employees and said she often works from 7
a.m. until 11 p.m. ''In many cases, they don't even know whether
they're going to have a job next month.''
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Kier, an onsite massage therapist in suburban Chicago,
has added several new brokerage clients over the last two months,
during which the Dow and the Nasdaq recorded their wildest point
swings in history on record volume.
</P>
<P>
   ''A massage helps them deal with it better, because it releases
endorphins, which are the body's natural painkillers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there's been only a little friendly competition in the
budding industry. The companies refer clients to each other when
their schedules don't fit.
</P>
<P>
   Intense competition, Atkinson said, ''isn't good karma.''
</P>
<P>
   More intense competition may be inevitable, though.
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson said she regularly is called by curious strangers
looking to get into the business, and she's thinking of
franchising. There are few overhead expenses, so entrepreneurs face
few hurtles going into the business for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kilcoyne said there's no real reason to worry about the
client pool drying up.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's so much stress out there, there's no real reason to be
cutthroat,'' he says.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Close Lower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks closed lower Thursday following an
overnight retreat on Wall Street and ahead of a long holiday in
Japan. The dollar was higher against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 115.14 points,
or 0.63 percent, to close at 18,019.17 at the end of daily trading.
On Wednesday, the average closed down 138.02 points, or 0.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar was trading at 106.30 yen on the Tokyo foreign
exchange market Thursday, up 0.42 yen from late Wednesday and above
its late New York level of 106.27 yen overnight.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, Tokyo investors remained cautious about
prospects for the U.S. stock market. The U.S. Commerce Department
was to release the nation's gross domestic product for the first
quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Investors can't move before seeing U.S. data later Thursday,''
said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager at Tokyo Securities Co.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were also reluctant to buy on concern that U.S. stocks
could drop sharply during Japan's ''Golden Week,'' a series of
upcoming holidays over that virtually shuts the country down,
traders said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 179.32 points
to 10,945.50 at Wednesday's close. The Nasdaq composite index
closed at 3,630.09 points, down 81.14.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section closed down 23.67 points, or 1.42 percent, to
1,644.22. The TOPIX closed up 2.61 points, or 0.16 percent, the day
before.
</P>
<P>
   Turnover on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange
totaled an estimated 542.31 million shares, down from 551.86
million shares Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the broader market, the number of declining shares
overwhelmed advancers broadly. On the TSE First Section, 955 issues
fell, with 307 issues closing higher and 122 unchanged from
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, traders said some foreign investors bid up
the greenback against the yen in an attempt to cover losses in U.S.
stocks by selling Japanese shares.
</P>
<P>
   But trading was moderate ahead of the release of major economic
data in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar traded between 106.03 yen and 106.42 yen in Tokyo on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 97.98 yen, up from
97.60 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond was
unchanged from Wednesday's finish at 1.7350 percent. Its price
remained at 100.55.

<HEADLINE> Experts: Medical Privacy Laws Needed  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Health industry officials say congressional
action, and not regulations being proposed by the administration,
is the key to assuring confidentiality in the treatment of medical
records.
</P>
<P>
   At Senate health committee hearings Wednesday, witnesses argued
that rules drawn up by Health and Human Services Secretary Donna
Shalala were both not tough enough in protecting individual rights
and too tough in restricting the flow of information needed to
ensure that people get the best health care.
</P>
<P>
   ''The regulations are a good effort,'' said Charles Kahn III,
president of the Health Insurance Association of America. But
''their shortcomings point to why it's vitally important for
Congress to pass confidentiality legislation that protects both
consumers' medical records and their ability to receive
high-quality health care.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 health care law required Congress to approve medical
privacy legislation by August 1999 or, if that didn't happen,
compel the health secretary to draw up administrative rules.
</P>
<P>
   Led by health committee chairman Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., and
ranking Democrat Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, the Senate neared
a compromise last year but couldn't resolve differences over the
right to sue companies that violate privacy rights and privacy for
teen-agers getting abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala proposed the new regulations last November. After
receiving public comment, she is to announce the final rules later
this year. They would go into effect in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The rules limit disclosure of medical information to the
''minimum necessary,'' give patients the right to see their medical
records, require health care providers to write privacy contracts
with their business partners, and pre-empt weaker state privacy
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses before Jeffords' panel concurred with the aims of the
new rules but took issue with some of the details.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn said the ''minimum necessary'' standard for divulging
information was too narrow and ''would have a chilling effect on
detecting and reporting (medical) errors.''
</P>
<P>
   From a different perspective, Janlori Goldman, director of the
Health Privacy Project at Georgetown University, said the rules
give too little weight to individual rights because people can't
control the use and disclosure of health information used for
treatment, payment and health care operations.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Farmer, representing the Washington Business Group on
Health, said the rule on pre-empting weaker state laws was too
confusing, and without a uniform federal code ''the functioning and
administration of employer health-related programs could be placed
in serious jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joanna Horobin, speaking for the Biotechnology Industry
Organization, said too many restrictions on access to important
data ''will severely hurt medical research.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Hospital Association's John Houston also warned
that the rules could drive up health care costs and said the
''minimum necessary'' standard was too stringent. ''This is
completely at odds with good medical practice and is potentially
very dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Others noted that Shalala was limited in what she could impose
without congressional action. The rules cover only health care
providers, health plans and clearinghouses and apply only to
electronic data, not the paper records that make up most health
information.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congressional action would protect all health information,
however it is transmitted and wherever it exists,'' Kennedy said.

<HEADLINE> Minorities a Key Target for Census  </HEADLINE>
By DARA AKIKO WILLIAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Es Nuestro Futuro. Hagase Contar.
</P>
<P>
   That's Spanish for, ''nov yog peb lub caij nyoog yav tom ntej.
Tsis txhob tso nws tseg,'' which is Hmong for ''oja przysztosc. Nie
zawieszaj,'' which in Polish means ''This is our future. Don't
leave it blank.''
</P>
<P>
   These multilingual campaigns and the Census Bureau's first big
push to team with community groups are credited for a high response
rate in many California cities with ethnic minority populations
considered difficult to count.
</P>
<P>
   A tally showing exact response rates from different groups won't
be available until December, but mail-in numbers in several
California cities with large ethnic minority populations, such as
Modesto, Santa Ana, Compton and Anaheim, exceeded expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is probably one of the better and broader and most
consistent efforts I've seen,'' said Frank Berry, the Los
Angeles-based regional director for the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   A similar trend wasn't noticeable outside California. A check of
14 other cities nationwide with large or a majority of ethnic
minority population -- including Chicago, Atlanta and Tucson -- shows
that they fell short of their mail-in target rate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think California got the message they lost billions of
dollars in federal aid targeted to these low-income communities
that were significantly undercounted in 1990. I think (legislators)
were determined to not let that happen again,'' said Phil Sparks, a
spokesman for Census 2000 Initiative, a nonpartisan group that
provides agencies with census data.
</P>
<P>
   California could lose $5 billion in federal money over the next
10 years if there is an inaccurate count in urban counties,
according to a federal study released in March.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, about 900,000 people in California weren't counted,
most of them ethnic minorities, census officials said. That cost
the state some $2.2 billion in federal funds over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, the state dedicated $24.7 million to get a
more accurate count, including spending $8.7 million on
multilingual forums and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   In previous tallies, many ethnic minorities didn't realize the
importance of the census, and were suspicious of how the data were
used and how private the information stays, census officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Hortencia Arias, 45, is among those who didn't fill out
the 1980 or 1990 census form. An undocumented immigrant in
south-central Los Angeles, she feared it would adversely affect her
residency application.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau is prohibited by law from sharing individual
information, even with other government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of my ignorance in the past I hurt myself and the
community,'' said Hortencia, who is now a legal U.S. resident.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see the schools and how many children there are and not
enough teachers. And you'll go to the hospital and so many people
need attention and there's not enough doctors,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Census Bureau took a much more active role in
reaching out to community groups. It stressed confidentiality, the
importance of minority representation in the redrawing of political
districts and the availability of federal funds for everything from
transportation to education and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Besides posting fliers and billboards in multiple languages,
including Thai, Creole, Russian, Tagalog and Chinese, the bureau
and community groups held workshops and offered toll-free hot lines
to help answer questions about the census.
</P>
<P>
   Forms were also available in five languages other than English
and the bureau offered assistance guides in more than 40 languages.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1999, the Mexican-American Legal Defense and
Education Fund started a nationwide campaign -- going to schools,
union halls and community meetings to encourage people to fill out
the census. MALDEF also produced bilingual training booklets and
videos and commercials using prominent Latinos, including boxer
Oscar De La Hoya and talk show host Cristina Saralegui.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was also remarkable that this go around, a lot of elected
officials stressed the importance of the census,'' said Margaret
Leal-Sotelo, MALDEF's national census director. ''All those things
were very, very helpful. And that everyone had the same focus --
that this is important.''
</P>
<P>
   The mail-in deadline has passed and enumerators will begin today
visiting those who failed to return the forms.
</P>
<P>
   Loc Vu, the longtime director of the Indochinese Resettlement
and Cultural Center in San Jose, said more people have come to him
this year with questions about the census, a sign that they want to
be counted.
</P>
<P>
   The boom in Asian-language media has helped, too. Twenty years
ago, there were no radio or television stations broadcasting in
Vietnamese, while today there are several, including a 24-hour
radio station.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a lot of ways to reach out to our community by our own
language. That's the big difference,'' Vu said.

<HEADLINE> Taxpayers' Electronic Filing Rises  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The returns are in: Americans by the millions
are embracing technology when they prepare and file income taxes.
There were impressive increases this year in electronic filing,
credit card payments and direct bank deposits.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics released Wednesday by the Internal Revenue Service
show that people are growing increasingly comfortable with doing
their own taxes on home computers. The number of self-prepared
electronic returns received as of last Friday doubled to more than
4.9 million compared with the year before.
</P>
<P>
   The total of 35 million electronic returns -- most of them filed
by professional preparers -- was 1.4 million more than the IRS had
expected and represented a 20 percent increase over last year.
Electronically filed returns now make up 27 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are more used to computers,'' IRS Commissioner Charles
Rossotti said. ''Secondly, the software is getting very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Working toward a goal of 80 percent electronic filing by 2007,
the IRS has been aggressively promoting the advantages, such as
fewer mistakes and much faster processing of refunds. Rossotti said
the agency will continue expanding the number of taxpayers who can
use identification numbers in place of the signature form that is
still required for most who file electronically.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a little thing but it is still a barrier,'' Rossotti
said.
</P>
<P>
   This year, about 7 million taxpayers used the electronic
signature option, including 1.4 million who did their own returns.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has asked Congress to approve a $10 tax credit
for people who file electronically, which would cover the cost of
most electronic filing services. The IRS is also working with
industry on ways to allow people to prepare and file their taxes on
the Internet at no cost, Rossotti said.
</P>
<P>
   About 186,000 taxpayers have charged $536 million in taxes on
their American Express, Mastercard and Discover cards so far this
year. Both are huge increases over 1999, when about $184 million
was charged on credit cards in the first year of the program.
</P>
<P>
   There was a 200 percent increase in the number of people who
paid taxes through direct debits from bank accounts and 25 percent
more people had their refunds deposited directly, the IRS reported.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all this growth, an older piece of technology remained a
problem for the IRS. About 65 percent of all telephone calls have
gotten through so far this year, up from last year's dismal 50
percent level but far from adequate, despite 24-hour, 7-day
service, Rossotti said.
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti wants Congress to approve a 9.5 percent budget increase
that will enable the IRS to hire about 2,000 more employees for
customer service and to reverse a steep slide in enforcement. In
both cases, he said, technology will never fully replace people.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people who are trying to pay, we want them to get through
and get the help they need,'' Rossotti said. ''If they don't want
to pay, we don't want them to be able to shift the tax burden onto
their neighbors.''

<HEADLINE> Victims' Rights Bill Faces Battle  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An effort to amend the Constitution to protect
victims' rights is short of votes in the Senate, the Republican
sponsor says.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now it's an uphill battle to get 67 votes,'' Sen. Jon
Kyl, R-Ariz., said Wednesday. ''It may be a bridge too far.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers return to the subject today. A vote could come later
in the day.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday started debating an amendment that would
enshrine rights for victims of violent crime or their families.
Those rights would include reasonable notice of court proceedings
and an offender's release or escape, the right to attend and be
heard at legal proceedings and court-ordered restitution.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds majorities in the House and Senate are needed for
passage. The amendment would also need to be ratified by
three-fourths of state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   The House has yet to take up the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents have said they support the concept but believe the
same guarantees can be written into law without tinkering with the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ''I must say I am very concerned about the cavalier attitude
which I have observed with respect to the offering of
constitutional amendments,'' said Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.V., in a
speech that lasted nearly three hours. ''There is a cavalier spirit
which seems to say that if it sounds good politically, if it looks
good politically, if it will get votes, let's introduce an
amendment to the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters, however, said the amendment is needed to balance
constitutional protections that suspects and criminals receive.
Thirty-two states have enacted some form of victims' rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we've given statutes plenty of opportunity,'' Kyl
said. ''They haven't gotten the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., one of the sponsors of the
amendment, agreed. ''The reason the statute won't work is because
it hasn't worked,'' she told senators at one point.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein and Kyl spent much of Wednesday negotiating for the
measure even as support began to wane. Sen. Daniel Inouye,
D-Hawaii, asked to be removed as one of 42 co-sponsors, Kyl said.
</P>
<P>
   The two also offered to make several changes to get the support
of President Clinton, Kyl said. Clinton, while having no direct
role in amending the Constitution, has said he supports a victims'
rights amendment but has reservations about the current proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters hoped gaining his support would sway other Democrats
but ''it doesn't appear to me, even if we write it the way they
want to write it, they're going to become strong advocates,'' Kyl
said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials released a letter sent Tuesday to
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, saying, ''Although we continue
to strongly support a victims' rights amendment to the Constitution
... we oppose the amendment in its current form.''

<HEADLINE> Gun Group Alleges Trade Conspiracy  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHEPARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seven gun makers and an industry group are
suing the federal government and others over a plan to give
purchasing preference to the only gun manufacturer that signed an
agreement to design safer guns.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit by the manufacturers and National Shooting Sports
Foundation is against the federal Housing and Urban Development
Department, 16 communities and the attorneys general of New York
and Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo called the lawsuit frivolous and
defended the effort to give preference to Smith &AMP; Wesson when
purchasing firearms for law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''After the Smith &AMP; Wesson agreement, there are two types of gun
manufacturers: safe and unsafe,'' Cuomo said in a statement.
''Working with law enforcement, we prefer to do business with the
safe manufacturers.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit filed in an Atlanta federal court Wednesday alleges
an illegal conspiracy in restraint of trade.
</P>
<P>
   In March, President Clinton announced a landmark gun safety
agreement with Smith &AMP; Wesson that included the installation of gun
locks on all the weapons it sells, the introduction within three
years of ''smart gun'' technology, and barring sales of its weapons
at gun shows without a background check.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Smith &AMP; Wesson was to be dropped from
lawsuits against gun makers that were being contemplated by federal
officials and some cities. Any other gun maker that agreed to the
plan would also be given preferential treatment, but so far none
has joined Smith &AMP; Wesson.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are demanding cities stop the effort of using their
purchasing power to control the distribution and design of
firearms,'' said Jeff Reh, general counsel for Beretta U.S.A. Corp,
one of the seven suing companies.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit names as defendants New York Attorney General Eliot
Spitzer and Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who
helped draw up the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''This action is preposterous, false and unfounded and an insult
to law enforcement,'' Blumenthal said. ''It is plainly an effort to
deceive and confuse the public, and distract law enforcement
officials from the work of improving gun safety and stopping
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Also named were the California communities of San Francisco,
Berkeley, East Palo Alto, Inglewood, Oakland, and San Mateo; as
well as Bridgeport, Conn.; Atlanta; Miami-Dade County, Fla.; Gary,
Ind.; Boston; Detroit; St. Louis; Newark, N.J.; Philadelphia; and
the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport Mayor Joseph Ganim called the lawsuit, ''a desperate
move by the gun makers to try and prevent us from doing what is the
right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They continue to forget that our only goal is to protect
children and families, and their only goal is to protect corporate
profits and greed,'' Ganim said.
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Delfay, president of the National Shooting Sports
Foundation, said local officials ''have tried everything from
litigation to economic extortion to compel compliance on a national
level with their own individual ideas about gun design, ownership
and distribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the lawsuit from Capitol Hill was swift and
partisan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am disappointed that some gun manufacturers have chosen
confrontation over cooperation,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg,
D-N.J. ''The federal government isn't asking for much, only that
these companies help adopt common sense measures to keep guns from
ending up in the wrong hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said the Clinton administration
overstepped its authority.
</P>
<P>
   ''From the allegations of the complaint filed today ... it now
appears the administration seeks to further its goals by
circumventing the will of Congress and illegitimately bringing the
weight of the executive branch to bear on law-abiding firearm
manufacturers,'' Hatch said.

<HEADLINE> Scout at Center of Gay Policy Fury  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Walking with his lawyer and parents, James
Dale ignored the anti-gay activists who followed him across the
Supreme Court's broad marble plaza.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know you're hurting. I see it in your eyes,'' said Joel
Gaines of Manassas, Va., shadowing Dale.
</P>
<P>
   ''Save yourself from this awful, horrible lifestyle!'' yelled
Philip Benham of Dallas, president of the anti-abortion group
Operation Rescue. ''Mr. Dale, Jesus will set you free!''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Martino of Washington stood with a cross and a large sign
declaring, ''A homosexual Boy Scout leader is like asking a fox to
guard the chickens.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale has seen and heard such statements before and says they do
not affect him.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only person I am is me, and I've always been true to
myself, and I think that's the most important thing,'' he said,
addressing a mob of reporters and curious tourists after the court
heard arguments in his case against the Boy Scouts of America.
</P>
<P>
   Expelled as a scouting supervisor in 1990 when the Boy Scouts
learned he was gay, the Eagle Scout two years later launched a
legal challenge to the scout's claim that gay people do not meet
the organization's standard of ''morally straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale said he was taught the phrase applied to how scouts treat
other people, not to sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what being 'morally straight' is all about: standing up
for yourself and being honest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, in the courtroom, Dale sat silently and watched as
justices struggled over whether to let the Boy Scouts bar
homosexuals from serving as troop leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Without saying how they will ultimately vote, several justices
voiced skepticism about how far the court could go to force open
admissions upon private organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ''In your view, a Catholic organization has to admit Jews'' and
''a Jewish organization has to admit Catholics,'' Justice Stephen
G. Breyer told Evan Wolfson, Dale's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and David H. Souter followed
Breyer's line of questioning, asking Wolfson whether his argument
meant the Scouts could be required to admit girls.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1910, the Scouts have an oath and law that long have
required members to promise to be ''clean'' and ''morally
straight.'' But no written rule specifically addresses
homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson said the Scouts are not primarily an ''anti-gay
organization'' and therefore Dale's presence did not burden the
group's message.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's highest court ruled that the Boy Scouts' ban on gay
troop leaders violated a state prohibition on discrimination in
public accommodations. But the Scouts say the state law violates
the organization's rights of free speech and free association under
the Constitution's First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Some justices also had pointed questions for the Scouts' lawyer,
George Davidson.
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens asked whether a homosexual could be
excluded if he did not publicly declare his sexual orientation but
it was discovered against his wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, said Davidson, arguing that the organization had a right
''to choose the moral leaders for the children in the program.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courthouse, Dale thanked his parents, Gerald and
Doris Dick of Middletown, N.J., for their support. Dale changed his
last name before the controversy arose.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're proud of him,'' Mrs. Dick said.
</P>
<P>
   Both of Dale's parents were active in the scouts until their
son's expulsion. His father, a lieutenant colonel in the Army
Reserve, was a scouting commissioner, and his mother was a den
mother.
</P>
<P>
   Dale, 29, lives in New York City and is advertising director for
a magazine for people who are HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have always loved the Boy Scouts of America,'' he said.
''It's a program that I hold dear to my heart, and I hope to one
day be able to be back in the program.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Address Memorial Service  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The memory of civil rights leader Daisy
Bates stands tall in the eyes of President Clinton. He was just 11
when she counseled nine black students who strode into an all-white
high school here and inched America toward desegregated schools.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the president was addressing a memorial service for
Bates, who died Nov. 4 at the age of 84 after a lifetime of civil
rights work.
</P>
<P>
   On the day Bates died, Clinton said her death will ''leave a
vacuum in the civil rights community, the state of Arkansas and our
country.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day of her funeral, the president was in Washington
praising the courage of the black students, known as the Little
Rock Nine, as they accepted the Congressional Gold Medal.
</P>
<P>
   Whites rioted outside Central High School in 1957 when National
Guardsmen, on orders from Gov. Orval Faubus, turned the nine
students away. President Eisenhower sent in Army troops to escort
the students to class. It was a clear sign that Washington was
going to enforce the 1954 Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of
Education that school segregation was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Before and after their tense days at school, the nine black
students took solace at Bates' home. She was their mentor, advising
them how to stand up to intimidation and physical threats.
</P>
<P>
   About a decade ago, Bates said: ''I'm 75 and a half. But I'm not
too tired to stand and do what I can for the cause I believe in. I
would like to see, before I die, that blacks and whites and
Christians can all get together.''
</P>
<P>
   Her wish is not yet reality.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton visited Arkansas following a trip Wednesday to
Whiteville, N.C., where he stressed the need to enhance Internet
access across America, but especially in rural communities.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday evening, he flew to Little Rock where he was
greeted at the airport by friends and local and state officials. He
briefly visited to the home of first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's
mother and then dined on red snapper with cucumber salsa and
saffron rice with former U.S. Sens David Pryor and Dale Bumpers,
who met him at a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also planned to speak today at a noon dedication of the
University of Arkansas at Little Rock Law School and later attend a
reception for the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities
at the Arkansas Arts Center.

<HEADLINE> Cartoons Go Three-Dimensional  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- From Superman to Batman, Popeye to Dick
Tracy, Hollywood has a long history of transforming comic-book and
cartoon characters into flesh and blood.
</P>
<P>
   The trend shows no sign of slowing, as studios prepare to bring
live-action versions of the Flintstones, the X-men, the Grinch and
Rocky and Bullwinkle to the big screen in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas'' kicks off the latest
round of cinematic cartoons when it opens Friday. The second
live-action movie about the modern stone age family, it recounts
the early romance of Fred and Wilma and Barney and Betty.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a huge fan of the cartoon when I was kid,'' said Stephen
Baldwin, who plays Barney Rubble in the new flick. ''It's kind of
coincidental because Barney was my favorite character, because he
was seemingly the dopey guy who usually had the solution or answer
in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie co-stars Mark Addy as Fred, Kristen Johnston as Wilma,
Jane Krakowski as Betty and Joan Collins as Fred's mother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Adaptations of two-dimensional characters pose a challenge for
filmmakers, who must try to satisfy fiercely loyal fans of the
originals while fleshing out the material for wider audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we do our jobs right, audiences will love these characters
not just as cartoon characters but as people,'' said Brian Levant,
who directed the new Flintstones movie and its 1994 predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   One of the challenges facing the makers of ''X-men'' is dealing
with nearly 40 years of comic-book devotion to the intrepid band of
mutants.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has been abuzz with chat and pre-emptive carping.
</P>
<P>
   Though many fans seem pleased with much of the casting --
particularly Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen as lead mutants
Professor X and Magneto, respectively -- there are some devotees who
have been critical of how characters look in the movie's trailers.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're very passionate people,'' said ''X-men'' director
Bryan Singer.
</P>
<P>
   McKellen even has his own ''X-men'' site where he provides
information about the film, dispels rumors and offers reassurances
that the movie will adhere to the comic book's spirit despite a
modern, more realistic look to the costumes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I caution people to wait and see the movie,'' McKellan said.
''If they don't like it, they should go make their own movie, or
just stay with the original comic.''
</P>
<P>
   Competing for your cartoon movie dollars this summer will be
''The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle,'' featuring
computer-generated versions of the moose and flying squirrel.
Co-starring as their real-life nemeses are Robert De Niro as
Fearless Leader, Jason Alexander as Boris Badenov and Rene Russo as
Natasha.
</P>
<P>
   ''These characters are part of our pop culture,'' said ''Rocky
and Bullwinkle'' director Des McAnuff. ''It's great to revisit
them, and for people with fond memories of the characters, you
hopefully want to spend 90 minutes with them in a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming in time for the holidays will be ''Dr. Seuss' How the
Grinch Stole Christmas,'' starring Jim Carrey and directed by Ron
Howard, and ''102 Dalmatians,'' the second live-action flick based
on Disney's animated classic.
</P>
<P>
   In the works over the next few years are live-action takes on
other Marvel comics, including Spider-man and the Incredible Hulk.
Also planned is a live-action movie of Josie and the Pussycats,
based on the comic-book and cartoon series about an all-girl rock
band.

<HEADLINE> Some Drug Prices Top Inflation Rate  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prices for drugs that older Americans use most
often jumped higher than the rate of inflation last year, says an
advocacy group's study. President Clinton cited the findings today
to promote his proposal to add prescription drug coverage to
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ''Seniors living on fixed incomes simply can't cope with these
kinds of price increases forever,'' Clinton said. ''That's why we
should take action to help them, and do it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Democratic congressional leaders released the report
at the White House to highlight soaring drug prices and call on
Congress to pass legislation giving all Medicare beneficiaries
coverage for their medicines -- an idea opposed by Republicans, who
say aid should go to the neediest seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the GOP proposal does not go far enough. ''It would
do nothing for those seniors with modest, middle-class incomes
between $15,000 and $50,000,'' he said in a Roosevelt Room ceremony
flanked by Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., and House
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you are dealing with drug prices increasing two, three
times the rate of inflation, the impact is extraordinary,
especially for a population that is living on a fixed income,''
said Ron Pollack, president of Families USA, which commissioned the
study. The group, which advocates universal health coverage for all
Americans, supports Clinton's drug benefit proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The study shows that wholesale prices for 50 prescriptions
frequently used by seniors rose by 3.9 percent last year, faster
than the overall rate of inflation at the retail level, which the
government reported at 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for all prescription drugs jumped 5.8 percent in 1999,
government figures show.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs common to seniors have soared 30 percent on average since
1994, according to the group's study.
</P>
<P>
   Drug industry officials said the report exaggerates drug price
increases. A government measure of wholesale prices found that
prices for all prescription drugs went up only 1.3 percent last
year, said Jackie Cottrell, spokeswoman for the Pharmaceutical
Research and Manufacturers of America, an industry group.
</P>
<P>
   Families USA zeroed in on medicines most important to seniors to
highlight what Pollack says is the need for a broad drug insurance
program that will help all elderly Americans -- who are living
longer and whose doctors are increasingly treating with drugs -- to
deal with soaring prices at the pharmacy window.
</P>
<P>
   The study showed the wholesale price for a year's supply of
furosemide, a generic used to treat hypertension and congestive
heart failure, doubled to $57 as of January compared to its price a
year before.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of a year's supply of Klor-Con 10, used as a potassium
replacement, jumped nearly 44 percent to $286 from $199, the report
said. Yearly price increases for other drugs cited in the report
include:
</P>
<P>
   --Glucophage, a diabetes drug, rose to $708 from $661.
</P>
<P>
   --Procardia, a hypertension drug, increased to $901 from $874
</P>
<P>
   --Premarin, used for estrogen replacement, rose to $208 from
$186.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants to add drug coverage to Medicare as an option for
all Americans age 65 or older. Administration officials say rising
drug prices are a problem for all seniors and want a broad plan --
costing $195 billion over 10 years -- for 39 million Medicare
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   They are locked in a heated debate with congressional Republican
leaders who believe drug coverage should go to low-income Americans
who need it most. Republicans say there's no reason to give drug
benefits to the millions of Medicare beneficiaries who already have
some type of coverage through HMOs or retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders earlier this month unveiled the outlines of a drug
proposal calling for private health plans to offer drug benefits
and government subsidies to pay drug costs for low-income seniors.
Most of the $40 billion they have earmarked for a five-year
overhaul of Medicare would go toward the drug plan, GOP lawmakers
said.

<HEADLINE> Body found in case of kidnapped computer expert  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRICK, N.J. (AP) -- Authorities found a body in the search for a
British computer expert who has been missing for ten days but
wouldn't confirm it was that of Paul Jeffrey Gale.
</P>
<P>
   Gale was abducted from his hotel room in Kentucky by a New
Jersey man upset because Gale was dating his former lover,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The agents have recovered a body. But we have not received
medical reports that it is the body of Paul Jeffrey Gale,'' said
Sandra Carrol, special agent and spokeswoman of the Newark FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Kentucky in a statement yesterday said the corpse
belonged to Gale.
</P>
<P>
   Carrol said the corpse was found yesterday at about 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of federal agents converged on a cul-de-sac at the end of
a road two miles from the home of Gregory J. Marcinski. Marcinski,
23, a volunteer emergency medical technician, was charged last week
in Kentucky with kidnapping Gale, who had been dating Marcinski's
ex-girlfriend. He also was charged with impersonating an FBI agent.
Federal court documents indicate Marcinski flashed an EMT badge and
computer-generated FBI credentials to gain access to Gale's room at
the Holiday Inn in Florence, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   The British man's relatives, who came to the United States after
the man disappeared 10 days ago, were notified of the search.
</P>
<P>
   Gale, a 28-year-old Naples, Fla., resident, recently lived in
Mount Laurel, where he worked as a computer programmer for TRW
Integrated Supply. He was working for TRW in Kentucky this month as
a consultant in the merger of two pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   Gale was reported missing April 17 by a friend and business
associate.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Marcinski became enraged Gale had been dating
his ex-girlfriend and drove his grandmother's Buick 800 miles to
confront Gale.
</P>
<P>
   Marcinski identified himself as Special Agent ''Trimble'' and
handcuffed Gale before placing him in the front seat of the Buick
early morning on April 17, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Gale's girlfriend, Darla Guidie, who had previously dated
Marcinski, told the FBI that Marcinski made the fake ID on his
computer and ''bragged that he had gotten the format for the phony
FBI credentials off of the Internet,'' according to affidavits.
</P>
<P>
   Marcinski, a member of the Community First Aid Squad and a
self-employed computer technician, was arrested last August when
another ex-girlfriend told police he assaulted her and grabbed her
new boyfriend by the neck, pushing him to the floor, the Asbury
Park Press reported in today's editions.
</P>
<P>
   Marcinski was being held without bail in Trenton, awaiting
extradition to Kentucky.

<HEADLINE> Court Hears Gay Scout Leaders Case  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supreme Court justices struggled Wednesday
over whether to let the Boy Scouts bar homosexuals from serving as
troop leaders, role models in an organization that teaches its
members to be ''morally straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Without saying how they will ultimately vote, several justices
voiced skepticism about how far the court could go to force open
admissions upon private organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ''In your view, a Catholic organization has to admit Jews'' and
''a Jewish organization has to admit Catholics,'' Justice Stephen
G. Breyer told Evan Wolfson, the lawyer for James Dale of New
Jersey, a former assistant scoutmaster ousted when the organization
learned he is gay. Dale subsequently filed suit against the Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and David H. Souter followed
Breyer's line of questioning, asking Wolfson whether his argument
meant the Scouts could be required to admit girls.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia voiced his reservations another way.
</P>
<P>
   ''They think that homosexuality is immoral,'' he said, asking
why the Scouts must accept as a leader ''someone who embodies a
contradiction of their message?''
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1910, the Scouts have an oath and law that long have
required members to promise to be ''clean'' and ''morally
straight.'' But no written rule specifically addresses
homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson said the Scouts are not primarily an ''anti-gay
organization'' and therefore Dale's presence did not burden the
group's message.
</P>
<P>
   Dale did not seek to use his leadership position to advocate
homosexuality, Wolfson added.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's highest court ruled that the Boy Scouts' ban on gay
troop leaders violated a state prohibition on discrimination in
public accommodations. But the Scouts say the state law violates
the organization's rights of free speech and free association under
the Constitution's First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Some justices also had pointed questions for the Scouts' lawyer,
George Davidson.
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens asked whether a homosexual could be
excluded if he did not publicly declare his sexual orientation but
it was discovered against his wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, said Davidson, arguing that the organization had a right
''to choose the moral leaders for the children in the program.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Boy Scouting is so closely identified with traditional moral
values that the phrase, 'He's a real Boy Scout,' has entered the
language,'' Davidson said. The Scouts believe homosexuality does
not fit that moral code, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Souter told Davidson, ''Mr. Dale is not asking to carry a
banner. He's saying, 'I'm not going to carry a banner.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dale and his parents attended the argument, and he spoke
afterward to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have always loved the Boy Scouts of America,'' he said.
''It's a program that I hold dear to my heart, and I hope to one
day be able to be back in the program.'' Being morally straight
means ''standing up for yourself and being honest,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's argument was the last for the court's current term,
and the justices are expected to decide by July whether the Scouts
had the right to revoke Dale's role as a troop leader.
</P>
<P>
   Dale was 19 and an assistant scoutmaster of a Matawan, N.J.,
troop when in 1990 he was identified in a newspaper article as
co-president of a campus lesbian and gay student group at Rutgers
University.
</P>
<P>
   The Scouts' Monmouth Council revoked Dale's registration as an
adult leader, telling him the organization does not allow openly
gay members.
</P>
<P>
   Dale sued, contending the Scouts violated New Jersey's
anti-discrimination law.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia told Wolfson that if the court ruled in favor of his
argument that gays cannot be banned because the Scouts' overall
message is not anti-homosexual, it may ''induce them to become more
openly and avowedly opposed to homosexual conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson said the Scouts may not want to do so because they could
lose heterosexuals who would not support an anti-gay policy.
</P>
<P>
   Giving public accommodations broad freedom to exclude people the
organization believes do not match its message could ''swallow the
civil rights laws,'' Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
   Breyer and Justice Anthony M. Kennedy questioned how courts
should determine whether a policy was central enough to a group's
goals to allow exclusion of people who oppose the policy.

<HEADLINE> European Bank Raises Interest Rates  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- The European Central Bank raised interest rates by
a quarter percentage point today for the 11 countries using the
beleaguered euro currency. The euro sank to a new low against the
U.S. dollar after the decision was announced.
</P>
<P>
   The Frankfurt-based bank pushed its main lending rate up to 3.75
percent, along with raising its other two key rates by a
quarter-point.
</P>
<P>
   ECB leaders had indicated an interest rate hike was imminent,
but still analysts had been split on whether the 17-member
governing board would make a move this week or hold off until its
next meeting in early May. The bank last increased its rates by a
quarter-point March 16, and enacted an earlier quarter-point
increase on Feb. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The bank had been conflicted by the euro's decline to new lows
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Market watchers said the bank had to be careful to avoid the
impression it was panicking after the euro hit a new record low of
91.62 cents on Tuesday. At the same time, other analysts said that
doing nothing would create the impression that the ECB doesn't
care.
</P>
<P>
   The euro has been in a downward spiral since its introduction
last year, plunging almost 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the ECB's rate decision, the euro hit a new record
low against the U.S. dollar of 91.5 cents, compared with 92.37
cents late Wednesday in New York and around 92.17 cents today in
Europe before the rate announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The ECB said it made the decision to continue ''its policy of
reacting to upside risks to price stability in the medium term in a
pre-emptive manner.''
</P>
<P>
   The bank also stuck by its opinion that the euro's current
weakness contradicts the underlying strength of the European
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governing council discussed recent movements in the
exchange rates between the major currencies, including the recent
decline of the euro, and examined their possible implications for
price stability in the euro area,'' the bank said in a statement.
''The ECB judges that the present level of the euro does not
reflect the strong economic fundamentals of the euro area.''
</P>
<P>
   The ECB had earlier been insistent that the weakness of the euro
was not its concern. But as the euro has continued its dive, the
bank started to warn that the currency's fall was also becoming a
threat to inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The ECB acknowledged today that the euro's rate was a continuing
worry, saying it was concerned about ''upside risks to price
stability which, given the prospects for strong economic expansion,
arise from strong growth in monetary and credit aggregates, as well
as from the present level of the exchange rate of the euro.''
</P>
<P>
   The ECB's main goal is maintaining price stability, and it is
charged with keeping inflation under 2 percent under its own rules.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, the EU statistical office said average inflation
in the euro-zone countries rose to 2.1 percent in March -- the
highest since the euro currency was launched Jan. 1, 1999. An
overheating economy can spur inflation, and raising interest rates
tends to cool things off by making it more expensive to borrow
money.
</P>
<P>
   EU politicians have also insisted that the euro's decline
reflects the strength of the U.S. economy. Still, analysts say that
a perceived stubbornness on the part of European economies to make
structural reforms has also added to the euro's woes.
</P>
<P>
   That's on top of the ECB also still working to gain respect.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier today, France's finance minister said a rate hike
wouldn't do anything to help the euro.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my view, it isn't with a strong increase in interest rates
that we will solve this problem,'' Laurent Fabius said in an
interview with French radio station RTL.
</P>
<P>
   Showing market participants that the ''European economic
situation is improving strongly'' is the solution to the euro's
current weakness, he said.

<HEADLINE> Tentative settlement in 4-month strike  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NYACK, N.Y. (AP) -- Striking nurses reached a tentative agreement
today with Nyack Hospital that could end a bitter 4-month-old
walkout.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Kriz, spokeswoman for the hospital, and Mark Genovese of
the New York State Nurses Association said the agreement was
reached just after 3 a.m., 12 hours into a bargaining session.
</P>
<P>
   They said the two sides had agreed not to release details of the
agreement until the nurses vote on ratification. That vote is
scheduled for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement came three days after all but four of the 425
striking nurses disregarded a hospital ultimatum that could have
cost them their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital had said it would begin hiring permanent
replacements for any nurse who did not return to work then.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, nurses chanted ''Unity!'' on their picket line and
shouted 'Scab!' at potential replacements.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was our feeling that the hospital was more willing to
settle after they saw the nurses were not intimidated by their
attempt to replace them,'' Genovese said. ''We're very proud of the
nurses for standing together.''
</P>
<P>
   Kriz said the nurses' bargaining committee had recommended
ratification. Meanwhile, the picket line that lasted through the
entire winter will stay up, Genovese said.
</P>
<P>
   Though the details were not released, Genovese said there must
have been movement on three issues: merit pay, vacation and
staffing levels.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital had proposed shifting much of the pay scale to a
merit system rather than seniority. Each nurse would get a 10
percent raise over the five years of the proposed contract, but
some could get 22.5 percent depending on their evaluations. The
nurses wanted pay to be based on seniority to avoid management
whims.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital also wanted to trim the number of paid days off,
including vacation and sick days, from 45 to 40.
</P>
<P>
   The union, complaining that a heavy work load could endanger
patient care, wanted guaranteed nurse-to-patient ratios and less
forced overtime.

<HEADLINE> 5 Win British Mobile Phone Licenses  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE STANLEY, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Four established British phone companies and a
Canadian newcomer emerged today as the winners in an auction for
Britain's next generation of mobile phone licenses.
</P>
<P>
   The auction, which reaped a $35.6 billion bonanza for the
British treasury, ended when NTL Mobile dropped out of the
competition after eight weeks and 150 rounds of bidding.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called third generation licenses represent precious
slices of Britain's airwave spectrum and give the winners a stake
in what's expected to be the hottest segment of the wireless
market.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the licenses now in use, they will enable wireless
companies to send far more information to a cell phone,
transforming the device into a mobile personal computer that can
roam the Internet, display video and provide constant access to
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The winners include four established players in the British
market: British Telecommunications; Vodafone AirTouch; One2One
Personal Communications, which is owned by Germany's Deutsche
Telekom; and Orange 3G, a unit of Germany's Mannesmann that will be
sold when Vodafone acquires the German company.
</P>
<P>
   TIW UMTS (UK) of Canada won License A, the fifth and most
powerful of those being offered. The government's
Radiocommunications Agency reserved this license for a newcomer,
hoping to stimulate greater competition in the mobile phone market.
</P>
<P>
   Trade Secretary Stephen Byers said that the auction will ensure
that Britain maintains its position as a leader in wireless
communications and represents a vital step toward his goal of
making the country ''the best place in the world for e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   The licenses, which take effect in 2002, are good for 20 years
and payable over the first 10 years. Bidding began on March 6, with
each company depositing just $158 million.
</P>
<P>
   The bidding far exceeded initial expectations and forced eight
of the original 13 bidders to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone paid the most for a license -- $9.5 billion -- followed
by final bids from TIW of $7.0 billion and Orange of $6.5 billion.
BT and One2One will each pay $6.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Grindle, an industry analyst at investment bank Dresdner
Kleinwort Benson, said the high cost of the licenses will
inevitably be reflected to some extent in the charges that the
companies assess their customers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The money doesn't stop there. They have to build up the
networks as well,'' he said, estimating that each of the five
winners will have to invest up to $4.7 billion on equipment and
services. ''It's a long-term game.''
</P>
<P>
   The auction has inspired Germany and other countries that are
planning to put their own third-generation licenses up for bid. The
larger size of Germany's population suggests the auction there
could exceed the size of Britain's.
</P>
<P>
   The treasury plans to use the proceeds to repay part of the
national debt.

<HEADLINE> Ford To Pay $1M Clean Air Penalty  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. will pay a $1.1 million penalty as
part of a settlement of alleged violations of the Clean Air Act,
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's consent decree with the EPA and the Justice Department
covers the Wayne Assembly and Michigan Truck Assembly plants, both
in Wayne, and the Dearborn Assembly plant in Dearborn.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Ford must pay one-third of the $1.1 million
penalty to the federal government, one-third to the state and
one-third to Wayne County.
</P>
<P>
   The consent decree incorporates Ford's plan to close Dearborn
Assembly by Oct. 31 and move its operations to a new plant being
built next to the existing facility.
</P>
<P>
   It also acknowledges that Ford has obtained required permits,
installed pollution control equipment and taken other measures to
comply with clean air rules at Wayne Assembly and Michigan Truck
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a $12 million environmental project, Ford will
install a waterborne primer system at the new Dearborn Assembly
plant that will replace a previously permitted solvent-based primer
system.
</P>
<P>
   The new system is designed to significantly reduce emissions of
volatile organic compounds, which combine in the air with other
chemicals on warm, sunny days to form ground-level ozone, or smog,
the EPA said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Detroit area achieved the health-based standard for ozone
in March 1995 after being out of compliance since the 1970s,'' said
Bharat Mathur, director of EPA's regional Air and Radiation
Division.
</P>
<P>
   ''EPA's goal is to ensure that Detroit continues to have air
quality that meets this health-based standard.''
</P>
<P>
   A telephone message left with Ford official Terry Bresnihan was
not immediately returned late Wednesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average is down 149
points in today's early going. Losing issues on the New York Stock
Exchange hold an 8-3 lead over gainers.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index is off 115 points and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 Stock Index is down 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's early tumble comes courtesy of some new readings
on the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   Those readings show the economy remained rather strong in the
first quarter, while inflationary pressures began to build.
</P>
<P>
   News of inflation is never received very well on Wall Street
because it tends to cut into the return on most investments.
</P>
<P>
   And it also suggests that the Federal Reserve will have to
engineer more interest rate hikes to prevent inflationary pressures
from building even further.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the economic news, shares in AT&AMP;T's wireless unit
begin trading today on the NYSE, after the biggest initial public
offering in U.S. history.

<HEADLINE> Workers Defy Daewoo Strike Order  </HEADLINE>
By JAE-SUK YOO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Defying the central labor union's call
for a full-scale strike, thousands of rank-and-file workers of
Daewoo Motor Co.'s second plant kept their assembly lines open
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The disobedience showed a deep crack in the months long struggle
by Daewoo union leaders against plans by creditor banks to sell the
ailing automaker to a foreign investor.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at Daewoo's main plant in Bupyong west of Seoul have
been on partial or full-scale strikes since Feb. 15 to oppose the
planned sale. They fear mass layoffs under foreign ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Police on Tuesday raided the main plant and arrested 20 labor
activists. All but seven were later released. Those under detention
included Chu Young-ho, the union's top leader and organizer of the
strike outlawed by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Angered by the arrest of their leaders, 7,500 workers of the
main plant suspended all operations and pledged to step up
protests.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, 500 Daewoo workers tried to march to a district
police headquarters near their main plant. When blocked by riot
police, the workers hurled eggs and rocks into the compound.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports of arrests.
</P>
<P>
   After the Tuesday police raid, the company's central labor union
ordered a full-scale strike which also should involve its second
plant in Kusan on the southwest coast.
</P>
<P>
   But 3,000 workers in Kusan ignored the order and kept their
assembly lines running.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Kunsan plant is only five years old and won't be affected
by foreign takeover, but the plant in Bupyong is over 30 years old
and may likely be closed,'' said Park Jin-ho, an official from
Daewoo's labor-management cooperation office.
</P>
<P>
   He said a foreign buyer would like to relocate the outdated
facilities in Bupyong to Kusan where land and other prices are
cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo's main plant has an annual capacity of 500,000 vehicles
and its second plant can produce 30,000 vehicles a year.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo Motor, South Korea's third largest car firm, is in
financial trouble after its parent conglomerate, Daewoo Group,
collapsed under huge debts last year.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo's creditors have invited international bidding to sell
the carmaker to a foreign investor by September. General Motors
Corp. and Ford Motor Co. are reportedly the leading contenders in
the bidding called in February.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at South Korea's two other main carmakers -- Hyundai
Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp. -- staged a one-week joint strike
early this month in support of Daewoo workers.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that foreign carmakers will encroach upon the local
market and sharpen competition. Hyundai, which took over Kia last
year, controls over 70 percent of the local market.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 154; Nasdaq Down 78  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply in early trading today after
a widely watched economic report showed wage pressures are rising
and suggested that the Federal Reserve is likely to continue
raising interest rates to contain inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But a broad selloff was averted by a report on the gross
domestic product that showed slightly lower-than-expected growth.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 164.74 at 10,780.76.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also down. The Nasdaq composite
index was down 78.98 at 3,551.11 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 26.06 at 1,434.93.
</P>
<P>
   Traders had nervously anticipated today's economic reports,
fearful that one or both would show that the economy was growing
much too fast for the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   The reports confirmed that the economy is on a tear. The gross
domestic product grew at a 5.4 percent annual rate during the first
three months of 2000, the Commerce Department said today. But many
economists had anticipated a 6 percent growth rate.
</P>
<P>
   The more troubling statistic to inflation-wary traders: the
Employment Cost Index. In the first quarter, the index rose 1.4
percent, the biggest quarterly advance in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Economists fear that rising wage pressures will stimulate
inflation, prompting more and steeper interest rate increases by
the Fed. Higher interest rates are generally bad for stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which are most sensitive to inflation, led the
Dow lower. American Express fell 3 7/16 to 151 3/16 and J.P. Morgan
fell 4 3/8 to 130 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's wireless business made a modest debut in trading on the
New York Stock Exchange, rising from an offering price of 29 1/2 to
30 7/16. The tracking stock is the largest initial public offering
in history, with 360 million shares valued at a total of $10.26
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-3 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 167.97 million
shares, ahead of Wednesday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 7.42 to 476.82.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.6 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's Xetra DAX index was down 2.6 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 1.8 percent, and France's CAC-40 was
down 2.8 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced
this morning that he has prostate cancer and indicated the disease
could affect his plans to run for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was diagnosed yesterday with prostate cancer. It's a
treatable form of prostate cancer,'' said Giuliani, 55, whose
father died of the disease in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how it would affect his run for the U.S. Senate against
Hillary Rodham Clinton, he said: ''I have no idea. ... I hope that
I'd be able to run, but the choice that I'm going to make is going
to be based on the treatment that's going to give me the best
chance to have a complete cure.''
</P>
<P>
   When pressed on whether he would continue his campaign he said:
''I don't think it's fair to answer questions about the Senate race
right now. ... Should I do it? Would I be able to do it the right
way? I hope that's the case but I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Treatment options include radiation and chemotherapy. ''Some
forms of treatment would require taking some time off,'' he
acknowledged, but said he didn't expect it to be a significant
amount of time.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor smiled frequently during the announcement and joked
with reporters. Asked whether he would be nicer, he replied, ''No
way.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I was diagnosed at an early stage,'' he said. ''It came about
as a result of taking a PSA (blood screening) test 2{ weeks ago.
The PSA was elevated. I took antibiotics for awhile. I went in for
a biopsy yesterday. The biopsy revealed several of the samples, not
all, not most, were indicative of cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor made the announcement a day after he was seen leaving
Mount Sinai Medical Center. He had undergone a second round of
tests for prostate cancer following an annual screening for the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Prostate cancer can be diagnosed early thanks to the PSA blood
test, and is considered highly curable if caught in a preliminary
stage.

   AT&AMP;T Wireless IPO Has Strong Start
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T's new wireless stock didn't fly to the sky
like an IPO in the good old days just months ago, but at least Ma
Bell found enough buyers to sell a mammoth $10 billion worth of
stock in its latest offspring. Shares of the new AT&AMP;T Wireless
Group, created through the biggest initial public offering in U.S.
history, debuted on the open market today, bobbing higher from the
IPO price of $29.50 set last evening. In morning trading on the New
York Stock Exchange, where AT&AMP;T executives rang the opening bell,
the stock rose as high as $31.87{ before pulling back to $31\.
Despite concerns that Wall Street's foul mood might derail the IPO,
AT&AMP;T announced late yesterday that it was selling 360 million for a
total of $10.26 billion.

   Wages, Benefits Jump 4.3 Percent
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. workers' wages and benefits rose by 4.3
percent in the 12 months ending in March, the fastest growth in pay
in eight years, the government said today. The increase in the
Labor Department's Employment Cost Index was up sharply from the 12
months ending in December, when wages and benefits rose by a more
moderate 3.4 percent. While higher wages and benefits are good news
for workers, economists are concerned that if companies pass on
rising labor costs to buyers of their products, it could trigger
higher inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Economy Grows at 5.4 Percent Rate
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy, propelled by the biggest
jump in consumer spending in nearly 17 years, grew at a 5.4 percent
annual rate during the first three months of 2000, the government
said today. The increase in the gross domestic product -- the
country's total output of goods and services -- as measured by the
Commerce Department was weaker than the 6 percent rate many
analysts were expecting. Growth in the January-March quarter was
slightly slower than the breakneck 7.3 percent rate posted in the
last three months of 1999, the strongest showing in nearly 16
years. First-quarter growth was led by a whopping 8.3 percent rate
of increase in consumer spending -- the largest gain since a 8.6
percent rate posted in the second quarter of 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Jobless Claims Rise by 26,000
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Labor Department announced today that that
new claims for unemployment benefits rose by 26,000 to 283,000, the
biggest one-week increase since early February. Even with the rise,
weekly jobless claims remain at a level indicating labor markets
are the strongest they have been in decades. Jobless claims had
fallen the previous week to a 26-year low of 257,000.

Dow industrials were down 143.34 at 10,802.16. On the NYSE,
decliners led advancers 1,620-781. The Nasdaq was down 3.15 at

<HEADLINE> BMW Rejects Exec's Offer for Rover  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- BMW on Thursday rejected an offer by
former Rover manager John Towers to take over the troubled British
automaker, saying it was ''financially not secured.''
</P>
<P>
   But talks with another group of British venture capitalists who
want to acquire Rover are proceeding and a decision is expected in
early May, the German luxury carmaker said.
</P>
<P>
   Towers, a former Rover chief executive who left the company in
1996, stepped in two weeks ago to make a rival bid for Rover to the
original offer by Alchemy Partners, a British venture capital firm.
</P>
<P>
   But BMW said Thursday it saw no basis for negotiations for
Towers in a statement implying that he lacked funds to sustain the
company.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement followed a visit to BMW's Munich headquarters
by British labor union representatives, who believe Towers would
lay off fewer Rover workers than Alchemy would.
</P>
<P>
   British Industry Secretary Stephen Byers has also urged BMW to
consider the Towers bid.
</P>
<P>
   Towers' proposal reportedly would see Rover's Longbridge plant
losing perhaps only 1,500 of its 9,000 workers. Under the Alchemy
proposal, job losses could rise into the thousands.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Air Force, seeking to put more recruits on
active duty this spring, is offering an extra $5,000 bonus for
enlistees in certain career fields who agree to report by the end
of May.
</P>
<P>
   The money, which is in addition to other existing enlistment
bonuses, is for those who already have shipped out to basic
training or are scheduled to ship out between April 17 and May 31.
Also eligible are those who signed up to enter basic training on or
after June 1 but are now willing to move up their date to May 31 or
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The money is paid after recruits finish their technical training
in one of about 100 specialized career fields.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force has fallen short of its recruiting goals in recent
months.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Buys Back More National Debt  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Treasury bought back $3 billion of the
national debt Thursday, the largest in a series of debt reductions.
</P>
<P>
   Because the outstanding 30-year Treasury bonds carry higher
yields than the current market yield on comparable securities, the
Treasury Department paid sellers $724 million in premiums to cash
in early.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury bought back 24 issues of 30-year bonds maturing between
February 2015 and August 2025. The bonds carried yields ranging
from 6.250 percent to 11.250 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Over the long run, the saving in interest payments will be more
than the costs of buying backing the bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The new era of bulging government surpluses -- helped along by a
booming economy that is generating lots of tax revenue -- is making
it possible for the Treasury to repurchase debt.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury bought back the debt using a process known as a
''reverse auction,'' in which the government selects offers on a
competitive basis based on the lowest prices. Offers must be
submitted in increments of $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   On March 9, Treasury bought back $1 billion of the debt, the
first time it has done so in 70 years. That was followed one week
later with a $1 billion repurchase and just last week another $2
billion. In those three operations, sellers were paid around $1.04
billion in premiums to cash in their bonds early.
</P>
<P>
   The debt bought back thus far is a tiny fraction of the $5.7
trillion national debt. Of that total, $3.6 trillion is held by the
public.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Treasury said it would like to buy back up to $30
billion of debt this year.

Church council takes over legal aid for Elian Gonzalez's father
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Council of Churches has taken
over the fund paying legal expenses for Elian Gonzalez's father
from the United Methodist Church's Board of Church and Society.
</P>
<P>
   A Methodist announcement said the change was made April 19 after
the denomination's financial office decided such money-raising did
not follow rules prescribed in the Methodist policy manual.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Methodists and the church council pay lawyer Gregory
Craig and his firm through voluntary contributions for that
purpose, not general program funds. The Rev. Thom White Wolf
Fassett, head of the Methodist board, said more than $50,000 has
been raised from anonymous donors but expenses have probably far
exceeded that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez should obtain ''equal representation under
the law, which is the hallmark of our democracy,'' Fassett said.
''Our principal goal was to get Elian back to his father.''

Charges filed against Methodist bishop in lesbian wedding dispute
</P>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- United Methodist parishioners have
called for an investigation of Bishop Melvin Talbert following a
church tribunal's decision to take no action against 68 ministers
who jointly conducted a lesbian wedding last year.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in two letters from church members requesting the probe
is whether the Sacramento bishop disregarded Methodist law, which
forbids clergy to participate in same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Elias Galvan of Seattle said the college of bishops of
the denomination's Western region would consider whether the case
merits formal complaint status. If so, a separate committee would
investigate whether Talbert should be tried by a church court,
which would have power to impose various penalties up to expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   John Stumbo, a Fort Valley, Ga. lawyer with the Coalition for
United Methodist Accountability, a newly formed conservative
caucus, said the complaints centered on Talbert's comments in
February that the church tribunal had found no basis for a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Talbert said the clergy appeared to violate Methodist rules, but
that a local commitment to ''inclusiveness and justice'' had
''precedence over this one narrow focus of law'' in the national
church. Talbert has urged the denomination to adopt a liberal
policy toward gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   Talbert had no immediate comment on the parishioners' filings.
</P>
<P>
   The denomination's quadrennial General Conference in Cleveland
beginning Tuesday will discuss what to do about bishops and clergy
who oppose the church policy against same-sex ceremonies and
ordaining women and homosexuals.

Catholic and Anglican bishops set May international confab
</P>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Anglican and Roman Catholic bishops from 13
regions of the world will meet May 14-20 near Toronto to review
three decades of formal dialogue between the two branches of
Christianity, and to consider future steps.
</P>
<P>
   The closed-door strategy sessions will be chaired by
Anglicanism's spiritual leader, Archbishop of Canterbury George
Carey, and Cardinal Edward Cassidy, president of the Vatican's
Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity.
</P>
<P>
   Also attending will be Presiding Bishop Frank Griswold of the
U.S. Episcopal Church and Roman Catholic Archbishop Alexander
Brunett of Seattle, Wash. They are the new co-chairmen of the
Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission, was launched in
1966 by the then-pope and archbishop of Canterbury to negotiate
steps toward unity.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has done significant work on doctrinal
differences; last year, for example, it issued a discussion of the
papacy, ''The Gift of Authority.'' But some Anglicans now ordain
active homosexuals to the priesthood, adding to tensions within
Anglicanism and with the Catholic Church.

Catholic church decries upsurge in guerrilla extortion
</P>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Not even charity offerings collected in
provincial Roman Catholic churches are immune from extortion by
Colombia's largest rebel band, which has stepped up pressure on
priests to turn over cash, the church's leader says.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've sought 50 million, 100 million pesos ($25,000 to
$50,000) from certain parishes,'' Archbishop Pedro Rubiano said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The parishes have been very clear that it's a matter of
principle that they cannot hand over ... monies collected for
social and evangelical projects,'' Rubiano told The Associated
Press, noting that money demands by the Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia, or FARC, have become more frequent and violent in
recent weeks.

Women want 'sacred place' at prison
</P>
<P>
   MITCHELLVILLE, Iowa (AP) -- The women at the Mitchellville prison
cannot escape the din of the loudspeaker, the ''squawk box,'' even
to worship. But that is about to change.
</P>
<P>
   Inmates hope construction can begin this summer on a building
they call the sacred place. ''It's in church that people deal with
feelings of guilt and shame, and it's only then that they can let
them go,'' chaplain Kay Kopatich said.
</P>
<P>
   The women of Mitchellville, she said, long for a place to pray.
Elizabeth Pitsor-Halcrow is among them. The 38-year-old mother hit
bottom after being sent to the prison on a conviction for dealing
methamphetamine. She searched her soul and found faith.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came here with a broken spirit, a broken heart, full of hate
and full of self-pity,'' said Pitsor-Halcrow, who follows American
Indian traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers, Iowa churches and former Lt. Gov. Joy Corning have
helped raise nearly three-quarters of the $600,000 needed for the
freestanding worship hall.
</P>
<P>
   About four of every five women at the prison attend some kind of
spiritual service.
</P>

   ''Jesus is my crutch,'' says Avis Blair, a Seventh-day
Adventist. ''And that's my everything in here.''

'Speed Dating' aims to match Jewish singles
</P>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Mich. (AP) -- The start of a long-lasting
relationship could take only seven minutes of conversation in a
coffee shop.
</P>
<P>
   But during that span, the two people sitting across from each
other can't talk about their jobs or where they live, and they
can't give out their phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Meet ''Speed Dating,'' a service for Jews who say they can't
find a Jewish mate.
</P>
<P>
   With seven minutes on the clock, pairs at each table fire
questions at each other about goals, values and feelings on Israel,
trying to gauge if the stranger is a soul mate.
</P>
<P>
   ''One minute,'' the rabbi calls out.
</P>
<P>
   Then time is up, and they pick up their lattes, swap seats and
start all over again; new table, new ''date.''
</P>
<P>
   Born of the idea that people are too busy to date and that
intermarriage is among the greatest threats to Judaism, Speed
Dating lets singles size up a pool of potential Jewish matches in
less than an hour, then decide whether they want a full-length
date.
</P>
<P>
   Participants write on a form whether they want to see a person
again. Organizers match up the dates and call the participants with
phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The concept was developed by Aish HaTorah, an international
Jewish outreach program, and pitched to chapters around the world.
The first session was held in Los Angeles in March 1999 and already
boasts one marriage.

Montana Episcopal bishop faces trial on sex charges
</P>
<P>
   HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- Bishop Charles I. Jones, 56, leader of the
Episcopal Church in Montana, will go before a church tribunal in
September on charges of immoral conduct with a woman parishioner in
Kentucky in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has denied the charges listed in a church indictment.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted by a court of seven fellow bishops, who will
assemble in Minneapolis, Jones could be reprimanded, suspended
temporarily or deposed.
</P>
<P>
   The charges were filed in February 1999 but kept confidential.
Copies circulated in some churches and were reported by the state's
Lee Newspapers. The indictment says Jones, a married priest then
serving in Russellville, Ky., had an affair of several years with
the parish housekeeper, a married woman.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Dooling, a former lawyer who is now a priest in Dillin,
Mont., sought dismissal of the case. He issued a statement on
Jones' behalf saying the charges were resolved in 1994 by a
''disciplinary agreement'' among Jones, the Montana diocese and the
then national leader of the Episcopal Church, Edmond Browning. A
diocesan convention voted to retain Jones as bishop, he said.

<HEADLINE> Religion Today  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD N. OSTLING, AP Religion Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The 992 delegates heading to Cleveland for the
United Methodist Church's most important gathering will lug 1,900
legislative proposals in their bulging briefcases. But only one
agenda topic has potential to split their denomination:
Homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Conflicting views of the Bible are at the root of the dispute
that will come to a head at the May 2-12 General Conference. And
that is equally true in the Episcopal Church and Presbyterian
Church (U.S.A.), whose assemblies will revisit the debate in early
summer; the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, which is just
entering the fray; and the United Church of Christ, which has moved
to a liberal policy.
</P>
<P>
   Christianity from its earliest days preserved Judaism's sexual
ethic, including an aversion to same-sex practices. Last month,
Reform Judaism severed its last ties to that tradition. America's
relatively liberal group of mainline Protestant denominations has
faced repeated proposals for change over the past three decades,
backed by growing numbers of seminary professors.
</P>
<P>
   In the intense biblical debate, two passages are crucial:
</P>
<P>
   -- ''You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an
abomination.'' (Leviticus 18:22, repeated in Leviticus 20:13 with
the death penalty added.)
</P>
<P>
   -- ''God gave them up to degrading passions. Their women
exchanged natural intercourse for unnatural, and in the same way
also the men, giving up natural intercourse with women, were
consumed with passion for one another. Men committed shameless acts
with men....'' (Romans 1:26-27).
</P>
<P>
   The Leviticus passage is part of what scholars call the Old
Testament ''Holiness Code.''
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Bird of the Methodists' Garrett-Evangelical Theological
Seminary says the passage expresses ancient concepts of male honor,
ritual purity and Jewish exclusivity that don't apply to modern
America.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in the new anthology ''Homosexuality, Science, and the
'Plain Sense' of Scripture'' (Eerdmans), she also contends the text
has no implications for lesbians. In February, Bird testified at a
Methodist hearing that acquitted 68 California clergy who jointly
led nuptials for a lesbian couple.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the same Leviticus passage forbids practices -- adultery,
incest, sex with animals -- that Christians still want to oppose,
notes Richard B. Hays of Methodist-related Duke University Divinity
School.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he agrees in ''The Moral Vision of the New
Testament'' (HarperSanFrancisco) that the Leviticus texts don't
necessarily settle matters because the church has always
disregarded Old Testament laws on, for instance, kosher diet and
circumcision.
</P>
<P>
   So the Romans text, part of Paul's sweeping analysis of sin and
salvation, becomes central.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Paul Furnish of Southern Methodist University provides a
modern reinterpretation in another new anthology, ''The Loyal
Opposition'' (Abingdon), which was mailed to all Methodist
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Furnish thinks Paul simply followed Jewish attitudes in a time
when Gentiles often practiced pederasty and gay prostitution, and
people held ideas about sexual ''nature'' that modern research
disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Liberals argue that Paul in Romans opposed only same-sex
activity by those who were naturally heterosexual. Hays finds that
simply untenable. Paul ''treats all homosexual activity as prima
facie evidence of humanity's tragic confusion and alienation from
God the Creator,'' he asserts.
</P>
<P>
   What about Sodom, the famously sinful Old Testament city that
gave its name to ''sodomy?'' Liberals say the sordid story (Genesis
19:1-29) described attempted gang rape, not consensual sex, and
note that Ezekiel 16:49 identified Sodom's sins as pride and
hardheartedness toward the poor.
</P>
<P>
   But the following verse in Ezekiel denounces Sodom's
''abominable things.'' Thomas Schmidt of California's Westmont
College in ''Straight &AMP; Narrow?'' (InterVarsity) says that is a
term given a sexual connotation elsewhere in the same chapter of
Ezekiel. He also points to the New Testament's Jude 7, which
condemns Sodom's ''unnatural lust.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberal and conserative scholars disagree on how to interpret
two Greek terms used in New Testament lists of sins (1 Corinthians
6:9, 1 Timothy 1:10). The ecumenical New Revised Standard Version
translates the terms as ''male prostitutes'' and ''sodomites''
while the Catholic New American Bible uses ''boy prostitutes'' and
''practicing homosexuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another liberal argument is that Jesus said nothing against
homosexuality. But in ''Same-Sex Partnerships?'' (Revell), which
conservatives sent to Methodist delegates, Anglican John Stott
argues that Jesus (Matthew 19:4-6, Mark 10:6-9) endorsed the
Bible's broader teaching, beginning with Genesis 2, that man-woman
monogamy is God's only design for sexual expression.
</P>
<P>
   The Bible advocates compassion, inclusiveness and justice and
this wider context must figure in analysis of the issue, says
Jeanne Knepper, a leader of Affirmation: United Methodists for
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgendered Concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''Scripture passages are not going to settle this issue for the
contemporary church,'' says Paul Jersild of Lutheran Theological
Southern Seminary in Columbia, S.C., in a current denominational
study guide. He thinks the church must accept ''new realities''
instead of being ''bound in literal fashion to the text.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird is more sweeping, contending that ''we cannot get a
ready-made sexual ethic or even an adequate foundation for it from
the Bible.'' She thinks the culturally bound thinking of ancient
Jewish writers must give way to ''the ongoing revelation of
science'' and modern experience.
</P>
<P>
   That approach alarms traditionalists. Robert Gagnon of the
Presbyterians' Pittsburgh Theological Seminary, author of the
forthcoming ''The Bible and Homosexual Practice'' (Abingdon),
believes acceptance of gay practice ''would have an enormously
detrimental effect'' because the Bible's stance is absolute,
pervasive and strongly held. ''At stake,'' he says, ''is the
credibility of the biblical witness on any moral issue.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 146; Nasdaq Up 34  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly lower today after a widely
watched economic report showed wage pressures are rising and
suggested that the Federal Reserve is likely to continue raising
interest rates to contain inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But a broad selloff was averted by a report on the gross
domestic product that showed slightly lower-than-expected growth.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 146.13 at 10,799.37.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index
was up 34.56 at 3,664.65 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 11.29 at 1,449.70.
</P>
<P>
   Traders had nervously anticipated today's economic reports,
fearful that one or both would show that the economy was growing
much too fast for the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   The reports confirmed that the economy is on a tear. The gross
domestic product grew at a 5.4 percent annual rate during the first
three months of 2000, the Commerce Department said today. But many
economists had anticipated a 6 percent growth rate.
</P>
<P>
   The more troubling statistic to inflation-wary traders: the
Employment Cost Index. In the first quarter, the index rose 1.4
percent, the biggest quarterly advance in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Economists fear that rising wage pressures will stimulate
inflation, prompting more and steeper interest rate increases by
the Fed. Higher interest rates are generally bad for stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ''The economy is not showing the signs of slowing that the Fed
is looking for, and investors are correct to be concerned about
that,'' said Eric Wiegand, director of the private client group at
Warburg Pincus.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which are most sensitive to inflation, led the
Dow lower. American Express fell 2 7/16 to 152 3/16 and J.P. Morgan
fell 3 13/16 to 130 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's wireless business made a modest debut in trading on the
New York Stock Exchange, rising from an offering price of 29 1/2 to
31 7/16. The tracking stock is the largest initial public offering
in history, with 360 million shares valued at a total of $10.26
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were helping the Nasdaq outperform the
blue-chip Dow. MCI WorldCom rose 3 17/32 to 44 13/32 after
announcing it beat Wall Street's first-quarter earnings
expectations by 1 cent a share. The telecom company saw net income
soar to $1.3 billion from $730 million a year ago on surging data
and Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless communications company Nextel narrowed its
first-quarter loss and rose 6 3/4 to 110 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 515.91 million
shares, ahead of Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 0.89 to 483.35.

<HEADLINE> Country Music Marathon Run Planned  </HEADLINE>
By TERESA M. WALKER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Ready, set, twang?
</P>
<P>
   With starting help from Vince Gill and Amy Grant, the Country
Music Marathon will be off and running Saturday with at least
10,000 competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ''A perfect location for a theme marathon and a perfect location
for country music,'' said Tracy Sundlun of Elite Racing Inc.
</P>
<P>
   He would know. Sundlun and Elite Racing are the organizers
behind the Rock 'n' Roll Marathon in San Diego, which set the
record for the largest first-time marathon with 19,978 entries in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The original idea for hitting Nashville came from some record
company executives who heard about that first Rock 'n' Roll
Marathon and wondered why not stage a music marathon in a town
known as Music City.
</P>
<P>
   ''They spoke to folks in the mayor's office here. They had some
representatives come out to the first marathon, and everybody's
eyes got lit up as to the possibilities,'' Sundlun said. ''It's a
natural.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming less than two weeks after the Boston Marathon, the
Country Music Marathon's field will feature 20 elite runners,
including Philip Chirchir of Kenya, whose personal best is 2 hours,
8 minutes and 51 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Grisales and Edgar Sanchez will be trying to land spots
on Colombia's Olympic team. Nadja Wijenberg, winner of the 1998
Rock 'n' Roll Marathon, also is entered.
</P>
<P>
   The 26.2-mile course winds near the Country Music Hall of Fame,
along Music Row and near the Ryman Auditorium, former home of the
Grand Ole Opry, with a variety of bands playing at 27 stages. Kenny
Rogers, Collin Raye and Linda Davis will perform Saturday night in
a concert open to both racers and the general public.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers are trying to learn from mistakes made in San Diego
the past two years, when they ran out of water, had traffic
glitches and bands long gone by the time late racers passed.
</P>
<P>
   This time, 48 bands are lined up to play, and cheerleaders will
be placed along the course.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're going to be entertained,'' Sundlun said.

<HEADLINE> PM-NY--Gambling House Killings, 1st Ld-Writethru,0296  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- A 21-year-old man was arraigned today on
charges he killed two men and critically wounded another during a
robbery at an illegal gambling house.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan C. Hunter, who was arrested Tuesday night in Auburn, 30
miles west of Syracuse, was charged with two counts of
second-degree murder and one count each of attempted murder and
robbery. He will appear again in City Court on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter had a loaded handgun in his possession but surrendered
without incident, said Sgt. Joseph Sweeny. Police gave no other
details of Hunter's arrest because the investigation is still under
way.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities accused Hunter of being among a group of masked
robbers who barged into Henderson Griffin's house in Syracuse
Friday night, shot three people and robbed the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin's house was a popular neighborhood gambling spot. He had
been ticketed several times for selling alcohol and running games.
Local thieves knew about the high-stakes games, too, and the house
had been robbed before, including as recently as April 13, Sweeny
said.
</P>
<P>
   Killed in Friday's shootings were Griffin, 62, and another man,
Vernon Griffin, 39, no relation. Henderson Griffin was shot in the
legs but suffered a fatal heart attack. The third victim, Robert
Anderson, 47, remained in serious condition today at University
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Additional charges against Hunter will be considered when the
case is presented to a grand jury, said Chief Assistant District
Attorney Nicholas DeMartino. Charges could be increased to
first-degree murder under the state's 1995 death-penalty statute
because the crime involved multiple victims and occurred during a
robbery.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Honors Civil Rights Leader  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The memory of civil rights leader Daisy
Bates stands tall in the eyes of President Clinton. He was just 11
when she counseled nine black students who strode into an all-white
high school here and nudged America toward desegregated schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I'd like to say to you is that I really liked Daisy
Bates. I liked her for who she was. I liked her because she was a
brave woman who fought the civil rights battle,'' Clinton said
today at a memorial service for Bates, who died last year after a
lifetime of civil rights activism. ''But I liked her also because
she was a brave woman who kept her spirits up.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Bates never lost her ability to laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Daisy's getting a big kick out of us making such a
fuss about here today.''
</P>
<P>
   Gospel music filled Robinson Auditorium where several hundred
people gathered to remember the woman, who received more than 200
awards for her work toward equality.
</P>
<P>
   Pianist Ricky Banks gave an emotional rendition of the civil
rights anthem, singing ''We shall overcome. We shall overcome,
yeah. ... Oooh, deep in my mind, I do, I do believe -- yes I do.
...''
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you believe that?'' he asked the people in the crowd, who
responded with applause and then stood, joined hands, slowly swayed
and sang along with him.
</P>
<P>
   Daisy Gatson Bates died Nov. 4, 1999, at the age of 84. On the
day of her funeral, Clinton praised the courage of the nine black
students as they accepted the Congressional Gold Medal in
Washington. Some of the students, dubbed the Little Rock Nine, were
given a standing ovation at today's memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   Whites rioted outside Central High School in 1957 when National
Guardsmen, on orders from Gov. Orval Faubus, turned the nine
students away. President Eisenhower sent in Army troops to escort
the students to class. It was a clear sign that Washington was
going to enforce the 1954 Supreme Court ruling in Brown vs. Board
of Education that school segregation was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Before and after their tense days at school, the nine black
students took solace at Bates' home. She was their mentor, advising
them how to stand up to intimidation and physical threats.
</P>
<P>
   About a decade ago, Bates said: ''I'm 75{, But I'm not too tired
to stand and do what I can for the cause I believe in. I would like
to see, before I die, that blacks and whites and Christians can all
get together.''
</P>
<P>
   Her wish is not yet reality.
</P>
<P>
   Her second cousin, David Neely, an attorney in Elmhurst, Ill.,
who was at the service with other relatives, said that in addition
to civil rights, Bates was vocal on issues involving children,
women and rape. Her mother was raped and murdered.
</P>
<P>
   Neely said Bates was a serious-minded woman, who liked to have
fun, but thrived on the discussion of issues. ''She loved to talk.
She loved attention,'' he said. ''Even after she had her first
stroke and her second stroke, her mind continued to work. But she
couldn't express herself because her speech was impaired.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration announced today that it has begun a
process to designate Bates' home in Little Rock a National Historic
Landmark -- a structure that symbolizes an ''unflattering period in
our nation's history,'' Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Later today, Clinton was to speak at the dedication of the
William H. Bowen Law School for the University of Arkansas. Bowen,
a Little Rock attorney, businessman and former dean of the law
school, was chief of staff to Clinton when the president was
governor of Arkansas.

<HEADLINE> More Cities Join Gun Safety Coalition  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHEPARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Unbowed by a gun industry lawsuit aimed at
overturning a key provision of a national gun safety plan, 190
communities have signed on Smith &AMP; Wesson's pledge to adopt new
safety and responsibility standards.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have turned a page in the book on gun violence in this
nation,'' said Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew
Cuomo, who was joined by Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., at a news
conference today to announce that 190 local governments have joined
the Communities for Safer Guns Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition formed in March around a pledge signed by Smith &AMP;
Wesson, the nation's largest gun maker, and federal officials to
make guns safer. As part of the pact, cities would give Smith &AMP;
Wesson a preference when buying guns for law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   The preference provision of the agreement is the subject of a
federal lawsuit filed Wednesday by seven gun makers and a gun
industry trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the suit ''laughable,'' Schumer said: ''Its seems the
gun industry is spoiling for a fight. To that we say, ' make our
day.'''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit filed in an Atlanta federal court alleges an illegal
conspiracy in restraint of trade.
</P>
<P>
   In March, President Clinton announced a landmark gun safety
agreement with Smith &AMP; Wesson that included the installation of gun
locks on all the weapons it sells, the introduction within three
years of ''smart gun'' technology, and barring sales of its weapons
at gun shows without a background check.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Smith &AMP; Wesson was to be dropped from
lawsuits against gun makers that were being contemplated by federal
officials and some cities. Any other gun maker that agreed to the
plan would also be given preferential treatment, but so far none
has joined Smith &AMP; Wesson.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are demanding cities stop the effort of using their
purchasing power to control the distribution and design of
firearms,'' said Jeff Reh, general counsel for Beretta U.S.A. Corp,
one of the seven suing companies.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit names as defendants New York Attorney General Eliot
Spitzer and Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who
helped draw up the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''This action is preposterous, false and unfounded and an insult
to law enforcement,'' Blumenthal said. ''It is plainly an effort to
deceive and confuse the public, and distract law enforcement
officials from the work of improving gun safety and stopping
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from HUD, also named were the California communities of
San Francisco, Berkeley, East Palo Alto, Inglewood, Oakland, and
San Mateo; as well as Bridgeport, Conn.; Atlanta; Miami-Dade
County, Fla.; Gary, Ind.; Boston; Detroit; St. Louis; Newark, N.J.;
Philadelphia; and the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport Mayor Joseph Ganim called the lawsuit, ''a desperate
move by the gun makers to try and prevent us from doing what is the
right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They continue to forget that our only goal is to protect
children and families, and their only goal is to protect corporate
profits and greed,'' Ganim said.
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Delfay, president of the National Shooting Sports
Foundation, said local officials ''have tried everything from
litigation to economic extortion to compel compliance on a national
level with their own individual ideas about gun design, ownership
and distribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the lawsuit from Capitol Hill was swift and
partisan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am disappointed that some gun manufacturers have chosen
confrontation over cooperation,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg,
D-N.J. ''The federal government isn't asking for much, only that
these companies help adopt common sense measures to keep guns from
ending up in the wrong hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said the Clinton administration
overstepped its authority.
</P>
<P>
   ''From the allegations of the complaint filed today ... it now
appears the administration seeks to further its goals by
circumventing the will of Congress and illegitimately bringing the
weight of the executive branch to bear on law-abiding firearm
manufacturers,'' Hatch said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Reporter Gets OSCE Award  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- Russian journalist Andrei Babitsky,
who was arrested by the Russian military in Chechnya and held
captive for weeks, won a prestigious $20,000 prize Thursday for his
coverage of the war in the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky ''has been one of the very few critical voices
commenting on the situation and recent developments in the
region,'' said the Organization of Security and Cooperation in
Europe, citing the 36-year-old correspondent for Radio Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky's reporting on the conflict in Chechnya has been widely
recognized for its objectivity and fairness,'' said the OSCE in
awarding the journalist its annual Prize for Journalism and
Democracy. ''(He) reported on the conflict in Chechnya with
complete disregard for his personal safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky, a 15-year journalism veteran, covered the war from
rebel positions, angering Russia's military, which arrested him in
January for allegedly failing to have proper accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   While held for two weeks in a detention center in Chechnya,
Babitsky said he saw innocent men tortured by Russian police.
</P>
<P>
   Russian authorities next announced they had traded him to rebels
in exchange for captive Russian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   No one heard from Babitsky for weeks, and co-workers said they
feared the military had killed him.
</P>
<P>
   In late February, Babitsky resurfaced in Russian custody in the
neighboring republic of Dagestan and said he had been held by men
he believed were working for the Russian secret services.
</P>
<P>
   The $20,000 OSCE prize, first awarded in 1996, is given to
reporters or organizations that have helped develop principles of
human rights and democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Past winners include Adam Michnik, a former Polish dissident and
editor of Poland's first independent newspaper, the Paris-based
organization Reporters Sans Frontiers, British journalist Timothy
Garton Ash and CNN's Christiane Amanpour.
</P>
<P>
   The prize will be awarded the prize July 6 at the OSCE's annual
session in Sofia, Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky is a seven-year veteran of Radio Liberty, which has its
headquarters in Prague, capital of the Czech Republic.

<HEADLINE> Sen: Victims' Rights Bill May Fail  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Citing waning support, backers of a victims
rights' amendment to the Constitution said today they would pull
the proposal from the Senate floor, apparently killing the idea for
the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of various things that have occurred, it is unlikely
that a cloture petition, if filed would be supported by the
requisite number of senators to proceed early next week,'' said
Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., and the measure's Republican sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   The cloture petition, which limits debate, would need 60 votes
and 67, or two-thirds, for passage.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl said he and co-sponsor Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.,
would seek ''to withdraw the motion. . . and move to other
business.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday started debating the amendment, which
would enshrine rights for victims of violent crime or their
families. Those rights would include reasonable notice of court
proceedings and an offender's release or escape, the right to
attend and be heard at legal proceedings and court-ordered
restitution.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds majorities in the House and Senate are needed for
passage. The amendment would also need to be ratified by
three-fourths of state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   The House has yet to take up the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents have said they support the concept but believe the
same guarantees can be written into law without tinkering with the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ''I must say I am very concerned about the cavalier attitude
which I have observed with respect to the offering of
constitutional amendments,'' said Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., in a
speech that lasted nearly three hours. ''There is a cavalier spirit
which seems to say that if it sounds good politically, if it looks
good politically, if it will get votes, let's introduce an
amendment to the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters, however, said the amendment is needed to balance
constitutional protections that suspects and criminals receive.
Thirty-two states have enacted some form of victims' rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we've given statutes plenty of opportunity,'' Kyl
said. ''They haven't gotten the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein agreed. ''The reason the statute won't work is because
it hasn't worked,'' she told senators at one point.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein and Kyl spent much of Wednesday negotiating for the
measure even as support began to wane. Sen. Daniel Inouye,
D-Hawaii, asked to be removed as one of 42 co-sponsors, Kyl said.
</P>
<P>
   The two also offered to make several changes to get the support
of President Clinton, Kyl said. Clinton, while having no direct
role in amending the Constitution, has said he supports a victims'
rights amendment but has reservations about the current proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters hoped gaining his support would sway other Democrats
but ''it doesn't appear to me, even if we write it the way they
want to write it, they're going to become strong advocates,'' Kyl
said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials released a letter sent Tuesday to
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, saying, ''Although we continue
to strongly support a victims' rights amendment to the Constitution
... we oppose the amendment in its current form.''

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Cites Summit Progress  </HEADLINE>
By KYONG-HWA SEOK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) -- The two rival Koreas have moved close to
an agreement on how to proceed at their unprecedented summit, South
Korean officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But North Korea and South Korea, who fought a 1950-53 war ending
without a treaty, still must move forward on an agenda for the June
12-14 summit of the two leaders, the officials indicated.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will try to resolve it step by step without a rush,'' said
Park Jae-kyu, South Korea's unification minister, after officials
of both Koreas met for 90 minutes meeting at the border village of
Panmunjom.
</P>
<P>
   In previous talks with the South, North Korea has complained
about South Korea's anti-communist national security law and the
presence of 37,000 U.S. troops in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Seoul officials say the summit between President Kim Dae-jung
and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il will be in jeopardy if
Pyongyang insists that such topics be included in the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators on Thursday agreed to hold a third round of
talks May 3 to prepare for the first leadership summit of the
Koreas, which were divided into the communist North and the
pro-Western South in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   At the first meeting on Saturday, South Korea proposed four
topics for the agenda -- economic cooperation, peace measures, the
reunion of separated family members and the establishment of a
permanent government channel of dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, North Korea's chief negotiator, Kim Ryong Song,
presented a proposal for summit procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ''He expressed expectation that the South side would agree to
it,'' reported Korean Central News Agency, North Korea's foreign
news outlet.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's chief negotiator, Yang Young-shik, said the two
sides were close to an agreement on procedure, which include
security, communications and the size of diplomatic delegations and
the press corps.
</P>
<P>
   The impoverished North Korea is desperate for aid to rebuild its

<HEADLINE> Gay Rights D.C. March Planned  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- There's nothing better than a march on the
National Mall to build on the victory that gay and lesbian rights
activists just won in Vermont, Diane Hardy-Garcia says.
</P>
<P>
   That's because every step forward gays and lesbians make -- such
as the brand-new Vermont civil unions law -- there is a step back,
like the slaying of Pfc. Barry Winchell at Fort Campbell, Ky.,
after rumors surfaced that he was gay, said Hardy-Garcia, executive
director of Sunday's Millennium March on Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers are expecting 300,000 people at the fourth rally for
gay, lesbian and bisexual right on the Mall in the last 21 years.
They have been planning for years, hoping the rally will mobilize
supporters into an important voting bloc this presidential election
year.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is not without its critics. And the most vocal ones
are other gay and lesbian rights groups who claim the event has
little grassroots support.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's many things to celebrate and a lot of work to yet to
do,'' Hardy-Garcia said. ''One of the reasons we do marches on
Washington is something that is important to the gay community --
the real need to bring more people into this movement.''
</P>
<P>
   To do that, they're staging a concert featuring Garth Brooks and
Melissa Ethridge, rallying between the Washington Monument and the
Capitol and broadcasting the events over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Also scheduled to attend are the parents of Matthew Shepard, a
21-year-old gay University of Wyoming student who died in October
1998 after being beaten into a coma and tied to a fence, and
Winchell's mother, Patricia Kutteles of Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just trying to do whatever I can so that no one has to be
afraid to serve their country anymore,'' said Kutteles, who has
said she will sue the Army for $1.8 million in the death of her
son.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want my son's death to count for something. I don't want his
death to have just been in vain. I want something good and positive
to come out of it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics praise the intentions of the event but question how it
has been organized. William Dobbs, member of a committee of
activists formed to oppose the march, says decisions about the
event were made by people in Washington who failed to garner enough
support on the local level and from minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''Celebrities draw attention but in the end it's supposed to be
a civil rights march,'' Dobbs said. ''It shouldn't be just a
feel-good event. But those past marches came about when there was a
real community consensus to march on the capital and push the
government changes.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City Councilwoman Christine Quinn, whose Manhattan
district is home to a big portion of the city's gay and lesbian
population, urged her constituents to stay away to concentrate on
efforts closer to home instead. The National Association of Black
and White Men Together rescheduled a board meeting originally set
for this weekend in Washington to show its opposition to the march.
</P>
<P>
   ''How do we advance this movement that really is diverse if we
have a 99.9 percent audience this weekend that is white?'' said
Mandy Carter of Tampa, Fla., who helped organize the 1987 and 1993
gay rights marches in Washington. ''For a lot of people of color,
where are our faces and voices?''
</P>
<P>
   March supporters dismiss the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been disagreements with every social justice
movement and past marches,'' said David Smith, spokesman for Human
Rights Campaign. ''The controversy right now is not as important as
the fact that we are all coming together to work for the common
goal.''

<HEADLINE> Gene Therapy Helps Two Babies  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- French scientists have used gene therapy to
restore an apparently normal immune system to two babies born with
a rare, life-threatening immune disease.
</P>
<P>
   It's far too soon to know if the babies are cured, experts
cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   But the research, reported in Friday's edition of the journal
Science, ''is a very important milestone,'' said Dr. Jennifer Puck,
a geneticist at the U.S. National Institutes of Health. ''It looks
like this really worked.''
</P>
<P>
   The babies have SCID, or ''severe combined immunodeficiency
disease,'' a rare disease that afflicted David, the Houston
''bubble boy'' who lived in a germ-proof plastic enclosure. SCID
prevents babies' bodies from producing lymphocytes, the immune
cells that ward off infection, meaning they can die from the most
minor of germs.
</P>
<P>
   Today, SCID patients receive bone marrow transplants to provide
them with healthy stem cells, the special cells that produce
lymphocytes. Transplants have cured some babies and extended the
lives of others. But because they're not always successful,
scientists have hoped gene therapy could offer an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alain Fischer of the Hospital Necker-Enfants Malades in
Paris took bone marrow from two babies when they were ages 8 months
and 11 months, and culled some of their stem cells.
</P>
<P>
   The babies have a defective gene that literally blocks
lymphocyte formation. Lift that roadblock, and the body should
generate normal immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer took a normal version of that immune system gene and
added it to a harmless virus. In a lab dish, he infected the
babies' stem cells with the gene-carrying virus. Then he
transplanted the stem cells back into their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the babies started making germ-killing immune cells.
Eleven months later, both have immune systems comparable to healthy
children their age, without any side effects, Fischer reports in
Science.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know how long this benefit is going to last,'' and
more children need the experiment to prove it really works,
cautions Puck, who hopes to begin a similar gene therapy study this
fall on U.S. babies. But, ''for now they seem to be doing just as
well as if they'd been cured.''

<HEADLINE> Tentative settlement reached in 4-month nurses strike  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NYACK, N.Y. (AP) -- The end could be in sight for a four-month
strike that kept Nyack Hospital nurses on the picket line through
the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Nurses' representatives reached a tentative settlement with the
hospital on Thursday, although picketers promised to continue their
demonstrations until the official contract vote on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Kriz, spokeswoman for the hospital, and Mark Genovese of
the New York State Nurses Association said the agreement was
reached just after 3 a.m., 12 hours into a bargaining session.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides agreed not to release details of the deal until
the nurses vote on whether to ratify it, but Genovese said there
must have been movement on three issues: merit pay, vacation and
staffing levels.
</P>
<P>
   Kriz said the nurses' bargaining committee recommended
ratification.
</P>
<P>
   About a half-dozen nurses picketed on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Meena Ananth, who worked as a substitute school nurse and on
other nursing jobs during the strike, said she will be happy to be
a full-time employee again.
</P>
<P>
   ''I sympathize for the people who really needed the job and had
to stand out here on picket lines,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement came three days after all but four of the 425
striking nurses disregarded a hospital ultimatum that could have
cost them their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital had said it would begin hiring permanent
replacements for any nurse who did not return to work then.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was a big surprise,'' said Maureen O'Connell, a nurse at
Nyack for a year and a half. She said the ultimatum by hospital
President Gregor Andersen was ''his last trump.''
</P>
<P>
   Only four nurses crossed the picket line Monday, after the
ultimatum, bringing to 25 the total number that left the strike
since it began Dec. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Other nurses chanted ''Unity!'' on their picket line and shouted
'Scab!' at potential replacements.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was our feeling that the hospital was more willing to
settle after they saw the nurses were not intimidated by their
attempt to replace them,'' Genovese said. ''We're very proud of the
nurses for standing together.''
</P>
<P>
   The hospital had proposed shifting much of the pay scale to a
merit system rather than seniority. Each nurse would get a 10
percent raise over the five years of the proposed contract, but
some could get 22.5 percent depending on their evaluations. The
nurses wanted pay to be based on seniority to diminish the affects
of managerial whims.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital also wanted to trim the number of paid days off,
including vacation and sick days, from 45 to 40.
</P>
<P>
   The union, complaining that a heavy work load could endanger
patient care, wanted guaranteed nurse-to-patient ratios and less
forced overtime.

<HEADLINE> A rash of school tax hikes despite record school aid  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- There has never been a sustained period of
state taxpayer support for public education in New York like the
one that has been in progress since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Year after year, the state has upped the state tax dollars going
to public schools, from $10.3 billion in the 1996-97 state budget
to a projected $13.2 billion in the yet-to-be-adopted 2000-01
budget.
</P>
<P>
   It has been almost like the Legislature and governor are in a
bidding war, with themselves as the only participants. ''An $800
million increase in 1998? We'll see that and raise you another $800
million in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   When this year's budget is finally enacted, it will include the
biggest increase yet -- $1.2 billion, according to state
legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, if the state leaders were hoping to forestall property tax
increases with such largesse -- if not actually causing a district
here and there to roll back tax bills -- they will be sorely
disappointed at the spending plans of schools in New York for the
2000-01 school year. The new budgets being outlined by districts
are calling, almost without fail, for school tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   The trend exasperates state Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no reason on this earth why the school districts in
this state have to raise taxes,'' Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
   School administrators say there are plenty of reasons why
districts are looking at higher taxes: increases in the cost of
teacher contracts and benefits; the districts' share of a very
popular state school construction program; adding programs to meet
higher state scholastic standards; the expenses caused by
unexpected increases in fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of the district expenses have increased at a rate much
higher than the rate of inflation,'' said David Ernst, a spokesman
for the state School Boards Association.
</P>
<P>
   Not unusual, either, is the experience of Marlboro Central
School District in Ulster County, Ernst said. Property owners there
are facing a 23 percent tax hike in the new school budget after
Central Hudson Gas &AMP; Electric argued successfully in court that the
school district had overassessed the value of the utility's
property and must repay $1.55 million.
</P>
<P>
   Many districts have lost such ''tax certiorari'' court rulings
to utilities, Ernst said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents in most places outside New York's largest cities will
vote May 16 on new budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst said districts will be asking voters for authorization to
spend up to a certain amount in the next school year. The actual
size of the tax increases will depend on how liberal local
districts have been at estimating the size of the 2000-01 state aid
increase.
</P>
<P>
   Districts who based budgets on Gov. George Pataki's proposed
$400 million education aid increase will likely see smaller tax
increases than more prescient -- or reckless -- districts who gambled
that the Legislature would add another $800 million in school aid
onto Pataki's proposed budget. Districts send out final tax bills
on Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, roughly 45 percent of public school costs in
New York are paid for by the state, 50 percent by local taxes and 5
percent by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The seeming incongruity of tax increases at a time when the
state is in such a giving mood toward schools is heightened by the
presence of the state's ''STAR'' property tax abatement program. It
will be expanded in the new state fiscal year to provide homeowners
with about $2 billion in breaks on their property tax bills.
</P>
<P>
   STAR has nothing to do with increasing or decreasing the amount
of money available to schools, it merely increases the proportion
paid by the state. But a program combining ''property taxes'' and
''tax reductions'' seems to provide the promise of lower overall
tax bills to New York property owners.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, those bills are on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno says he favors a proposal from Pataki to have the state
send STAR tax rebate checks directly to residents instead of using
the current system, where residents' tax bills are reduced by the
amount homeowners are qualified for and localities collect
reimbursement from the state on a dollar-for-dollar amount.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say Pataki wants to get more credit from voters for
STAR. But Bruno said the billing change would be a sort of
truth-in-taxing provision to prevent school districts from
camouflaging tax hikes in tax bills which have fallen because of
STAR.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's much more honest,'' Bruno said. ''It's much more upfront.
It's what the Legislature and the governor originally intended when
they put that (STAR program) in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Be that as it may, Pataki's proposal has been unpopular with
school boards and Democrats in the state Assembly and the
governor's spokesman Michael McKeon said this week Pataki was
considering ''alternatives to rebates.''

<HEADLINE> Tree Runs for Congress  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MORRISTOWN, N.J. (AP) -- Voters looking for congressional timber
may want to consider filmmaker Michael Moore's candidate: a ficus
tree.
</P>
<P>
   Moore brought a 3-foot tree to Morris County on Wednesday to
announce its write-in campaign for the seat held by Rep. Rodney
Frelinghuysen, a Republican seeking his fourth term.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm doing this because the American people no longer show up
to vote,'' Moore said. ''The majority of people feel they have no
choice. Candidates make promises and go to Washington and do
nothing. We believe a potted plant could do no worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Frelinghuysen's spokesman, Mark Broadhurst, called it a
publicity stunt to drum up interest in Moore's comedy show ''TV
Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore acknowledged that leafy candidates are no real solution.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a sad commentary on the state of electoral politics in
this country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moore is serving as campaign manager for 21 ficus trees running
in congressional races around the country. The trees are
challenging representatives who have little or no competition.

<HEADLINE> European Stocks End Lower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- European stocks ended lower on
stronger-than-expected U.S. economic figures, but suffered little
damage from another plunge in the euro against the dollar and a
European Central Bank rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of shares in European companies ended
2.96 points, or 0.8 percent, lower at 385.71, with the media sector
particularly weak. Telecoms issues also fell heavily after some
early gains.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks companies in
countries that joined the single currency, ended down 6.11 points
at 428.42. The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index was down 73.1 points
at 5172.0 and the Dow Jones Stoxx 50 Index 20.3 points lower at
4985.6.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the sharp turnaround in Europe after U.S. data
were released, sparking fears the Federal Reserve would hike
interest rates at its May meeting, illustrates the tightening hold
of the U.S. markets over equity trends in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the markets' general decline, food and beverages,
pharmaceuticals, tobacco and cyclicals gained.
</P>
<P>
   Helsinki and Stockholm bourses both rose on the back of strong
Nokia results, which also increased confidence in mobile phone
stocks across Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Nokia's first quarter mobile phone unit sales and operating
profit were both up 88 percent.
</P>

   Helsinki's General Index rose 4.7 percent, while Nokia climbed
by 7.6 percent. Stockholm's OMX index was up 1.1 percent as
Ericsson rose.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 80; Nasdaq Up 80   </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks were mostly lower today after a
widely watched economic report showed wage pressures are rising and
suggested that the Federal Reserve is likely to continue raising
interest rates to contain inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But a broad selloff was averted by a report on the gross
domestic product that showed slightly lower-than-expected growth.
Technology stocks rose on the latest wave of corporate earnings
reports.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 80.67 at 10,864.83.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index
was up 80.57 at 3,710.66 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 3.63 at 1,457.36.
</P>
<P>
   Traders had nervously anticipated today's economic reports,
fearful that one or both would show that the economy was growing
much too fast for the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   The reports confirmed that the economy is on a tear. The gross
domestic product grew at a 5.4 percent annual rate during the first
three months of 2000, the Commerce Department said today. But many
economists had anticipated a 6 percent growth rate.
</P>
<P>
   The more troubling statistic to inflation-wary traders: the
Employment Cost Index. In the first quarter, the index rose 1.4
percent, the biggest quarterly advance in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Economists fear that rising wage pressures will stimulate
inflation, prompting more and steeper interest rate increases by
the Fed. Higher interest rates are generally bad for stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ''The economy is not showing the signs of slowing that the Fed
is looking for, and investors are correct to be concerned about
that,'' said Eric Wiegand, director of the private client group at
Warburg Pincus.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which are most sensitive to inflation, led the
Dow lower. American Express fell 2 3/16 to 152 7/16 and J.P. Morgan
fell 4 3/8 to 130 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's wireless business made a modest debut in trading on the
New York Stock Exchange, rising from an offering price of 29 1/2 to
31 13/16. The tracking stock is the largest initial public offering
in history, with 360 million shares valued at a total of $10.26
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, AT&AMP;T itself fell 3 1/8 to 47 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks that posted strong earnings growth were
helping the Nasdaq outperform the blue-chip Dow. MCI WorldCom rose
3 3/4 to 44 5/8 after announcing it beat Wall Street's
first-quarter earnings expectations by 1 cent a share. The telecom
company saw net income soar to $1.3 billion from $730 million a
year ago on surging data and Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless communications company Nextel narrowed its
first-quarter loss and rose 9 5/8 to 113 3/8.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 12-to-7 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 750.51 million
shares, well ahead of Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 1.75 to 485.99.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- A bitter newspaper strike at one of Calgary's two
major dailies has provoked an extraordinary public dispute between
newspaper baron Conrad Black and the city's Roman Catholic bishop.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict so far has included name-calling, with Black
referring to Bishop Frederick Henry as a ''little twerp'' in
response to Henry's intimation that Black's company was
un-Christian in its handling of the strike.
</P>
<P>
   Despite letters exchanged by the two men last week in what a
Black associate called the resolution of the rift, Henry said
Wednesday that the central issue -- the refusal of management at the
Calgary Herald to negotiate -- remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issue is still not over and done with,'' Henry said in a
telephone interview. ''I haven't changed my stance. I still have
not seen any indication that the people of the Herald have
addressed any of the substantive issues I raised.''
</P>
<P>
   A desire to set up collective bargaining at the newspaper in
Alberta led to the strike that began in November and has continued
through the winter and early spring.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 workers -- including reporters, editors,
photographers and other editorial personnel -- demanded seniority
rights and other benefits. Negotiations quickly collapsed and
management brought in replacement workers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Henry wrote an opinion piece for the
Catholic Register magazine that explained why he had refused to
give interviews to Herald reporters and criticized the newspaper's
management.
</P>
<P>
   Henry supported the workers' right to strike and said Black,
whose holdings control 60 percent of Canadian newspapers and dozens
of others around the world, failed to consider legitimate demands.
The bishop also implied such intransigence by Black, who converted
to Catholicism 14 years ago, went against Christian teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ''Church teaching encourages Catholic workers to become actively
involved in their own unions and urges the Catholic community as a
whole to support the essential role that labor unions have to play
in society,'' the bishop wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Black responded in a Herald column by writing: ''If your
jumped-up little twerp of a bishop thinks I'm not a very good
Catholic, I think he's a prime candidate for exorcism.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to write that Henry shirked a fundamental duty by
making a moral statement on an important issue without having
''informed himself fairly.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In the Leninist terminology that would be familiar to the
strike leaders, he has made himself a perfect 'useful idiot' to
them,'' Black wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Henry initially said he wanted an apology from Black and
indicated he might take legal action, then later said he would let
the matter rest. The Vatican said it has no comment on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Colson, the vice chairman of Black's Hollinger International
publishing empire, said Wednesday in London that Black received a
letter from Henry last week explaining that the bishop never
intended his column to be interpreted as suggesting Black was
un-Christian.
</P>
<P>
   According to Colson, Black responded with a letter that thanked
the bishop for his gracious gesture, and the dispute was resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Henry, however, said there was more. While his letter to Black
began as described by Colson, it also offered forgiveness for what
Henry called ''cheap shots'' by Black and concluded by noting that
nothing had changed regarding the newspaper strike.
</P>
<P>
   He said Black's response ''started off graciously, but near the
end he started telling me in very Black-esque language, 'Bishop,
you still don't know know what you're talking about.'''
</P>
<P>
   Henry noted that he and other Calgary clergymen have tried to
intervene in the newspaper dispute but were rebuffed by management.
He said the newspaper appeared unwilling to negotiate in good faith
on the seniority question, which would restrict management's
freedom to hire and fire at will.

<HEADLINE> Smithsonian Features Viking Exhibit  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A thousand years ago adventurers in open
wooden ships sailed out of the North Atlantic mists to become the
first Europeans on American shores. They return Saturday in a major
Smithsonian exhibition: Vikings, the North Atlantic Saga.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Viking spirit of exploration surmounted barriers,'' King
Harald V of Norway said in previewing the show. ''That spirit is as
highly prized today as it was then.''
</P>
<P>
   On the 1,000th anniversary of their discovery of America, the
National Museum of Natural History hosts the $3-million exhibi
</P>
<P>
   tion of artifacts, tracing the lives, travels, jewelry,
religion, clothing, poetry and impact of the Norse.
</P>
<P>
   William W. Fitzhugh, curator of the exhibit, stressed that the
focus is on more than the terror brought by the Norse.
</P>
<P>
   From their discovery of America 500 years before Columbus, there
is evidence of settlement and widespread trading with other Norse
colonies in Greenland. The Vikings also honored poetry, and much of
their history is preserved in sagas written and passed down, giving
modern people a chance to understand their world and lives.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the show is to tell their story, ''not just as
raiders and plunderers but as heroes of western expansion who moved
with their families and livestock to form new settlements,''
Fitzhugh said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Vikings traveled widely -- from Iceland in the north to
Constantinople in the South, from Russia in the east to
Newfoundland in the west -- the show focuses on their arrival in
America 500 years before Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   The warrior spirit of the Vikings is not ignored, however, with
the exhibition including a carved memorial stone from the isolated
abbey at Lindisfarne off the coast of England. The Vikings arrival
there on June 8, 793, marked their first mention by foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   These hardy Scandinavians were feared for their brutality. Erik
Thorvaldsson settled in Iceland, where his violent ways earned the
nickname ''the Red.'' Finding himself exiled again, he colonized
Greenland and settlers with him traded with Inuit on Labrador and
Baffin Island.
</P>
<P>
   One, Bjarni Herjolfsson, first sighted mainland North America
but didn't bother to land since he was behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   That left the first landing to Erik's son, Leif the Lucky, in
about 1000.
</P>
<P>
   He founded a colony and Leif's brother, Thorvald, became the
first Viking to encounter native Americans -- and the first to be
killed fighting with them.
</P>
<P>
   The brief colony was also the scene of the first European baby
to be born in America, when Gudrid Thorbjarnardottir, wife of
Thorfinn Karlsefni, delivered a boy named Snorri. Three years
later, they moved back to Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   Location of their camp is not known, but remains of a Viking
settlement have been found in Canada, and Fitzhugh noted that
Viking goods have been found through eastern Canada and as far
south as Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The 5,500 square foot exhibition contains more than 200
artifacts, including Viking Age jewelry, wooden carvings, and items
from graves dated from A.D. 800 to 1050; medieval church carvings
from 1050 to 1400; Romantic period, 1800-1900's, paintings; and
contemporary pop-culture items.
</P>
<P>
   The display also takes on misunderstandings -- they never wore
horned helmets, for example -- their misuse as symbols by the Nazis
and even their modern day status as namesake for a National
Football League team.
</P>
<P>
   The travel schedule for the exhibition: Washington, through Aug.
13; New York, American Museum of Natural History, Oct. 20 to Jan.
20, 2001; Houston, Houston Museum of Natural History, July 13, 2001
to Oct. 11, 2001; Los Angeles, Natural History Museum of Los
Angeles County, Nov. 23, 2001 to March 16, 2002; Ottawa, Canada,
Canadian Museum of Civilization, May 16, 2002 to Oct. 14, 2002.

<HEADLINE> Gene Therapy Restores 2 Babies  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an exciting and long-awaited success, gene
therapy has restored apparently normal immune systems to two French
babies born with a rare, lethal immune disease sometimes called the
''bubble boy disease.''
</P>
<P>
   It's too soon to know if the babies are cured, experts
cautioned. But the experiment, reported in Friday's edition of the
journal Science, finally provides evidence that gene therapy can
succeed -- at a time when skeptics are harshly criticizing the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ''The clinical benefits we observe had never been achieved
before,'' Dr. Alain Fischer, the Paris physician who performed the
gene therapy, said at a news conference Thursday, describing his
sickly patients' rebound into healthy toddlers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like this really worked,'' agreed Dr. Jennifer Puck,
a geneticist at the U.S. National Institutes of Health who plans to
start a similar gene therapy study this fall with doctors at North
Carolina's Duke University. ''This is a very important milestone.''
</P>
<P>
   The babies have SCID, or ''severe combined immunodeficiency
disease,'' a devastating, rare disease. Their bodies cannot make
lymphocytes, the immune cells crucial for warding off infection --
meaning they can die from the most minor of germs.
</P>
<P>
   The best-known victim of SCID was David, Houston's famous
''bubble boy'' who lived in a germ-proof plastic enclosure until
his death at age 12.
</P>
<P>
   Today, bone marrow transplants keep many SCID babies from having
to live in sterile bubbles. Transplants provide them with healthy
stem cells, special cells that reside in the bone marrow and
produce lymphocytes. Transplants have cured some babies and
extended the lives of others. But they're not always successful, so
scientists hope gene therapy could offer an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   The French babies never tried a transplant, and lived the first
months of their lives inside sterile bubbles. They have the most
common form of SCID, caused by a defective gene that blocks a cell
receptor needed to trigger lymphocyte formation. Lift that
roadblock, and the body should generate normal, working immune
cells.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer, of the Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades in Paris, took
bone marrow from the babies when they were ages 8 months and 11
months, respectively. He culled some of their stem cells, and
bathed them in fibronectin, a protein believed to make them more
receptive to gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Then he took a normal version of the immune system gene the
babies were missing, and added it to a harmless virus. In a lab
dish, he infected the babies' stem cells with the gene-carrying
virus for three days. Then he transplanted the stem cells back into
their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the babies started making germ-killing immune cells. Three
months later, they went home from the hospital without antibiotics
or any additional treatment -- and 11 months later, both have levels
of immune system cells comparable to healthy children their age,
Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither suffered any side effects from the gene therapy. Their
immune systems reacted properly when they were vaccinated against
polio and other diseases. A third patient who had the treatment
four months ago is also doing well, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is ''the first significant success'' in gene therapy in 10
years of experiments with over 4,000 people, said Dr. W. French
Anderson of the University of Southern California, who performed
the world's first gene therapy attempt.
</P>
<P>
   What's especially important here: Scientists have long wanted to
correct gene defects at the stem cell level because healthy stem
cells should continue producing a working immune system for years.
Plus, unlike the challenge with genetic diseases that affect other
types of cells, every stem cell doesn't have to take up the new
gene -- only a few healthy stem cells are required to work.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't call it a cure'' until the children are older and
the disease doesn't return, Anderson cautioned, but it is a
possibility. ''It does look like gene therapy might finally be
turning the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, it comes at a crucial time. Gene therapy has come under
harsh criticism since September, when a different gene therapy
experiment killed an Arizona teen-ager. Skeptics questioned if the
field was too risky and would ever cure anyone, and the public
outcry slowed new experiments as regulators and doctors alike
started double-checking safety procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had my heart in my throat watching this trial go on,'' Puck
said of the French study, worried that any side effects could
threaten her own pending study. Instead, she said, ''They did
great.''

<HEADLINE> NBC Faces 'Friends' Cast Talks  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Television's best cliffhangers over the next few
weeks won't be on the air but behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   NBC and Fox are facing deadlines and delicate negotiations that
will determine whether two of their most popular series --
''Friends'' and ''The X-Files'' -- will continue next season or end
abruptly.
</P>
<P>
   Stars of each show are playing hardball in seeking more money to
continue, arguing that they are not receiving what they're worth
now that reruns of both programs are being shown in the lucrative
syndication market.
</P>
<P>
   ''Friends'' isn't as popular in its sixth season as it once was,
but it is still NBC's top-rated comedy and leads off the powerful
Thursday schedule. ''The X-Files,'' in its seventh season, has also
faded in the ratings. But it is Fox's most popular drama, and two
of the struggling network's other dramas, ''Beverly Hills 90210''
and ''Party of Five,'' are going off the air this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thursday is NBC's strongest night and Sunday is Fox's
strongest night,'' said Mike Greco, manager of broadcast research
for the advertising firm BBDO Worldwide. ''The reason is because of
their anchor shows. If you lose one of those anchor shows, it's
going to hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   As they did one time before, the six stars of ''Friends'' --
David Schwimmer, Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox Arquette, Matthew
Perry, Lisa Kudrow and Matt LeBlanc -- are banding together in an
all-for-one, one-for-all negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   Each actor reportedly earned $125,000 per episode this season.
Entertainment Weekly reported that they are asking for as much as
$800,000 per show to continue, plus some back pay. There's some
precedent they can point to: NBC gave Helen Hunt and Paul Reiser $1
million per episode for the last season of ''Mad About You.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC wouldn't comment on the negotiations. The network announces
its fall schedule to advertisers on May 15.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very hopeful that the show will return,'' said NBC
spokeswoman Shirley Powell. ''We would very much like to see it on
our schedule in the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The X-Files'' situation is more complicated, because star
David Duchovny has frequently spoken in interviews about getting
tired of the show and he has a lawsuit against its producers.
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny told The Associated Press this week that ''it's 50-50''
whether ''The X-Files'' will return and that ''if it ended, it'd be
fine. It's been seven really interesting years.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I definitely could do another year, but I really don't know if
it'll happen,'' he said. ''I'm kind of happy that decision's been
taken away from me. I've made my terms clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more important than extra money is the opportunity for him
to write and direct more episodes of the series, Duchovny said. His
co-star, Gillian Anderson, is signed for one more year.
</P>
<P>
   Fox declined comment on the talks other than to say the network
wants ''The X-Files'' to return. The show is produced by 20th
Century Fox, which also wouldn't comment.
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny sued 20th Century Fox last year, claiming the company
gave Fox-related companies sweetheart deals for syndication rights
to ''The X-Files'' that cost him a great deal of money. He said he
wants to settle the lawsuit as a condition for returning for
another year.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is due to announce its fall schedule May 18.

<HEADLINE> Sens. Back USDA on Food Mergers  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Agriculture Department should be allowed
to challenge mergers between companies that process meat and grain
or sell seed and other supplies to growers, some farm state
senators said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department hasn't done enough to slow down a wave of
mergers and acquisitions that some producers blame for a downturn
in commodity prices during the late 1990s, the lawmakers said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have an obligation to act. Current laws are not working,''
Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., said during a Senate Agriculture
Committee hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Bills introduced by Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Senate
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., would allow USDA to block
agribusiness mergers or to force the divestiture of assets.
Daschle's bill also would give the department more authority to
regulate the business practices of food and agriculture companies.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is given little chance of passing this year, and
economists say that worldwide overproduction of grain, not
agribusiness consolidation, caused the fall in commodity prices. In
fact, beef and pork prices have rebounded in recent months as
demand has increased. Beef and pork processing are among the most
highly concentrated segments of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Mergers allow companies to cut costs and get the capital it
takes for expansion, said David C. Nelson, an industry analyst with
CS First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ''Essentially, we have too many companies fighting for too few
profits. Agribusiness will not attract the capital it needs to make
the investments farmers say they want until profitability
improves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has not taken a position on the
bills, although Justice Department officials have previously said
that existing antitrust laws are adequate to protect the interests
of farmers and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our antitrust laws have stood the test of time,'' said John
Nannes, deputy assistant attorney general for the department's
antitrust division.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the department has blocked a merger between
the two biggest cotton seed producers but allowed other
acquisitions to go through, although sometimes requiring companies
to sell off some assets.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most recent mergers: Smithfield Foods Inc., the
world's largest hog producer and processor, acquired No. 2 producer
Murphy Family Farms, and Cargill Inc., North America's
second-largest grain trader, bought the grain operations of No. 5
Continental Grain. Cargill and Continental were required by Justice
to sell some of their facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted overwhelmingly last fall against imposing an
18-month moratorium on agribusiness mergers. However, the
consolidation in the industry is a major issue with many farm
groups, and in an election year, farm state lawmakers say they are
determined to keep the heat on Congress and the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an uphill climb this year, but that doesn't keep us from
raising Cain,'' said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont.

<HEADLINE> Computer Consultant Body Found  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRICK, N.J. (AP) -- Authorities searching for a missing computer
consultant recovered his body from a swamp Thursday, 10 days after
he was believed to have been kidnapped from a Kentucky motel by a
man brandishing fake FBI credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of federal agents converged on a cul-de-sac two miles
from the home of Gregory J. Marcinski, who is accused of kidnapping
Paul Jeffery Gale from a Florence, Ky., motel.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities wouldn't say why they knew to go to the site where
the body was found. The FBI would not immediately confirm the body
was Gale's, but Linda Tally Smith, an assistant commonwealth
attorney for Boone County, Ky., said it was his. An autopsy was
pending to determine cause of death, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The understanding, at this point, is that (the death) occurred
somewhere between Kentucky and New Jersey. The exact point is
unknown,'' Smith said. Regardless of the location, Kentucky can
charge Marcinski with murder because the crime originated there,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   On April 17, motel employees saw Gale, a 28-year-old British
national who was dating a former girlfriend of Marcinski's,
handcuffed and put into a white Buick with New Jersey license
plates. He had not been seen since. Kidnapping charges against
Marcinski were brought three days later.
</P>
<P>
   The British man's relatives, who came to the United States after
Gale disappeared, were notified of the search.
</P>
<P>
   Marcinski, 23, a volunteer emergency medical technician, was
charged last week in Kentucky with kidnapping and impersonating an
FBI agent.
</P>
<P>
   Marcinski gained access to Gale's motel room by flashing an
emergency medical technician badge and computer-generated FBI
credentials identifying him as ''Special Agent Trimble,''
authorities have said. He told motel employees that Gale was in the
federal witness protection program.
</P>
<P>
   Gale recently lived in Mount Laurel, where he worked as a
computer programmer for TRW Integrated Supply. He was working for
TRW in Kentucky this month as a consultant in the merger of two
pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   Gale's girlfriend, Darla Guidie, told the FBI that her former
boyfriend Marcinski made the fake ID on his computer and ''bragged
that he had gotten the format for the phony FBI credentials off of
the Internet,'' according to affidavits.
</P>
<P>
   According to an affidavit, Marcinski told authorities he drove
from New Jersey to Florence and picked up Gale because he wanted to
''clear the air.'' But he insisted he drove around for up to two
hours and then dropped Gale off unharmed at another Florence hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Marcinksi's New Jersey housemate, Preston Foree, was arrested
Wednesday night on a federal charge of being an accessory after the
fact, said Alan Ables, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office
in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   Foree, 21, was not in Kentucky and does not face charges in that
state, Smith said, but ''we believe he helped conceal the body once
the defendant brought it back to New Jersey.''

<HEADLINE> Pivotal Vietnam Battle Remembered  </HEADLINE>
By DENIS D. GRAY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   A SHAU VALLEY, Vietnam (AP) -- Today, it's a nondescript hill in
a remote mountain valley ringed by the rice fields of dirt-poor
peasants.
</P>
<P>
   To many Americans who fought there, Hamburger Hill seemed a
useless lump of terrain in the back of nowhere. Definitely not
worth dying for.
</P>
<P>
   But the military brass deemed otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   So the taking of Hill 937 proved one of the most brutal battles
of the Vietnam War -- and because of the casualties, circumstances
and timing, it sounded an early death knell for America's
engagement in this Southeast Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years after the end of the war and 31 years after
the battle of Hamburger Hill, it still ignites passionate debate --
and terrifying nightmares among survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Vander Luitgaren was a squad leader wounded in one of
the dozen assaults up the hill along with everyone else in his
company.
</P>
<P>
   In short, staccato phrases, he recalls a machine gunner buddy
torn apart by a rocket grenade, a captain killed by friendly fire,
rain turning slopes into vast mud slides and himself regaining
consciousness in the dark after being riddled by shrapnel and
thinking he had died.
</P>
<P>
   ''Was it worth it?'' asks the retired 52-year-old veteran in a
telephone interview from Buchanan, Tenn. ''Definitely not. We
should have done anything else but charge up that hill. We could
have blown it apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Another survivor is 61-year-old Ho Khoa, a major with North
Vietnamese defenders whose unit lost 20 out of 100 men in the
battle on May 10-20, 1969. Now retired, he lives in the shadow of
Ap Bia, the Vietnamese name for the hill, along the Laotian border
in central Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ''We felt isolated, we could not retreat or advance. We were
most afraid of aerial bombardment, which killed us but also the
Americans,'' he says. ''It was a very special, intense battle. We
call it the battle of 'thit bam' (the meat chopper).''
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, 46 Americans had been killed and some 400
wounded. At least 633 North Vietnamese, by American accounts, lay
strewn across the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   There were bloodier battles in the Vietnam War, but what sparked
a furor was the meat-grinder image of soldiers being ordered up a
hill again and again under withering fire, and the abandonment of
the hilltop to North Vietnamese forces just two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, U.S. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy called the assault
''senseless and irresponsible ... madness. American boys are too
valuable to be sacrificed to a false sense of military pride.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the last hurrah of American engagement,'' says Michael
Blecker, who was a 19-year-old infantrymen in the Hamburger Hill
operation. ''It took that portion of the silent majority and turned
them sour in a very dramatic way against the war. That was the
death knell.''
</P>
<P>
   Blecker, 50, who works with poor and homeless veterans in San
Francisco, said that after Hamburger Hill, the American public
could no longer stomach major American casualties no matter how
they were justified. Most historians agree.
</P>
<P>
   The orders of the day became: Keep the casualties low, let the
South Vietnamese do more of the fighting and seek a way out of
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a turning point because people said the Vietnam War was
no longer worth the American lives,'' Blecker said in a telephone
interview. ''It was just one more hill. What was one more hill from
another in the A Shau Valley?''
</P>
<P>
   Commanders at the time had a different perspective, which some
maintain to this day: the battle was part of Operation Apache Snow
which attempted to clear the 28-mile A Shau Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The valley served as an important terminus of the Ho Chi Minh
Trail, the vital North Vietnamese supply line. And it was an ideal
staging ground for attacks against Hue and other coastal cities.
</P>
<P>
   The North Vietnamese, who launched a strike against Hue, the
former imperial capital, during the Tet Offensive a year earlier,
were massing again. They had to be rooted out, and the 187th
Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division was ordered to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Luitgaren, who still relives the combat in nightmares, said he
attended a reunion of veterans who fought at Hamburger Hill last
year. It was held at Fort Campbell, Ky., home of the 187th, to mark
the 30th anniversary of the battle.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of guys took it pretty hard,'' he says. ''The loss of
life on both sides was tragic.''
</P>
<P>
   Khoa, the Vietnamese veteran, agrees, pointing one quiet
afternoon past a carpet of green rice paddies, towards denuded
foothills, to Hamburger Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could not understand why the Americans chose to fight at Ap
Bia,'' he says.

<HEADLINE> 30-, 15-Year Mortgages Inch Lower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rates on 30-year and 15-year mortgages edged
down this week but still are up more than 1 percentage point from a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The average interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell
to 8.13 percent for the week ending April 28 from 8.16 percent the
previous week, according to a survey released Thursday by Freddie
Mac, the mortgage company. This time a year ago, 30-year mortgages
averaged 6.93 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-February, the rates on 30-year mortgages hit a 3{-year
high of 8.38 percent. That was the highest since a 8.42 percent
rate for the week ending July 12, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing, also
ticked down this week to 7.79 percent from 7.82 percent. This time
a year ago, 15-year mortgages were at 6.55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an
average initial rate of 6.77 percent this week, up from 6.76
percent last week.
</P>
<P>
   The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which
averaged at or just over 1 percent of the loan amount for all three
types of mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America said
that mortgage loan applications for the week ending April 21
increased 0.5 percent from the previous week and were down 20.2
percent compared with the same week last year.

<HEADLINE> Cable TV Sparks Hollywood Walkout  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT JABLON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Actor Gary Epp sees it this way: He can
strike, or he can become a ''perpetual waiter.''
</P>
<P>
   Epp, 46, who has mostly made a living playing ''the regular guy
next door'' in TV commercials for everything from Budweiser to
Motrin, is one of 135,000 actors threatening to walk off the job
Monday. They are angry about how the rise of cable TV has hurt
their earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The strike by the Screen Actors Guild and the American
Federation of Television &AMP; Radio Artists would be the first major
Hollywood walkout in 12 years. It would affect only radio and TV
commercials, not movies or TV series.
</P>
<P>
   TV commercials are low-prestige and typically low-paying,
offering a minimum of $478 for a day's work. The important money
comes from ''pay-per-play'' residuals -- ranging roughly from $50 to
$120 -- that the actor gets each time a commercial airs on network
television.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to cable TV ads, actors receive only a renewable
flat fee of $1,000 or less for each 13-week run. But with
two-thirds of all TV ads now being made for cable, actors are
demanding pay-per-play rights.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers want the opposite -- to expand flat fees to network
commercials. They contend a proposed increase in the flat rates
would more than make up the difference for the actors.
</P>
<P>
   Epp doubts it. He said he used to earn as much as $18,000 in a
year in residuals from a single network commercial -- three times
what a cable ad might provide.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, the joke among actors is ''it actually pays better to
make the french fries at McDonald's than to make the McDonald's
commercial,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The current contract arrangement dates to the 1950s and '60s,
when ABC, NBC and CBS claimed up to 95 percent of the audience.
Nowadays, six networks fight for 50 percent of the audience, while
200 or so cable and satellite channels claim the rest, said Ira
Shepard, whose Washington-based law firm is representing the
Association of National Advertisers and the American Association of
Advertising Agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The fragmented audience means advertisers must show the same
commercial much more often to reach as many viewers, so a
pay-per-play fee ''would create an inappropriate windfall to
performers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The union's demands would mean a 350 percent increase in cable
commercial residuals, Shepard said.
</P>
<P>
   Screen Actors Guild President William Daniels doesn't buy the
argument. Advertisers are making record revenue, he said, because
they can better target audiences through specialized channels such
as ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Epp, a SAG vice president, was on the negotiating team. He said
performers account for less than 2 percent of the cost of a
commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I sit across the table from them and I see them in their
$400 Gucci shoes, telling me I'm overpaid, it really sticks in my
craw,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers say viewers won't even notice the strike. They have
stockpiled commercials and plan to continue production with both
union and nonunion actors.
</P>
<P>
   However, Steve Marcus, head of Florida-based Marcus Productions
Inc., which has done national commercials for Chrysler, L'Oreal and
others, said at least two advertising agencies have told him they
are holding off on commercials because of the strike.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're used to working with top talent, and their clients are
expecting the best,'' Marcus said.

<HEADLINE> Intruder Attacks Germaine Greer  </HEADLINE>
By IAN PHILLIPS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Feminist author Germaine Greer, threatened in her
home this week by a ranting female intruder, admits to being
slightly obsessive about privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am as territorial as a robin, who will drill his beak into
the skull of any interloper robin who wanders on to his patch,''
she said in excerpts of an account of her ordeal published Thursday
in The Daily Telegraph.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the author of ''The Female Eunuch'' was pushed back
inside her walled Georgian house near the southern England town of
Great Chesterford by a woman who, while screaming at her, smashed
some of her belongings with a poker.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how long the ordeal lasted or how violent it was.
</P>
<P>
   Police, alerted by friends who heard the shouting as they
dropped by, said Greer, 61, had been badly shaken.
</P>
<P>
   They said Karen Burke, a 19-year-old student at Bath University
in southwest England, would appear in court May 4 on charges of
causing bodily harm and unlawful imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can see that I'm not hurt, that I can walk,'' Greer
snapped at reporters at Heathrow Airport on Thursday after
returning from a work appointment in Ireland. ''I haven't lost my
sense of humor or my tolerance of dreadful behavior ... Now, you
can go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, outside her home, she said she long suspected she would
one day be targeted.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ever since I published 'The Female Eunuch,' there has always
been an off-chance that someone was going to pick me off.
Somewhere. Some nutter -- seeing some of the hostility we get in
letters,'' she said. ''I feel a bit like Caesar. The brave man dies
but once. The coward dies many times. In this case, it is a brave
woman. I refuse to be afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer chose her house because it is far from prying eyes with
only one point of entrance.
</P>
<P>
   She said she invited Burke into the house after the student
knocked on the door during the weekend, but called police after
their conversation became tense. Burke returned Monday, the author
said, pouncing from some bushes as Greer left for a dinner date.
</P>
<P>
   She said the woman should be prosecuted but expressed sympathy,
saying many university students are ''under great stress ... and
very vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   In the full account of her ordeal, to appear in Saturday's Daily
Telegraph, Greer, who in recent years has often opened her doors to
the homeless or needy, admits being on edge when confronted by
strangers at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why is it that when my space is invaded my heart beats like a
sledgehammer?'' she writes. ''If I see a stranger wandering down my
drive, my hackles rise and I pounce out of the workshop roaring
'Can I help you?' as if what I really meant was 'Can I slit your
throat?'''
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no signs saying Private Property or Keep Out or
Trespassers will be Prosecuted, but the mad glint in my eyes is
meant to speak volumes,'' she adds.
</P>
<P>
   Greer, a native of Australia, teaches women's studies at
Cambridge University and is professor of English and Comparative
Literary Studies at Warwick University.
</P>
<P>
   As well as ''The Female Eunuch,'' published to great acclaim in
1970, she wrote the 1999 work ''The Whole Woman.''

<HEADLINE> German Public Workers May Strike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) -- Germany's main public workers union
said Thursday that it will hold warning strikes next week to press
demands for a 5 percent pay increase.
</P>
<P>
   The OeTV public transport and service workers union in Stuttgart
said the job action was planned for Thursday and Friday just before
a crucial third round of pay talks.
</P>
<P>
   The third round of wage talks will be held Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The union said the warning strikes aimed to force a decent
counteroffer out of the employers in response to union demands for
5 percent pay increases for the some 3.1 million public workers in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   It said the employers were offering raises of 2 percent, or
equal to expected inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst-Otto Stueber, the employers' negotiator for German
communities, and Saxony state Finance Minister Georg Milbradt, who
represents the states, warned the union about misuse of strike
threats.
</P>
<P>
   ''No problems are solved with strikes,'' Stueber said.
</P>
<P>
   But OeTV Chairman Peter Blechschmidt said that if no responsible
wage offer came, warning strikes would take place nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''The employers must finally make a move,'' Blechschmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides 5 percent increases, the union is asking for approval of
a step-by-step plan to bring wages of eastern Germans, currently at
86.5 percent of that of workers in the West, up to western levels.
</P>
<P>
   Eastern public workers also have a 40-hour workweek, compared to
38.5 hours for their western colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Germany's public workers settled for 3.1 percent
raises after demanding 5.5 percent increases.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, an 11-day strike by the public service unions --
including transport, office workers, bank employees, garbage,
hospital and airport ground crews -- closed Frankfurt International
Airport, shut down public transportation and left garbage piled in
the streets.
</P>
<P>
   After that action, the unions accepted 5.4 percent increases,
just over half of what they were demanding.

<HEADLINE> Body of kidnapped computer consultant found in New Jersey swamp  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A British computer consultant snatched from
Kentucky last week has been found dead in a central New Jersey
swamp, and the suspected kidnapper could now face the death penalty
for murder, a Kentucky prosecutor says.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Gregory J. Marcinski of Brick has been held without
bail since April 20 on charges he impersonated an FBI agent to
kidnap Paul Jeffrey Gale of Naples, Fla., three days earlier
because Gale was dating Marcinski's former lover.
</P>
<P>
   Marcinski's housemate, Preston Foree, was arrested Wednesday
night, and authorities believe he helped Marcinski hide Gale's
body.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of Gale's death has not been determined, pending
completion of an autopsy scheduled for Thursday afternoon, said FBI
Agent Sandra Carroll, a spokeswoman for the Newark office.
</P>
<P>
   She declined to comment on the condition of the body, which was
found about daybreak Thursday in a marshy section of Brick about
two miles from Marcinski's home following a daylong search.
</P>
<P>
   Gale, 28, was kidnapped from a hotel room in Florence, Ky., but
investigators do not yet know where he was killed, said Linda Tally
Smith, an assistant commonwealth attorney for Boone County, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   ''The understanding, at this point, is that it occurred
somewhere between Kentucky and New Jersey. The exact point is
unknown,'' Smith said. Regardless of the location, Kentucky can
charge him with murder because the crime originated there, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky is awaiting autopsy results and other information
before deciding whether to charge Marcinski with murder, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will probably become a capital case, but we're still
looking at it,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Marcinski, 23, is being held in the Monmouth County,
N.J., jail awaiting extradition to Kentucky on state and federal
kidnapping charges.
</P>
<P>
   Foree, 21, lived at the home of Marcinkski's grandmother, and
does not face Kentucky charges, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no evidence he stepped foot in the state,'' she said.
''We believe he helped conceal the body once the defendant brought
it back to New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Foree was arrested Wednesday on a federal charge of being an
accessory after the fact, said Alan Ables, a spokesman for the U.S.
attorney's office in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   Marcinski, a volunteer emergency medical technician, flashed an
EMT badge and computer-generated FBI credentials to gain access to
Gale's room at the Holiday Inn in Florence, a city across the Ohio
River from Cincinnati, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   Gale recently lived in Mount Laurel, N.J., where he worked as a
computer programmer for TRW Integrated Supply. He was working for
TRW in Kentucky this month as a consultant in the merger of two
pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   Gale was reported missing April 17 by a friend and business
associate.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Marcinski became enraged that Gale had been
dating his ex-girlfriend, Darla Guidie, and drove his grandmother's
Buick 800 miles to Kentucky to confront Gale.
</P>
<P>
   Marcinski identified himself as Special Agent ''Trimble'' and
handcuffed Gale before placing him in the front seat of the Buick
in the early morning hours of April 17, authorities have said.
</P>
<P>
   Guidie told the FBI that Marcinski made the fake identification
on his computer and ''bragged that he had gotten the format for the
phony FBI credentials off of the Internet,'' according to court
papers.
</P>
<P>
   Marcinski, a member of the Community First Aid Squad and a
self-employed computer technician, was also arrested last August
when another ex-girlfriend told police he assaulted her and grabbed
her new boyfriend by the neck, pushing him to the floor, the Asbury
Park Press Of Neptune reported.

<HEADLINE> Rep. Kennedy Ordered To Hearing  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF WILSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Rep. Patrick Kennedy was ordered Thursday to
appear at an informal hearing to try to work things out with an
airport security guard who claims he shoved and grabbed her in a
dispute over his bag.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than file a misdemeanor battery charge, which carries up
to six months in jail and a $2,000 fine, the city prosecutor's
office ordered the May 12 meeting between the two in front of a
hearing officer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a closed, informal, quasi-judicial hearing so both
parties can discuss this. We refer cases to the hearing because we
feel they can be resolved,'' said Mike Qualls, spokesman for the
city attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Such hearings are held in 25,000 to 30,000 cases a year. The
hearing officer will prepare a report for the city attorney, who
will decide whether to file charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''The final decision on the case is made after the hearing, but
nine out of 10 are resolved and there are no charges,'' Qualls
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Marcella, Kennedy's chief of staff, has no immediate
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Della Patton, 58, claims the Rhode Island Democrat shoved and
grabbed her on March 26 after she told him his bag was too big to
fit through an X-ray scanner at Los Angeles airport. She filed a
battery complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy admitted he lost his temper but said he apologized to
Patton and the incident was ''blown completely out of proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said that the surveillance video of the incident showed
''physical contact.''
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old son of Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., asked
police earlier this month to make the videotape public, insisting
it would clear him. Police refused, saying it was evidence in a
criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Patton's attorney, Paul Trump, had no comment Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Southeast Asia Waters Hide Rebels  </HEADLINE>
By RANJAN ROY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MATAKING ISLAND, Malaysia (AP) -- The powder-white beach here is
untouched, save for the twigs and darkened kelp washed ashore from
waters teeming with coral reefs and tropical fish.
</P>
<P>
   Mataking Island -- one of hundreds peppering the waters between
Malaysia and the Philippines -- is an ideal retreat for a holiday
getaway, or a hide-out for pirates like the ones who abducted 21
foreign tourists and resort workers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Since nabbing their hostages from nearby Sipadan Island in
Malaysia five days ago, the kidnappers have released no one. A
former Muslim rebel leader negotiating for the Philippine
government said he would meet Friday with representatives of the
captors to try to win the hostages' release.
</P>
<P>
   Sipadan itself is now sealed to the public and press, while
investigators question its resort workers about the kidnapping. But
other inlets in the vast Sulu and Celebes seas still provide
pirates ideal getaways.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, six armed captors in two wooden fishing boats
abducted the hostages and fled along this very route to similar
islands in the southern Philippines. The victims include citizens
of Germany, France, South Africa, Finland, Lebanon, the Philippines
and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysian police intelligence reports indicate that the
abductors split up into smaller groups, and have been hopskotching
from one island to another in a bid to avoid the hundreds of police
swarming the area.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnappers, apparently connected to extremist Muslim
insurgents in the Philippines, have demanded a $2.4 million ransom
for the hostages, who are being held somewhere on the islands of
Sulu province in the Philippines, officials said. So far, neither
the Philippines nor Malaysia has said it would negotiate a ransom.
</P>
<P>
   This hostage-taking, along with another one month ago in which
rebels took 27 people, has drawn wide attention to the Philippines'
quarter-century Muslim separatist rebellion, which has taken more
than 120,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   Former rebel leader Nur Misuari, the Philippines' negotiator in
the crisis, urged the military Thursday not to threaten the Sipadan
kidnappers while the talks were under way. Announcing he would meet
with the rebel captors Friday, Misuari said the kidnappers saw the
hostages as a treasure, and were unlikely to release them quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they will cling tooth and nail to these people just to
be able to optimize their gain,'' Misuari told reporters Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But military Deputy Chief of Staff Jose Calimlim said the
military had prepared a ''contingency'' action plan.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers have launched an attack against the Muslim extremists'
southern stronghold to free the 27 hostages taken earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But while both kidnappings have been blamed on the same group,
the Abu Sayyaf, Philippine officials said they may not be related.
</P>
<P>
   Calimlim said the motive of the Malaysian kidnapping appeared to
be money, while the abductors in the earlier case have made
ideological demands, including the release of three Arab terrorists
jailed in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the attack on Sipadan had been planned for nearly a month,
indicating it was not intended to coincide with the hostage rescue
attempt, a police report said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, local authorities have continued to search the
watery maze of islands for pirates and kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
   On Mataking, at the edge of Malaysian waters off Borneo,
fourteen Malaysian policemen armed with M-16 rifles scour the seas
with binoculars for passing boats traversing one of the sea
channels between Malaysia and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Mataking's small marine force is part of Malaysia's effort to
combat piracy, which has become so serious in the area that the
London-based International Maritime Bureau in 1992 set up a
regional piracy center in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-acre island just three miles west of the international
border is the marine force's frontier outpost. Barbed wire and
sandbagged gun positions run the length of the otherwise pristine
shoreline, and briefings are held in a tin-roofed shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Sipadan kidnapping, patrolling has intensified, said
the head of the force, Inspector Daud, dressed in shorts and beach
sandals, his assault rifle close at hand.
</P>
<P>
   But despite treaties between the Southeast Asian neighbors to
fight piracy, the police officers on Mataking said they'd never
been part of any joint patrol of the waters, considered some of the
world's most dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have never seen any Philippine patrol boats, even on their
side of this border,'' said one Malaysian marine policeman, who
would give his name only as Hamid.

   Wages, Benefits Jump 4.3 Percent
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. workers' wages and benefits rose by 4.3
percent in the 12 months ending in March, the fastest growth in pay
in eight years, the government said today. The increase in the
Labor Department's Employment Cost Index was up sharply from the 12
months ending in December, when wages and benefits rose by 3.4
percent. Higher labor costs are a concern to economists for fear
employers will pass on the cost to consumers, raising inflationary
pressures.

   Economy Grows at 5.4 Percent Rate
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 5.4
percent in the first quarter, driven by an 8.3 percent rise in
consumer spending, the largest since 1983. The increase in the
gross domestic product -- the country's total output of goods and
services -- as measured by the Commerce Department was weaker than
the 6 percent rate many analysts were expecting. The economy grew
at a 7.3 percent rate in the last quarter of 1999.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The technological boom that is transforming
the nation's cities is also providing greater job opportunities and
a better life in rural areas, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan said today. In the Internet and computer age, rural
citizens are gaining access to a broader range of goods and
services and the already existing goods and services are available
more expeditiously and at lower cost,'' Greenspan said. in remarks
to a conference on rural America sponsored by the Federal Reserve
regional bank in Kansas City, he noted satellite television, and
also innovations being developed, such as telemedicine, which
enables doctors in rural areas to diagnose illnesses through TV and
computer hookups.

   EToys' Sales Rise but Losses Widen
</P>
<P>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- EToys Inc.'s quarterly sales nearly
quadrupled from a year ago, but the online retailer's losses
widened significantly as it spent heavily on marketing and
expanding its warehouse space. EToys reported today that it lost
$36.6 million or 30 cents per share, in the quarter that ended
March 31, compared with a loss of $8.9 million, or 10 cents per
share, a year ago. The results beat a 32-cents-per-share loss
forecast by analysts. Sales jumped to $23 million, up from $6.1
million a year ago. The company expects to be in ''striking
distance'' of break-even by the holiday quarter of 2001 and should
reach profitability in 2002, said eToys president and chief
executive Toby Lenk.

   PARIS (AP) -- Credit Lyonnais has suspended the voting rights of
Dresdner Bank AG for two years after its German rival failed to
declare its recent purchase of a 3.6 percent in the French bank,
chairman Jean Peyrelevade said today. The decision came at the
demand of one or more of Credit Lyonnais' core shareholder group,
which has a 33 percent stake in the bank. Peyrelevade, speaking at
the bank's annual meeting, said he expects members of the core
shareholder group to protect Credit Lyonnais from any takeover bid

<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. will pay a $1.1 million penalty as
part of a settlement of alleged violations of the Clean Air Act,
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said. Ford's consent
decree with the EPA and the Justice Department covers the Wayne
Assembly and Michigan Truck Assembly plants, both in Wayne, and the
Dearborn Assembly plant in Dearborn. Under the agreement, Ford must
pay one-third of the $1.1 million penalty to the federal

The consent decree incorporates Ford's plan to close Dearborn
Assembly by Oct. 31 and move its operations to a new plant being

automaker, saying it was ''financially not secured.'' But talks
with another group of British venture capitalists who want to
acquire Rover are proceeding and a decision is expected in early
May, the German luxury carmaker said. Towers, a former Rover chief
executive who left the company in 1996, stepped in two weeks ago to
make a rival bid for Rover to the original offer by Alchemy

<HEADLINE> Electronic Postmarks Launched  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Postal Service launched its new electronic
postmark service Thursday, offering a means of dating and securing
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   An electronic postmark is not a new e-mail service, but rather
an additional feature available through any e-mail service. It
provides a Postal Service date stamp to guarantee the date the
message was sent.
</P>
<P>
   The message cannot then be changed without the alterations being
obvious, postal officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Postal spokeswoman Sue Brennan likened the system to mailing a
postcard written with indelible ink. It has a postmark to prove
when it was sent and it can't be changed without that being
obvious.
</P>
<P>
   The first Internet company to offer the service is PostX Corp.
of Cupertino, Calif. Others are expected to join in.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Electronic Postmark will give online communicators a
little peace of mind and add a level of trust and security that
Americans have come to expect from sending a regular hardcopy
letter,'' said Deputy Postmaster General John Nolan.
</P>
<P>
   The post office said it expects the Electronic Postmark to be of
particular interest to businesses and individuals who need secure
electronic transmission of financial transactions and confidential
data, so they can detect if a document or file has been tampered
with in transit and to provide evidence that the document existed
at a specific time and date.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet companies pay the Postal Service for offering the
Electronic Postmark and then can charge their customers a fee. The
amount of that charge was not immediately available.

<HEADLINE> Sentencing for killer mom delayed, judge to consider abuseallegation  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM KATES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN, N.Y. (AP) -- A judge agreed Thursday to hear evidence of
domestic abuse before sentencing a woman who says she killed her
teen-age autistic son to stop him from raping and abusing her.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Davis was scheduled to be sentenced by Cayuga County
Judge Peter Corning. Instead, her attorney asked for a last-minute
adjournment so Corning could consider whether Davis was responsible
for her actions because of the alleged abuse.
</P>
<P>
   If Davis' case meets the criteria under the state's domestic
abuse laws, she could receive a significantly lighter sentence,
even probation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The defense is entitled to make its case,'' said Corning.
</P>
<P>
   Although prosecutors at one time considered bringing death
penalty charges against the 37-year-old Davis, she was allowed to
plead guilty in March to first-degree manslaughter and use an
''affirmative defense.'' That defense argued that she suffered from
''extreme emotional disturbance'' the night of the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Davis admitted using a candle and nail polish remover to start a
fire in her Fleming home last Sept. 4, killing her 13-year-old son,
Daniel Leubner, who was asleep on the second floor.
</P>
<P>
   Her plea came several days after a closed four-day hearing on
whether to suppress her statement. It was later revealed that in
her statement, Davis alleged her son had raped her and beaten her
several times, including the night of the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they investigated Davis' claim and found no
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Corning will hold a hearing to consider the domestic abuse
claims. If witnesses are available, the hearing will begin
Wednesday, otherwise it could be late May or early June before it
is held, the judge said. Defense attorney David Elkovitch said
testimony would focus on the effects of post-traumatic stress
syndrome and rape trauma syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Davis remains free on bail pending her sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than being disappointed by the delay in seeing his
ex-wife punished, Leroy Leubner welcomed the hearing. Leubner said
Davis made up the rape allegations to obtain leniency. He said his
son, although a big 13-year-old at 5-foot-7, 155 pounds, was not
violent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Danny was convicted of a crime and has never had a chance to
defend himself. None of this is true and a hearing will give us a
chance to challenge her lies,'' Leubner said outside the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   First-degree manslaughter carries a maximum penalty of 25 years
but it was expected Davis was going to receive a term of three to
five years Thursday. Leubner is confident the hearing will
undermine Davis' story and convince the judge she should receive a
longer sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ''She deserves to spend a lot more time in jail for what she
did. If we have to wait a little longer to see that happen, we can
wait,'' Leubner said.

<HEADLINE> 55 Bodies in Uganda Cult House  </HEADLINE>
By HENRY WASSWA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- A month after officials dug up hundreds
of victims of a Ugandan doomsday cult, workers on Thursday exhumed
the bodies of 55 more people -- mostly women and children -- from a
garage rented by a cult leader.
</P>
<P>
   Gravediggers clad in yellow plastic protective gear removed the
bodies of 22 women, 15 men, 10 girls and eight boys from three
graves in a garage attached to a small brick house in Ggaba, a
residential area just south of Kampala, police spokesman Assuman
Mugenyi said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the bodies bore no external signs of violence and the
cause of death would be determined by pathologists. The remains
were wrapped in black polyethylene bags and loaded onto a trailer
to be taken to the municipal cemetery for burial.
</P>
<P>
   The exhumations came a month after barefoot prisoners in shorts
dug up 80 bodies and a skull from a cult compound in the village of
Rushojwa in southwestern Uganda, the last of four properties tied
to the cult where bodies were found.
</P>
<P>
   Mugenyi said police had suspected for some time that there might
be bodies at the Ggaba house rented by excommunicated Roman
Catholic priest Dominic Kataribabo, a leader of the Movement for
the Restoration of the Ten Commandments -- the cult now blamed for
979 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   But criticism over the use in the villages of unprotected
prisoners to unearth the bodies, coupled with international media
coverage, prompted authorities to suspend the search until they had
assembled the necessary equipment and logistics.
</P>
<P>
   It was feared that the grisly discovery in Ggaba would not be
the last.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not got the logistics for the whole investigation,''
Mugenyi told The Associated Press. ''This was in the city, and
people were concerned, and we were equally concerned, so we had to
give it priority. We will wait until everything is ready, and then
we will resume the work.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of police and soldiers kept reporters and photographers
well away from the property as the bodies were being dug up.
</P>
<P>
   Mugenyi said the digging at the Ggaba compound was finished, and
authorities did not expect to find more bodies there.
</P>
<P>
   When several hundred people were reported to have perished in a
fire at a cult compound in Kanungu on March 17, the deaths were
first believed to have been a mass suicide. Authorities later said
530 people were burned alive.
</P>
<P>
   When six bodies were found in a pit latrine in the same
compound, and then 388 more in houses owned or rented by cult
leaders in three other villages, officials began to speak of mass
murder.
</P>
<P>
   On April 6, police issued arrest warrants for Kataribabo, Joseph
Kibwetere, Credonia Mwerinde and three other cult leaders. They
were initially thought to have perished in the Kanungu fire.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and relatives of the victims said cult leaders
encouraged their followers to sell their worldly possessions to
prepare for the end of the world that they said would occur Dec. 31
because the Ten Commandments were not being properly observed. When
the end did not come, some of the members began to ask for their
goods back.
</P>
<P>
   Kataribabo, who earned a master's degree in religious studies
from Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles in 1987, owned a
house in Rugazi village where 155 of the buried bodies were exhumed
on March 28 and 29.
</P>
<P>
   Many cult members had been practicing Roman Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Kampala authorities could have waited even longer to dig in the
Ggaba compound had heavy rain last week not created a sinkhole near
the garage. That raised the suspicions of neighbors and police, who
sealed off the area after poking around and initially finding
nothing, neighbors said.
</P>
<P>
   Four women and two teen-age boys who had lived in the house
vanished three days before the Kanungu fire. Before that,
Kataribabo had been seen there often with busloads of people who
went inside to pray.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got complaints from people about the smell coming from the
side of the garage two days after the occupants vanished,'' said
Hamisi Kigozi, a local chief. ''We did not suspect much, but people
were complaining that there might be bodies there.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 31; Nasdaq Up 111  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks regained leadership of the
stock market today, rising sharply and helping blue-chip names
shake off a pair of economic reports that suggested more
interest-rate increases are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the
Nasdaq composite index was up 111.35 at 3,741.44.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were recovering from early losses. The
Dow Jones industrial average was down 31.03 at 10,914.47 and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 1.58 at 1,462.57.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks drove the Nasdaq higher after some leading
telecommunications companies posted strong earnings reports. MCI
WorldCom rose 4 1/16 to 44 15/16 after announcing it beat Wall
Street's first-quarter earnings expectations by 1 cent a share. The
telecom company saw net income soar to $1.3 billion from $730
million a year ago on surging data and Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless communications company Nextel narrowed its
first-quarter loss and rose 6 11/16 to 110 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, AT&AMP;T's wireless business made a successful, if
modest, debut in trading on the New York Stock Exchange, rising
from an offering price of 29 1/2 to 31 15/16. The tracking stock is
the largest initial public offering in history, with 360 million
shares valued at a total of $10.26 billion.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T itself fell 1 7/8 to 48 7/8.
</P>
<P>
   The strength in telecom and technology helped the market recover
from initial weakness in the wake of government reports on the
gross domestic product and the Employment Cost Index. Many on Wall
Street had been fearful that one or both would show that the
economy was growing much too fast for the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   The reports confirmed that the economy is on a tear. The gross
domestic product grew at a 5.4 percent annual rate during the first
three months of 2000, the Commerce Department said today. But many
economists had anticipated a 6 percent growth rate.
</P>
<P>
   The more troubling statistic to inflation-wary traders: the
Employment Cost Index. In the first quarter, the index rose 1.4
percent, the biggest quarterly advance in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Economists fear that rising wage pressures will stimulate
inflation, prompting more and steeper interest rate increases by
the Fed. Higher interest rates are generally bad for stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ''The economy is not showing the signs of slowing that the Fed
is looking for, and investors are correct to be concerned about
that,'' said Eric Wiegand, director of the private client group at
Warburg Pincus.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which are most sensitive to inflation, led the
Dow lower. American Express fell 2 3/16 to 152 7/16 and J.P. Morgan
fell 4 3/8 to 130 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 12-to-7 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 896.28 million
shares, well ahead of Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 5.36 to 489.60.

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Help Colombia Fight Drugs  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New extortion demands by Colombian leftist
rebels will not deter the United States from helping the Colombian
government fight its drug war, Defense Secretary William Cohen said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel group known as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC, announced Tuesday it will begin kidnapping
Colombian millionaires and corporate executives who refuse to pay a
tax to it.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels said their extortion policy was a counter to
government aggression fueled in part by ''Yankee imperialism.''
</P>
<P>
   ''These are not dewy-eyed romanticists that have in mind the
welfare of the Colombian people,'' Cohen told reporters in a joint
appearance with Luis Fernando Ramirez, Colombia's minister of
national defense. ''To the extent that they are engaged and
supported by narco-trafficking, that is clearly undermining
Colombian society, and to the extent that that product is
distributed and disseminated in the United States, it's certainly
having a very negative impact upon our citizens as well.''
</P>
<P>
   A $1.7 billion anti-narcotics aid package passed the House on
March but has stalled in the Senate. Cohen predicted that the
Senate would pass the aid package soon.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that we are determined to help Colombia, which wants
to rid itself of narco-trafficking (means) we are prepared to
continue that assistance,'' Cohen said. ''That is for our benefit
as well as the people of Colombia.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez said his government would not stand for more extortion
demands by FARC.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is obviously an extortion,'' Ramirez said. ''The
Colombian government cannot accept that someone who has not been
legitimately elected, replace our congress and our authorities. And
the Colombian military or police will continue to perform their
constitutional mandate to pursue and prosecute those who are
committing these acts against the law.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Weighs Gay Discrimination Ban  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate supporters of a federal law banning
workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation pointed
Thursday to a study showing that similar state laws don't result in
a flood of lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the facts are clear, there has been no litigation
explosion as a result of laws preventing employment discrimination
based on sexual orientation,'' said Sen. Jim Jeffords, R-Vt.
</P>
<P>
   A General Accounting Office study requested by Jeffords found
that in the 11 states and the District of Columbia that have sexual
orientation anti-discrimination laws, there was ''no indication
that these laws have generated a significant amount of
litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The study by GAO, the investigative wing of Congress, also
revealed that sexual discrimination cases are a relatively small
proportion of all employment discrimination complaints.
</P>
<P>
   In California, which has had a sexual orientation law since
1993, there were 154 sexual orientation discrimination lawsuits in
1999, 0.8 percent of all employment discrimination complaints. The
state with the highest percentage in 1999 was New Hampshire, where
sexual orientation cases were eight out of a total of 241, or 3.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffords said the study disproved the arguments of opponents of
federal legislation that it would lead to a ''rush to the
courthouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffords and Sens. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn., are sponsoring a bill that would give federal

<HEADLINE> Ransom Plot Foiled by Suspicious Mom  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROKEN ARROW, Okla. (AP) -- When her son told her drug dealers
were after him for $10,000, Denise Six gave him the money. But when
a ransom note for the young man appeared on her door five days
later, she got suspicious and called police.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrived at the arranged drop spot in Broken Arrow,
outside of Tulsa, on Monday to find Six's son, Nathaniel Reid Six,
20, in a rented limousine with his friends and an empty bottle of
champagne.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears other parties in the vehicle had no idea they were
supposed to be kidnappers,'' Lt. Paul Kroutter said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel Six was arrested and accused of obtaining money by
false pretenses and marijuana possession.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Six told police she gave her son $10,000 on April 19
after he told her drug dealers were threatening him.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, she found the note and phone messages from her son
saying he had been kidnapped by people who were driving him around
in a limousine and demanding $10,000 or they would harm him,
Kroutter said.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the kidnappers not giving up and kidnapping him again,
she started to think that something doesn't add up,'' Sgt. Heath
Arning said.

<HEADLINE> Russians Tone Down Chechnya Talk  </HEADLINE>
By NICK WADHAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- With Russian troops bogged down in the mountains
of Chechnya and suffering heavy losses, the Kremlin is hinting it
may no longer be counting on an overwhelming military victory to
end the war.
</P>
<P>
   Russian jets keep flying daily air raids and tens of thousands
of federal troops are locked in a hit-and-run war in Chechnya. But
President Vladimir Putin and other top officials have toned down
their harsh rhetoric of accepting nothing less than total victory.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have repeatedly defied Russian claims that they are
on the verge of defeat, repeatedly ambushing federal troops. The
government, reacting to pressure from abroad and faltering public
support at home, admits it is talking with Chechen intermediaries
about a political solution and would consider negotiating with
rebel leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the war dragging on, at some point or another, Russia has
to come to an agreement with the people it's fighting against,''
said Emil Pain, a former adviser to Boris Yeltsin who directs the
Center for Ethno-Political Studies.
</P>
<P>
   While the government shows no sign of calling off the military
campaign, it has recently acknowledged swapping peace proposals
through intermediaries with Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov,
nominal leader of the rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin has said Maskhadov, who has been seeking a deal with
Moscow, could qualify for amnesty. Putin said last week that he was
prepared for talks with Maskhadov, but only if he gets the rebels
to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Such a deal with Maskhadov would further split the already
fractured rebel command and give Russia an important propaganda
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's not clear what negotiations with Maskhadov -- or any
Chechen leader -- could achieve. Several Chechens are vying for the
top spot in the republic, but none has the authority to enforce a
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''Such a person must have influence with the illegal armed
formations,'' Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo said in an
interview with the newspaper Izvestia. ''Unfortunately, there is no
such person in Chechnya at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Rushailo also said the government was working with at least two
prominent Chechens outside the rebel ranks: Bislan Gantamirov, who
was pardoned and released from prison last fall to lead a
pro-Moscow militia in Chechnya; and a religious leader, Mufti
Akhmad Alidkhadzhi Kadyrov. But neither is thought to have any real
support in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The talk of negotiations comes as Russian popular support for
the war -- initially very high -- has begun to slowly erode,
according to Natalia Laidinen, a researcher at the independent
ROMIR polling agency.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have inflicted heavy casualties recently, and
official figures put the death toll for federal troops at over
1,800 since the military entered Chechnya in September.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent reported attack, Chechen rebels attacked a
Russian squad from the front and rear on Wednesday, killing 10
federal troops and 17 rebels, Russian officials said. The firefight
took place near Serzhen-Yurt, a town near the entrance of the key
Vedeno Gorge that leads into the mountains. An ambush Sunday near
the town killed at least 13 Russians.
</P>
<P>
   If the rebels counterattack this spring, as some analysts
predict, support could evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the federal forces take larger losses, if the Chechens
launch terrorist attacks elsewhere in Russia, this war will be far
more present in people's minds,'' Laidinen said. ''They will want
the problem decided.''
</P>
<P>
   Moscow is under pressure from the West to end the war. With
Putin seeking better ties, Moscow may want to avoid major new
offensives in Chechnya that would only sour relations. The cost of
such attacks would also be high in manpower and material.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Putin could lose credibility if he steps back from
promises of a decisive victory in Chechnya that helped make him
popular before he won the March 26 presidential elections. And most
Russians still believe order must be brought to Chechnya, which was
overrun by violence after rebels defeated Russian troops in the
1994-96 war.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no way Putin can backpedal now,'' said independent
political analyst Pavel Felgenhauer. ''He hasn't left himself an
exit strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Pain, of the Center for Ethno-Political Studies, said Russia
would probably try to scale down fighting, but that it wouldn't
risk withdrawing troops and the conflict could drag on for a long
time.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are all the signs of a widening guerrilla war in
Chechnya,'' Pain said. ''I don't rule out that it could last for
the entire four years of Putin's term.''

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Bill in Limbo in Senate  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation to increase U.S. military ties
with Taiwan may be put on hold in the Senate to use as future
leverage over China, a sponsor of the bill suggested Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, said he has recommended to
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., that the Senate not
move forward on the bill at this time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see a need for it,'' Murkowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Murkowski said Taiwan's president-elect, Chen
Shui-bian, and other leaders told him that a Senate vote on the
measure now could serve as an irritant to already-frayed relations
between China and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, who will be sworn in May 20, is under great pressure to
improve relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're very interested now in getting the president
inaugurated and having a smooth transition,'' said Murkowski, who
visited Taiwan last week. He said Chen and other Taiwanese leaders
had reached a consensus that Senate action on the bill at this time
''would not be in the best interests of Taiwan.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Congress would have more leverage over China if it keeps
the legislation pending, rather than passing it and needlessly
provoking China at a sensitive time.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which passed the House 341-70 in February, would
establish formal links between the U.S. and Taiwanese military. It
has drawn strong opposition from Beijing and a veto threat from
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent decision of Lott and other Senate leaders to allow
the Taiwan legislation -- passed overwhelmingly by the House in
February -- to languish a little longer on the Senate calendar was
cheered by supporters of granting China permanent trade benefits.
They do not want the issue of increased military support for the
island to interfere with the China trade vote scheduled for later
this spring.
</P>
<P>
   But Lott spokesman John Czwartacki said Thursday that ''no
decision has yet been made on scheduling'' on the Taiwan bill,
despite Murkowski's appeal that it be delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Lott earlier this month put the bill on the Senate calendar to
allow it to be taken up at any time.
</P>
<P>
   One problem for Lott is that some influential Senate
conservatives, including Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., are pressing for Senate action on the legislation --
particularly after the administration's decision last week not to
sell Aegis destroyers and certain other sophisticated weapons to
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   However, Republican sources speaking on the condition they not
be identified said they expected Lott to honor Murkowski's request.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatically, the United States deals with Taiwan carefully,
avoiding any suggestion it is promoting independence for the
island.
</P>
<P>
   The bill to increase military ties with Taiwan already was
viewed as in trouble in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., a leading Senate sponsor of the China
trade bill, put a ''hold'' on the legislation -- implying that he
would use procedural obstacles to block the bill vote should Lott
choose to bring it up.
</P>
<P>
   Such obstacles are time-consuming to overcome and require 60
votes instead of the simple 51-vote majority generally needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears that the Senate is taking a momentarily thoughtful
approach to the issue surrounding U.S. relations with Taiwan,''
Baucus spokesman Michael Siegel said. ''That's encouraging.
However, Senator Baucus is intent on ensuring that he can do all he
can to separate the issue of this legislation from the upcoming
trade debate. Therefore, his hold still stands.''
</P>
<P>
   The House will start debating the bill to extend China permanent
normal trade relations on May 22 and both sides are predicting a
close vote. The Senate, where support for the trade bill is more
broadly based, has not yet set a date for debate.
</P>
<P>
   Leading supporters of the legislation want the Senate to vote
first to help build momentum before the crucial House vote. But
recent back surgery undergone by Senate Finance Committee Chairman
William Roth, R-Del., could mean the Senate won't vote on the
measure until June.
</P>
<P>
   Roth is the chief Senate sponsor of the trade bill.

<HEADLINE> Brits Auction Mobile Phone Licenses  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE STANLEY, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The world's first auction of next-generation
mobile phone licenses ended today, and already one of the losing
bidders is sizing up one of the winners as a potential acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Four established British phone companies and a Canadian newcomer
emerged victorious in the auction, which reaped a $35.6 billion
bonanza for the British treasury.
</P>
<P>
   The five firms won licenses that represent slices of Britain's
airwave spectrum and stakes in what's expected to be the hottest
segment of the wireless market.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the licenses now in use, the new third-generation
licenses will enable wireless companies to send far more
information to a handset, transforming the device into a mobile
personal computer that can roam the Internet, display video and
provide constant access to e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The winners include four longtime players in the British market:
British Telecommunications; Vodafone AirTouch; One2One Personal
Communications, which is owned by Germany's Deutsche Telekom; and
Orange 3G, a unit of Germany's Mannesmann that will be sold when
Vodafone finishes acquiring the German company.
</P>
<P>
   Under British law, Vodafone cannot operate two wireless
businesses at the same time, and industry analysts expect it to try
to sell Orange as early as this summer.
</P>
<P>
   France Telecom, the No. 1 phone company in France, is a leading
contender to buy Orange. France Telecom had backed NTL Mobile, the
last unsuccessful bidder to withdraw from the auction.
</P>
<P>
   Now it may have an even stronger interest, with NTL losing out
in the last round of bidding for a license, said Mark Horn, head of
European research for the brokerage T. Hoare Canaccord.
</P>
<P>
   Other likely suitors for Orange are Royal KPN of the Netherlands
and Japan's largest mobile phone service, NTT DoCoMo.
</P>
<P>
   ''The crucial thing now is the price for Orange,'' said
Christian Mahr of the brokerage Investec Henderson Crosthwaite.
</P>
<P>
   A valuation of more than $55 billion might discourage some
potential suitors, Mahr said. But he added: ''It remains a very
attractive asset.''
</P>
<P>
   The fifth firm to capture a license is TIW UMTS (UK), a
subsidiary of Telesystem International Wireless of Montreal,
Canada. TIW won License A, the most powerful on offer, which the
government had reserved for a newcomer in the hope of stimulating
competition in the British mobile phone market.
</P>
<P>
   TIW plans to develop its network with the help of a service
provider in which Hong Kong-based conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa
has a 90.1 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   The new licenses, which take effect in 2002, are good for 20
years and payable over the first 10 years. Bidding began on March
6, with each company depositing just $158 million.
</P>
<P>
   The bidding far exceeded initial expectations and forced eight
of the original 13 bidders to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone is paying $9.5 billion for the most high-powered
license available to the established companies. TIW won with a bid
of $7.0 billion, Orange with $6.5 billion, and BT and One2One with
$6.3 billion each.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Grindle, an industry analyst at investment bank Dresdner
Kleinwort Benson, said the high cost of the licenses will
inevitably be reflected in the rates that companies charge their
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The money doesn't stop there. They have to build up the
networks as well,'' he said, estimating that each of the five
winners will have to invest up to $4.7 billion on equipment and
services.
</P>
<P>
   The auction has inspired Germany and other countries that are
planning to put their own third-generation licenses up for bid. The
larger size of Germany's population suggests the auction there
could exceed the size of Britain's.

<HEADLINE> Patrick Kennedy Ordered to Hearing  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF WILSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Rep. Patrick Kennedy was ordered Thursday to
appear at an informal hearing to try to work things out with an
airport security guard who claims he shoved and grabbed her in a
dispute over his bag.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than file a misdemeanor battery charge, which would carry
up to six months in jail and a $2,000 fine, the city prosecutor's
office ordered the May 12 meeting between the two in front of a
hearing officer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a closed, informal, quasi-judicial hearing so both
parties can discuss this. We refer cases to the hearing because we
feel they can be resolved,'' said Mike Qualls, spokesman for the
city attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Such hearings are held in 25,000 to 30,000 cases a year. The
hearing officer will prepare a report for the city attorney, who
will decide whether to file charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''The final decision on the case is made after the hearing, but
nine out of 10 are resolved and there are no charges,'' Qualls
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the congressman said: ''From the night of the
incident on, I have stated my regret that I acted rudely. I also
have said that I regret how this has been blown way out of
proportion. I am now hopeful that, with this office procedure, the
matter will be closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Della Patton, 58, claims the Rhode Island Democrat shoved and
grabbed her on March 26 after she told him his bag was too big to
fit through an X-ray scanner at Los Angeles airport. She filed a
battery complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Police have said only that the surveillance video of the
incident showed ''physical contact.''
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old son of Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy asked
police earlier this month to make the videotape public, insisting
it would clear him. Police refused, saying it was evidence in a
criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Patton's attorney, Paul Trump, had no comment Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Director of Yugoslav Airline Buried  </HEADLINE>
By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   POZAREVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Zika Petrovic, an ally of President
Slobodan Milosevic who was gunned down two days ago, was buried
Thursday in his native Pozarevac.
</P>
<P>
   A few hundred people, including several top Yugoslav officials,
attended the funeral in this central Serbian town, which is the
hometown of Milosevic and his influential wife Mirjana Markovic.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Zoran Uskokovic, a well-known Belgrade underworld
figure, and his friend were killed in a gangland-style shooting,
independent Studio B television reported.
</P>
<P>
   Uskokovic, alias Skole, was driving with a friend in his black
sedan in a Belgrade suburb when assailants sprayed machine-gun fire
on the two from another car.
</P>
<P>
   He had been targeted already earlier this week when a bomb went
off in front of the high-rise apartment building in which he lived.
No one was harmed in that blast.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade tabloids had implicated Uskokovic in the January
slaying of Zeljko Raznatovic, known as Arkan, Serbia's most
notorious warlord and underworld don -- something Uskokovic later
denied in the papers.
</P>
<P>
   In Pozarevac, some 48 miles east of Belgrade, Milosevic and
Markovic were not present at the burial service. Serbia's ruling
couple sent a wreath instead.
</P>
<P>
   Petrovic was an associate of Milosevic and head of Yugoslavia's
national carrier, JAT. He was killed in front of his home in
downtown Belgrade on Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the killing, no arrests had been made.
</P>
<P>
   Petrovic was not believed involved in any of the financial
scandals in Serbia in the past decade nor did he have any political
function or ties to the underworld.
</P>
<P>
   Previous high-profile deaths in Serbia -- most of which remain
unsolved -- involved either mafia bosses, such as Arkan, or police
or state officials.
</P>
<P>
   A top Serbian official, Nikola Sainovic, said Thursday that
Petrovic's killing represented a ''revolting crime,'' Beta news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''Crimes are committed by criminals. Criminals should be
prosecuted and they will be found and punished,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities declared Petrovic's killing a ''terrorist act'' and
blamed it on foreign intelligence services. But the opposition saw
the slaying as a sign of growing lawlessness and demanded the
resignation of Serbia's police chief, Vlajko Stojiljkovic.
</P>
<P>
   Stojiljkovic, one of four Yugoslav officials indicted by the
U.N. war crimes tribunal along with Milosevic, was seen at
Petrovic's funeral along with the head of state security, Rade
Markovic.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia's deputy prime minister and ultranationalist leader
Vojislav Seselj also claimed the slaying of JAT's manager was the
'dirty work'' of American and other Western intelligence services
who continue ''intensive espionage and subversive activities'' in
Yugoslavia
</P>
<P>
   As Petrovic was buried, three Cessna 172 planes performed an
honorary flyover.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was not just a shot at Zika, it was also a shot at JAT
and the state,'' Ljuba Acimovic, head of Belgrade airport said in a
funeral speech.

<HEADLINE> Seal Bites German Mayor's Hand  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- One of the Frankfurt zoo's 10 dwarf
seals bit the hand of the city's mayor and nearly sent her tumbling
Thursday, just after she had dedicated a new enclosure for the
''seadogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Petra Roth had been standing on a slippery rock in
high-heel shoes. She was trying to feed the seals when one of them,
Daisy, nipped the 56-year-old mayor's right index finger and nearly
knocked her into the pool. A zoo escort grabbed Roth just in time.
</P>
<P>
   Roth immediately received medical treatment, which included a
bandaged finger, tetanus shot and prescription for antibiotics, her
office said.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo director Christian Schmidt defended the ''seadogs,'' saying
they had always been well mannered in the past. Daisy's bite was
not out of aggression, he said, but more a playful reflex.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's not a mean animal, and the mayor understands that,''
Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   Frankfurt zoo claims to have the largest group of dwarf seals in
captivity, and had to expand its facilities at a cost of $2.7
million.

<HEADLINE> European Central Bank Raises Rates  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- The European Central Bank raised interest rates
Thursday for the third time in three months, citing a continued
risk of inflation, but that did nothing to keep the battered euro
currency from tumbling to a new low and flirting with 90 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The quarter-point increase in short-term rates by the Frankfurt,
Germany-based central bank followed similar increases on Feb. 3 and
March 16.
</P>
<P>
   The ECB said in a statement that it acted to counter continued
''upside risks to price stability in the medium term,'' including
the weak euro.
</P>
<P>
   As the euro falls, it drives up the cost of goods imported into
the 11 European nations that adopted the single currency, adding to
inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
   But there was little comfort to investors from a central bank
statement that ''the present level of the euro does not reflect the
strong economic fundamentals of the euro area.''
</P>
<P>
   The euro fell as low as 90.59 cents Thursday after the ECB
raised rates and ended the trading day in New York at 91.01 cents,
down from 92.33 cents Wednesday. The previous low of 91.62 cents
was reached during trading Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's closing rate, the euro was down 23 percent from
the all-time high of $1.1886 reached on the first day it traded --
Jan. 4, 1999 -- and down almost 10 percent from where it ended last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The ECB's main goal is keeping prices stable, and it has set a
guideline of keeping inflation under 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, the EU statistical office said average inflation
in the euro-zone countries rose to 2.1 percent in March -- the
highest since the euro currency was launched.
</P>
<P>
   Monetary officials had been indicating they planned to raise
rates, but the timing of Thursday's move was questioned.
</P>
<P>
   The German Labor Federation said a retreat in world oil prices
should bring inflation back down on its own -- adding it couldn't
understand why the ECB acted now for any reason other than to try
and prop up the euro.
</P>
<P>
   ''The new interest move has absolutely no basis in looming
dangers to price stability,'' the group said.
</P>
<P>
   Raising interest rates can cool an economy by making it more
expensive to borrow money, dampening spending. A slowing economy
would aggravate already high unemployment in parts of the euro
region.
</P>
<P>
   Since the impact of central bank interest rate decisions is not
immediate -- policy-makers must look to longer-term indicators and
not just the ups and downs of the currency markets.
</P>
<P>
   Market watchers said the bank had to be careful to avoid the
impression it was panicking after the euro set new lows this week.
At the same time, other analysts said that doing nothing would
create the impression that the ECB doesn't care.
</P>
<P>
   The ECB raised its key short-term rate up to 3.75 percent from
3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''The step is OK, but they should communicate the right thing --
that they can't target or steal the exchange rate,'' said Michael
Schubert, an economist with Commerzbank.
</P>
<P>
   Most European politicians contend the main reason for the euro's
woes continues to be the strong U.S. economy, and the sluggishness
of Europe to reform.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Commerce Department reported Thursday that America's
total output of goods and services, called the gross domestic
product, rose at an annual rate of 5.4 percent in the first
quarter. Consumer spending, which has been driving the economic
expansion, had its strongest increase in almost 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   France's finance minister said Thursday a rate hike wouldn't do
anything to help the euro.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my view, it isn't with a strong increase in interest rates
that we will solve this problem,'' Laurent Fabius said in an
interview with French radio station RTL.
</P>
<P>
   Showing market participants that the ''European economic
situation is improving strongly'' is the solution to the euro's
current weakness, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Newly appointed Italian Prime Minister Giuliano Amato in his
first speech to parliament Thursday called on lawmakers to press
ahead with structural reforms to help boost the euro.
</P>
<P>
   ''The euro is undervalued and destined to grow,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Poll names Dole, Feinstein as top prospects for vice president  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former presidential candidate Elizabeth Dole
beat New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman among Republicans, and Sen.
Dianne Feinstein of California narrowly edged Maryland Lt. Gov.
Kathleen Kennedy Townsend among Democrats, in a poll measuring
public interest in a female vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was conducted by the White House Project, a nonprofit
group urging the election of women to top national posts.
</P>
<P>
   Dole received 58 percent of Republican support to 18 percent for
Whitman. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas finished third with 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein received 24 percent of Democratic support to 23
percent for Townsend. Rep. Maxine Waters of California finished
third with 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Though released in the midst of the 2000 election campaign, the
findings are not intended as a call for either party to choose a
female vice presidential nominee this year, said White House
Project President Marie C. Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our goal is a long-term goal,'' she said. ''We're looking way
beyond this election. We're looking to 10 years from now having
one, two, three, four women'' running for president.
</P>
<P>
   She added: ''If there's one woman, the conversation is only
about gender. If there are two women, then there is probably talk
about a 'catfight' for a campaign. If we have three or four women
running, you can hear their agendas.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington polling firm Lake Snell Perry &AMP; Associates
contacted 323 registered Democrats and 238 registered Republicans
from March 16 to 19. The margin of error is 5.5 percent for the
Democrat results, 6.4 percent for the Republican results.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to commissioning the poll, the White House Project
asked Americans to weigh in on 15 possible vice presidential
nominees on ballots published in Parade magazine and posted at the
group's Web site. Some 17,000 votes were cast over 26 days in that
unscientific contest.
</P>
<P>
   The four women who emerged with the most votes were Dole,
Whitman, Feinstein and Lt. Gen. Claudia Kennedy, the Army's
highest-ranking female officer. Those four will share the cover of
Parade magazine this Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Because her party affiliation is unknown, Kennedy was not
offered as a choice in the telephone poll of registered Democrats
and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy made news recently by accusing a fellow general of
sexual harassment, a charge the Army is investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Other names on the ballot in the unscientific contest were Rep.
Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash.; Gov. Jane Dee Hull, R-Ariz.; Sen. Mary
Landrieu, D-La.; Rep. Patsy Mink, D-Hawaii; Los Angeles County
Supervisor Gloria Molina; Condoleezza Rice, a foreign policy
adviser to Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush; Gov.
Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H.; Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of policy, the White House Project will not say how
many votes each candidate received in the mail-in competition. Nor
will it specify the order in which Dole, Whitman, Feinstein and
Kennedy finished.

<HEADLINE> Eastman Music School Gets $1M Gift  </HEADLINE>
By BEN DOBBIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- A frugal piano teacher with a flair for
investing in the stock market is giving away her third $1 million
gift -- this time to the Eastman School of Music where she studied
as a child in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Grace Murray Trebert, 88, equates her self-taught success in
accumulating money with her musical talents. ''I use my eyes, I use
my memory and I'm not slow -- when I want to do anything, I don't
fuss around,'' she said with a hearty chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   But holding onto the riches she has built up since the 1960s has
never interested her.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just don't like money,'' she said Thursday. ''I guess being
in music from a tender young age, that was my love. Everything was
the music. The value of music is important, not money. My mother
used to say, 'Oh, that's only filthy lucre.'''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how she managed to earn millions while teaching piano,
Trebert deadpanned, ''Well, I charged about $8,924 a half-hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Invoking her modest upbringing -- her father died when she was 10
-- Trebert recalled many times not being able to afford a dime to
ride a street car or buy an ice cream cone.
</P>
<P>
   Among the valuable lessons of childhood were persistence and
patience. ''You have to be awful patient with the stock market,''
she said, adding that ''thriftiness and investing ability'' also
play a big part.
</P>
<P>
   Trebert always liked to dabble in stocks but only got going in
earnest after her husband, William, a lawyer, died in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't want to be like my mother, cry all over the house and
moan and groan,'' she said. ''So I said, I'm going to sit down and
concentrate and get my mind on some of these companies. I want to
know all about them, their earnings and stuff. So I did, and I
stuck with it.''
</P>
<P>
   She relies on her own instincts and research -- often poring over
annual reports -- and only rarely on her broker's advice. In the
past, she often favored ''well-managed companies'' like Merck, IBM
and Texas Instruments or industries with long-term promise. But
nowadays, because of her age, she's not averse to rolling the dice
on a surging Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got to have a tough stomach,'' she cautioned.
''Everything is a risk even if it's well-managed. Of course when I
lost my husband, my attitude was, 'Well, I've lost everything, I
can face it.' If you don't love money, you've got it made.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining an investment club like the Beardstown Ladies wouldn't
cut it for Trebert. ''Too much discussion, wasted time and then
they can't make a decision at the tail end,'' she said
dismissively.
</P>
<P>
   While declining to quantify her worth, Trebert said she has not
yet given all her money away. ''I'm going to continue to do it just
for fun,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Trebert has given $1 million to Rochester's
Hochstein School of Music, where she taught piano for years, and
another $1 million to the Al Sigl Center, a partnership of agencies
that help people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by her music-loving mother, Clara, Trebert earned a
master's degree in musicology at Eastman in 1941, then taught at
Western Maryland College and worked as an organist.

<HEADLINE> Amber Room Piece Back in Russia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- One of two pieces known to still exist from Peter
the Great's famed Amber Room was returned by Germany on Thursday,
more than half a century after being stolen by retreating Nazi
troops, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   The piece -- an elaborate mosaic of amber -- came to Moscow aboard
a special plane also carrying German Culture Minister Michael
Naumann, the agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Naumann is to turn over the mosaic and a chest of drawers from
the room in a ceremony Saturday at the Yekaterinsky Palace outside
St. Petersburg, the royal residence that once included the room.
The chest of drawers was to arrive in Russia separately, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   The 18th-century Amber Room got its name from the magnificent
panels of golden-brown amber that lined its walls. The furnishings
were presented by Prussian King Frederick William to Czar Peter the
Great.
</P>
<P>
   Nazi soldiers looted the palace in World War II and stripped the
Amber Room bare as they retreated from their failed campaign
against Stalinist Russia. The room's contents were moved to a
castle in Koenigsberg, now the Russian city of Kaliningrad, and
disappeared from there in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   The German woman who bought the chest recognized it in a
television report and turned it over to authorities in 1997. It is
not known how much she paid for it.
</P>
<P>
   The mosaic was found in the possession of a man from Bremen,
Germany, in 1997, and the city purchased it from him to avoid a
lengthy legal battle.
</P>
<P>
   The return of the Amber Room pieces is part of an agreement
under which Russian authorities will give Bremen back 101 graphics
and watercolors, including art by Albrecht Duerer, Manet, Goya and
Toulouse-Lautrec. The works disappeared from a Bremen museum in
1945.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon: Chinese Approach U.S. Jets  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two Chinese F-8 fighters approached within a
couple of miles of an American spy plane flying in international
airspace over the South China Sea on Thursday, Pentagon officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Craig Quigley, a Pentagon spokesman, described the
incident as ''relatively common'' and not a cause for concern.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many nations around the world send up aircraft to just have a
look-see as to who is getting close to their airspace,'' Quigley
said. He said the United States did this routinely during the Cold
War when Soviet bombers approached Alaskan airspace.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley said the encounter had no effect on the flight path of
the U.S. Air Force RC-135 reconnaissance plane, which he said was
operating in international airspace southwest of Taiwan and
''dozens of miles'' beyond China's 12-mile territorial limit.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley described the spy plane's mission as reconnaissance but
would not be more specific. ''At no time did the aircraft -- the
U.S. aircraft -- feel the least bit threatened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley said there was no diplomatic protest by either the
Chinese or American governments. ''This was a relatively common
event not only in that part of the world but in other parts of the
world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman would not describe the kind of intelligence being
gathered by the RC-135, known as the Rivet Joint. The plane is
routinely used to collect electronic and communications
intelligence, such as monitoring another country's battle
management communications. It also can provide indications about
the location and intentions of enemy forces and provide imminent
threat warnings to friendly aircraft in danger.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Federation of American Scientists, the Rivet
Joint aircraft are capable of conducting electronic and
communications intercepts against targets at ranges of up to 240
kilometers, or about 150 miles. The higher-flying U-2 spy plane can
conduct such operations at a range of up to 280 kilometers (175
miles).
</P>
<P>
   The Rivet Joint is flown for intelligence-gathering missions not
only in East Asia but also the Persian Gulf. They also played a
reconnaissance role during last year's air war over Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Dole, Feinstein for V.P.  </HEADLINE>

<HEADLINE> Senator Pushes More IMF Reforms  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A senator warned the Clinton administration
Thursday that if it wants to win congressional approval for greater
debt relief for poor nations, it will have to offer more sweeping
reform proposals for the International Monetary Fund and World
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm said he supported
the administration's proposal to forgive all debt owed to the
United States by the 40 poorest nations and provide the U.S. share
to provide relief on loans owed by those countries to the IMF and
the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But Gramm, R-Texas, told Treasury Under Secretary Timothy
Geithner, ''I can't see doing either without some fairly
substantial reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, whose committee has jurisdiction over the issue, said he
would like to take up legislation in mid-May to approve revaluation
of a portion of IMF gold reserves in support of debt relief plus
approve the U.S. share of the debt forgiveness program.
</P>
<P>
   However, he and other Republican members of the Banking
Committee pushed the administration to adapt reform proposals more
along the lines being recommended by a congressional advisory panel
headed by Allan Meltzer, an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon
University.
</P>
<P>
   ''The time for reforming the IMF is upon us and we have to act
now,'' said Michael Crapo, R-Ind., who called it unacceptable to
have 70 countries holding IMF loans for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reforms being pushed by the Meltzer commission would
restrict the IMF to providing short-term loans in crisis
situations, leaving long-term lending to the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But Geithner said it made sense for the IMF to continue making
long-term loans to poor countries because they often need the
expertise provided by IMF economists to adapt proper reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Geithner also attacked another major Meltzer commission reform
which would limit IMF loans in most situations to countries who
have pre-qualified for the loans by adopting various reforms such
as strengthening the banking system.
</P>
<P>
   He called adoption of such reforms a good idea but no guarantee
that foreign investors will not suddenly panic and begin pulling
their money out of a particular country, the process that triggered
the cascading Asian crisis in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   Geithner said the pre-qualification requirement would have
prevented IMF assistance from going to many of the crisis
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''We find the core recommendations of the majority report
troubling and fundamentally incompatible with our compelling
national economic and strategic interests,'' Geithner told a Senate
Banking subcommittee hearing, promising to have a complete
administration response to the Meltzer proposals ready soon.
</P>
<P>
   Geithner later told reporters that the administration could
accept less restrictive requirements for reform of the IMF included
in legislation passed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He
expressed the hope a compromise could be reached with Gramm on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Geithner insisted during the hearing that the IMF and World
Bank, under prodding from the administration, have gone a long way
toward implementing reforms based on lessons learned from the
global currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Both institutions held their spring meetings in Washington last
week under heavy police security. Police made 1,300 arrests during
the week and the 750 delegates and staff attending the meetings
were forced to take shuttle buses starting at 5 a.m. to avoid
protesters who clogged streets around the IMF and World Bank
headquarters, two blocks from the White House.

<HEADLINE> Demand for Workers Still Strong  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The volume of help-wanted advertising in major
U.S. newspapers dipped in March, but the demand for workers remains
strong nationwide, the Conference Board said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The business-financed research organization said its Help-Wanted
Advertising Index fell to 87 in March from a revised 90 in
February. That compared with a reading of 89 a year earlier and was
the lowest since the 86 reported in December.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, labor demand remains strong because the economy
continues to grow by more than 4 percent per quarter,'' board
economist Ken Goldstein said in a statement accompanying the
report. He predicted that this ''will send the unemployment rate
below 4 percent this spring.''
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department reported earlier this month that the
nation's unemployment rate in March was close to a three-decade low
at 4.1 percent. The Commerce Department reported Thursday that the
economy grew at a 5.4 percent annual rate in the first quarter of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein added that ''employers are not cutting back on job
recruitment efforts in print, and efforts to assess the change in
activity on the Internet suggest that job recruitment is even
stronger there.''
</P>
<P>
   The index measures help-wanted advertising volume in 51 major
newspapers every month. The index is used as a gauge of changes in
job supply and is watched by economists as an indicator of labor
market conditions to help form estimates of unemployment rates.
</P>
<P>
   The report Thursday said that in the first three months of the
year, help-wanted advertising rose in five regions and declined in
four.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest increases were in the Middle Atlantic region, which
includes New York, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, where help-wanted
advertising rose 6.3 percent, and the West South Central region,
which covers Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana, where it went up 5.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest declines were in New England, where help-wanted ads
dropped 8.4 percent, and the East South Central region, including
Birmingham, Ala., and Nashville, Tenn., where it was down 5.1
percent.

<HEADLINE> Cities Join Gun Safety Coalition  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHEPARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite a federal lawsuit challenging a major
provision of a sweeping national gun safety plan, federal officials
said Thursday the number of cities joining the effort has grown to
190 communities and continues to swell.
</P>
<P>
   ''To get 190 communities is an overwhelmingly supportive
response,'' said Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew
Cuomo, an architect of the gun safety plan introduced by President
Clinton in March.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Smith &AMP; Wesson, the nation's largest gun maker,
agreed to install gun locks on all the firearms it sells, the
introduction within three years ''smart gun'' technology and the
prohibition on sales of its weapons at gun shows without a
background check.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Smith &AMP; Wesson will be the preferred choice for law
enforcement officials in the 190 communities that have joined the
Communities for Safer Guns Coalition. On March 31, the coalition
included just 65 communities. The 125 new coalition members
announced Thursday include Peoria, Ill.; Cedar Rapids, Iowa;
Trenton, N.J., and Reno, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   Communities on the list range in size from behemoths like Los
Angeles and the Brooklyn borough of New York to smaller Burnsville,
Minn., and North Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan to give Smith &AMP; Wesson a leg up on its competitors
is now facing a legal challenge since seven gun makers and an
industry group filed a federal suit Wednesday in Atlanta alleging
an illegal conspiracy in restraint of trade.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo told a news conference Thursday that the lawsuit misses
the mark.

<P>
   ''After the Smith &AMP; Wesson agreement, there are two types of gun
manufacturers: safe and unsafe. Working with law enforcement, we
prefer to do business with the safe manufacturers,'' Cuomo said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the gun safety plan, purchasing agents for law enforcement
officials in those communities will buy Smith &AMP; Wesson guns,
provided that model and cost factors dovetail with the city's
needs.
</P>
<P>
   It is that preferential buying provision that rankled the gun
manufacturers and pushed them to file suit.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a handful of local government officials trying to
decide gun distribution and design patterns across the United
States,'' said Jeff Reh, general counsel for Beretta U.S.A., one of
the seven gun makers suing HUD and 16 cities in the coalition.
''The mayors are trying to expand their authority beyond where they
were elected.''
</P>
<P>
   At the HUD press conference, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.,
called the lawsuit ''laughable'' and added, ''It seems the gun
industry is spoiling for a fight. To that we say, 'Make our day.'''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from HUD, also named in the lawsuit were the California
communities of San Francisco, Berkeley, East Palo Alto, Inglewood,
Oakland, and San Mateo; as well as Bridgeport, Conn.; Atlanta;
Miami-Dade County, Fla.; Gary, Ind.; Boston; Detroit; St. Louis;
Newark, N.J.; Philadelphia; and the District of Columbia.

<HEADLINE> Scandal in Japan's Military  </HEADLINE>
By SHIGEYOSHI KIMURA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's military dismissed a colonel and punished
23 other officers Thursday for covering up alleged illegal shooting
on a military firing range.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Agency fired Col. Yasunobu Hideshima, 53, who was
charged last month with letting three civilian friends fire guns
during a drill in 1994, said Lt. Col. Yakayuki Hamada, a military
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Yoshiharu Amano, 56, and Lt. Gen. Michihiko Suzuki, 53,
were suspended from duty for 20 days each, Hamada said. The two
were the highest-ranking Japanese military officers ever to be
suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Amano, Suzuki and another of the punished officers, Maj. Gen.
Junichi Ikeda, offered to resign, but the Defense Agency had not
decided whether to accept the resignations, Hamada said.
</P>
<P>
   The punishments follow a series of scandals shaking the
country's police departments. On Thursday, prosecutors demanded
prison sentences for five former police officials who pleaded
guilty to covering up a colleague's drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Defense Agency report, Hideshima, who was a
leader of the 1st Airborne Brigade at the time, invited three
acquaintances to one of the force's ranges south of Tokyo in
November 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Hideshima is accused of fired a hunting gun which belonged to
one of the civilians without required police approval and of
letting the three civilians illegally test-fire a military rifle
and machine gun at the range.

<HEADLINE> Bush Seeks Teamsters Support  </HEADLINE>
By ESTES THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- George W. Bush says he asked the
Teamsters union to endorse his Republican presidential bid, and
while he didn't get a promise he saw the ''beginnings of a good
sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in North Carolina Thursday for a fund-raising luncheon and
speech to a teachers' conference, said he and Teamsters President
James Hoffa ''had a very frank discussion of a variety of issues''
on Wednesday while the Texas governor was in Washington for a GOP
fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did ask for his union's endorsement and he said he hadn't
made up his mind,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   A Teamsters spokesman said the meeting was one of a series that
Hoffa has held with major party candidates, including earlier this
month with Vice President Al Gore, the presumed Democratic
presidential nominee, and with Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is part of the continuing conversation with all of the
major presidential campaigns,'' said spokesman Bret Caldwell.
</P>
<P>
   He said Hoffa has made a commitment ''from the beginning to make
an endorsement based on the best interests of the members of the
union, and that requires having a serious conversation with each
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   While labor unions are traditionally thought of as Democratic
supporters, the Teamsters have swung between the Democrats and
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, the Teamsters backed then-President Nixon, a
Republican, but they stayed neutral in 1976. They supported Ronald
Reagan, another Republican, in 1980 and 1984, and endorsed Bush's
father, also the GOP nominee, in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, however, the Teamsters abandoned Bush and joined the
AFL-CIO -- of which it is the largest member -- in endorsing Democrat
Bill Clinton. In 1996, the union did not endorse President Clinton,
but also rejected the GOP candidate, Bob Dole, because of his ties
to corporate interests.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Hoffa has withheld a Teamsters endorsement in the
current race is that he opposes a Clinton-Gore administration plan
to give permanent normal trade status to China.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the union joined the United Auto Workers in
abstaining as the AFL-CIO decided to endorse Gore. At the time,
Hoffa said the union needed more time before making a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Following his meeting with Hoffa, Gore said they disagreed on
China's trade status, but he wouldn't talk about details of their
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the two talked Wednesday about the North American Free
Trade Agreement and truck safety issues.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman, said the governor requested the
session. ''America's working people share an awful lot with
Governor Bush and we're going to work awful hard for their
support,'' Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush came to North Carolina for a $1,000-a-plate luncheon
attended by 250 supporters and to speak briefly at a teachers'
conference attended by 1,600 people.
</P>
<P>
   For both audiences, the Texas governor promoted bipartisanship
in reaching excellence in education.
</P>
<P>
   Bush praised improvements in student achievement in both Texas
and North Carolina. The conference theme was closing the
achievement gap for minority and poor students, and Bush said
student achievement must be measured to avoid the ''soft bigotry''
of old education strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ''The old way of thinking used to ask the question, 'How old are
you? If you're 12, you're supposed to be here.' Guess who got left
behind? The inner city kids,'' Bush said. ''What we ought to ask is
what do you know?''
</P>
<P>
   Access to education was the battle of past decades, while today
access is universal ''but excellence is not,'' Bush said.

<HEADLINE> Victims' Rights Bill Withdrawn  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Backers of a victims' rights amendment to the
Constitution said they were pulling the measure from the Senate
floor Thursday after onslaught of criticism that it needlessly
tinkers with the nation's charter.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of support likely kills any prospect of passage this
election year, when lawmakers must get through appropriations bills
and return home for campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Critics complained it was the third attempt to amend the
Constitution in just 30 days and one by one several lawmakers
railed against the proposal over three days of debate.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., one of the amendment's sponsors, told
lawmakers he wanted permission ''to withdraw the motion . . . and
move to other business.''
</P>
<P>
   Going forward would only encourage more ''unproductive speeches
that really don't go to the heart of the constitutional
amendment,'' Kyl said.
</P>
<P>
   The measure lacked the 60 votes to even limit debate, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will fight again another day,'' cosponsor Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif., added.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has been debating the amendment since Tuesday. It
would give victims rights such as reasonable notice of court
proceedings and an offender's release or escape, the right to
attend and be heard at legal proceedings and court-ordered
restitution.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two states have enacted some form of victims' rights. The
House has not taken up the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Had it passed with two-thirds majorities in the Senate and the
House, the amendment would have had to be ratified by three-fourths
of state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl criticized the Clinton administration Wednesday, which had
not endorsed their amendment because of lingering concerns. After
news of the withdrawal, the White House released a statement from
Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to reiterate our strong commitment to continue to work
towards passage of a constitutional amendment that will ensure that
victims' rights are fully considered in the criminal justice
process,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents had complained the Constitution was the wrong place
for the victims' rights. They noted that the proposal was the
latest in a string of proposed constitutional amendments. Last
month, lawmakers rejected attempts to amend the Constitution to ban
desecration of the flag and give Congress powers to limit campaign
spending.
</P>
<P>
   ''The goal of expanding victims' rights is one that we fully
share, but the method should be by changes in our laws, not in our
Constitution,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. and the ranking
Democrat on the Judiciary Committee.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Honors Civil Rights Heroine  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Daisy Bates is best remembered by the
public as the mentor for nine black students who walked into Little
Rock's all-white Central High School and took a bold stride toward
desegregating American schools. To President Clinton, the civil
rights activist was much more.
</P>
<P>
   She was a brave woman who was harassed and ostracized, yet
inspired confidence and action, Clinton said Thursday at a memorial
service for her. Bates, who died last year, was the only woman who
spoke on the National Mall in August 1963 when the Rev. Martin
Luther King gave his ''I have a dream'' speech, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like Daisy Bates, not only because of what she did at Little
Rock, but because of the way she lived right to the end,'' he said.
''And when she lost things that are painful for any person to lose,
somehow what was left became more pure, more strong -- almost like a
diamond that was chipped away in form and shines more brightly.''
</P>
<P>
   Daisy Gatson Bates died Nov. 4, 1999, at the age of 84.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of her funeral, Clinton praised the courage of the
nine black students as they accepted the Congressional Gold Medal
in Washington. Some of the students, dubbed the Little Rock Nine,
were given a standing ovation at the service.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Little Rock Nine, Carlotta Walls-Lanier, said when
she was 10 years old, Bates gave her a job delivering newspapers.
She said she admired Bates because her persistence uncovered ''the
nation's hypocrisy and dirty laundry'' about separate but equal
education.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mrs. Bates walked the talk of freedom for all,'' she said.
''She was one of the brighter lights of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   Whites rioted outside Central High in 1957 when National
Guardsmen, on orders from Gov. Orval Faubus, turned the students
away. President Eisenhower sent in Army troops to escort the
students to class. It was a sign that Washington was going to
enforce the 1954 Supreme Court ruling in Brown vs. Board of
Education that school segregation was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Before and after their tense days at school, the students took
solace at Bates' home. She counseled them on how to stand up to
intimidation and physical threats. Clinton announced at the service
that a process has begun to designate Bates' home a National
Historic Landmark.
</P>
<P>
   About a decade ago, Bates said: ''I'm 75{, but I'm not too tired
to stand and do what I can for the cause I believe in. I would like
to see, before I die, that blacks and whites and Christians can all
get together.''
</P>
<P>
   Her wish is not yet a reality.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred people gathered in Robinson Auditorium to honor
Bates, who received more than 200 awards for her work toward
achieving equality. Gospel music filled the hall. Pianist Ricky
Banks gave an emotional rendition of the civil rights anthem,
singing ''We shall overcome. We shall overcome, yeah. ... Oooh,
deep in my mind, I do, I do believe -- yes I do. ...''
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you believe that?'' he asked the people in the crowd, who
responded with applause and then stood, joined hands, slowly swayed
and sang along with him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he thought Bates was ''getting a good kick out of
us making such a fuss about her today.'' But Bates' second cousin,
David Neely, an attorney in Elmhurst, Ill., who was one of several
of her relatives who attended the service, remembers her more
serious side.
</P>
<P>
   ''She didn't joke a lot. She was a very serious person,'' he
said. ''Even after she had her first stroke and her second stroke,
her mind continued to work, but she couldn't express herself
because her speech was impaired.''
</P>
<P>
   After the service, Clinton spoke at the dedication of the
William H. Bowen Law School for the University of Arkansas. Bowen,
a Little Rock attorney and businessman, was chief of staff to
Clinton when the president was governor of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen recalled that Clinton had a picture of his maternal
grandparents in the governor's office and two of his grandfather's
sayings hung on the wall. One of them was about public service. The
other said: ''It never hurt a good man to take a few unfair
lickings.''

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Up 144; Dow Down 57  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks regained leadership of the
stock market today, rising sharply and helping pull blue-chip names
shake off a pair of economic reports that suggested more
interest-rate increases are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index rose 144.02 to 3,774.11.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 57.40 to close at
10,888.10. Earlier in the session, the Dow fell as much as 197
points.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 3.93 to 1,464.92.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 11-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,618 down, 1,317 up and 502
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 1.1 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 979.71
million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 10.34 to
494.58.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications stocks led the Nasdaq's advance after posting
strong corporate earnings reports. MCI WorldCom rose after
announcing it beat Wall Street's first-quarter earnings
expectations by 1 cent a share. The telecom company saw net income
soar to $1.3 billion from $730 million a year ago on surging data
and Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless communications company Nextel narrowed its
first-quarter loss and rose.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, AT&AMP;T's wireless business made a successful, if
modest, debut in trading on the New York Stock Exchange, rising
from an offering price of 29 1/2 to 31 5/16. The tracking stock is
the largest initial public offering in history, with 360 million
shares valued at a total of $10.26 billion.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T itself fell.
</P>
<P>
   A wide range of large-capitalization technology stocks rose,
with Qualcomm and Applied Materials up sharply.
</P>
<P>
   The strength in telecom and technology helped the broad market
recover from initial weakness in the wake of government reports on
the gross domestic product and the Employment Cost Index. Many on
Wall Street had been fearful that one or both would show that the
economy was growing much too fast for the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   The reports confirmed that the economy is on a tear. The gross
domestic product grew at a 5.4 percent annual rate during the first
three months of 2000, the Commerce Department said today. But many
economists had anticipated a 6 percent growth rate.
</P>
<P>
   The more troubling statistic to inflation-wary traders: the
Employment Cost Index. In the first quarter, the index rose 1.4
percent, the biggest quarterly advance in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Economists fear that rising wage pressures will stimulate
inflation, prompting more and steeper interest rate increases by
the Fed. Higher interest rates are generally bad for stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ''The economy is not showing the signs of slowing that the Fed
is looking for, and investors are correct to be concerned about
that,'' said Eric Wiegand, director of the private client group at
Warburg Pincus.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which are most sensitive to inflation, led the
Dow lower. American Express and J.P. Morgan fell.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's ability to shrug off the inflation reports provided
the most conclusive sign to date that the technology sector has
stabilized, said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime
Charter Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Nasdaq has been trying to hammer out a bottom,'' he said.
''The fact that it was able to rally despite some bad news on the
economic front tells me that it's finally found one.''
</P>
<P>
   Massive selloffs earlier this month knocked the Nasdaq as much
as 34 percent below its March 10 record of 5,048.62. The last
crushing selloff came on Monday, when the Nasdaq shed 161 points.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's purge may have been the last for a while, Bleier
argued.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is that a lot of Nasdaq stocks have been
crushed,'' he said. ''It will be a more selective environment going
forward, but many stocks will do very well.''

<HEADLINE> No Polls Allowed on Military Sites  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID PACE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Election officials across the country are
scrambling to find new polling places after local military
commanders informed them they won't be allowed to use defense
facilities as voting sites like in years past.
</P>
<P>
   The commanders took the action after receiving a routine
directive from Defense Secretary William Cohen that cites
decades-old federal criminal laws requiring strict separation of
the military and the election process.
</P>
<P>
   The laws were designed to prevent military interference with
voting. Cohen's order states that ''commanders are advised not to
allow their installation facilities to be used for polling or
voting sites.''
</P>
<P>
   The directive is sent each election year, but this time numerous
local commanders whose facilities have been used for years as
polling place mentioned it when ordering armories and other
facilities off limits for elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do this every election year,'' said Glenn Flood, a Pentagon
spokesman. ''It's just that now, the commanders are reading the
fine print. They're seeing that this is something they should
probably pay more attention to.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kentucky, Franklin County officials had to find a new polling
place for the May 23 state primary after an Army Reserve commander,
following the directive, shut down a reserve center that had been
used for voting for more than 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were shocked by it,'' said Sarah Ball Johnson, assistant
director of the Kentucky elections board. ''Any time you change a
polling site it causes problems and it's traumatic for the
voters.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no official estimate on how many polling places may be
affected, since they are controlled by local election officials and
military commanders.
</P>
<P>
   But a preliminary survey by the Election Center, a nonpartisan
association of state and local election officials, turned up dozens
of instances where commanders have notified local officials they
can no longer use National Guard armories, reserve facilities and
other military installations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have just started to hear from jurisdictions who didn't
know they had a problem until they started to make arrangements for
a primary election,'' said Doug Lewis, the center's executive
director.
</P>
<P>
   The situation has caused such an uproar that Pentagon officials
have begun to backpedal.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a request from Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman
of the Senate Armed Services Committee, a Pentagon lawyer last week
issued a memorandum stating that the directive does not cover
National Guard installations under state control, unless the guard
units are called to active duty.
</P>
<P>
   But the clarifying memo hasn't been widely circulated. Lewis,
who complained to Cohen about the policy last month, had not seen
it by Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Neither had official Pentagon spokesmen who continued to insist
this week that the directive covers armories.
</P>
<P>
   ''Apparently there's an ongoing dispute as to whether or not
armories are covered,'' said Brad King, Minnesota elections
director. ''The uncertainty is making it difficult for local
officials because of the need for planning time.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said if the Pentagon exempts armories and reserve
facilities from the directive, it would allow most polling places
on defense property to stay where they are. He said his survey has
found only three states, Hawaii, Alaska and Utah, where voting is
conducted on military bases, rather than on guard or reserve
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Flood, the Pentagon spokesman, said defense officials have no
idea why local commanders who have allowed voting at military sites
in the past are suddenly citing the routine directive to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   Election officials worry the directive will have the unintended
consequence of discouraging voting, both by military personnel and
by civilians confused by the closing of their regular polling
places.

   ''In an era of great concern about participation in the
democratic process, do we really want to make it more difficult for
voters to exercise their right to participate?'' asked Lewis, who
called the order ''well-intended but severely misguided.''

<HEADLINE> Telecom Co. GTE Meets Expectations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Strong sales of data, wireless and
long-distance services in the first-quarter helped
telecommunications company GTE Corp. meet analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   For the three months ended March 31, GTE said that net income
fell to to $807 million, or 83 cents per share, from $882 million,
or 90 cents per share a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding one-time items in both quarters, GTE said its
operating profits rose to $796 million, or 82 cents per share, up
from $723 million, or 74 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   The results matched the expectations of analysts surveyed by
First Call/Thomson Financial
</P>
<P>
   The Irving-based GTE, which is being acquired by Bell Atlantic
Corp., said its consolidated revenue increased to $6.1 billion,
compared to an adjusted revenue of $5.6 billion in the first
quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   GTE said it adjusted the previously reported amount of $5.9
billion downward in part to account for the sale of its government
systems unit, though net income and earnings per share were not
affected.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue from domestic wireless services grew 30 percent, and
revenue from its data-services wing jumped 53 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our core operations continue to produce solid results,
allowing us to invest in higher-growth opportunities,'' said
Charles R. Lee, GTE's chairman and chief executive. ''As a result
we experienced significant growth in our data, wireless and
long-distance businesses as well as in bundled offerings.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, GTE said its Internet unit will spend $11
billion to $13 billion over five years to build its network,
limiting profit growth to less than 10 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said it would spend $1.8 billion to $2 billion
this year -- roughly doubling earlier projections -- on its Genuity
unit, previously called GTE Internetworking, which provides
Internet data services to businesses.
</P>
<P>
   GTE has indicated it plans to spin off Genuity as part of a
proposal to win federal approval for its acquisition by Bell
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   GTE shares fell $2.31\ to $69.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Mayor, police, question civil rights draft critical of NYPD  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The mayor and police commissioner on Thursday
questioned the political motivations behind a draft report from a
federal civil rights panel suggesting that the New York Police
Department engages in racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rev. Al Sharpton, a frequent critic of the NYPD and the
mayor, praised the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights report for
reinforcing what he says the minority community has known all
along: that police target them more than their white counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ''The report clearly indicates what we have been saying for some
time -- that there is a real inherent practice of discrimination in
areas of promotions, employment, search and seizure, and other
police activities in the city,'' Sharpton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The data validates all of the protests and all of the points
that have been raised since the Abner Louima case,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-member commission began its probe into the police
force last year in the wake of the 1999 shooting of Amadou Diallo
and the 1997 torture of Louima, both at the hands of New York City
cops.
</P>
<P>
   Six members of the commission were appointed by Democrats and
two by Republicans. The panel has no enforcement powers but can
make recommendations to the president, Congress and federal
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The political makeup of the panel was noted by Giuliani and
Safir, the main targets of the probe. Giuliani called the draft ''a
joke.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My reaction to the Civil Rights Commission is they're an
embarrassment,'' he said. ''The chairman of the commission donated
to Hillary Clinton, donated to other Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Frances Berry, the commission's chairwoman, contributed
$250 dollars to the U.S. Senate campaign of Giuliani's Democratic
rival, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Safir was just as harsh, saying when he testified last year
before the commission, the chairman stopped him.
</P>
<P>
   ''The chairman of the committee stopped the proceeding, went out
of her way to praise and welcome Rev. Sharpton. She did not do that
for any other individual. That may give you some indication of her
motivation and where her politics are,'' Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the commission, Kimberly Alton, said she could
not discuss the draft until it had been approved for release by the
panel.
</P>
<P>
   The draft was released to Safir and Giuliani on Wednesday -- they
have 20 days to respond.
</P>
<P>
   The 250-page draft concludes that ''the NYPD's data strongly
suggests that racial profiling plays some role in the
stop-and-frisk practices of the overall department,'' reported The
New York Times on Thursday, which obtained a copy of the draft. For
example, the draft cites data from 1998 indicating that 51 percent
of the people stopped on Staten Island were black, even though the
island's population is only 9 percent black.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani disagreed, saying statistics show that the police
department searches a lower percentage of minorities, and police
are only searching people based on the descriptions they are given.
</P>
<P>
   The draft report also suggests that the city create an undefined
mechanism to prosecute serious accusations of police brutality,
instead of using local district attorneys ''who must work with the
police on a routine basis,'' the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the draft suggests the reshaping of the department's
diversity training, which it found defective, and an independent
monitor to review how citizen complaints of police misconduct are
handled.

<HEADLINE> Report: Weak Charter School Support  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN, AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- States attempting to promote charter schools
are heading in the wrong direction if they don't give the special
public schools ample freedom and funding, say supporters in a new
report on state laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some states think it's OK to pass a relatively weak law and
still be part of the charter movement,'' said Jeanne Allen,
president of the Center for Education Reform, a privately run
school-reform research and advocacy group. ''A large number believe
it's all right to have charter schools as long as they liberate the
system from bad kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Charter schools -- public schools created by parents and teachers
and run with exemptions from most state laws and regulations --
usually represent a public school-choice for parents in poor
communities, where schools often struggle.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington-based group evaluated the 36 states and the
District of Columbia that have laws governing how charters open and
are run -- and concluded that just 9 states ensure good charter
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The group -- whose newest analysis comes as charter school
support widens and intensifies -- examined states for policies it
associates with strong charter school laws. The best states, Allen
said, tended to allow universities and other groups to join school
districts in sponsoring charters, make sure those charters get
their funding directly from the state, approve a variety of
schools, and protect charters from restrictive teacher union
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona ranked first; Mississippi last. Massachusetts got high
marks for giving charters schools more direct access to their
special pool of state funding. Others like Kansas were panned for
opening charters narrowly targeted to troubled kids.
</P>
<P>
   The report, to be released next week, did not include
information on student test scores. It counted schools opened in a
given state and detailed how and when a state allows such a school
to open.
</P>
<P>
   The group put a premium on how many charter schools a community
has. Saying the best laws lead to the greatest number of charters,
Allen believes a critical mass of schools will only lead to more
reform at the ailing public schools that drive parents away in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   There's little evidence of how much better a charter school
student does in testing and other academic performance, says Amy
Stuart Wells, a researcher at University of California at Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Wells noted in a recent interview that her longterm study of the
schools found that many presented vague goals, little
accountability and antagonized relations with the local school
district.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Jones, the associate state superintendent of Mississippi's
Education Department, said lawmakers there felt districts should
have a key role in charters. The state's lone elementary charter
school in Cleveland, Miss., is successful, despite low marks for
the state's charter law, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''School districts given the correct resources and correct
latitude will be able to establish the kind of schools to help
their communities,'' said Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Some states in the top categories, such as Michigan, Arizona and
North Carolina, have also had a number of charter schools close.
Allen says those states have learned what works: ''We don't
celebrate closures, but that's an indication that the concept is
working. They all made their mistakes , but they've learned from
those mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the top-ranked states -- Arizona, Texas, Florida,
Michigan and Massachusetts -- are led by Republican governors.
Nonetheless, Allen said the charter school effort is bipartisan --
noting Democrat support ranging from President Clinton to
legislative majorities in California and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could have been considered at one time that the more
pro-charter people were conservative, but you don't get states like
California or New York without healthy Democratic or minority
support,'' Allen said.

<HEADLINE> Cold War Spy Powers Gets Honors  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER COLEMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Francis Gary Powers, the U-2 spy plane
pilot who was shot down over the Soviet Union and captured in 1960
during the height of the Cold War, is at last being honored for the
fateful mission.
</P>
<P>
   Powers was held by the Soviets for two years. But the former Air
Force captain was considered a CIA employee, not military, so he
was not recognized as a prisoner of war until 21 years after his
death, when declassified Cold War documents in 1998 revealed his
mission was a joint operation of the CIA and Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important to make sure he's honored for his
contribution,'' his son, 34-year-old Francis Gary Powers Jr., said
Thursday. ''He never thought of himself as a hero, he thought of
himself as a pilot.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, exactly 40 years after Powers' capture by the
Soviets, his wife, son and daughter will accept the Air Force
Distinguished Flying Cross, the Department of Defense Prisoner of
War Medal and the National Defense Service Medal on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony will take place at Beale Air Force Base, about 60
miles north of Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   The Distinguished Flying Cross award is awarded at the direction
of the president.
</P>
<P>
   When the U-2 plane crashed over Russia, President Eisenhower at
first said it was a weather research plane lost over Turkey. The
United States eventually was forced to admit that Powers was spying
on the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   ''When my father was shot down, captured and shown to be alive
in the Soviet Union, it was the first time a president was caught
lying,'' said Powers Jr., who manages an Internet design and sales
company in Manassas, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Powers was sentenced to 10 years in prison but was exchanged for
KGB master spy Col. Rudolph Abel in 1962. He died in 1977 when a
news helicopter he was piloting crashed in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''Growing up he was just Dad. But when he died, the press, the
burial at Arlington, the floods of letters and news reports -- I
figured out that maybe Dad's job was a little different than other
people's,'' Powers Jr. said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would always ask, 'Dad, how high were you flying?' And he'd
say, 'Not high enough,''' he said. ''He respected his duty and his
country and never revealed any of the technical information, even
to me.''

<HEADLINE> Park Service Bans Snowmobiles  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Snowmobilers, stay away!
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Service, saying there's significant evidence
that thousands of snowmobilers are causing environmental damage to
the nation's parks, announced Thursday it is banning the offroad
winter vehicles from most of the park system.
</P>
<P>
   ''The time has come for the National Park Service to pull in its
welcome mat for recreational snowmobiling,'' Assistant Interior
Secretary Donald J. Barry said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The broad ban applies to 25 national parks, recreation areas,
monuments and other park units where snowmobiles have been allowed
for years.
</P>
<P>
   Yellowstone and Grand Teton in Wyoming are not included in the
immediate ban, but the vehicles are likely to be phased out, or
possibly banned, this fall. However, a formal decision on that must
await completion of a winter-use study, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign against snowmobiles is part of a broader Park
Service effort to curtail use of motorized vehicles in parks. In
March, the agency announced new restrictions on the use of Jet Skis
and similar motorized watercraft in some parks, and efforts also
are under way to limit private automobile traffic to reduce
congestion and air pollution at some of the busiest parks.
</P>
<P>
   Snowmobilers have been the source of controversy for some time.
Critics contend they are too noisy and disturb park tranquility,
account for much of the winter air pollution in parks, damage
vegetation, and endanger wildlife. Last year, an estimated 180,000
snowmobilers visited the park system, conservationists estimated.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Park Service is finally waking up to the lasting harm
motorized thrill-craft such as snowmobiles cause to parks,'' said
Sean Smith of the San Francisco-based Bluewater Network, which
filed a petition more than a year ago accusing the government of
violating its own regulations by allowing snowmobile use.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 conservation and other park advocacy groups
supported the petition, to which the Park Service responded
Thursday with its action, banning recreational snowmobiling in 10
national parks and 15 national recreation areas, trails, seashores,
monuments and historic sites from Maine to California.
</P>
<P>
   Parks in Alaska and the Voyageurs National Park in Minnesota
were exempted from the ban because Congress specifically allowed
snowmobile use in those parks. The Park Service said the vehicles
also will be allowed in limited areas when they are needed for
access to private land within or adjacent to a park.
</P>
<P>
   Barry of Interior called snowmobiles ''noisy, antiquated
machines that are no longer welcome in our national parks'' and
said the industry ''has had many years to clean up their act and
they haven't.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no final decision on the future of snowmobiling is
expected for Yellowstone -- which stretches into Montana and Idaho --
until November, Doug Schmier, who runs a snowmobile rental service
in West Yellowstone, Mont., fears the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ''The writing's on the wall. ... They're just taking our rights
away from us,'' Schmier said, adding that a ban on snowmobiles
would ''will devastate this community'' that is near an entrance to
the park and relies heavily on income from park visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists and other park advocates have long argued that
since the 1970s, the Park Service has largely ignored the problems
posed by snowmobiles, contrary to its own regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Denis Galvin, the agency's deputy director, acknowledged that
for ''years inattention to our own regulatory standards on
snowmobiles generated the problem we have before us today.'' He
said the agency long failed to monitor environmental harm from
snowmobile use in the parks.
</P>
<P>
   A Park Service study, completed in February, confirmed that
snowmobiles have had a significant impact on air pollution at the
parks. It also found the vehicles had affected wildlife and the
quiet of the parks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say the Park Service's newfound concerns are
long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Collins of the National Parks and Conservation
Association, a private parks advocacy group, said that the Park
Service's own studies have shown 78 percent of the carbon monoxide
and 94 percent of the hydrocarbons emitted annually within
Yellowstone can be attributed to snowmobiles.
</P>
<P>
   In its petition, the Bluewater Network argued that snowmobiles
are many times dirtier than automobiles that travel through parks.
Over a year, 60,000 snowmobiles enter Yellowstone, expelling 13.8
million pounds of hydrocarbons, compared with 203,000 pounds from
visitors' automobiles, the petition said.

<HEADLINE> Tough job ahead trying to relocate Tiger Lady's 26 big cats  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- It's not like a newspaper ad saying
''Wanted: good home for big cat'' will work. After all these are
tigers, 400-pound carnivores.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are just very hard animals to find a home for. They scare
the hell out of you. They're big, and they will eat you if they get
a chance,'' said Craig Brestrup, executive director of a national
association for animal preserves.
</P>
<P>
   After losing a court appeal, New Jersey's Tiger Lady must now
get her 26 animals out of her Jackson Township preserve and into
suitable shelters. Experts say that is a job far more difficult
than it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Resources at accredited animal preserves are strained as they
deal with increasing numbers of big cats that were once pets, wild
life activists said. Tigers present particular concerns for habitat
mangers, especially since big cats breed easily in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   Animal rights workers say there is no clear number of just how
many tigers there are in the United States, since many owners fail
to keep breeding records and routinely sell cubs to roadside zoos.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey officials alleged Joan Byron-Marasek did just that.
She also fed her animals road kill and kept them in cramped,
chain-link cages, state authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials and residents close to Byron-Marasek's property
have complained of noise, odors, dust and other problems. In
addition to the tigers, Byron-Marasek keeps approximately 30 guard
dogs.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation into the Tigers Only Preservation Society began
when a 431-pound Bengal tiger was found wandering in a neighborhood
two miles from her property. Authorities shot the tiger.
Byron-Marasek denies the animal was hers.
</P>
<P>
   State officials revoked Byron-Marasek's permit to keep the
animals, and she appealed. On Wednesday, an administrative law
judge sided with the state.
</P>
<P>
   Byron-Marasek can appeal, but unless this latest decision is
overturned, she must find new homes for the animals, according to
DEP spokesman Peter Page. The judge ruled that they must be placed
in a ''appropriate, lawfully operated facility.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no bona fide sanctuary out there that can take 26
tigers,'' said Lynn Cuny, executive director of Wildlife Reserve
and Rehabilitation in Boerne, Texas. ''This has been going on for
so long that most of us are in a position where we can't even take
two or three. We've taken in two or three so many times before.''
</P>
<P>
   Like others who operate such preserves, Cuny said she gets
''dozens of calls a month'' from people looking for homes for
lions, tigers, mountain lions and large primates.
</P>
<P>
   ''The zoos don't want them. They could not go back to the wild.
It's absolutely out of the question,'' Cuny said.
</P>
<P>
   Most tigers wind up in roadside zoos where they breed, and the
cubs are sold, Cuny said. While those attractions might be legal,
they are not in the best interests of the animals, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of finding homes for these tigers, the best solution
might be to have the animals put to sleep, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''As unfortunate as that might be and as much as we might hate
to say it, certainly it is a better option than a slow death in
substandard conditions,'' Cuny said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Gilbreth estimates it costs him $565 a month for each of
the tigers he keeps at his International Exotic Feline Sanctuary in
Boyd, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything we do here is straight-line legit. Every time you
don't do it, you put the cats in jeopardy,'' Gilbreth said. He's
got no room or no money for any new tigers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   This week alone Gilbreth said he had calls from three people
looking to unload exotic pets. And he had an e-mail from a man in
Brazil with seven tigers that need a home, Gilbreth said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an epidemic. It is a major problem all over this
country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Byron-Marasek's tigers, the closest wildlife refuge
accredited by his organization is in Mississippi, said Brestrup of
the Association of Sanctuaries. Representatives from his group
examine each property and check on the animals' living conditions,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But many animals kept as pets suffer from lack of proper care,
access to recreation areas and poor food supplies, Brestrup said,
citing these 26 tigers as an example.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one of the clear reasons why people ought not to be
allowed to own wild animals as pets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Byron-Marasek has been allowed to keep the animals while she
appealed the state move to revoke her license.
</P>
<P>
   That means the animals just suffer longer, said Jennifer
O'Connor, a caseworker with People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals.
</P>
<P>
   ''When people fight it out in court, the animals languish,''
O'Connor said. All of this adds to PETA's argument that such
animals should not be pets, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are only about 5,000 of these animals in the wild,''
O'Connor said. ''Yet there are thousands more in little backyard
hellholes through out the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Although not obligated, state officials will look ''on an
informal basis'' for appropriate homes for the tigers, said Page,
the DEP spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not going to be easy. Anybody that has tigers probably
has all the tigers they want. It's not like they're panda bears,''
Page said.

<HEADLINE> Peruvian Challenger May Back Out  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL HAVEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Peruvian candidate Alejandro Toledo said
Thursday he'll boycott the deciding second round of presidential
elections unless wide-ranging electoral abuses are eliminated and
he is allowed to compete on a ''level playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   The 54-year-old economist pointed to ballot stuffing and
tampering throughout the country by President Alberto Fujimori's
supporters in the April 9 first round, and warned that he won't
allow a repeat performance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let me relate to you our firm commitment of not going into an
election if conditions do not change significantly for the second
round,'' Toledo told a gathering at the nonprofit Americas Society
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has denied irregularities and assured a clean second
round. The president won 49.8 percent of the vote in the first
round, just short of the absolute majority needed to avoid the
run-off with Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   But the results have been questioned by international monitors
and on Tuesday, President Clinton signed a congressional resolution
warning that Peru could face political and economic sanctions if
electoral irregularities persist.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo said the second round of elections may be a one-man race.
There is no date set yet, but it is likely the elections will take
place in either late May or early June.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to legitimize a process that is fraudulent,'' he
said. ''If there is not a political will to make any significant
changes in the rules of the game, (Fujimori) might be alone in the
contest ... and he will not gain national and international
legitimacy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point, I'm not very optimistic,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo said Thursday that ballots in many regions were cut so
that his name -- which was last on the list of candidates -- did not
appear. In other instances he said ballots were waxed over,
allowing only Fujimori's name to be marked. In some states, more
people were reported to have voted than there were eligible voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is clear that the figures that you see officially do not
correspond to the will of the voters,'' Toledo told the conference.
He spoke in English.
</P>
<P>
   He called on Fujimori to allow increased international
monitoring, equal access to the media, and the participation of
outside polling companies in order to ''construct a more level
playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo was on a trip to New York and Washington to meet with
international lending institutions and discuss his plans for Peru's
economy.
</P>
<P>
   At the Americas Society talk, he said that if elected he would
focus on improving education and health care so that poor Peruvians
are no longer dependent on handouts from the government to survive.
He also said he would follow an austere fiscal line and encourage
stability and foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo praised Fujimori for fighting drug trafficking,
stabilizing the economy, and dealing a series of crushing blows to
the brutal Shining Path rebel group during his two terms as Peru's
iron-fisted leader. But he said Fujimori's re-election would be
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ''The choice is authoritarianism or democracy'' he said. ''The
choice is the respect of institutions and the need to have checks
and balances versus the concentration of power in a single
person.''

<HEADLINE> Body of kidnapped consultant found strangled, burned in NJ swamp  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A British computer consultant snatched from
Kentucky last week has been found dead in a central New Jersey
swamp with marks indicating he was strangled and set afire, the FBI
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The suspected kidnapper, Gregory J. Marcinski, could now face
the death penalty for murder, a Kentucky prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   Marcinski, of Brick, has been held without bail since April 20
on charges he impersonated an FBI agent to kidnap Paul Jeffrey Gale
of Naples, Fla., three days earlier because Gale was dating
Marcinski's former lover.
</P>
<P>
   Marcinski's housemate, Preston C. Foray Jr. was arrested
Wednesday night, and authorities believe he helped Marcinski hide
Gale's body. Foray told agents where to find the body, the FBI said
in court papers.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of Gale's death had not yet been determined, pending
completion of an autopsy Thursday, said FBI Special Agent Sandra
Carroll, a spokeswoman for the Newark office.
</P>
<P>
   A shirtless body bearing ''ligature markings'' on the neck and
burn marks from a flammable liquid was found about 2 a.m. Thursday
in ''shallow grave,'' said FBI Special Agent Garey S. Chin, the No.
2 agent in the Newark office.
</P>
<P>
   Gale, 28, was awakened by Marcinski and kidnapped April 17 from
his hotel room in Florence, Ky., but investigators do not yet know
where he was killed, Chin said.
</P>
<P>
   Marcinski told Foray that he killed the man after driving around
with him for about an hour, Foray told agents, according to court
papers filed Thursday by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ''The understanding, at this point, is that it occurred
somewhere between Kentucky and New Jersey. The exact point is
unknown,'' said Linda Tally Smith, an assistant commonwealth
attorney for Boone County, Ky. Regardless of the location, Kentucky
can charge him with murder because the crime originated there, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky is awaiting autopsy results and other information
before deciding whether to charge Marcinski with murder, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will probably become a capital case, but we're still
looking at it,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Marcinski, 23, is being held in the Monmouth County,
N.J., jail awaiting extradition to Kentucky on state kidnapping
charges and a federal charge of impersonating an FBI agent.
</P>
<P>
   Foray, 21, lived at the home of Marcinski's grandmother and does
not face Kentucky charges, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no evidence he stepped foot in the state,'' she said.
''We believe he helped conceal the body once the defendant brought
it back to New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Foray told agents on Wednesday that when he saw Marcinski on
April 17, Marcinski disclosed the kidnapping and showed him the
body in the trunk of Marcinski's grandmother's Buick, according to
court papers.
</P>
<P>
   Marcinski asked him to help dispose of the body, and they buried
him in a marshy section of Brick about two miles from Marcinski's
home, Foray told agents, the FBI papers said. The information
sparked a daylong search.
</P>
<P>
   Foray spoke softly and kept his head bowed during a brief
appearance before U.S. Magistrate John Hughes in Trenton on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes set bail at $1 million, but said he would release Foray
on $90,000 in property bonds from his parents on the condition that
he live and work with his father in Point Pleasant and wear an
electronic monitoring device.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the judge ordered Foray to spend the night
Thursday in protective custody at the Monmouth County Jail, where
Marcinski is also being held.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyer Michael E. Wilbert told the judge his client is
''despondent,'' and said Foray could face a ''catastrophic result''
in jail without protective custody. He declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Foray faces up to 15 years in federal prison if found guilty of
accessory after the fact of a kidnapping, Assistant U.S. Attorney
Treby Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Marcinski, a volunteer emergency medical technician, flashed an
EMT badge and computer-generated FBI credentials to gain access to
Gale's room at the Holiday Inn in Florence, a city across the Ohio
River from Cincinnati, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   Gale recently lived in Mount Laurel, N.J., where he worked as a
computer programmer for TRW Integrated Supply. He was working for
TRW in Kentucky this month as a consultant in the merger of two
pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   Gale was reported missing April 17 by a friend and business
associate.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Marcinski became enraged that Gale had been
dating his ex-girlfriend, Darla Guidie, and drove the Buick 800
miles to Kentucky to confront Gale.
</P>
<P>
   Marcinski identified himself as Special Agent ''Trimble'' and
handcuffed Gale before placing him in the front seat of the Buick
in the early morning hours of April 17, authorities have said.
</P>
<P>
   Guidie told the FBI that Marcinski made the fake identification
on his computer and ''bragged that he had gotten the format for the
phony FBI credentials off of the Internet,'' according to court
papers.
</P>
<P>
   She had a restraining order against Marcinski, said John Mercun,
the executive assistant prosecutor for Ocean County, where Brick is
located.
</P>
<P>
   Marcinski, a member of the Community First Aid Squad and a
self-employed computer technician, was also arrested last August
when another ex-girlfriend told police he assaulted her and grabbed
her new boyfriend by the neck, pushing him to the floor, the Asbury
Park Press of Neptune reported.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers, Rowland near agreement on budget  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Gov. John G. Rowland and legislative
leaders said Thursday they are close to sealing a budget deal that
will include tax cuts on gasoline and clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Tax credits for parents who send their children to private
elementary and secondary schools are not a part of the pact, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The nature of the beast is that nothing is agreed to until
everything is agreed to,'' said Senate Majority Leader George
Jepsen, D-Stamford. ''I think it is very close to being finished.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislative session ends at midnight Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After fighting Rowland's proposal to enact a 7-cent gas tax cut
on July 1, Senate Democrats said they're near agreement on that
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe it will be 7 cents, although that's not fully
resolved,'' Jepsen said. ''And it will be July 1st.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the gas tax cut, Rowland and Jepsen said they've
agreed on doling out $75 million in tax breaks to the state's
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think those will be the two essential ingredients for the
tax cut package,'' Rowland said. ''The spending portion looks like
its pretty much concluded.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats want something in return -- namely an increase on
clothing tax exemptions. Currently, clothing priced below $50 is
tax free. Democrats want to raise that limit to $75.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they want to include that as part of the package, I think
there would be enough room,'' Rowland said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never run into a tax cut I didn't like,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the legislative session started in February, Democrats
have railed against Rowland's plan for a one-time, 7-cent gas cut.
They argued that such a slash would suck money out of the state's
fund for road and bridge repairs and fail to give drivers relief at
the pumps.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats have since softened their stance, suggesting
last month they would be willing to cut the tax 7 cents over three
years. Then they proposed cutting the 32-cent tax to a quarter for
one year, with the understanding that it could be reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   ''The risk with the gas tax -- in addition to compromising the
transportation fund -- is that it's impossible to control how the
large oil companies ... are not pocketing the profits and not
passing the savings on to consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the gas tax cut say it would mean a savings of $85
to $140 a year for a family that drives 30,000 miles. In addition,
lowering the tax would keep Connecticut drivers from crossing state
lines to fill their tanks at cheaper prices, they say.
</P>
<P>
   While they've budged on the gas tax issue, Democratic leaders
are resisting Rowland's pitch to give parents a tuition tax credit
of up to $500 if they send their school-age children to private
school.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said he predicts the credit plan will be passed as a
separate bill in the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of bipartisan support for that,'' Rowland said.
''I think we'll have a vote on it, but it won't be part of the
negotiated settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jepsen said the plan doesn't have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe there is support for tuition tax credits and
I'm personally and completely opposed to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the tax credits say they're too much like vouchers
that would drain money from public education.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed budget -- about $12.2 billion -- would remain about
$50 million under the state's mandatory spending cap, Rowland and
Jepsen said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's really where we wanted to be,'' Rowland said. In
February, Rowland said he wanted to keep spending $84 million below
the cap.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland and lawmakers also want to use the state's surplus to
pay for one-time expenses and retire debt. As of April 1, the state
Comptroller estimated the surplus at $264.5 million. But that
estimate has been reduced to about $240 million, Rowland said.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said the fluctuation will not effect the budget deal
he's reached with Democratic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not going to disrupt the negotiations,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> AP Photographer's Arrest Condemned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- The arrest of an Associated Press
photographer in connection with a newspaper office attack in
Zimbabwe drew protest Thursday from foreign press organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Obed Zilwa, a South African citizen based in Cape Town, was
detained after police claimed he matches an eyewitness description
of a person involved in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The South African Foreign Correspondent's Association sent a
letter to President Robert Mugabe requesting that he personally see
to Zilwa's release.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Zilwa is a respected member of the foreign press corps
based in South Africa and the idea that he should be involved in
terrorist activities is outrageous. Mr. Zilwa -- like other members
of the FCA -- covers news events. He does not organize them,'' wrote
Werner Vogt, chairman of the FCA.
</P>
<P>
   The South African based Freedom of Expression Institute called
Zilwa's detention ''just a further ploy to silence the press and,
more specifically, the foreign press.''
</P>
<P>
   The institute said it was distressed by the disrespect shown to
the media during the recent violence in Zimbabwe and the
government's refusal to protect reporters. It also accused the
government of blaming the foreign press for the country's ills.
</P>
<P>
   Zilwa was held in a Harare jail after his arrest Wednesday.
Police have the right to detain him for 48 hours without charge.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Jonathan Samkange said Zilwa was being asked to make a
written and sworn statement at the main police precinct in the
Zimbabwe capital, indicating he would spend a second night in
detention before being either charged or released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Zilwa was preparing to return home Wednesday from covering the
political crisis in Zimbabwe when police arrested him at Harare's
airport, Samkange said.
</P>
<P>
   Police questioned Zilwa for more than seven hours, not only
about the explosion at the offices of The Daily News, but also
about his opinions on Zimbabwe's political parties and the recent
occupation of white-owned land by black squatters, Samkange said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We protest in the strongest terms the detention of our
photographer, Obed Zilwa, and we demand his immediate release,''
said Terry Leonard, AP's southern Africa bureau chief. ''We are
protesting to the Zimbabwe government, and we urge other
governments and news organizations to call for an end to the
intimidation of the foreign press. The Associated Press will
provide whatever assistance is needed to help obtain Obed's speedy
release.''
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press sent a letter of protest to Zimbabwe's
ambassador to the United States, Simbi Veke Mubako, demanding
Zilwa's immediate release.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Zilwa matches a description of a person in a car from
which the explosive device was hurled at The Daily News on
Saturday, Samkange said. No one was injured in the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Zilwa was one of the first photographers on the scene after the
explosion. He had just driven by when he heard the loud noise, and
stopped to ask a police officer what had happened, Samkange said.
The officer said he thought it was a bomb. Zilwa then rushed to his
hotel, fetched his cameras and went back to take photographs.
</P>
<P>
   The Meikles Hotel, where Zilwa and most other international
journalists were staying, is just a few blocks from The Daily News,
and many foreign journalists quickly arrived at the scene. After
the bombing, authorities said the media's quick arrival raised
their suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   Police did not return a phone call seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Some doubt state tactics in overseeing Camden finances  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- New Jersey is stricter than almost every
other state in overseeing local government finances. So some
critics want to know why the state didn't do more about Camden's
financial crisis years ago and why it might take a near takeover of
the city to correct the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Next week a state Superior Court judge will hear arguments on
why the state Division of Community Affairs should assume direct
supervision of nearly all aspects of Camden's financial operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''DCA year after year after year approved the municipal budgets.
Year after year they have certified municipal budget officers, tax
collectors, municipal clerks,'' said Bill Dressel, executive
director of the League of Municipalities. ''The question has to be
asked, why weren't affirmative steps taken when these things were
uncovered.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials allege that Camden officials repeatedly ignored
warnings to correct faulty financial practices. Camden -- where 70
cents of every city dollar spent comes from state aid -- does not
keep proper financial records, including a general ledger and an
account of city payouts, all of which are required by law, the
state says.
</P>
<P>
   The Division of Community Affairs already oversees much of
Camden's operations through a Financial Review Board put in place
last year. If the judge agrees after the May 5 hearing, the next
phase would be a complete supervision, one step shy of a takeover
of the New Jersey's poorest city.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state already has power, oversight functions. What have
they done with the power to date. How are they going to solve the
problem with more power'' Dressel said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Local Finance Board told the attorney general on
April 14 to sue Camden and its officials after Camden failed to
comply with a dozen orders outlined in a state ultimatum.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the state Division of Community Affairs had given
Camden two weeks to correct the long-standing problems. The
deadline came March 24, a day after Mayor Milton Milan was named in
an indictment charging him with extortion, money laundering and
mail fraud. Authorities say Milan accepted payoffs and gifts from
city contractors and took bribes from organized crime figures.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Wayne R. Bryant, D-Camden, at a Senate budget committee
hearing Wednesday, asked Division of Community Affairs Commissioner
Jane M. Kenny why the state wants full supervision of the city now,
when it had the chance to fix the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant argued that the division should have used its oversight
powers before threatening the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ''For me to give you more powers if you don't exercise the ones
you already have doesn't make sense,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   But Kenny claimed that state supervisors were thwarted by
Milan's administration ''at nearly every turn.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You can stop the hemorrhaging and we've done that. But you
can't make government work efficiently and effectively,'' Kenny
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Milan threatened to file bankruptcy before he accepted
a deal to allow a state financial review board some oversight of
city operations. But despite that monitoring, the state alleges
Camden officials continued to ignore the problems.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, the state says Camden filed annual audits more
than two years after they were due. When the audits were filed,
some contained a notice from the auditor that the examinations
could not be done because Camden kept no records of its
expenditures. And in 1998, Camden overspent its $116 million budget
by nearly $500,000, according to the state's legal brief.
</P>
<P>
   ''We lay down the rules. Did Camden follow the rules, no. That's
the reality,'' Ulrich Steinberg, the state's director of the
Division of Local Government Services, told the Senate panel.
</P>
<P>
   Milan did not return three telephone messages left at his City
Hall office on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey is the only state that requires each town to submit
its yearly budget for approval. The state also mandates that towns
include detailed information about accounts and expenditures in
their budgets.

<HEADLINE> Teamsters Back Rep. Hoekstra  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a strange political marriage, the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters has endorsed Rep. Peter
Hoekstra, a Republican who voted against all the union's key bills
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Teamsters officials said the endorsement was due to Hoekstra's
support for ending the federal government's 11-year supervision of
the 1.5-million member union.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's the first candidate that has stood up and said, 'It's
time for the government to get out of the Teamsters' business.' He
came to speak to us and that left an impression on us,'' Bill
Black, legislative director for the Michigan Teamsters Joint
Council 43, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan Teamsters endorsed Hoekstra at their delegate meeting
in Detroit last week and the national union went along with it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew it would not be a popular endorsement because of his
voting record,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Teamsters Local 406 in Grand Rapids, Mich., which has many
members in Hoekstra's district, endorsed his opponent, Democrat Bob
Shrauger.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot endorse him at the local level because of his voting
record and we have to reflect what our members want,'' said Bruce
Harvey, the local's political director.
</P>
<P>
   When Fred Bennett, an agent with Teamsters Local 214 in
Muskegon, Mich., heard of the national union's endorsement, he
laughed. He said his local would support Hoekstra's opponent ''no
matter who it is.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The international is a lot different than the regular
locals,'' he said. ''I don't think Mr. Hoekstra has the best
interest of labor at heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoekstra opposed all nine of the Teamsters' key issues last
year, including legislation dealing with ergonomics and trade with
China. The Teamsters give him a lifetime voting record of 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   After a federal election official overturned the 1996 election
of Teamsters President Ron Carey in August 1997, Hoekstra conducted
a 17-month investigation into the balloting.
</P>
<P>
   The election result was set aside when federal investigators
found Carey's campaign had improperly benefited from donations the
union made to third-party political organizations. A new election
was held in 1998, clearing the way for James P. Hoffa to assume
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of Hoekstra's investigation, he recommended the union
create records of spending by union bosses, establish an inspector
general to investigate fraud and adopt a code of ethical conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ''When this union was going through a lot of its turmoil, we
were the ones that responded to the rank-and-file,'' Hoekstra said
Thursday in a telephone interview from his Hawaii vacation. ''The
only Teamsters that don't like me are the ones that are connected
to the corrupt Ron Carey regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Shrauger did not return a phone call seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Spends $500K on Elian Case  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department has spent more than
$578,000 on the Elian Gonzalez case, including Saturday's raid,
since the 6-year-old Cuban boy was plucked from the Atlantic Ocean
last Thanksgiving, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent Miami city cost figures were $1 million through
last Thursday, two days before the raid and the street disorders it
set off. Nearly 80 percent of that was for police overtime.
</P>
<P>
   At her weekly news conference Thursday, Attorney General Janet
Reno said the Border Patrol agents, who carried automatic weapons
on the early morning raid, ''had to be in force.'' As reasons, she
cited the hostile crowd of Cuban exiles outside and the family,
which had stopped saying it would stand aside and had ''started
talking in the last days about 'you're going to have to use force
to take the child'.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There had to be a show of force, not a use of force, to show
that we were in control,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez and his family, who cared
for the boy for five months, had refused to obey federal orders to
turn him over his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who had come from
Cuba to retrieve him.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Justice official also has said four or five men acting
as bodyguards for the family had permits to carry concealed
weapons, there were reports of guns in a house behind Lazaro's, and
Lazaro's daughter, Marisleysis Gonzalez, warned a federal official
that ''there are more than cameras in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno knew photographers were present to record the raid. The
American people ''don't like the picture any more than I do,'' Reno
said referring to an Associated Press photo of a uniformed agent
holding an automatic weapon near an obviously frightened Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't like the thought of having to take a little boy to
his father in this fashion any more than I do,'' Reno said. ''It
may not be the prettiest thing in the world, but it is effective.''
</P>
<P>
   But law enforcement experience ''demonstrates that the show of
force does so much to protect life, rather than harm life,'' Reno
said.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary Justice Department figures, through Monday, showed
the largest spending was $374,000 for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service. That included the cost of training and
housing 131 immigration agents who participated in the raid and
Elian's government airplane flight to Washington and the airplane
that would have taken Lazaro Gonzalez to Washington had he agreed
to a peaceful transfer.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. marshals, who provided 20 deputies for the raid and
security for Elian's father in Washington since April 6 and the
entire family since Saturday, spent $161,000.
</P>
<P>
   Justice's Community Relations Service spent $25,000 on mediators
and conciliators who worked to calm the crowd and to set up
negotiating sessions with the family.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. attorneys in Miami and Atlanta and Justice's civil division
spent a combined $18,000 on legal work.
</P>
<P>
   The figures included overtime but not regular salaries which
would have been paid anyway. They also included copying costs and
expenses for psychiatric consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Justice was awaiting a Defense Department bill for the three
nights Juan Miguel Gonzalez' family spent at Andrew Air Force Base.
The Pentagon said Thursday that would total $540.
</P>
<P>
   At 4 a.m. Saturday and even after that, Reno told Aaron
Podhurst, a Miami lawyer who served as an intermediary with her
during last-ditch negotiations, that they were ''out of time.''
</P>
<P>
   She ordered the raid then because ''this seemed to be the safest
time possible.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There were very few people outside the house,'' Reno said.
''If we did not go, people were sure to find out that we were
prepared to go, and the crowd would gather and keep a vigil and
make it more difficult for the future.''

<HEADLINE> Pork Bellies at 4-Yr. High  </HEADLINE>
By BENNIE M. CURRIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pork belly futures closed at the highest level in nearly four
years Thursday as demand for bacon from fast-food restaurants put
pressure on fresh supplies for a second straight day.
</P>
<P>
   In other commodity markets, platinum rose sharply while crude
oil prices increased slightly.
</P>
<P>
   While hog futures closed mixed on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, pork bellies continued to show the effect of crackling
demand for bacon, which is made from hogs' bellies.
</P>
<P>
   Pork bellies for May delivery are at the highest price levels
since August 1996, up more than 77 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Market observers said the trend to add bacon to sandwiches,
pizzas and other fast-food items is pitting consumers' taste buds
against supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're getting stronger demands in what normally is an off-type
season,'' said Chuck Levitt, an analyst with Alaron Trading Corp.,
a brokerage firm in Chicago. ''The prime consuming period is the
summer when people or vacationing and have more time for big
breakfasts. Meanwhile, restaurants are cooking hamburgers longer to
kill bacteria and are adding bacon to make up for the fat that's
being cooked out.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, pork consumption is at a 20-year high, according to
the National Pork Producers Council. Pork sold to U.S. food
companies increased 17 percent between 1996 and 1999, with bacon
making up nearly one-fifth of all sales.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon was the most popular product used by restaurants last
year, according to the National Pork Producers Association.
</P>
<P>
   The spurt in pork consumption could send prices as high as $1.05
before the interest in bacon settles down, Levitt added.
</P>
<P>
   May pork bellies rose .20 cents to 99.92 cents a pound. Also,
June live cattle fell .32 cent to 69.40 cents a pound, while May
feeder cattle rose .10 cent to 84.32 cents a pound and June lean
hogs fell .42 cent to 77.05 cents a pound.
</P>
<P>
   In trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures
ended 5 percent higher amid continued speculation about Russian
exports. Skittish investors have been dumping the metal in response
to last week's announcement that Russia's largest producer, Norilsk
Nickel, was resuming exports.
</P>
<P>
   Platinum futures jumped to a one-week high of $463.50 for July
before settling at $462.10, up $24 for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on the New York Merc floor, crude oil futures closed
higher as investors sought bargains after two days of losses,
according to market-watchers.
</P>
<P>
   Light, sweet crude for June delivery rose 77 cents, or 1
percent, to $25.42 a barrel.

<HEADLINE> Child-Rearing Costs Jump To $160K  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- That new baby will cost a bundle. The cost of
rearing a child born last year will be $160,140 for a middle-income
family, up about 2 percent from 1998, the government said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   For low-income families, those earning less than $36,800, the
cost of rearing a child through age 17 is lower -- $117,000 --
because they spend less on food, housing and other needs. For
high-income families, those earning more than $61,900, the total
expenditure is estimated at $233,850.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department compiles the estimates each year to
help state agencies and courts determine payments for child support
and foster care.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said the modest increase in
child expenditures last year is ''a testament to the amazingly
strong U.S. economy and our low rate of inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   The department estimates a middle-income family could expect to
spend $8,450 to $9,530 a year on each child, depending on the age.
</P>
<P>
   Costs vary by region, with the highest expenses in the urban
West, followed by the urban Northeast and the urban South. Rural
areas and the urban Midwest are the least expensive places to rear
children.
</P>
<P>
   Housing is the biggest expenditure, $53,310, or 33 percent of
the cost of raising a child for 17 years. Food is next at $27,990,
or 18 percent of the total. Next comes transportation costs at
$22,980. Child care and education expenditures are estimated at
$15,750.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, total child expenditures for a middle-income family
were estimated at $25,230.

<HEADLINE> Haitian Shipwreck Leaves 14 Dead  </HEADLINE>
By JESSICA ROBERTSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- A ship carrying nearly 300 Haitian boat
people ran aground in the southern Bahamas, and 14 victims died
apparently of dehydration, Bahamian and U.S. officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Coast Guard rushed rescuers to the scene, immediately
evacuating 31 people suffering from severe hypothermia, dehydration
and kidney failure.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fifteen of the migrants still on Flamingo Cay are in pretty
poor shape,'' said Petty Officer Gibran Soto. Two Coast Guard
helicopters deployed from Clearwater, Fla., were continuing the
rescue Thursday afternoon, and four Coast Guard cutters would soon
be on site.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the Bahamas sent a Defense Force vessel to pick up
survivors, who will be returned to Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   The boat was carrying about 275 Haitians -- the largest single
load of migrants to reach the Bahamas in years. It ran aground
Wednesday afternoon off Flamingo Cay in the Ragged Island chain,
Bahamian immigration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Three sailing vessels spotted the wreck and alerted officials,
Soto said by telephone from Miami.
</P>
<P>
   When the Coast Guard arrived that night, they found 14 of the
Haitians already dead, Soto said.
</P>
<P>
   The trip through Atlantic Ocean waters to the Bahamas or to
Florida's coast is a risky journey, but more and more impoverished
Haitians have been willing to take.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday morning, another 122 Haitians landed on Inagua, the
southernmost island in the Bahamian chain just over 100 miles from
Haiti's northern coast. And on Friday another group of 224 Haitians
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Florida said they arrested 15 Haitians dropped off
Wednesday night near Key Biscayne by a motor boat running without
lights. The smuggling vessel was stopped by customs officers, who
arrested two suspects, one Bahamian and one Haitian, according to a
statement from the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   The Haitians said they paid $4,000 each for the trip, Border
Patrol spokesman Joseph Mellia said.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic increase in the number of Haitians seeking refuge
in the Bahamas coincides with increasing violence in Haiti as the
nation gears up for long-postponed legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
   But the director of Haiti's National Migration Office, Carol
Joseph, said he did not believe politics had a hand in the
emigration.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a sign of economic despair,'' he said Thursday, noting
that it takes months to prepare such voyages and that most migrants
were subsistence farmers from Haiti's northwest, not the capital
where most of the political violence has been occurring.
</P>
<P>
   Bahamian officials say they have no idea how many Haitians
manage to reach the islands undetected. Though there is no official
figure, some estimate as many as 40,000 Haitians live among the
300,000 Bahamians.

<HEADLINE> Sales Lift Dow Chemical Earnings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDLAND, Mich. (AP) -- Dow Chemical Co. said Thursday its
first-quarter earnings rose 26 percent as a big increase in sales
volume overcame higher raw material and energy costs.
</P>
<P>
   Dow said it earned $415 million, or $1.83 a share, in the three
months ending March 31. The company earned $329 million, or $1.47 a
share, in the same period of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The first-quarter results exceed Wall Street expectations. A
survey of 13 analysts by First Call/Thomson Financial had predicted
earnings of $1.65 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Sales rose 22 percent to $5.38 billion from $4.42 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Its shares rose $3.43}, or more than 3 percent, on the news to
$109 at 5:15 p.m. EST on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Dow said its energy and raw material costs rose $700 million in
the quarter, while its prices rose only $540 million, or 12
percent. But that was offset by a 10 percent increase in its sales
volume.
</P>
<P>
   Chief financial officer J. Pedro Reinhard said the results
''demonstrate once again our ability to overcome major hurdles such
as the substantial increase in raw material and energy costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales were particularly strong in the Asia-Pacific region, where
volume rose 26 percent, compared with a more modest 3 percent in
the United States. Overall, non-U.S. sales volume rose 17 percent,
including 12 percent in Europe and 10 percent in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Midland-based Dow has announced plans to merge with Union
Carbide of Danbury, Conn., to form the world's second-largest
chemical company behind DuPont Co. The merger has received
stockholder approval but remains under review by regulators.

<HEADLINE> Senate Panel OKs Anti-Suicide Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HUGHES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Right-to-life supporters cheered a Senate
panel's passage Thursday of a bill that would thwart Oregon's
landmark law allowing physician-assisted suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ''A sad chapter in our nation's history may be nearing an end,''
said Richard Doerflinger of the National Conference of Catholic
Bishops.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-8 Senate Judiciary Committee vote was largely along party
lines, with just one Republican, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania,
voting against the bill and one Democrat, Joe Biden of Delaware,
voting for it.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. and a leading bill opponent, said he was
heartened because the committee approved a similar bill by an 11-6
margin in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still think we've got an uphill battle, but today was
certainly better than we expected,'' Wyden said. ''We've gained
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   No Senate floor vote has been set, but the bill's author -- Don
Nickles of Oklahoma, the Senate's No. 2 Republican -- said he has
the votes to pass it and the 60 votes needed to shut off a
threatened filibuster by Wyden. The House already has passed a
version.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has not taken a position on the bill, which is
supported by some groups that opposed the 1998 version, including
the American Medical Association and the National Hospice
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would revoke the licenses to prescribe drugs of
doctors who deliberately use federally controlled substances to aid
a patient's death. Violators also would face a 20-year prison
sentence, according to the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   All 43 people who have taken their lives under Oregon's Death
With Dignity Act have used federally controlled substances.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also authorizes $5 million in annual grants for
medical schools to teach doctors better ways to treat pain.
</P>
<P>
   Before Thursday's vote, Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
amended the bill with changes sought by the AMA, including a
provision saying states will continue to regulate medical
practices.
</P>
<P>
   The new version also sets a ''clear and convincing evidence''
standard for federal authorities to prove doctors were trying to
aid in a patient's death.
</P>
<P>
   ''Terminally ill patients deserve better pain control
management,'' Hatch said. ''I am troubled by laws that single out
these patients as candidates for assisted suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the panel said the bill would hinder doctors'
ability to treat pain.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., told of holding her husband as
he was dying of cancer and suffering excruciating pain. Physicians
who give out large doses of pain medication to dying patients would
risk investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration under the
bill, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's just plain wrong,'' Feinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Suicide opponents have pressed for the bill since June 1998,
when Attorney General Janet Reno ruled federal drug agents cannot
move against doctors who help terminally ill patients die under
Oregon's assisted suicide law.
</P>
<P>
   The act was approved by 51 percent of Oregonians in 1994, and 60
percent voted against repealing it in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The calendar could the main ally of bill opponents, as senators
may be unwilling to chew up precious floor time in an election year
with lengthy debates on amendments Wyden would offer.

<HEADLINE> Regis Has Artery-Clearing Procedure  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Regis Philbin underwent a procedure that
successfully cleared a blocked artery, the television host said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Philbin had the procedure done Monday, while he was on vacation,
and stayed one night in the hospital, he said on his morning show,
''Live With Regis and Kathie Lee.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm fine, I'm fine,'' he assured co-host Kathie Lee Gifford.
</P>
<P>
   The 67-year-old has been juggling his talk show with nighttime
duties on ABC's hit ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   He said doctors had been monitoring a small blockage on his
right side since 1993, when he had a similar one removed from his
left side. A stress test several weeks ago revealed that the right
blockage had grown, he explained.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now it got a little heavy, so they decided, 'Would you like to
come in and have an angioplasty?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Philbin instead ended up getting an atherectomy, a procedure in
which doctors use a rotating shaver on the end of a catheter to
clear coronary arteries blocked by plaque. The catheter is
generally inserted through a blood vessel in the leg or arm and
threaded through vessels to the blocked artery.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's just the Roto-Rooter,'' Philbin said. ''It's quicker
and safer,'' than angioplasty, which involves a small inflatable
balloon.
</P>
<P>
   Philbin said he'd kept the procedure quiet because he didn't
want to worry anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said, 'What am I going to call everybody? ... (Walt Disney
Co. Chairman) Michael Eisner would be jumping out a window. I don't
want to do that to him, so I just had it done.''
</P>

   Disney owns ABC, which has enjoyed a major boost from
''Millionaire's'' high ratings.

<HEADLINE> Study: Beer Taxes Reduce STD Rates  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID PITT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Cheap beer is a leading contributor to the spread
of sexually transmitted diseases, according to a government report
that says raising the tax on a six-pack by 20 cents could reduce
gonorrhea by up to 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study, released
Thursday, compared changes in gonorrhea rates to changes in alcohol
policy in all states from 1981 to 1995. In years following beer tax
increases, gonorrhea rates usually dropped among young people. The
same happened when the drinking age went up -- as it did in many
states during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ''Alcohol has been linked to risky sexual behavior among youth.
It influences a person's judgment and they are more likely to have
sex without a condom, with multiple partners or with high-risk
partners,'' said Harrell Chesson, a health economist with the CDC.
</P>
<P>
   Beer industry lobbyists, however, said recent statistics show
young people are already drinking more responsibly, thanks in part
to efforts by brewers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Excise taxes have little or nothing to do with alcohol abuse
in society,'' said Lori Levy of The Beer Institute in Washington.
''I think that our members understand the importance of educating
young people about how to make responsible choices once they're old
enough and they put a lot of money and effort into those
programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonorrhea, one of the most common venereal diseases, was
examined in the CDC study because long-term statistics are
available and the disease is more evenly spread among states.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC analyzed the drops in gonorrhea rates following
different tax increases and came up with the estimate that 20-cent
increase per six-pack would lead to a 9 percent drop in gonorrhea
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Chesson cited the example of a 16-cent per gallon -- about 9
cents per six-pack -- tax increase in California in 1991. Gonorrhea
rates in the 15 to 19 age group dropped about 30 percent the
following year. Drops in other states were not as dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   During the study, various states raised beer taxes 36 times.
Gonorrhea rates among in the 15 to 19 age group dropped in 24 of
those instances, and rates among those 20 to 24 dropped 26 times.
</P>
<P>
   In both age groups, men seem to be more affected than women by
higher beer prices.
</P>
<P>
   Most minimum legal drinking age increases were also followed by
a decrease in the gonorrhea rate, especially in the 15 to 19 age
group.
</P>
<P>
   ''This study suggests these strategies could have a significant
impact in reducing sexually transmitted diseases among young
people,'' said Dr. Kathleen Irwin, chief of health services
research and evaluation for the CDC's division of sexually
transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
   About 3 million teen-agers are infected with sexually
transmitted diseases each year, Chesson said. Gonorrhea usually can
be treated with antibiotics, although some drug-resistant strains
have been developed.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Up 143; Dow Down 57  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks regained leadership of the
stock market Thursday, rising sharply and helping blue-chip names
shake off a pair of economic reports that suggested more
interest-rate increases are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index rose 143.94 to close at 3,774.03.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which fell as much as 197
points in early trading, pared its loss to just 57.40, closing at
10,888.10.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mostly higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 rose 3.93 to 1,464.92.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications stocks led the Nasdaq's advance after posting
strong corporate earnings reports. MCI WorldCom rose 4{ to 45]
after announcing it beat Wall Street's first-quarter earnings
expectations by 1 cent a share. The telecom company saw net income
soar to $1.3 billion from $730 million a year ago on surging data
and Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless communications company Nextel narrowed its
first-quarter loss and rose 8 5/16 to 112 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, AT&AMP;T's wireless business made a successful, if
modest, debut in trading on the New York Stock Exchange, rising
from an offering price of 29{ to 31 15/16. The tracking stock,
which reflects just one segment of AT&AMP;T's operations, is the
largest initial public offering in history, with 360 million shares
valued at a total of $10.26 billion.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T itself fell 3 to 48.
</P>
<P>
   A wide range of large-capitalization technology stocks rose.
Qualcomm gained 6\ to 103{ and Applied Materials rose 9~ to 100
5/16.
</P>
<P>
   The strength in telecom and technology helped the broad market
recover from initial weakness in the wake of government reports on
the gross domestic product and the Employment Cost Index. Many on
Wall Street had been fearful that one or both would show that the
economy was growing much too fast for the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   The reports confirmed that the economy is on a tear. The gross
domestic product grew at a 5.4 percent annual rate during the first
three months of 2000, the Commerce Department said. But many
economists had anticipated a 6 percent growth rate.
</P>
<P>
   The more troubling statistic to inflation-wary traders: the
Employment Cost Index. In the first quarter, the index rose 1.4
percent, the biggest quarterly advance in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Economists fear rising wage pressures will stimulate inflation,
prompting more and steeper interest rate increases by the Fed.
Higher interest rates are generally bad for stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ''The economy is not showing the signs of slowing that the Fed
is looking for, and investors are correct to be concerned about
that,'' said Eric Wiegand, director of the private client group at
Warburg Pincus.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which are most sensitive to inflation, led the
Dow lower. Citigroup slipped 27/32 to 61{ and J.P. Morgan fell 3
3/16 to 131].
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's ability to shrug off the inflation reports provided
the most conclusive sign to date that the technology sector has
stabilized, said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime
Charter Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Nasdaq has been trying to hammer out a bottom,'' he said.
''The fact that it was able to rally despite some bad news on the
economic front tells me that it's finally found one.''
</P>
<P>
   Massive selloffs earlier this month knocked the Nasdaq as much
as 34 percent below its March 10 record of 5,048.62. The last
crushing selloff came on Monday, when the Nasdaq shed 161 points.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's purge may have been the last for a while, Bleier
argued.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is that a lot of Nasdaq stocks have been
crushed,'' he said. ''It will be a more selective environment going
forward, but many stocks will do very well.''
</P>
<P>
   With Thursday's gains, the Nasdaq is about 25 percent below its
peak and 7 percent below its level at the start of 2000. But since
last April 27, the Nasdaq has risen 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange Thursday, declining issues
outnumbered advancers by an 11-to-9 margin. Volume totaled 1.31
billion shares, compared with 1.21 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 10.34 to
494.58.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.6 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index fell 2.3 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
lost 1.2 percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 2.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Senators Attack Pension Provision  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators from both parties are attacking a
provision tucked into a bankruptcy bill passed by the Senate that
would allow credit card companies to take some bankrupt consumers'
retirement assets to pay off debts.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department also opposes the provision, drafted by Sen.
Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, the key author of the bill overhauling
bankruptcy laws that cleared the Senate overwhelmingly in February.
Grassley was seeking to prevent wealthy debtors who file for
bankruptcy protection from shifting their assets into protected
retirement accounts to escape repaying debts, his aides say.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sen. Grassley's position is that it is wrong to let a
big-spending debtor who has declared bankruptcy stick it to the
little guy by stashing millions of dollars in a retirement account
to avoid paying (his) fair share,'' they said in a statement
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say his provision would encourage credit card
companies, banks and retail businesses to put into the fine print
of agreements waivers under which consumers would forfeit
protection of their pensions and other retirement assets in the
event of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The provision would permit boilerplate language to be inserted
into credit card applications, requiring individuals to sign over
their pensions in bankruptcy,'' Sen. Jim Jeffords, R-Vt., chairman
of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions,
said at a hearing on April 13.
</P>
<P>
   ''I fear that many individuals will sign away their pensions
unknowingly. Even for knowledgable consumers, the cost of applying
for a credit card should not be one's retirement security,''
Jeffords warned.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., who has consistently criticized
the overall bankruptcy bill, said in a statement: ''This harsh
provision would give a further unfair advantage to the credit card
industry. ... Our priority in Congress should be to strengthen the
employees' pensions, not undermine them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a member of the Senate Banking
Committee who supports bankruptcy overhaul in principle but voted
against the legislation, said he strongly opposes Grassley's
provision. It would especially hurt seniors ''struggling to provide
for themselves,'' he maintained.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, has written a letter to Grassley criticizing the
provision, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Labor Department figures, most retired workers get
annual pension benefits of less than $7,000, while most employees
have balances in their 401(k) retirement investment accounts of
less than $15,000 and total retirement savings of under $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill and a similar measure passed by the House last
year, also by a veto-proof margin, would make it harder for people
to sweep away credit card and other debts through bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   They apply new standards for determining whether people filing
for bankruptcy should be forced to repay their debts under a
court-approved reorganization plan instead of having them
dissolved.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation has been pushed for several years by the banking
industry, credit card companies and retail-business industry, which
have spent millions of dollars in lobbying Congress.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate negotiators must meld the two bills into one
measure to be approved by both chambers and sent to President
Clinton. The two versions are fairly similar but negotiations
appear to have stalled over whether to remove a Senate provision to
raise the $5.15 hourly minimum wage to $6.15 over three years and
give billions in new tax breaks to small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, which supports rewriting the
bankruptcy laws in principle, has criticized both versions because
it believes they are too hard on debtors. The White House also
opposes the business tax breaks and wants to see the minimum wage
increase over a shorter period of time.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Labor Department has criticized the Senate provision
related to retirement assets.
</P>
<P>
   If it is adopted, creditors could treat a consumer's retirement
savings, ''which may have been accumulated over decades ..., as
security against the debtor becoming bankrupt,'' Leslie Kramerich,
an assistant labor secretary, said at the hearing held by Jeffords.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Fall on Inflation Fears  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The price of 30-year Treasury bonds fell
Thursday as traders reacted to two strong economic reports that
again put the spotlight on inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark bond slipped 19/32 point, or $5.94 per $1,000 in
face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose
to 5.98 percent from 5.94 percent Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Traders responded to a Labor Department report that wages and
benefits for American workers climbed by 4.3 percent during the 12
months ending in March, the sharpest advance in eight years. In
addition, the Commerce Department said the U.S. economy, propelled
by the biggest jump in consumer spending in nearly 17 years, grew
at a 5.4 percent annual rate during the first three months of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   That news reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will
raise interest rates at its May 16 meeting to hold down inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Both rising interest rates and rising inflation hurt investments
like bonds, which pay a fixed return.
</P>
<P>
   Losses might even have been greater, except for the Treasury
Department's repurchase of an additional $3 billion repurchase of
national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury on Thursday bought back 24 issues of 30-year bonds
maturing between February 2015 and August 2025. The bonds carried
yields ranging from 6.250 percent to 11.250 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the broader bond market, prices of short-term notes fell
between \ point and 5/16 point, while intermediate notes fell 15/32
to 11/16, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information
service.
</P>
<P>
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.73 percent as the
discount fell 0.01 percentage point from Wednesday to 5.58 percent.
Six-month yields were 6.05 as the discount rate rose 0.05 point to
5.80 percent. One-year yields were 6.13 percent as the discount
rose 0.03 percentage point to 5.83 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the
discount is the interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, remained unchanged at 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell 13/32 point to 94 5/16. The average
yield to rose to 6.01 percent from 5.98 percent on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Italy's New Leader Seeks Support  </HEADLINE>
By ELLEN KNICKMEYER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Italy's new premier courted an unenthusiastic
Parliament on Thursday, saying his stopgap center-left coalition
would concentrate on electoral reforms if lawmakers let it serve
out the 11 months until general elections.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Giuliano Amato outlined the aims of his 2-day-old
government to the Chamber of Deputies, where a vote of confidence
on Friday will determine whether his unstable, eight-party
coalition gets a chance to see the plans through.
</P>
<P>
   ''A little legislation and a lot of action, results: That's what
we want to do in the little time available,'' the 61-year-old
political veteran told the 630-seat lower house.
</P>
<P>
   Amato needs 50 percent of the vote, plus one -- 316 votes,
assuming there is a full house Friday. His prospects improved
Thursday when the wavering Green party decided to stick with the
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Bad news came later when a smaller party, the Republicans, said
it was leaning toward abstaining in the vote, threatening what for
Amato promised to be at best a few-vote margin of victory.
</P>
<P>
   Amato first served as premier for 10 months in the early 1990s,
earning respect for seeing through rigorous budget cuts at a time
when corruption scandals were pulling apart Italy's Cold War
political order.
</P>
<P>
   He was treasury minister under the 18-month government of former
Communist Massimo D'Alema, who resigned when forces allied with
conservative media magnate Silvio Berlusconi triumphed in April 16
regional elections.
</P>
<P>
   The center-left turned to Amato to put together a new
government. He came up with a reshuffled version of the old one,
which was divided by squabbles over Cabinet seats and held together
chiefly by the desire to stave off Berlusconi's demand for
immediate general elections.
</P>
<P>
   The center-left has argued it must stay in power to see through
electoral reforms, particularly a May referendum that would do away
with a proportional allotment system credited with giving Italy's
many tiny parties undue influence.
</P>
<P>
   Amato's introductory speech stressed the electoral reforms, but
drew some of the warmest response when he rejected links between
immigration and crime -- saying his own uncle was no criminal when
he went to America to look for work.
</P>
<P>
   In foreign policy, he said he would push for an Italian seat on
the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   He pledged to work for more flexibility in the labor market to
fight unemployment, telling lawmakers: ''We need to take the hand
brake off the Italian economy.''
</P>
<P>
   That and his promises to fight crime followed much the same line
as Berlusconi's conservatives. Berlusconi said the ideas sounded
less than fresh to his own ears.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we expected thunderbolts, we were struck by boredom
instead,'' the TV mogul said after Amato's speech.

<HEADLINE> Doctors Say Giuliani Likely OK  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN MATTHEWS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Doctors said Thursday that if Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's prostate cancer was detected early he has a good
prognosis and the treatment should not keep him from continuing his
Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''Formerly most patients had prostate cancer which invaded or
extended beyond the prostate gland itself,'' said Dr. Steven
Carabell, chief of radiation oncology at Catholic Medical Centers
of Brooklyn and Queens. ''Now in most patients it is detected while
the cancer is still limited to the prostate gland and has not
spread.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said his cancer was diagnosed at an early stage. He
said he had not decided on a course of treatment and did not know
how it would affect his Senate campaign against Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer of the prostate, a gland involved in semen production, is
the second-most common type of cancer in American men, behind skin
cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates that 180,400 American
men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2000 and 31,900 will
die of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Prostate cancer spreads slowly in elderly men, and their doctors
often recommend leaving the cancer untreated as the men are likely
to die of other ailments.
</P>
<P>
   But a man of Giuliani's age, 55, will likely be advised to
choose between surgery to remove the cancerous prostate and
radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harmon Eyre, chief medical officer of the cancer society,
said both treatments are about equally successful, with five-year
survival rates of more than 90 percent. And neither course of
treatment should keep the mayor out of commission for longer than a
few weeks, the doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   There are two main types of radiation therapy for prostate
cancer: external beam radiation, in which high-energy X-rays are
aimed at the prostate gland in a series of treatments over several
weeks, and the implantation of radioactive ''seeds'' directly in
the prostate.

<HEADLINE> Papers Look At Vietnam War Policy  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- On the morning of Oct. 22, 1972, Henry
Kissinger believed he had achieved a breakthrough agreement to end
the Vietnam War. By the end of the day, South Vietnam's leader was
accusing him of conniving with the Soviets and Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   National Security Council files made public Thursday, 25 years
after the war's end, include previously top secret government
cables that trace Kissinger's agonizing quest to get South
Vietnamese agreement for a peace accord with the North Vietnamese
communists 2 1/2 years before the fall of Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   The documents are among 130,000 pages from the Nixon presidency
released by the National Archives. Most deal with foreign policy
matters.
</P>
<P>
   One cable, with some portions still blacked out, reports that
Laotian Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma had ''concluded the North
Vietnamese have accepted that they have lost and are willing to
surrender.''
</P>
<P>
   The cable was dated four days before Kissinger, then the
president's national security chief, declared to the world that
''peace is at hand.'' Negotiations later collapsed, and the war
went on. The United States withdrew its forces in 1973 and the
South Vietnamese surrendered on April 30, 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Souvanna, who had remained neutral in the war, was described as
elated by the prospect of peace and hopeful that the North
Vietnamese would not try to gain more Laotian territory.
</P>
<P>
   Cables to Washington from Kissinger and U.S. Ambassador
Ellsworth Bunker, all on Oct. 22, document the up-and-down course
of the talks with South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu.
</P>
<P>
   Bunker reported that Thieu began the day's meetings in ''a
highly emotional state,'' accusing Kissinger and embassy personnel
of leaking statements concerning the peace proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thieu's attitude became more relaxed as we examined the
alternatives before us,'' Bunker cabled. ''We (Bunker and
Kissinger) both left with the impression we had finally made a
breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaction from Laos, Thailand and Cambodia was all optimistic,
Bunker said in other cables.
</P>
<P>
   But in a later message, after an evening meeting with Thieu,
Bunker said Thieu declared he was being sacrificed.
</P>
<P>
   Thieu was quoted as telling Kissinger he thought the United
States had connived with the Soviet Union and China. He was
concerned about North Vietnamese who would remain in the South
under the proposed peace. ''The South Vietnamese people will assume
that we have been sold out by the U.S. and that North Vietnam has
won the war.''
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger told Thieu he resented the charge that he was in
collusion with the Soviet Union and China.
</P>
<P>
   The cable said that just before his return to Washington,
Kissinger saw Thieu again briefly and told him he considered his
course ''suicidal for him and for his country.''

on six-month certificates of deposit, unchanged from the previous
week. Yields were 5.33 percent on 1-year CDs, down from 5.34
percent; 5.62 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 5.64 percent; and
5.99 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 6.00 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- The Detroit Lions re-signed defensive end
Travis Kirschke and offensive linemen Tony Ramirez, Juan Roque and
Eric Beverly on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, Roque and Kirschke were unrestricted free agents, while
Beverly was an exclusive rights free agent. Each has played three
seasons with Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions also signed wide receiver Andre Rone and claimed wide
receiver Tim Alexander off waivers.
</P>
<P>
   Contract terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Rone was on Detroit's practice squad the first two weeks of the
1999 season before being released Sept. 17. He joined the Lions
after playing earlier last year for the Berlin Thunder of NFL
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, selected by Washington in the seventh round of the
1999 draft, was released Sept. 2 by the Redskins after training

By MATT MOORE, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- MCI WorldCom, riding the performance of
its Internet, data and international operations, reported
first-quarter earnings nearly double from a year ago and slightly
ahead of Wall Street estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's second biggest long-distance phone company said
Thursday it earned $1.3 billion, or 44 cents per share in the first
three months of 2000. That compared with earnings of $730 million,
or 24 cents per share, during the same period in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   After the report, MCI WorldCom's stock gained more than 11
percent to end the day at $45.37{, up $4.50, on the Nasdaq Stock
Market. Wall Street analysts had expected earnings of 43 cents a
share for the quarter, according to a survey by First Call/Thomson
Financial.
</P>
<P>
   First-quarter revenues rose to $9.15 billion, compared to $8.03
billion a year ago, excluding Embratel, a Brazilian phone company
part-owned by MCI WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   ''The revenue was a little bit better than expected and really
strong on the Internet side,'' said Ramkrishna Kasargod, an analyst
with Morgan Keegan &AMP; Co. in Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Data, Internet and international revenues grew a combined 32
percent to $4.6 billion, accounting for about half of the total.
</P>
<P>
   Like many phone companies grappling with falling rates in local
and long-distance services, MCI WorldCom has been placing a greater
emphasis on faster-growing, higher-margin areas such as providing
network and Web services for businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the company launched a new initiative --
dubbed ''generation d'' -- to provide one-stop shopping for
businesses needing services including Web site hosting, design and
domain registration.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts and reporters, Vice Chairman
John Sidgmore said revenue from Internet operations will increase
in the coming months with the renewal of a contract to carry
network traffic for America Online. Sidgmore also said the deal
could lead to more opportunities after AOL merges with Time Warner.

<HEADLINE> Tigers, ChiSox Players Penalized  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- In what is believed to be the harshest penalty
for a brawl in baseball history, 16 members of the Detroit Tigers
and Chicago White Sox were suspended Thursday for a total of 82
games.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're trying to set an example for the rest of the league,''
White Sox manager Ron Schueler said. ''I think it will. I think
you're going to see around the league a little more reluctance to
start fights or get involved with them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I respect the decision,'' he said. ''Don't necessarily agree
with it, but I respect it.''
</P>
<P>
   Managers Phil Garner of Detroit and Jerry Manuel of the White
Sox were suspended for eight games each for Saturday's two fights
at Comiskey Park. Tigers coach Juan Samuel must sit out 15 for
throwing punches.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit third baseman Dean Palmer, who charged the mound after
being hit by Jim Parque in the first fight, was suspended for eight
games. Parque got a three-game suspension. Chicago outfielder
Magglio Ordonez was suspended for five.
</P>
<P>
   White Sox reliever Keith Foulke, who got the worst of the brawl,
needing five stitches to close a cut under his left eye, was
suspended for three games.
</P>
<P>
   There were 25 people fined -- including the 16 who also received
suspensions -- ranging from $3,000 for Palmer to $500 for Detroit
pitchers Danny Patterson and Jim Poole.
</P>
<P>
   ''We researched this as best we could, and we think this is the
largest mass suspension ever,'' baseball spokesman Rich Levin said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, fights at Kansas City and Yankee Stadium resulted in
multiple suspensions. Five players, including Orioles pitcher
Armando Benitez, were suspended for a total of 18 games after a
wild brawl against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, nine players and both managers were suspended
for a total of 38 games after the Anaheim Angels brawled with the
Kansas City Royals.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's penalties were the first ones issued by Frank
Robinson, baseball's vice president of on-field operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Major league baseball wants to send a message ... that
participation in these sorts of incidents will be handled in a
swift and serious manner,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Altercations like the one that took place in Chicago last week
show a lack of sportsmanship,'' Robinson said. ''It sends the wrong
message to our fans -- particularly young people. Fighting is not an
acceptable part of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Deciding discipline became his responsibility when commissioner
Bud Selig dissolved the president's office in the AL and NL.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't expect that harsh of a treatment, I guess you could
say,'' Manuel said. ''Frank Robinson is a baseball man who I have
great respect for. I can't dispute his decisions one way or the
other.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't agree with it, but I won't dispute it.''
</P>
<P>
   The penalties came a day before the White Sox were to start a
series in Detroit. The suspensions will be staggered from Friday
night through May 10 because of the number of players involved.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the players already said they will appeal, and the
penalties would not take effect until appeals have been heard.
</P>
<P>
   ''All you can ask for is consistent and equal penalties,''
Detroit general manager Randy Smith said. ''I think he made every
effort to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   White Sox reliever Bob Howry and outfielder Carlos Lee said
their three-game suspensions are scheduled to begin Friday. Both
plan to serve them. Ordonez, who said his suspension is to begin
May 1, wants to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Though the suspensions dredge up the bad feelings from the brawl
all over again, the White Sox said they don't anticipate problems
in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had some concerns about the severity of it. And more so
about the severity for the other club,'' Schueler said. ''After
that, it was another war rally, 'Let's go get 'em.' We've got a
good bunch of kids in that clubhouse. I think tomorrow you'll see
them come out playing hard again.''
</P>
<P>
   Some White Sox were upset, though, that Detroit starter Jeff
Weaver wasn't suspended. Weaver started the bad blood by plunking
Lee in the sixth inning. He was done pitching and had his uniform
jersey off when the fighting began, but he came back out onto the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver was fined $750.
</P>
<P>
   ''For throwing at Carlos, maybe not,'' Howry said. ''The fact he
comes back on the field and the tapes show him fighting with
Magglio, yeah, he probably should have gotten something.''
</P>
<P>
   The other Tigers suspended were: pitcher Doug Brocail (four
games); outfielder Juan Encarnacion (three games); catcher-DH
Robert Fick (five games); outfielder Karim Garcia (three games);
outfielder Bobby Higginson (five games); and outfielder Luis
Polonia (three games).
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, since sent Triple-A Toledo, would begin serving his
penalty if he is recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The other White Sox player suspended was pitcher Tanyon Sturtze
(three games).
</P>
<P>
   Eleven people were ejected Saturday and the benches emptied
twice -- first for 13 minutes in the seventh inning and then a
second time for eight minutes in the ninth after two more Tigers
batters were hit.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer charged the mound in the seventh and was ejected
following a rumble that started in the infield and spread to right
field. Parque hit Palmer one inning after Weaver had plunked Lee,
prompting an angry staredown.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, even though he'd been tossed, returned to the field when
a second brawl erupted in the ninth, moments after Howry hit Shane
Halter with a pitch. Earlier in the same inning, Sturtze hit
Detroit's Deivi Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we'll see anything else this weekend,'' White
Sox reliever Bill Simas said. ''If guys couldn't take care of what
they needed to during the three games last weekend, then where were
they?''

<HEADLINE> UK, Zimbabwe Meeting Yields Little  </HEADLINE>
By MARA D. BELLABY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- British and Zimbabwean officials on Thursday
failed to reach agreement on ending deadly clashes between black
squatters and white farmers in the African nation, prompting
Britain to withhold land reform aid.
</P>
<P>
   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, weary and clearly
frustrated by the talks with a visiting Zimbabwean delegation, told
reporters that Britain would freeze $57 million earmarked for land
reform until Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, halts the
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''I made it clear we could not take any of these steps against a
background of occupations and violence,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   Seven people have been killed in the former British colony since
armed black squatters began occupying white-owned farms in
February.
</P>
<P>
   ''An end to the violence and the occupations is the essential
next step,'' Cook said. ''In the event that these conditions are
met, we are willing to enter into dialogue and discussions with the
government of Zimbabwe on how to take forward our commitment to
fund land reform.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Zimbabwe delegation, which held a separate briefing at
the Zimbabwe High Commission after the talks concluded, said it did
not accept the conditions set by Britain.
</P>
<P>
   While giving assurances that Zimbabwe was working to solve
resolve the dispute, the delegation head, Minister John Nkomo, said
''the problems we have at home'' were not legitimate reasons for
Britain to hold up the funding, which was originally agreed to in
1998. Britain later blocked release of the funds after claiming
that the land was being distributed to Mugabe's cronies and not to
poor, black Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a real problem which we did not create, which we must
resolve,'' Nkomo said.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has said it would provide $57 million to give blacks a
chance to own some of their nation's most productive farmland. Cook
also said that he would help organize funding from the
international community.
</P>
<P>
   But Cook reiterated Britain's demands that the land reform be
fair and that Zimbabwe prove its commitment to free democratic
elections first.
</P>
<P>
   The Zimbabwe delegation said the demand for free elections --
expected in May -- has already been met.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our response was in fact that the process is on,'' said Nkomo.
''Our commitment to the holding of elections in accordance with the
constitution is unquestioned.''
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe's opponents have charged that the forcible occupations --
supported the president -- are designed to boost his lagging
popularity before the parliamentary elections and intimidate the
opposition Movement for Democratic Change. The farmers and black
activists who have been killed in recent weeks have had connections
to the opposition party.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Zimbabwe police announced sweeping new powers to
curb political activity, a move they said was necessary to stop the
political violence.

   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- New Jersey Nets forward Scott
Burrell had surgery on his left knee and left hand Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Burrell, a reserve who averaged 6.1 points and 3.5 rebounds in
74 games, underwent arthroscopic surgery on his knee to remove torn
cartilage and loose particles. The hand surgery was performed on
the fourth finger to repair ligament damage.
</P>
<P>
   Both surgeries were performed at Beth Israel North Hospital in
New York City, general manager John Nash said.
</P>
<P>
   Burrell, a seven-year veteran, will be a free agent this summer.

<HEADLINE> Sens.: USDA Needs Power Over Mergers  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Agriculture Department should be allowed
to challenge mergers between companies that process meat and grain
or sell seed and other supplies to growers, some farm state
senators said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department hasn't done enough to slow down a wave of
mergers and acquisitions that some producers blame for a downturn
in commodity prices during the late 1990s, the lawmakers said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have an obligation to act. Current laws are not working,''
Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., said during a Senate Agriculture
Committee hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Bills introduced by Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Senate
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., would allow USDA to block
agribusiness mergers or to force the divestiture of assets and give
the department more authority to regulate the business practices of
food and agriculture companies.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is given little chance of passing this year, and
economists say that worldwide overproduction of grain, not
agribusiness consolidation, caused the fall in commodity prices. In
fact, beef and pork prices have rebounded in recent months as
demand has increased. Beef and pork processing are among the most
highly concentrated segments of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Mergers allow companies to cut costs and get the capital it
takes for expansion, said David C. Nelson, an industry analyst with
CS First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ''Essentially, we have too many companies fighting for too few
profits. Agribusiness will not attract the capital it needs to make
the investments farmers say they want until profitability
improves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has not taken a position on the
bills, although Justice Department officials have previously said
that existing antitrust laws are adequate to protect the interests
of farmers and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our antitrust laws have stood the test of time,'' said John
Nannes, deputy assistant attorney general for the department's
antitrust division.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the department has blocked a merger between
the two biggest cotton seed producers but allowed other
acquisitions to go through, although sometimes requiring companies
to sell off some assets.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most recent mergers: Smithfield Foods Inc., the
world's largest hog producer and processor, acquired No. 2 producer
Murphy Family Farms, and Cargill Inc., North America's
second-largest grain trader, bought the grain operations of No. 5
Continental Grain. Cargill and Continental were required by Justice
to sell some of their facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted overwhelmingly last fall against imposing an
18-month moratorium on agribusiness mergers. However, the
consolidation in the industry is a major issue with many farm
groups, and in an election year, farm state lawmakers say they are
determined to keep the heat on Congress and the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an uphill climb this year, but that doesn't keep us from
raising Cain,'' said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont.

<HEADLINE> Albert Pirro alleges campaign to derail DA's career  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- District Attorney Jeanine Pirro's
husband said Thursday that a new allegation in his tax fraud case,
focusing on his wife, is part of a federal campaign to smear her
and ''derail her career.''
</P>
<P>
   'Everybody knows that my wife could have been and should have
been a statewide candidate for political office by now,'' Albert
Pirro said at a news conference. ''The only thing that has held her
back is the fact that her husband ... has been subjected to
constant spotlight, scrutiny and criticism for business
transactions.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White had no comment, spokesman Herb
Haddad said.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Pirro, one of the state's top lobbyists and a major
Republican fund-raiser, spoke the day after prosecutors alleged
that a loan taken out by Jeanine Pirro in 1993, ostensibly to buy a
$40,000 Mercedes, was ''an empty financial transaction, a sham''
used by her husband to cover up tax fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Pirro, Westchester County's biggest vote-getter, a national
TV commentator and a veteran of People magazine's ''50 Most
Beautiful People'' list, will not comment until the case is
concluded, said spokeswoman Anne Marie Corbalis.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney has never been charged in the case. It
alleges that her husband and his brother Anthony, who was Pirro's
accountant, conspired to hide about $1 million in Albert Pirro's
income by masking personal expenses as business deductions. Pirro
says he has paid all the back taxes and blames his brother for bad
tax returns. His brother blames him.
</P>
<P>
   Though the indictment alleges that many of the expenses were
family-oriented, like vacations, baby sitters, toys and veterinary
expenses, the alleged loan arrangement is the closest connection so
far between the district attorney and her husband's tax case.
</P>
<P>
   ''These allegations are totally nonsense,'' Albert Pirro said
Thursday. Prosecutors are ''trying to create ... artificial issues
to inflame and influence the jury,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jury selection is scheduled to begin Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Pirro's lead attorney, Gustave Newman, said in court Thursday
that he would not be arguing that Pirro was a victim of ''selective
prosecution.'' But Pirro said later that ''the motives in this case
will be coming out and will be issues in this trial.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the defense has information that federal agents
pressured witnesses into testifying by threatening to prosecute
them ''in the event that they do not cooperate with the point of
view that the agents were proferring.''
</P>
<P>
   The new court papers say that Albert Pirro, in the name of one
of his many companies, leased a 1989 Mercedes-Benz for his wife in
late 1988. The lease payments were fraudulently deducted as
business expenses through 1992, although the car was used by Mrs.
Pirro, then a county judge, ''for personal purposes,'' the papers
say.
</P>
<P>
   By late 1992, she was considering a run for district attorney
and Albert Pirro, ''anticipating that the car might become an issue
in the upcoming campaign,'' tried to make it look as if Mrs. Pirro
had purchased the car, the court papers allege.
</P>
<P>
   She took out a $41,000 loan in January 1993 and paid her
husband's company $39,470 from her personal account. However, the
prosecution says, the company made the payments on Mrs. Pirro's
loan and paid it off entirely in November 1993, the month she was
elected district attorney. It then sold the car to a dealership for
$32,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''The loan taken by Jeanine Pirro was an empty financial
transaction, a sham intended to make it look like Jeanine Pirro had
purchased the vehicle ... and was responsible for the payments,''
the papers say.

<HEADLINE> Hypnosis May Reduce Pain in Surgery  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- People who were hypnotized while undergoing
surgery without a general anesthetic needed less pain medication,
left the operating room sooner and had more stable vital signs than
those who were not, according to a study in this week's issue of
The Lancet medical journal.
</P>
<P>
   Trance states have been used for hundreds of years by both witch
doctors and modern surgeons to help sick people. But there had been
little scientific evidence that hypnosis really works to reduce
pain during surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite how long hypnosis as been around and the dramatic
effects it has shown, there are very few properly designed clinical
studies that demonstrate that it is more than a placebo,'' said
David R. Patterson, professor of rehabilitation medicine, surgery
and psychology at the University of Washington in Seattle, who was
not connected with the study.
</P>
<P>
   ''This really solidifies the evidence,'' he said. ''For acute
pain ... it's not arguable any more.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, led by Dr. Elvira Lang of Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center in Boston, involved 241 people of similar health and
age who had operations to open clogged arteries and veins, relieve
blockages in the kidney drainage system or block blood vessels
feeding tumors.
</P>
<P>
   The patients were divided into three groups -- one that
experienced normal interactions with doctors and nurses, another
that received extra attention from an additional person in the
operating room who made sure nobody said anything negative and a
third who were helped to hypnotize themselves.
</P>
<P>
   All the patients were able to give themselves as much pain
medication as they wanted through an intravenous tube.
</P>
<P>
   The hypnosis group -- who were guided through visualizations of
scenarios they found pleasant -- fared best, but the patients
receiving extra attention also benefited.
</P>
<P>
   About half the patients in those two groups needed no drugs at
all, while the rest gave themselves only half the amount of
medication as those undergoing the operation with no special
attention.
</P>
<P>
   The hypnotized patients were the only ones who said the pain did
not get worse as the surgery progressed. They also had fewer
problems with their blood pressure and heart rate during the
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Their operations also finished 17 minutes earlier than those
conducted without the patients receiving special attention.
</P>
<P>
   Lang suggested that time was saved in these operations because
the surgeon's attention was diverted less often by events such as
the patient being oversedated, unstable blood pressure or vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people have talked about it, but no one's going to
take hypnosis seriously in this arena unless it's shown to work,''
said Michael Nash, editor of the International Journal of Clinical
and Experimental Hypnosis. ''This is a breakthrough study that
moves beyond mere anecdote and actually demonstrates not only a
benefit but also a cost saving.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marie-Elisabeth Faymonville, an anesthesiologist at the
University of Liege in Belgium who has conducted similar research,
said she did not consider the new study to be groundbreaking.
</P>
<P>
   But she added that as the largest study to date on the issue, it
provides important confirmation of the benefit of hypnosis in
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The study was funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health.

DERBY FAVORITE PUTS ON EARLY MORNING SHOW
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus, the likely favorite for the May 6 Kentucky
Derby, turned a routine morning jog into a spectacle Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   While being led off the track just near the clockers' stand, the
son of Mr. Prospector reared on his back feet and tossed exercise
rider Nuno Santos. Losing his balance, the three-year-old colt fell
to the racetrack on his backside and rolled ov er. He came to his
feet, somewhat ''startled'' according to his trainer Neil Drysdale,
who led the colt off the track.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The goal of wiping out polio worldwide is within
reach but trouble spots still exist, the government said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Substantial progress has been reported in all World Health
Organization regions since 1988, the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention said.
</P>
<P>
   The Western Pacific Region is expected to be declared polio-free
this year. The American region was the first in 1994. A region must
have no polio cases found for at least three years to be declared
free of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   The World Health Assembly resolved in 1988 to wipe out polio
worldwide by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC said the number of known or suspected countries
originating polio cases decreased from 50 to 30 from 1998-1999.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC said occurrences remain high in northern India and
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   Significant decreases were recorded in the eastern Mediterranean
Region and Southeast Asian Region in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Polio circulation in the African Region is confined largely to
the Horn of Africa and western and central Africa.

<HEADLINE> Squabbling Endanger Barak's Gov't  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A long-running dispute between two members of
Israel's coalition government escalated Thursday, endangering Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's efforts to make peace with the Palestinians
and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The dovish, secular Meretz party announced it would bolt from
the coalition rather than hand government funds to the
ultra-Orthodox Shas party to run its corrupt and debt-ridden school
system.
</P>
<P>
   Meretz leader Yossi Sarid, who is Israel's education minister,
has refused to turn over administration of the Shas education
system to his deputy minister Meshulam Nahari, who is from the Shas
party.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has indicated that he will rule in favor of Shas in the
dispute, according to Israeli media.
</P>
<P>
   Barak needs the support of Shas, the third largest faction in
the parliament, to assure a majority in favor of peace deals he
hopes to make with Syria and the Palestinians, including deep
territorial concessions in the Golan Heights and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   That has opened the way for Shas to make a series of escalating
demands on Barak, especially money for its school system. Barak has
appealed to Meretz to swallow the pill for the sake of the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   Meretz refuses, charging that Shas must not be allowed to
supervise a system that it has already mismanaged. ''We will not
write a corrupt check ... and it will not come from our
government,'' said Trade Minister Ran Cohen of Meretz.
</P>
<P>
   Sarid said if Meretz quits the government over the Shas crisis,
it would stay in the coalition for a limited period of time to give
Barak a chance to achieve peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Shas say that its voters are mostly hawkish opponents
of concessions to the Arabs, and the 17 members of the Shas
parliament faction would vote against peace deals even if their
demands are met.
</P>
<P>
   Shas leader Eli Ishai said votes on peace issues would not be
connected to other matters. He said the party would vote according
to the rulings of its Council of Torah Sages, headed by Rabbi
Ovadia Yosef, the spiritual leader of the party.
</P>
<P>
   If Meretz, with ten seats in parliament, quit Barak's
government, he would still command a majority in the house. If Shas
pulled out, another religious party might follow. Barak would be
hard pressed to muster a majority, and his government could fall.
</P>
<P>
   That could lead to new elections, delaying peace efforts for
many months.
</P>
<P>
   Barak was elected prime minister in May 1999, defeating
hard-liner Benjamin Netanyahu by a wide margin. But voters gave
Barak's One Israel bloc only 26 seats in the 120 seat parliament,
forcing him to form a motley coalition with parties representing
secularists, Orthodox Jews and immigrants.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Henry Rodriguez hit one of Chicago's four home
runs in the first inning and later had a grand slam as the Cubs
roughed up Jose Lima and the Houston Astros 12-3 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs tied a team record record set in 1930 with four homers
in an inning. Eric Young and Ricky Gutierrez began the game with
home runs, Rodriguez hit a two-run drive and Damon Buford's solo
shot made it 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez tagged Lima (1-4) for a grand slam into the upper deck
in right field for a 10-0 lead in the fourth. His fifth lifetime
slam gave him a career-high six RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Lima set a team record by allowing five home runs, and set
another by giving up four homers in the first inning. He gave up 12
runs and 13 hits in five innings and lost his fourth straight
start.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 46 home runs in 12 games at Enron Field this
season. Daryle Ward connected for the Astros, who have lost nine of
12 at their new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Lieber (2-2) pitched a five-hitter for the eighth complete
game of his career. He struck out seven and walked none.
</P>
<P>
   Young opened the game by lining a 2-0 fastball over the
left-field bleachers for his first homer. Gutierrez drove the next
pitch over the railroad tracks above left field.
</P>
<P>
   A single by Sammy Sosa set up Rodriguez's home run. Buford
connected with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Lieber retired the first 12 Astros batters. Ken Caminiti reached
on first baseman Mark Grace's error to lead off the fifth and Ward
followed with a home run.
</P>
<P>
   Grace had a two-run double.
Notes: The Cubs' four homers in one inning tied the club record
set May 12, 1930, against the New York Giants when Cliff Heathcote,
Hack Wilson, Charlie Grimm and Clyde Beck did it. ... Lima has
allowed 10 home runs, most in the major leagues. His ERA jumped
from 8.42 to 5.88. ... The Cubs went 3-6 on their road trip. ...
The Cubs have homered in 11 straight games. ... Rodriguez has 14
career multi-homer games. ... The Cubs outscored the Astros 32-22
in the three-game series.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Reformist Loses  </HEADLINE>
By LOUIS MEIXLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey's parliament failed to elect a
reformist president in the first round of voting Thursday in
humiliations for Prime Miinister Bulent Ecevit and the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit believed he had gained the promises of every party leader
in the legislature to support Ahmet Necdet Sezer, chief of the
constitutional court who has advocated democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't even consider the probability that Sezer won't be
elected,'' Ecevit said late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But parliament, which elects the chief of state, gave Sezer only
281 votes, instead of the 367, or two-thirds, of the 550 members,
needed for a first-round win. Nine other candidates split the
remaining votes, with the second highest vote getter, Nevzat
Yalcintas, netting just 61. The vote was by secret ballot.
</P>
<P>
   After Ecevit failed two weeks ago to get parliament to amend the
constitution to give President Suleyman Demirel another term, he
settled on Sezer as the ideal compromise candidate.
</P>
<P>
   As head of Turkey's top court and a supporter of constitutional
reforms, Sezer appealed to the European Union that has pressed for
changes so Turkey can join the group.
</P>
<P>
   Sezer also had also questioned the military's purge of officers
suspected of links with Islamic groups, which pleaed the Islamic
Virtue Party, which faces banning for challenging Turkey's secular
system.
</P>
<P>
   Sezer's views alarmed the military, which fears views political
Islam as a major threat to Turkey's secular state. The top generals
stayed away from a reception Sezer held this week.
</P>
<P>
   But the opposition of the military to Sezer appeals to the
European Union, which believes that Turkey's generals have had too
much say in poliitics. The army has seized power three times since
1960.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the first-round defeat for Sezer, Ecevit believes his
candidate will win in the next round or the one after that when
several candidates drop out.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is clear as of now that the results will be good for Mr.
Sezer,'' Ecevit said. ''I am very optimistic about the results.''
</P>
<P>
   The presidency in Turkey is a largely ceremonial post, but
presidents are often powerbrokers in times of crises and can exert
strong moral influence.

<HEADLINE> Janvrin Rallies for Decathlon Win  </HEADLINE>
By CHUCK SCHOFFNER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Kip Janvrin once again played the 1,500
meters as his trump card in the decathlon.
</P>
<P>
   After trailing the entire day, Janvrin ran away from the field
in the 1,500, the last event, to win the Drake Relays decathlon for
the sixth straight year and the 11th time overall.
</P>
<P>
   Janvrin, the track coach at Central Missouri State, finished the
two days of competition with 7,794 points. Kamau Sullivan, who
trained under Janvrin for two years, was second with 7,620.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan was in first place going into the 1,500 -- 102 points
ahead of Janvrin.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's my ace in the hole,'' Janvrin said. ''But I was concerned
at about 1,000 meters. He wasn't that far back. Then I put down the
hammer a little bit and moved away from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Janvrin, 34, needed to beat Sullivan by 16 seconds to win the
title. He ended up beating him by nearly 43 seconds to win the race
in 4 minutes, 22.78 seconds. Janvrin also sealed his Drake victory
last year with a strong performance in the 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm coming back to the field. The field's getting closer to
me,'' Janvrin said. ''I was lucky to win again.''
</P>
<P>
   Wichita State's Mellanee Welty won the heptathlon for the second
straight year with 5,365 points. First-day leader Barbara
Szlendakova of Iowa State was second with 5,315, a school record.
</P>
<P>
   Janvrin was in fourth place after the first event Thursday, the
110 hurdles, and trailed Sullivan by 206 points with three events
to go. But he finished ahead of Sullivan in the javelin and pole
vault and that put him within striking distance in the 1,500, which
he finished with a 61-second final lap.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've still got some good events,'' said Janvrin, who has
topped 8,000 points more often than any U.S. decathlete. ''I can
still do a lot of things I could before, obviously not as good as I
could, but to keep winning, that's really what it's all about.
</P>
<P>
   ''Taking home that watch, getting that victory and feeling the
excitement of when I cross the line knowing that I've won again,
having all my friends and family out here being a part of it,
that's why I keep coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Janvrin also won the pole vault and Sullivan was first in the
hurdles. Brad Swanson won the javelin and discus.
</P>
<P>
   Welty got the lead from Szlendakova in the heptathlon by beating
her in the long jump, the next to last event. Then she stayed close
enough to the Iowa State sophomore in the 800 to keep the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Szlendakova won that race in 2:19.90 and Welty ran 2:21.62. If
Szlendakova had run 3.7 seconds faster, she would have won the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a matter of guts,'' Welty said. ''I just had to stay
with her. I couldn't let her beat me by five or six seconds. I just
had to stay on her heels.''
</P>
<P>
   Welty closed the gap by winning the javelin, the first event of
the day, then got a break when Szlendakova did not do as well as
expected in the long jump. Szlendakova is capable of going past 20
feet in that event but went only 18-6. Welty jumped 18-7\.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once she didn't jump well, I knew I had a chance,'' Welty
said.

<HEADLINE> Panthers Release Tovar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE (AP) -- The Carolina Panthers released linebacker Steve
Tovar on Thursday, a day before the team begins its three-day
minicamp.
</P>
<P>
   Tovar, 30, played in all 16 games during last season for the
Panthers and started six at middle linebacker. The eight-year
veteran had 41 tackles, including nine on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   Tovar was signed by Carolina as a free agent from San Diego last
year. He was fined $7,500 by the NFL for a helmet-to-helmet hit on
Detroit quarterback Charlie Batch in October.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina's linebacker corps will be significantly different next
season with the retirement of Kevin Greene, the waiving of Mike
Barrow and signing of free agent Lee Woodall. The Panthers also
acquired linebacker Spencer Reid last week from Indianapolis.

<HEADLINE> Census response could determine the state's largest city  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Just before 1 p.m. Thursday, U.S. Census
Bureau employee Sharon Grant headed out to her own neighborhood to
count the uncounted.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important that my neighborhood is being represented,''
she said, sporting a large red ''Census 2000'' button and an armful
of census forms in a black bag.
</P>
<P>
   Grant was one of thousands of Census employees who fanned out
across the state on Thursday to find the people who failed to mail
back Census forms as the Bureau prepares its once-a-decade
population estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Their success will help determine how much government funding
and political representation cities and counties get. But in Newark
and Jersey City, the bragging rights for the state's most populous
city also are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we have a realistic chance'' at overtaking Newark to
become the state's largest city, said Tom Gallagher, chief of staff
for Jersey City Mayor Bret Schundler. ''We can surpass them if we
continue to gain and they continue to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Newark, long the state's biggest city, had 275,221
residents, according to Census figures, compared to 228,517 in
Jersey City.
</P>
<P>
   But 1998 estimates showed that Newark had lost people to its
suburbs, dropping to 267,823, while Jersey City's waterfront
development and continued influx of new immigrants brought its
population up to 232,429 people.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's probably too close to call, but I think Newark will
probably maintain the edge,'' said James Hughes, the dean of the
public policy school at Rutgers University. He said that Jersey
City had to close a large gap from the 1998 numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Before Thursday, only 43 percent of Newark households and 49
percent of Jersey City households had mailed back Census forms, and
officials in both cities agreed that the Census Bureau's ability to
accurately count the cities will hinge upon its ability to reach
immigrant populations.
</P>
<P>
   Luiggi Campana, who is heading Newark's Census outreach efforts,
said immigrants, particularly those of Caribbean and Haitian
descent, made up the bulk of residents who failed to respond.
</P>
<P>
   In Jersey City, the Egyptian and Filipino population has grown,
and a growing Vietnamese and Chinese community may be the hardest
to target because of a lack of publications in their own language
to launch an ad campaign, Gallagher said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday Newark sent 300 Census employees and Jersey City
sent 400 people door-to-door to obtain information ranging from
names and addresses to their medical history and whether they work
at home.
</P>
<P>
   Abigail Carter, Newark's Census office manager, said that 750
employees would be out in the streets in two weeks for the
eight-week program. Many of the employees are bilingual and are
chosen to go to their own neighborhood, hopefully to offer more
approachable faces to wary residents, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Jersey City Census office manager Ervin Washington said the
city's most undercounted neighborhood was the predominantly black
Greenville district. Black leaders held a news conference Thursday
to announce an outreach program that will spread into churches and
neighborhood groups.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said the office wasn't targeting any particular
neighborhood in Newark. The lack of specifics disturbed Campana,
who canceled a plan to send trucks out on Saturday to make public
service announcements because he didn't know what the Census Bureau
was doing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't deploy our support base because I have no idea yet of
how they're deploying their resources,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other cities with poor response rates included East Orange (41
percent), Asbury Park (43) and Camden (44), which rely on federal
financial aid. Of New Jersey's 21 counties, none had a lower
initial response rate than Cape May County, with its abundance of
summer homes.
</P>
<P>
   Cape May planning director Jim J. Smith said the response rate
will certainly rise when enumerators realize that about four of
every five homes on the barrier island towns that span the county
are owned by people who live elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Enumerators are to visit homes up to six times before declaring
them seasonal, unless a neighbor lets them know sooner, Smith said.

<HEADLINE> Padres Await Reaction to John Rocker  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- John Rocker goes on the road this weekend for
the first time since his suspension for offensive comments, and San
Diego Padres officials aren't quite sure what to expect from their
normally easygoing fans.
</P>
<P>
   Suspended for the first two weeks of the season for making
disparaging remarks about foreigners, minorities and gays in a
magazine interview, Rocker rejoined the Atlanta Braves at the start
of a nine-game homestand.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker got a standing ovation in his first appearance and had
four saves as the Braves swept the homestand to run their winning
streak to 10.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Steinberg, the Padres' vice president for public
affairs, said he has no feel for how the fans will respond during a
three-game series with the Braves starting Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was interesting to see the ovation that the Braves fans
provided,'' Steinberg said Thursday. ''This is his first stop on
the road. I think we're at ground zero. We're interested in seeing
what the attitudes of people are.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres don't plan to increase the number of security guards
for the Braves series, but will keep an eye on the Braves' bullpen
as the games progress, said Mark Guglielmo, director of stadium
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been in contact with major league baseball. We know what
the concerns are,'' Guglielmo said Thursday. ''We'll treat this as
any other event and take appropriate actions as necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Guglielmo said there will be some fans who will jeer Rocker,
''but I think those will be few and far between. I think our fans
are more in tune with supporting the Padres and watching a good
baseball game between two good teams.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres, who beat the Braves to win the 1998 NL pennant, have
not heard about any possible protests, Guglielmo said.
Representatives of the NAACP and the San Diego County Hispanic
Chamber of Commerce did not immediately return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said the team's No. 1 concern ''is always with safety,
and right with that, sportsmanship. I think our fans have shown a
great ability to honor both of those concepts.''
</P>
<P>
   While generally considered laid-back, San Diego fans have shown
a nasty side toward three stars who left as free agents after
helping the Padres reach the 1998 World Series. Kevin Brown, Steve
Finley and, surprisingly, Ken Caminiti, the 1996 NL MVP and one of
the most popular Padres ever, have been booed on their returns to
San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti and Padres officials were stunned when the Houston
Astros slugger was booed repeatedly on April 15, his first game in
San Diego since the '98 Series.
</P>
<P>
   Padres owner John Moores went to the Astros' clubhouse afterward
and apologized to Caminiti.
</P>
<P>
   While that episode bothered Moores, he had some fun when Brown
made his first appearance in San Diego in a Dodgers uniform in
April 1999. Moores suggested that the Beatles' ''Can't Buy Me
Love'' be played on the stadium PA system, one of several musical
jabs at Brown that night, when the fans, and even the club's
mascot, really let loose. Brown had turned down San Diego's $60
million offer to become baseball's first $100 million man.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect a musical poke at Rocker. ''It's a non-subject,''
Steinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ''From a baseball perspective, you hope you don't see him
because you hope you're beating the Braves. That would be the ideal
scenario.''

<HEADLINE> Squabbling Endangers Barak's Gov't  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A long-running dispute between two members of
Israel's coalition government escalated Thursday, endangering Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's efforts to make peace with the Palestinians
and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The dovish, secular Meretz party announced it would bolt from
the coalition rather than hand government funds to the
ultra-Orthodox Shas party to run its corrupt and debt-ridden school
system.
</P>
<P>
   Meretz leader Yossi Sarid, who is Israel's education minister,
has refused to turn over administration of the Shas education
system to his deputy minister Meshulam Nahari, who is from the Shas
party.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has indicated that he will rule in favor of Shas in the
dispute, according to Israeli media.
</P>
<P>
   Barak needs the support of Shas, the third largest faction in
the parliament, to assure a majority in favor of peace deals he
hopes to make with Syria and the Palestinians, including deep
territorial concessions in the Golan Heights and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   That has opened the way for Shas to make a series of escalating
demands on Barak, especially money for its school system. Barak has
appealed to Meretz to swallow the pill for the sake of the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   Meretz refuses, charging that Shas must not be allowed to
supervise a system that it has already mismanaged. ''We will not
write a corrupt check ... and it will not come from our
government,'' said Trade Minister Ran Cohen of Meretz.
</P>
<P>
   Sarid said if Meretz quits the government over the Shas crisis,
it would stay in the coalition for a limited period of time to give
Barak a chance to achieve peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Shas say that its voters are mostly hawkish opponents
of concessions to the Arabs, and the 17 members of the Shas
parliament faction would vote against peace deals even if their
demands are met.
</P>
<P>
   Shas leader Eli Ishai said votes on peace issues would not be
connected to other matters. He said the party would vote according
to the rulings of its Council of Torah Sages, headed by Rabbi
Ovadia Yosef, the spiritual leader of the party.
</P>
<P>
   If Meretz, with ten seats in parliament, quit Barak's
government, he would still command a majority in the house. If Shas
pulled out, another religious party might follow. Barak would be
hard pressed to muster a majority, and his government could fall.
</P>
<P>
   That could lead to new elections, delaying peace efforts for
many months.
</P>
<P>
   Barak was elected prime minister in May 1999, defeating
hard-liner Benjamin Netanyahu by a wide margin. But voters gave
Barak's One Israel bloc only 26 seats in the 120 seat parliament,
forcing him to form a motley coalition with parties representing
secularists, Orthodox Jews and immigrants.

<HEADLINE> Jury convicts former Wall Street executive in insider tradingscandal  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A former top Wall Street executive described by
prosecutors as the ''stud stock picker'' was convicted Thursday of
giving inside information on bank stocks to an X-rated movie
actress.
</P>
<P>
   The jury in Manhattan federal court convicted James McDermott
Jr., the executive, and a codefendant, Anthony Pomponio, of all but
one of eight counts in an indictment charging conspiracy and
securities fraud.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott, former chief executive officer at Keefe, Bruyette &AMP;
Woods, took a deep breath before the verdict was read, holding his
head high as the jury forewoman spoke. McDermott was a frequent
guest on financial programs in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   He had appeared relaxed throughout a trial that featured
repeated references to his extramarital affair with Kathryn Gannon,
who performs in X-rated movies under the name ''Marylin Star.''
Courtroom artist Dale Dyer said McDermott entered the courtroom for
the verdict, looked at his drawing, and asked, ''Could you give me
a little more hair than that?''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood set sentencing for July 17 on
charges that could bring up to 10 years in prison for McDermott,
48, of Briarcliff Manor and Pomponio, 45, of North Caldwell, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The judge had directed before the trial that Gannon would only
be referred to as an actress, a model and a dancer who sometimes
goes by the stage name ''Marylin Star.''
</P>
<P>
   Two jurors who declined to identify themselves said outside
court that they did not know Gannon was a porn star and that it
would not have made a difference.
</P>
<P>
   One male juror, though, smiled slightly and added, ''We didn't
think she was the Queen of England.''
</P>
<P>
   Gannon, the star of features including ''Fantasies of Marylin,''
''Pumped,'' ''The Violation of Marylin Star'' and ''Sins of the
Flesh,'' remains a fugitive in the case and is living in Canada.
Her extradition has been sought.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyer, Howard Shapiro, said he was disappointed with the
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even if it were correct, however, it does not follow that
Kathryn Gannon is guilty of the charges brought against her.
Indeed, she is not and she intends to contest them vigorously,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro said the Department of Justice must decide whether it
will pursue plans to extradite Gannon.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're taking it one step at a time. I expect her to eventually
appear in a courtroom somewhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro said his client does not have any business arrangements
in the United States now and is out of the X-rated movie business.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said McDermott and Pomponio were each having an
extramarital affair with Gannon. The men did not meet each other
until they were arrested, lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors alleged McDermott gave Gannon secret information
about six stocks, allowing her to buy bank stocks that were about
to skyrocket in value after public announcements of mergers.
</P>
<P>
   She was accused of giving the information to Pomponio, the owner
of a New Jersey quartz- and glass-cutting company who met Gannon at
an adult trade show in Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   Gannon, 30, who has a home in Miami, Fla., and Pomponio
allegedly made $170,000 in illegal profits.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors alleged McDermott, a $4 million-a-year executive,
gave Gannon more than $150,000 to gamble with in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, McDermott's lawyer, Denis McInerney, referred
to his client as a ''rocket scientist on bank stocks'' and admitted
that McDermott gave Gannon tips on stocks -- but only before he
learned the stock involved merger deals. McDermott and McInerney
declined to comment after the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   In final remarks to the jury before deliberations, Assistant
U.S. Attorney Alex Young Oh questioned whether McDermott's motives
could be considered innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you think that's how it really happened?'' Oh asked. ''Come
on. She was the actress, dancer and model. He was the stud stock
picker.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There was something more to this scheme than just the money.
Maybe McDermott was trying to impress her. This is a way for him to
show her what he did. Maybe it was a macho thing,'' Oh said.
</P>
<P>
   The jury exonerated McDermott and Pomponio on one count of the
indictment, finding that they did not conspire to trade illegally
in one of the six stock deals alleged to have involved insider
trading.
</P>
<P>
   Pomponio's lawyer, Thomas Dunn, said he would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   He said his client was ''pretty devastated.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I really got to know the man and I really didn't buy the
government's case. I don't believe he did anything wrong,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Bush-McCain on 'Tenuous' Ground  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a blow to George W. Bush's bid to unify the
Republican Party, negotiations for a May 9 meeting between the
nominee-in-waiting and vanquished rival John McCain nearly broke
down Thursday in a dispute that widened the rift between their two
camps.
</P>
<P>
   Senior McCain advisers said the first face-to-face meeting since
the Arizona senator left the presidential race would likely be
postponed -- if not canceled -- in a disagreement over the agenda.
Bush advisers said they were still confident the session would be
held. Aides in both camps spoke only on condition they not be
identified.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to salvage the event, which is important to the
political futures of both McCain and Bush, their top advisers
planned to meet Friday in the Washington office of 1996 GOP
presidential candidate Bob Dole, who will not be present.
''Governor Bush is looking forward to meeting as scheduled with
Senator McCain,'' said Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute exposed layers of mutual mistrust and animosity that
will complicate Bush's efforts to embrace McCain and his
influential bloc of independent-minded voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain need a successful meeting for different reasons.
Bush wants to unify the party and appeal to McCain backers. The
Arizona senator, who still has presidential ambitions, wants to
show Republicans he is a party man.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting would have downsides for both men, too. Bush is
unlikely to gain McCain's endorsement, which he needs to help court
independent voters. And McCain fears he could damage his political
maverick image if he unites with Bush at a meeting that independent
voters recognize as, in the words of one aide, ''a political
charade.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The status of the meeting is tenuous,'' said McCain spokesman
Todd Harris. ''We feel that any meeting between Senator McCain and
Governor Bush should be a substantial one. We don't view a meeting
whose primary purpose is to go over once again whether John McCain
wants to be vice president -- when everyone knows he doesn't want to
-- falls into the substantial category.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain and his advisers have been chafing ever since Bush took
the unusual step last week of announcing that he would ask McCain
in the meeting whether he was willing to serve as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has said repeatedly that he doesn't want the job. Bush
has been under pressure from some Republicans who think McCain's
appeal is worth a full-court effort to get him on the ticket.
McCain and his advisers believed that Bush was turning the meeting
into a high-profile forum for the Arizona senator to take himself
out of the running.
</P>
<P>
   Their discomfort with that notion suggests that some top McCain
supporters want him to remain a vice presidential prospect. Some of
them say they suspect that McCain could be persuaded to serve on
the ticket if Bush waged a sincere campaign to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's pledge to pop the question to McCain also guaranteed a
''circus atmosphere'' at the meeting, a senior McCain adviser said.
The advisers saw it as an attempt to narrow the agenda, which
McCain had hoped would include fruitful discussions about campaign
finance reform, Social Security, military spending and his role in
the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's advisers were preparing a list of suggested agenda
items to submit to the Bush campaign Friday when a syndicated
column by Robert D. Novak stirred up the pot. Novak said
unidentified Bush advisers expected ''little satisfaction'' from
the meeting and might prefer ''a short, unhappy get-together in
Pittsburgh than a long, tendentious partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, traveling in Vietnam to commemorate the 25th anniversary
of the fall of Saigon, was angered by the column. He told aides to
cancel the meeting unless they could be assured that Bush wanted to
hold substantial talks on a variety of topics.
</P>
<P>
   McCain advisers said they tried for several hours to reach
Bush's team but their calls were not returned. Bush's advisers,
meanwhile, said they never received the calls.
</P>
<P>
   McCain strategist John Weaver and Bush campaign manager Joe
Allbaugh eventually talked by telephone. Bush advisers said they
were assured by Weaver that the meeting could still be held as
scheduled but that it was in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver and Allbaugh already had planned to conduct their first
substantial planning session on the Bush-McCain event Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of how deep the resentment runs, Weaver won't meet
with his counterpart Karl Rove because of a long-running dispute
with the Bush aide.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout came just as Bush seemed to be stepping up his
efforts to reach out to McCain and his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Bush advisers, in interviews before the meeting was put
in jeopardy, said the governor was looking for common ground on
campaign finance reform -- McCain's signature issue. They said, for
example, that Bush planned to tell McCain that he supported efforts
to require disclosure of donors to special interest groups that
spend unlimited, unregulated donations on political ads.
</P>
<P>
   And on Tuesday, Bush telephoned Warren Rudman, a McCain ally and
former New Hampshire senator who was harshly criticized by Bush
allies during the primaries. Two people familiar with the telephone
calls said Bush expressed regret for the tone of the campaign.
Rudman would only say, ''It was a reaching out call. He seems to be
reaching out to McCain supporters.''

   INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Fire Sale Queen highlights a field of
10 entries in Friday night's $100,000-added Senorita Stakes at
Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   Fire Sale Queen will be ridden by Frank Alvarado and carry 118
pounds in the one-mile race for 3-year-old fillies on turf as
Hollywood Park opens its 65-day thoroughbred racing season. Each of
the other nine entries was assigned 114 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Fire Sale Queen, who won the $150,000 California Thoroughbred
Breeders' Association Stakes at Del Mar last summer, has won three
of her eight lifetime starts and earned $191,261.
</P>
<P>
   The opening weekend at Hollywood Park will be capped by the
inaugural California Gold Rush on Sunday -- a series of 10 stakes

<HEADLINE> Port authority elects new officers, fails to vote on budget  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey
re-elected its officers Thursday but did not vote on a $3.9 billion
budget that it had put on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   A vote on the budget, which holds down increases in PATH
commuter rail fares and tolls at Port Authority bridges and
tunnels, would have ended a stalemate on all major business at the
board, which is hamstrung by a feud between the governors of New
York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-month-old dispute began when Gov. George Pataki refused
to sign off on a $200 million lease with a shipping company, saying
it would benefit New Jersey more than New York. New Jersey Gov.
Christie Whitman, in turn, demanded that the board not take action
on issues important to New York, such as the privatization of the
World Trade Center and expansion of the Howland Hook Marine
Terminal in Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   Each governor appoints and controls the votes of six
commissioners on the board.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Lewis M. Eisenberg, a Whitman appointee, said at
Thursday's meeting that a vote on the budget would not take place.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenberg was re-elected, along with Pataki appointee and vice
chairman Charles A. Gargano and Pataki ally Robert E. Boyle as
executive director.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Reformist Gains Support  </HEADLINE>
By LOUIS MEIXLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey's Parliament failed to elect a
president in the first round of voting Thursday, but delivered its
strong support to a reformist judge who is likely to capture the
office in later balloting.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was a blow to Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit who had
secured promises from party leaders to support his candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmet Necdet Sezer, a top judge who has spoken of the need for
democratic reforms, received 281 votes, falling short of the
two-thirds required for election in the first round. There are 550
seats in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The other votes were split between nine other candidates. The
candidate who came in second, Nevzat Yalcintas, received only 61
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Several candidates were expected to drop out of the race in the
coming days. The next round of balloting is scheduled for Monday.
If the vote reaches a third round, a candidate can take the office
with a simple majority.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is clear as of now that the results will be good for Mr.
Sezer,'' Ecevit said after the balloting. ''I am very optimistic
about the results.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the leaders of all five parties in parliament
agreed to support Sezer's nomination. But Thursday's vote was a
secret ballot and many deputies from the ruling coalition clearly
did not back Sezer. The ruling coalition has 351 members.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government is losing its force over its own party
groups,'' said Fehmi Koru, a political analyst. ''It will not
affect the government in the short-run, but after the election,
Ecevit may think about his partners in the government.''
</P>
<P>
   The first-round ballot comes just two weeks after Ecevit failed
to muster enough support for a constitutional amendment that would
enable President Suleyman Demirel to run for another term.
Demirel's term expires on May 16.
</P>
<P>
   ''The leaders, who received a blow during the debate on the
constitution, will receive an even bigger blow if they fail to have
Sezer elected in the first round and make their trustworthiness
questionable,'' Yeni Safak, a pro-Islamic newspaper, wrote before
the voting.
</P>
<P>
   Sezer is head of the constitutional court and is expected to be
a strong advocate of democratic reforms if elected. The presidency
in Turkey is a largely ceremonial post, but presidents are often
powerbrokers in times of crises and can exert strong moral
influence.
</P>
<P>
   Sezer has called for changing the constitution, which was
written after the 1980 military coup, saying it restricts freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   He also has questioned the military's purge of officers
suspected of having links with Islamic groups, decisions in which
officers have no right of appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Those positions have led to praise from the Islamic Virtue
Party, but have raised fears that the military, which regards
political Islam as one of the greatest threats to the secular
state, may be wary of Sezer's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   The army has seized power three times since 1960.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Cautions Americans in China  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department advised U.S. citizens
living and traveling in China to be cautious with the approach of
the May 8 anniversary of the American bombing of the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   China has refused to accept repeated U.S. statements that the
bombing was the result of a targeting mistake.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the United States and its NATO allies were
attacking Yugoslavia to force withdrawal of Serb troops from
Kosovo, where they were accused of criminal treatment of ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said Thursday it had not received any
information regarding demonstrations or threats against U.S.
interests in China.
</P>
<P>
   But the public announcement noted that the bombing, which it
described as a ''tragic event,'' was followed by sometimes violent
demonstrations at U.S. diplomatic offices in China and a few
isolated incidents of harassment of U.S. citizens.

<HEADLINE> Three More Papers Shut Down in Iran  </HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iranian hard-liners shut down three more
newspapers Thursday, including one owned by reformist President
Mohammad Khatami's brother, pressing their campaign against
publications that have fueled public support for reform.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 students demonstrated against the closures at the
Shahid Beheshti University in northern Tehran in the early hours of
Friday, said an Iranian journalist, speaking on condition of
anonymity. The students burned tires and threw stones at university
buildings and were dispersed by police after about an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The media closures, now numbering 16, are hampering Khatami's
allies' political ambitions. Only one reformist paper remained
publishing Thursday as campaigning started for the May 5 run-off
elections, which will decide 66 seats in the 290-seat parliament,
or Majlis.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling clergy was stunned by the first round of voting in
February, in which candidates linked with reformist parties won
about 70 percent of the seats.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, hard-line authorities have annulled 12 reformist
winners, giving two seats to hard-liners and calling for run-offs
in the others. They also said they might call for recasting votes
in the capital, Tehran, where reformists won 29 of the 30 seats.
The capital's vote, they said, was marred by fraud and
inconsistencies.
</P>
<P>
   But amid the media blackout imposed on reformists, Khatami's
allies campaigning in this round will have a tougher job competing.
</P>
<P>
   The Press Court, which is dominated by hard-liners, justified
Thursday's newspaper closures by saying Mohammad-Reza Khatami's
newspaper and the two others had violated press laws. It gave no
details of the violations.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammad-Reza Khatami has been closely allied with his brother's
national campaign to loosen social, political and cultural
restrictions. The only reformist paper still allowed to publish is
Bayan, which has not been as outspoken as the others.
</P>
<P>
   Without support from the press, reformist lawmakers and
candidates might have to wait until Parliament resumes session on
May 27 to restart direct dialogue with the people: the constitution
mandates that Parliament debates be broadcast live on state radio.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reformists are under siege. They are looking to the
opening of the Majlis as the cavalry,'' said Saeed Laylaz, an
analyst who used to write for the Azad daily before it was closed
down Monday with a court order issued by the hard-line judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   There are clear signs the hard-liners are trying to claw their
way back into control of the Majlis, which in February they lost
for the first time since the 1979 Islamic revolution. Hard-liners
have considerable power thanks to their dominance over the
judiciary, the state broadcasting media and the Guardians Council
that supervises elections.
</P>
<P>
   Absent much of the reformist press, a lackluster campaign began
Thursday for the May run-offs. In most cases, the 66 seats up for
grabs May 5 were left open because no candidate won the minimum 25
percent in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   The council announced first-round results only Wednesday -- two
months after voting -- but said the Tehran seats were still in
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it said, 185 places outside the capital were confirmed,
and 66 would be voted on May 5. It was unclear when authorities
planned to fill the 10 left by their annulments after the first
round, or how they would resolve the objections over the 29
reformist wins in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   Holding 120 of the 185 confirmed seats, reformists need just 26
more for a simple majority. The 29 Tehran seats in question would
give reformists firm control.
</P>
<P>
   The allies of President Khatami, a maverick cleric, have
appealed for calm, saying unrest will play into the hands of
hard-liners who are looking for a pretext to delay the Majlis
opening. The constitution requires the Majlis be inaugurated on
time, except in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ''When there is tension or crisis in society, everyone should
apply wisdom and self-restraint ... and act within the framework of
the law in order to calm the crisis and meet the needs of
society,'' Iranian TV reported Khatami as saying during a meeting
Thursday with the Tehran city council.
</P>
<P>
   Protests and riots erupted in July in Tehran and several other
cities when hard-liners closed a single reformist newspaper. The
protests were quelled by a hard-line crackdown, but the unrest --
the worst since the revolution -- shook the clergy's authority.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a few protests since the latest closures, but
they have been small, peaceful and contained inside universities.
</P>
<P>
   ''By remaining calm we are showing our own political maturity,''
said Javid Rahmanqoli, a university student in Tehran. ''The other
side wants us to react, but we won't, not because we are afraid of
a crackdown, but because we have the maturity to understand the
rules of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The elite Revolutionary Guards, backbone of Iran's military
force, warned last week that reformists would ''feel the
revolutionary hammer on their skulls'' if they failed to fall in
line.

<HEADLINE> Two Arrested in Brockovich Sting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (AP) -- As a hidden camera rolled, an
ex-husband and an ex-boyfriend of the real-life Erin Brockovich
were arrested in a sting for allegedly trying to extort $310,000
from her and her boss.
</P>
<P>
   The men allegedly were threatening to go to the media with
accusations about Brockovich, the tart-tongued legal secretary
whose work on a toxic waste case is the basis of the hit movie
starring Julia Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's arrests of ex-husband Shawn William Brown,
ex-boyfriend Jorg Lawrence Halaby and their lawyer, John Jeffrey
Reiner, culminated a two-week investigation by the Ventura County
district attorney's office and the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were outside Brockovich's attorney's office
Wednesday morning as Brockovich and her boss, Ed Masry, handed over
checks totaling $310,000 to the three men, according to a criminal
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Hidden cameras captured the action as investigators entered and
made the arrests almost as soon as Brockovich and Masry left the
room, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Masry, who is played by Albert Finney in the movie ''Erin
Brockovich,'' said on Thursday that the men threatened to tell the
media he and Brockovich had a sexual relationship and that she was
a bad mother.
</P>
<P>
   Both claims are untrue, Masry said.
</P>
<P>
   Brockovich and Masry issued a statement saying such situations
come with celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, part of the price you pay for becoming
well-known these days is that unscrupulous people try to take
advantage of you. The very idea that there has ever been anything
improper about our relationship is of course ludicrous,'' they
said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 38, of Simi Valley; Halaby, 46, of Costa Mesa and Reiner,
53, whose office is in Century City, posted $50,000 bail each on
Thursday and were released pending arraignment on May 10.
</P>
<P>
   A phone call to Reiner's office went unanswered Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, Brockovich goes to work for Masry as an assistant,
and through hard work, initiative and guile uncovers power plant
pollution in a small town in the Mojave Desert and helps win a
record $333 million settlement from corporate giant Pacific Gas &AMP;
Electric. ''Erin Brockovich'' has grossed more than $100 million
since its release last month.

<HEADLINE> Utah State Extends Coach's Contract  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOGAN, Utah (AP) -- Utah State extended basketball coach Stew
Morrill's contract through 2008 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Morrill, 43-19 in two seasons at the school, originally signed a
five-year contract. The five-year extension calls for his base
salary next season to increase from $120,000 to $143,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said when I came to Utah State that this would very possibly
be my last coaching stop,'' Morrill said. ''This long-term contract
certainly shows an effort by the administration to make the
possibility a reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies won the Big West title last season before losing to
Connecticut in the first round of the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Morrill is 261-157 in 14 years as a college coach. He was 97-52
in five seasons at Montana and 121-86 in seven seasons at Colorado
State.

<HEADLINE> Steinem Urges 'Healthy Rebellion'  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Feminist author Gloria Steinem urged girls
on Thursday to keep that ''healthy rebellion'' that inspires
youngsters to say what they want and do what they want.
</P>
<P>
   Steinem made the comments after presiding over a U.N. program
for the annual ''Take Our Daughters to Work Day'' -- the nationwide
campaign to boost girls' self-confidence that was launched seven
years ago by Steinem's Ms. Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The founder of Ms. magazine was joined by the first woman space
shuttle commander, Col. Eileen Collins, and Australian Ambassador
Penny Wensley, who heads up the powerful U.N. budget committee, at
a morning ceremony attended by U.N. staff and their daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ''What this has helped to understand is that when a girl is say,
8 or 9 10, she often has a lot more strength and sense of herself
than she may have when she's 12, 13 or 14,'' Steinem said.
</P>
<P>
   At that older age, the ''feminine role'' often sneaks up on
girls, making them less willing to speak out about what they want,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've learned how to strengthen healthy rebellion in girls to
keep that sense of self we have as little girls,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wensley, the Australian ambassador, spoke of her determination
to become a diplomat -- a dream she had since she was 12 -- and the
discrimination she faced as one of the few women foreign service
officers in the Australian Foreign Ministry in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Wensley, who has two daughters in college in Australia, said she
still sees discrimination as one of 11 women ambassadors at the
United Nations -- and as the head of the U.N. budget committee, the
most important committee at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are surprised I'm chairing the Fifth Committee. It's a
masculine committee. They wonder why I'm not chairing the Third
Committee,'' which handles social and humanitarian affairs, Wensley
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to chair the 5th Committee,'' she said. ''People
think I'm crazy. It's a very difficult yet challenging, demanding
job. But it is important to demonstrate that there aren't male
territories and female territories.''

<HEADLINE> Violations at Brown Athletic Dept.  </HEADLINE>
By RACHEL ZOLL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Brown University said Thursday that an
internal investigation of its athletic department found several
rules violations involving financial aid and recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   The infractions ranged from offers of financial aid in violation
of the Ivy League ban on athletic scholarships, to improper contact
with prospects at a football banquet.
</P>
<P>
   Two student athletes, eight recruits, and five coaches from the
football team, the men's soccer and basketball teams, and the
women's volleyball team were involved. Several alumni and staff,
and administrators at the Brown Sports Foundation also were
responsible.
</P>
<P>
   If the NCAA accepts the school's recommendations, no teams will
be disqualified or required to forfeit games, and no one will be
fired. The NCAA already reviewed and cleared the eligibility of the
student athletes and recruits.
</P>
<P>
   The Ivy League has accepted the school's findings.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Freid, Brown's executive vice president of public affairs
and university relations, would not reveal the amount of money
involved, but said the aid was from sources outside the university.
She said she believes the violations reflect a lack of
understanding, not a willful disregard of NCAA rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very grateful we found out about this early in the
recruiting system and that we could address it,'' Freid said.
</P>
<P>
   The two-month investigation began after other schools contacted
the Ivy League with concerns about Brown's actions, Freid said.
</P>
<P>
   The report referred to several foundations that provide
financial aid to students. None of the institutions was identified
except for the Brown Sports Foundation, an independent nonprofit
group formed to benefit Brown athletes. The names of the coaches
and athletes were not included in the report.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, with the knowledge of coaches and staff, prospects
in football, men's basketball and men's soccer were offered aid
based in part on their athletic ability from an outside foundation
with ties to Brown.
</P>
<P>
   In another, a foundation was found to be offering aid only to
athletes from Brown. The NCAA bars aid that limits the recipients
choice of school.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has promised to intensify oversight of outside sources of
financial aid to athletes and limit official recruiting visits next
year for the football and other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches will have a letter of reprimand or admonishment
placed in their personnel files and will be required to attend NCAA
and Ivy League compliance seminars.

<HEADLINE> Avengers QB Says He's Innocent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Los Angeles Avengers quarterback Todd
Marinovich said he was wrongly accused in a sexual assault case.
</P>
<P>
   ''My attorney has advised me not to comment, but my gut feeling
tells me I must respond to the accusation, did I do it?''
Marinovich said Thursday after practice at West Los Angeles
College. ''Absolutely not is my answer. Anyone who knows me knows
this couldn't be further from the truth. That's all I have to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old quarterback declined to answer a question on how
the charge arose.
</P>
<P>
   Marinovich reported on time for an 8:30 a.m. quarterbacks
meeting, then practiced with his Arena Football League teammates
for a little over two hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''He seems focused,'' coach Stan Brock said. ''He threw fairly
well in practice for coming off a day off. Being on the practice
field with his teammates is a nice place for him to be when he has
a lot of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Brock said he never thought Marinovich would fail to show up for
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew he would be here and fully expected him to be here,''
Brock said. ''I would have fined him if he wasn't here.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting quarterback Scott Semptimphelter said the meeting ''was
like every other day, going through the game plan. We talked about
Oklahoma and winning the football game Monday night.''
</P>

   The Avengers resume their season Monday, playing the Oklahoma
Wranglers at Staples Center. Los Angeles lost its opening two
games, and Marinovich did not play in either. The former University
of Southern California and Los Angeles Raiders quarterback played
in both of his team's exhibition games, and was selected as the
most valuable player of the first, March 27.
</P>
<P>
   Marinovich's teammates voiced their support for him.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a teammate of ours -- once a teammate, always a
teammate,'' said Victor Hall, a lineman and team captain. ''We're
supporting him. That's what we have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The practice was the Avengers' first since Marinovich's arrest
Tuesday. The assault allegedly occurred early that morning at his
Marina del Rey apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Marinovich, released on $50,000 bail, is scheduled for
arraignment May 16 in Culver City Municipal Court.

<HEADLINE> Big 10 Allows Purdue To Keep Title  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- The Big Ten has decided to allow
Purdue to keep its 1996 conference basketball title, athletic
director Morgan Burke said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Burke said the Big Ten's compliance and reinstatement
subcommittee reviewed penalties the Boilermakers received from the
NCAA and decided not to levy any further sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Ten had the option of taking away the title for NCAA
violations committed during the 1995-96 season. The NCAA placed
Purdue on two year's probation in July for major rules violations
that included recruiting, extra benefits and unethical conduct.

<HEADLINE> Kings' Laperriere Has Knee Surgery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Los Angeles Kings forward Ian Laperriere had
surgery Thursday to repair a torn ACL in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Laperriere, 26, is expected to be ready for training camp in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Laperriere had 22 points, including nine goals, in a career-high
79 games this season. He also led the Kings with 185 penalty
minutes, including 21 major penalties that led the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings acquired Laperriere from the New York Rangers in an
eight-player trade in 1996. Laperriere has 45 goals and 123 points
in seven NHL seasons with the St. Louis Blues, Rangers and Kings.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were swept in four games by the Detroit Red Wings in
the first round of the playoffs.

<HEADLINE> Lawsuits Abound in Sports  </HEADLINE>
By JIM LITKE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   A guy who had one of the worst ideas ever is mulling over
another bad one. Orlando Brown, the Cleveland Browns lineman who
flattened a ref last December, is still having problems seeing and
is thinking about suing the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   In a game against Jacksonville, referee Jeff Triplette threw a
penalty flag weighted with BBs in Brown's direction and wound up
striking Brown in the right eye. Viewing videotape of the incident
months later, one blow looks intentional, the other an accident.
But now that attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr., is involved, it's even
money which was which.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, the NFL ended Brown's indefinite suspension and
gave back the $49,000 he was docked. But that gesture proved no
more effective than the finger-crossing at league headquarters.
Earlier this week, Cochran confirmed he was already on Brown's
case.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will take a few weeks probably,'' Cochran's publicist,
Rachel Noerdlinger, said. ''Maybe longer just to obtain background
on the case, if there is a case.''
</P>
<P>
   But only if.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, the sports section looks like the rest of the
newspaper. First commerce swallowed chunks and now the law has come
along to take a bite. In the last few days, we've read stories
about coaches suing players, fans suing players and now another
player preparing to sue his league. None of the lawsuits is
unprecedented -- remember Latrell Sprewell, tired of being
''demonized,'' suing the NBA for $30 million -- they're just
occurring closer together.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the story was Toronto coach Butch Carter filing a $5
million defamation suit against Knick forward Marcus Camby, who
once played for Carter and called him ''a liar.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter said he wouldn't sue, then sued anyway. Then he demanded
an apology from Camby, didn't get it, and dropped the lawsuit
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The story making the rounds now is the lawsuit wasn't even about
Camby. ESPN reports Carter was stung because his former Indiana
teammates wouldn't back up claims in Carter's book that Bob Knight
aimed racial slurs at a player. So when Camby attacked his
credibility, Carter went legal.
</P>
<P>
   But at least he came to his senses in time. All Yankee pitcher
Allen Watson and a 16-year-old Baltimore fan arrived at was an
out-of-court settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Robbins of Arlington, Va., claimed Watson threw two
balls at his daughter, Cheryl, during batting practice at Camden
Yards last September. The sign probably said something stronger
than ''Yankee Go Home!'' because Watson's teammate, Jeff Nelson,
grabbed the sign from Cheryl, ripped it to pieces and threw it back
at her.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't say anything,'' Watson said leaving the courthouse.
''You know I wish I could.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the Robbins' attorney, Gregory Angst, said the
family's separate civil suit against the Yankees would be dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the NFL has to buy out Brown still remains to be seen.
When the incident took place in December, the league's disciplinary
headache was approaching migraine status. It already had one player
facing a murder rap (Rae Carruth) and a second player (Cecil
Collins) charged with climbing through other people's bedroom
windows.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Paul Tagliabue was itching for a test case to make
him look tough. And when the 6-foot-7, 350-pound Brown decked
Triplette, a slender 6-footer, it looked like he was auditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is a guy who doesn't mind mixing it up. He had already
turned down an offer from the World Wrestling Federation and wanted
friends to call him ''Zeus.'' More damning, he went to the sideline
and appeared to have a grip on things before walking back on the
field and applying it to Triplette.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, it's much harder picking out the villain. Brown's
father lost his sight to glaucoma in 1993. That shook Brown up. Now
he's worried about when -- and even whether -- he will resume his NFL
career.
</P>
<P>
   But this much is known: It's getting tougher by the minute for
pro sports leagues to call their own shots.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian authorities -- real cops -- talked to the NHL's Marty
McSorley over his stick-swinging. And some of the White Sox and
Detroit Tigers suspended Thursday for last weekend's basebrawl have
already pulled out their cell phones and called the union.
</P>
<P>
   The chain of command in sports is being yanked at every
opportunity, from all sides, often with the aid of the court
system. But now, those inmates who want to run the institutions can
afford pricey legal help, too.

<HEADLINE> Gore Targets Bush on Health Care  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, pressing his plan to
bring health insurance to all children, said Thursday that
presidential rival George W. Bush has done little to get coverage
to thousands of uninsured Texans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the Texas governor, has been touting a health program of
his own as he works to make inroads on traditionally Democratic
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''I welcome him to this debate because he has some pretty
serious questions to answer,'' Gore said at Children's Hospital of
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to know why under George W. Bush, the state of Texas
has become first in the nation for the number of people without any
health insurance at all,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   About one in four Texans lacks health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer responded with national figures
showing the number of uninsured Americans has grown to some 44
million, including about 11 million children, despite the booming
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since he (Gore) was elected, there are 8 million more
Americans without health insurance,'' Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's trip to Pennsylvania also netted more than $1 million for
the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In Pittsburgh, Gore also questioned why Bush wanted Texas to
impose stricter limits on the incomes of families participating in
the 2-year-old Children's Health Insurance Program, which provides
subsidized coverage to working poor families that earn too much to
qualify for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why ... did Governor Bush fight to deny health coverage to
more than 200,000 children who were legally eligible for it under
the national law that President Clinton and I passed?'' Gore asked.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning with sick kids in a swing state, Gore said no child
should go without care in these strong economic times. He visited a
playroom filled with children, most of whom had received or were
waiting for organ transplants.
</P>
<P>
   Few of their parents knew much about Gore's health plan but they
all welcomed his interest.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the last thing you want to worry about, who's paying the
bills,'' said Tim Colligan of Wellsville, N.Y., whose son just got
a transplanted heart.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan builds on the Clinton administration's approach to
incrementally expanding access to insurance, a strategy adopted
after the failure to get a universal health coverage plan through
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would allow more children and many of their parents into
the Children's Health Insurance Program. He also would require that
states simplify the application process for that program and for
Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't happened under Bush, Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ''His state's Medicaid program requires now face-to-face
interviews ... before a child can be signed up, as if these
families were applying for high-security jobs rather than health
coverage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many states have similar requirements, designed to make sure
people are not getting government-funded coverage they are not
qualified for.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have traditionally enjoyed a political advantage on
health care, but Bush has signaled he will not concede the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking with Republicans of the past, Bush has called for more
federal spending on traditionally Democratic issues such as health,
education and housing. But Gore argues there would be no money to
pay for them after Bush's $483 billion, five-year tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ''The other side is proposing ... to go back to the promise of
no hard choices, have-it-all, risky-tax-scheme plus more spending
and don't worry about tomorrow,'' Gore told some 200 people at a
$1,000-per-plate fund-raiser luncheon for the Democratic National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The lunch was expected to raise $200,000. Afterward, Gore was
attending a DNC reception and dinner in Philadelphia that were
expected to raise another $1 million. Tickets to the reception were
$1,000; to the dinner, $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   On health care, the candidates' positions reflect their parties'
philosophies, with Gore preferring a government program that
guarantees a minimum set of benefits and Bush using the tax code to
encourage families to buy insurance on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Under the centerpiece of the Bush plan, estimated at $35 billion
over five years, families would get tax credits of up to $2,000 per
family to offset much of the cost of insurance.

<HEADLINE> Bush: I'll Make Call on Big Cases  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush said Thursday that, if elected,
he would make the decision -- not his attorney general -- in cases
such as the fate of Elian Gonzalez that are a matter of ''national
conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I would rely upon the advice of those who are fully involved
in the case, but this seems like a decision that would have risen
to the Oval Office to me,'' Bush said of reuniting the Cuban boy
with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed on the PBS ''NewsHour with Jim Lehrer,'' the
presumed Republican presidential nominee said he would rely on his
attorney general's advice, but make the final call himself.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno have said Reno
alone gave the go-ahead for the early morning raid last Saturday in
which armed federal agents snatched the 6-year-old Cuban boy from
the home of his Miami relatives and flew him to Washington, where
his father waited.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd make the decision on a situation that had risen to this
level in the national conscience, and I'd, of course, rely upon the
attorney general's advice,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor said he understood the need to reunite father
and son, but repeated his position that the matter should have been
handled in family court.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's rival, Democrat Al Gore, also has said -- in a break with
the Clinton administration -- that the case should have been decided
by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand the boy's being with his dad. Heck, I'm a dad,''
Bush said. ''But I wish it had been done in a place where there
wasn't a lot of suspicion about what took place.''
</P>
<P>
   On other matters, Bush said:
</P>
<P>
   -- He would not be ''beholden'' to corporations and other big
money donors that support him and the Republican Party, which
raised a record $21.3 million Wednesday night at a Washington
dinner Bush headlined. ''Either you're crooked or you're not
crooked, I guess is the way to put it bluntly,'' he said. '' Either
you're somebody who can be bought, or you're somebody who's running
on principle. My job is to convince the American people that I'm a
man running on principle.''
</P>
<P>
   -- In the case of Microsoft, he hoped the government doesn't
''ruin this company'' in deciding whether to order a breakup. ''I
hope the judge would keep in mind that this company is an important
part of the technological revolution taking place in America.'' He
refused to say what a Bush administration would have done in the
antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   -- He hoped President Clinton would not sign an amended
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty that would prevent the United States
from developing a full missile defense system. ''I would hope he
wouldn't constrain me -- the next president -- or the next
administration's ability to move forward by signing a halfhearted
reform of the ABM,'' Bush said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Downplays Security Concerns  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL ALEXANDER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam (AP) -- The government on Thursday
downplayed security concerns for the 25th anniversary celebration
of the Vietnam War's end, despite the presence of armed troops and
the scaling back of what had been planned as a major street parade.
</P>
<P>
   Streets in this southern city formerly known as Saigon were
filled with bright colored bunting proclaiming the anniversary of
Vietnam's victory, along with North Vietnamese and Communist Party
flags and photos of the legendary communist hero Ho Chi Minh.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam clearly views Sunday's events as an opportunity to
bolster patriotism -- and possibly generate increased aid from
abroad as foreign media attention is focused on the impoverished
nation, which still battles the long-term effects of the war.
</P>
<P>
   The country's leaders also have become increasingly nervous
about the prospect of something going wrong, particularly as
hundreds of foreign journalists have poured in.
</P>
<P>
   Officials refused to comment directly on the possibility of a
terrorist attack by Vietnamese exiles who remain opposed to the
country's communist government.
</P>
<P>
   A suspected bomb plot by Free Vietnam, an opposition group, was
uncovered in February in Cambodia; one member was arrested with
explosives and propaganda materials near the Thai-Cambodian border,
officials reported.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department last month alerted Americans working
in Vietnam and tourists of possible attacks on foreign businesses
aimed at disrupting the anniversary celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   As is often the case in a country where all local media is
government controlled, what officials don't say can be more telling
than their public pronouncements.
</P>
<P>
   Le Thanh Hai, deputy mayor of Ho Chi Minh City, told a news
conference Thursday that no extra police or troops would be
deployed leading up to the anniversary. But he would not elaborate
on whether this would be the case on Sunday and refused to answer
questions on the February arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reality is that on the occasion of big events, there are
bad elements who wish to disrupt the smooth celebrations of the
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is extremely rare in Vietnam to see armed troops outside
military bases. But soldiers with assault rifles have been spotted
on night patrol at Lam Son Square, the center of the downtown area,
throughout the week, some crouched behind trees and planters.
</P>
<P>
   By dusk, police had cordoned off the streets leading toward the
palace for a four-hour dress rehearsal, creating chaos in streets
already choked with motorbikes.
</P>
<P>
   The government scaled back plans for a massive street parade.
</P>
<P>
   Hai acknowledged the parade would be limited to the palace
grounds. He cited the palace's historic significance and a savings
of $70,000 instead of security concerns as the reason for reducing
the size of the parade.
</P>
<P>
   At Reunification Palace, known as the Presidential Palace when
North Vietnamese tanks broke through the gates, was bustling with
activity Thursday. Workers were painting the walls and installing
telephone lines for live national television coverage.
</P>
<P>
   For many Vietnamese, Sunday will be a day of happiness, with
20,000 expected to march in the dawn parade, the centerpiece of
festivities marking Vietnam's ouster of foreign troops and the
then-divided country's reunification.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very excited because we are celebrating national
reunification,'' said Nguyen Cong Hien, a security guard at the
palace.
</P>
<P>
   But for Khanh Siu, 26, of Seattle, who grew up in Vietnam but
left for the United States when she was 17, the festivities held no
interest. Returning for vacation, she planned to spend the weekend
at Vietnam's beaches.

<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Fusaichi Pegasus, the Kentucky Derby
favorite, tossed an exercise rider and fell but was not injured
during a morning workout Thursday at Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Neil Drysdale said the Wood Memorial winner went through
his daily morning trot without a hitch. But as he was being led off
the track, the horse reared onto its hind legs just before reaching
the draw gate. The horse threw exercise rider Nuno Santos to the
dirt, fell to the track and rolled over.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus got up within seconds, and Drysdale grabbed his
bridle, calmed the colt and led him back to his barn.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was doing superbly, and then he felt so good that he reared
up and sat down,'' Drysdale said. ''It startled him a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The trainer joked about the horse's eccentric behavior:
</P>
<P>
   ''When he's in California he can really do some tricks. We may
be coming up to them this week,'' Drysdale said. ''Some mornings
he's a perfect gentleman; some mornings he's feeling so good he
doesn't know what to do with himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky Derby is May 6.

   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Authorities evacuated a day care center with
130 preschool-age children Thursday after hearing complaints that
fumes had made it difficult for some to breathe.
</P>
<P>
   All 130 children and 36 adults at Centre Inc. Day Care were
taken to hospitals as a precaution after the 12:10 p.m. incident
but none were injured, said Robert Resetar, a city emergency
coordinator. All were expected to be released, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Four children and one adult had complained that the fumes
smelled of cleaning fluid and made it difficult to breathe, Resetar
said. Officials took everyone to the hospital because many of the
children were younger than 2 and unable to communicate their
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   State environmental officials found no source of the odor.

   STOCKBRIDGE, Ga. (AP) -- Nancy Lopez is putting off gall bladder
surgery until after the Chick-fil-A Charity Championship, where she
is the tournament host.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am feeling fine, and I played in the pro-am yesterday
without any pain,'' the Hall of Famer said Thursday. ''I have
adjusted my diet to assist in controlling the stomach pain, and
things are going well.''
</P>
<P>
   The 43-year-old golfer will schedule the surgery later. It
requires little recovery time, and she does not expect it to
interrupt her tournament schedule. A year ago, Lopez was forced to
withdraw from the LPGA Championship because of knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ''I look forward to having this taken care of and then playing
out my schedule for the season,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, a winner of 48 tournaments on the LPGA Tour, last won

<HEADLINE> Sabonis May Be Key for Blazers  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Scottie Pippen has hurt the Minnesota
Timberwolves with his quick moves to the basket, timely jump
shooting and punishing defense.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Portland Trail Blazers will be counting on the more
reliable, even plodding style of center Arvydas Sabonis when they
try to eliminate the Timberwolves in Game 3 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Sabonis scored 19 points Wednesday night as the Trail Blazers
built a big fourth-quarter lead and withstood a late charge to win
86-82 and take a 2-0 lead in the best-of-five series. Sabonis had
missed his first six shots and scored just five points in Sunday's
91-88 Game 1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''Arvydas was the difference in the game,'' teammate Greg
Anthony said of Wednesday's performance.
</P>
<P>
   At 7-foot-3 and 292 pounds, the 35-year-old Sabonis looks like a
giant compared with the 7-foot, 250-pound Radoslav Nesterovic. But
the 23-year-old from the former Yugoslav province of Slovenia has
hung in there. He hit both of his shots in the fourth quarter
Wednesday night, and had two big blocks -- on a layup try by Sabonis
and a dunk attempt by Wallace that helped the Timberwolves stay
close in the final two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a good player,'' Sabonis said of Nesterovic. ''He's
young, but for his time in the playoffs, I think he plays good
defense. He causes me problems.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine now, but when Sabonis was drafted by the
Blazers in 1986, he was booed by fans at the team's draft party at
Memorial Coliseum. Sabonis was an unknown commodity in this
country. And Walter Berry, the college player of the year that
season out of St. John's, got all the cheers as the other Portland
first-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   Berry played just seven games before he was traded to San
Antonio for Kevin Duckworth, and Berry has been out of the league
since the 1990-91 season. Sabonis, in his fifth NBA season after
years of success in Europe, is still around, lumbering up the court
and playing a pivotal role in the Blazers' quest for their first
title since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen has been the undisputed star of the playoffs for
Portland, averaging 24.5 points in the two games -- nearly twice his
season average of 12.5. After his season-high 28 points in Game 1,
Pippen came back with 21 Wednesday night. During the regular
season, he scored at least 21 points only six times, and just twice
in the last 29 games.
</P>
<P>
   But the offense starts with Sabonis, who can bull inside and
draw a foul, put up a soft hook shot, pass the ball deftly out of
traffic or, when he's away from the basket, knock down a perimeter
shot.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's so big that he gets double-teams,'' Portland guard Steve
Smith said. ''He passes so well, he causes so many problems. When
he misses the shot, he usually is standing right there to tip it
back in.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabonis also might be helped more than anybody by the long
layoffs between games. He wears black sleeves on his creaky knees,
and his agility was further slowed by a right foot sprain that
knocked him out of 10 games late in the season.
</P>
<P>
   Sabonis struggled in the fourth quarter of Game 1, when the
Blazers started out with a nine-point lead but let the Timberwolves
back in the game. Sabonis missed his first four shots, all under
the basket, before hitting an 18-foot jumper that put the Blazers
ahead 81-77 with 1:45 left.
</P>
<P>
   ''You must always be alert,'' Nesterovic said. ''What is he
going to do? You have to focus on trying to take away his
strengths, but he can shoot from the outside and he's good around
the basket. I just try to stay focused and stay in front of him
wherever he wants to go.''

<HEADLINE> Sprewell Success Begs Trade Question  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN, AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Knicks general manager Scott Layden stood
outside the locker room with three Madison Square Garden
executives, keeping a straight face when somebody said: ''Good
thing you didn't trade him.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of Layden's lieutenants burst out laughing -- nervous,
relieved laughter.
</P>
<P>
   It was no joke last fall, though, when Layden seriously
considered trading Latrell Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were talking to Seattle, Houston and the Lakers, but how
close they actually came to trading him I can't say for sure,'' an
opposing Eastern Conference general manager said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Layden is known to have spoken to the SuperSonics about a
Sprewell-Gary Payton trade, to the Rockets about a Sprewell-Pippen
trade before Pippen was dealt to Portland, and to Los Angeles about
a Sprewell-Glen Rice trade.
</P>
<P>
   No deal ever came off, and Layden now has the luxury of knowing
that the best trades -- as general managers often say -- are the ones
that don't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell outdid Vince Carter once again Wednesday night, giving
his second straight superstar-caliber performance to lead the
Knicks to an 84-83 victory over the Toronto Raptors.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell scored 13 of the Knicks' final 17 points, most of them
coming off one-on-one isolation plays with Carter helpless to stop
him. It was a performance reminiscent of Sprewell's mano-a-mano
battle with Tim Duncan in Game 5 of the NBA Finals last year, which
until this past week was Sprewell's brightest moment in a Knicks
uniform.
</P>
<P>
   With New York holding a 2-0 lead in the best-of-five series that
resumes Sunday, no one is more responsible that Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   His defense in Game 1 was a big reason why Carter shot 3-for-20.
His short jumper from the lane with 7.9 seconds left in Game 2 won
it.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last one was vintage Latrell,'' coach Jeff Van Gundy said.
''Hard, two dribbles, pull up and shoot over a great shot blocker
in Carter.''
</P>
<P>
   Odd as it might seem, the Knicks actually considered trading
Sprewell last October, even before he blew off training camp
without the courtesy of a phone call to explain his absence.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell averaged 18.6 points for the Knicks, leading the team
in scoring 28 times while playing small forward instead of his
natural shooting guard position.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 1{ years after re-entering the league following his
controversial attack on Golden State coach P.J. Carlesimo, Sprewell
has been lauded all season by Van Gundy for his unselfishness.
</P>
<P>
   But it's his star power that makes Sprewell so valuable, and it
has re-emerged against the Raptors and their young star, Carter.
</P>
<P>
   The two have been making eye contact during the games, but there
has been no trash-talking or bad blood -- even after Sprewell
flagrantly fouled Carter, bringing him down by the shoulders, near
the end of Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing but respect,'' was how Sprewell characterized the duel
between the two, objecting when someone suggested it was a budding
rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Down the stretch of Game 2, Sprewell had the added advantage of
knowing Carter was playing with five fouls.
</P>
<P>
   It allowed him to be aggressive with the dribble and drive to
his right, even though Carter and the Raptors' coaching staff knew
that Sprewell doesn't go to his left quite as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once I got into foul trouble, it was hard for me to judge how
to play him because I didn't know what I could get away with and
how close I could play him,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   After Sprewell put the Knicks ahead, Carter got the ball for the
final shot and was isolated at the top of the 3-point circle
against Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   With Sprewell daring him to drive left, Carter left his feet and
decided in mid-air to pass to Dee Brown. The Raptors got a
wide-open shot, but not from the player expected to take it.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who hadn't even attempted a shot all night, missed.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the ball comes to you, you have to hit that shot. But it's
tough when you've been sitting,'' Brown said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Wind Power for Denver Agencies  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT WELLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- All federal agencies in the Denver area will be
powered in part by wind under the biggest-ever federal contract for
''green power,'' Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The agencies have agreed to buy 10 megawatts of power yearly
from wind farms operated by Public Service Co. of Colorado and
other utilities, Richardson said. That's enough energy to supply
3,500 households for a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe this is the single largest purchase of green power
ever by federal agencies,'' said Richardson, who last week ordered
his agency to make sure it buys at least 7.5 percent of its power
from renewable sources.
</P>
<P>
   Public Service began developing the first commercial wind farm
three years ago, according to the agency's general manager, Chuck
Fuller. The farm, near the Wyoming line, has 15 turbines that are
26 stories tall with 900-pound, 32-foot-long blades. Six more
turbines are being built, and Richardson's agency has provided a $3
million grant.
</P>
<P>
   Public Service has 15,000 wind-power customers and has a waiting
list of more potential users, Fuller said.
</P>
<P>
   Wind-power users don't get their energy directly from the site,
but through the regional power grid that delivers electricity to
users in Colorado and other Western states. The wind-power buyers
agree to be billed extra to pay the added cost.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said the wind power will cost about 2 percent more
than conventional power, but the cost is offset by reduced
pollution and less dependence on foreign oil.

<HEADLINE> Pa. Coroner Blames Heartburn Study  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A hospital study designed to test a heartburn
remedy on children was partially to blame for the death of a
9-month-old boy, a coroner ruled.
</P>
<P>
   When Gage Stevens died in November, Allegheny County Coroner
Cyril Wecht blamed sudden infant death syndrome, but on Tuesday, he
amended the death certificate to say the boy's inclusion in a study
of the drug Propulsid was also a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Janssen Pharmaceutical Inc. of Titusville, N.J., a subsidiary of
Johnson &AMP; Johnson, announced last month after consulting with the
Food and Drug Administration that it would stop marketing the drug,
also called cisapride, but would make it available on a limited
basis to some patients.
</P>
<P>
   The drug has been associated with heart rhythm abnormalities and
80 deaths, though the FDA said it can't prove the drug caused any
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Don Fischer, medical director of Children's Hospital, said
Thursday there would be no way an autopsy could show whether Gage
died from an abnormal heartbeat, and he had no medical history of
it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot say that cisapride contributed to his death,''
Fischer said. ''I'm not sure that we will ever know how he died.''
</P>
<P>
   Fischer said thousands of children had taken the drug. ''This
was a highly effective drug in treating congenital abnormalities,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The baby's parents, Scott Stevens and Gretchen Stewart of
Munhall, said they signed a consent form at the hospital that
incorrectly said the drug was approved by the FDA for infants.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Wednesday, Children's Hospital officials
admitted the form was wrong. They said it told parents the drug was
approved because officials believed approval was imminent. They
also said the form listed the drug's potential side effects and
risks, including heart rhythm problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to believe that it was verbally communicated to them in
an appropriate way,'' Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bonnie Stevens, the boy's grandmother, said Gage's parents
did not know the risks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were not aware it could cause heart problems,'' said
Stevens, a retired registered nurse. ''Who in their right mind
would give it to a baby if they knew that?''
</P>
<P>
   Gage, who suffered from heartburn and chronic diarrhea, had been
enrolled in the study for six months when he died. He was one of
100 children participating in a clinical trial to determine the
safety of the drug to treat gastroesophageal reflux in children.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital halted the trial in March after the FDA told
officials of a possible link between the drug and Gage's death.
</P>
<P>
   Wecht said he reopened the case after being contacted by the
''CBS Evening News'' and reviewing additional information from the
baby's family and the FDA. CBS first reported the link between
Gage's death and the drug Wednesday.

Court Hears Graphic Details of Bernardo's Sex-and-torture Tapes
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. CATHARINES, Ontario (AP) -- Lawyers, spectators and courtroom
staff sat in mortified silence Thursday during a graphic,
profanity-laced description of sex killer Paul Bernardo's chilling
sex-and-torture videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   Austin Cooper, who is defending Bernardo's former lawyer Ken
Murray, spent the day grimly reciting details of the tapes Murray
recovered from his notorious client's home in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes depict sexual assaults by Bernardo and ex-wife Karla
Homolka on four teen-age girls, including Homolka's slain sister
Tammy and murder victims Leslie Mahaffy and Kristen French.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper was trying to counter the Crown's suggestion Wednesday
that Murray, on trial for obstruction of justice, intended to
protect his client by suppressing the tapes for more than 16
months.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran defense lawyer clearly didn't relish his task; he
had barely begun Thursday when he became so overcome with emotion
he was forced to ask Justice Patrick Gravely for a brief recess.

Sour Gas Probe Considered As Oilpatch Bomber Begins Jail Term
</P>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- As oilpatch bomber Wiebo Ludwig begins
his jail term, the concerns over sour gas that helped put him there
may result in a public inquiry by Alberta's energy regulator.
</P>
<P>
   A decision will be made ''within days'' as to whether the Energy
and Utilities Board will grant Ludwig's request for such an
inquiry, board spokesman Greg Gilbertson said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Although some dispute the board's effectiveness, an inquiry
would be the latest in a series of responses it has made to growing
public concern about the deadly but lucrative resource.
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig, 58, blames pollution from the energy industry for health
problems on his northwestern Alberta farm. He and several others
asked for an inquiry into sour gas in October 1998. But once
criminal charges were laid against Ludwig the following March, the
board decided to wait until the trial was over.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Ludwig was sentenced to 28 months in jail after
being convicted on two counts of bombing and cementing in wellsites
and three dynamite possession charges.

Alberta Premier Ralph Klein's Son-in-law Convicted of Bigamy
</P>
<P>
   CALGARY (AP) -- It appears Alberta Premier Ralph Klein
unwittingly performed a marriage ceremony uniting his daughter to a
bigamist.
</P>
<P>
   Klein's son-in-law, Richard Philip Marcia, 37, was sentenced
recently to 30 days in jail after he pleaded guilty to bigamy in a
court in Drumheller, 130 kilometers northeast of Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   The premier, a licensed commissioner, officiated at the Oct. 4,
1997, wedding of his daughter Angela Klein to Marcia in the Alberta
government's Calgary office.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman in Klein's office said the premier would not talk
about the conviction, although he has said he knew nothing of the
previous marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Crown prosecutor Darlene Oco told the Drumheller provincial
court that Marcia was married to Angi Mari Marcia of Regina in
September 1994 and did not make any divorce attempt before he wed
Angela Klein-Marcia.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Gordon Clozza gave Marcia credit for an early plea but
added bigamy should hold some serious consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia was already serving 2{ years in prison for property
charges, including theft and possession of stolen property. His
30-day bigamy sentence is to be served after that.

Vancouver Aquarium To Stop Keeping Whales in Captivity
</P>
<P>
   VANCOUVER (AP) -- The Vancouver Public Aquarium is phasing out
its killer whale display, an exhibit that has been the mainstay of
the aquarium for decades.
</P>
<P>
   The last killer whale in the aquarium -- Bjossa -- will go to a
Seaworld in the United States, Dick Bradshaw, chairman of the
aquarium's marine sciences centre, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Bradshaw said Bjossa is being moved because the aquarium hasn't
been able to find a companion for her and she needs to be with her
own species.
</P>
<P>
   Bjossa was recently sick with an infection. Her former poolmate
Finna died in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The aquarium said it will continue to keep dolphins, sea lions,
seals and otters.
</P>
<P>
   Animal rights activists have been lobbying for years for an end
to the whale display.

<HEADLINE> Davis Will Sign Racial Profiling Ban  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE LAWRENCE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis says he will sign a bill
barring police from stopping motorists because of their race, seven
months after he vetoed a measure designed to reveal the extent of
the practice.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic governor and the author of the earlier bill,
state Sen. Kevin Murray, said Thursday they agreed on legislation
that would ban so-called racial profiling of motorists.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would expand diversity training for police and require
officers who are not working undercover to give their business
cards to motorists they stop but don't cite or arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Murray said the business card provision would make it easier for
motorists who think they were the victims of racial discrimination
to file complaints and make it easier to prove discrimination in
court.
</P>
<P>
   ''We make it clear what racial profiling is and make it clear
that you cannot do it,'' said Murray, who is black. ''There's no
esoteric argument about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Last September, Davis vetoed a Murray bill that attempted to
document the extent of racial profiling by ordering the highway
patrol and other major California law enforcement agencies to keep
track of the race of the motorists their officers stop.
</P>
<P>
   Davis spokesman Michael Bustamante said the new bill was an
improvement because it would not ''presume guilt on the part of law
enforcement ... nor mandate that extraordinary records be kept when
law enforcement, on a daily basis, has enough to do.''

<HEADLINE> Franco, Kuehne Share Shell Golf Lead  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL A. LUTZ, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE WOODLANDS, Texas (AP) -- Carlos Franco and 1998 U.S. Amateur
champion Hank Kuehne shot 7-under-par 65s on Thursday to share the
first-round lead in the Shell Houston Open.
</P>
<P>
   Franco, who shuns the driving range and shows up as late as
possible for rounds, arrived at the tournament Tuesday after
spending the Easter holiday with his family in Paraguay. He brought
a supply of chipas, a cornbread-like food to remind him of home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I brought them down here so I could eat them, to give me
power,'' Franco joked, flexing his biceps.
</P>
<P>
   Something worked for Franco. He teed off with the morning group
under clear, cool conditions and finished with eight birdies and
one bogey, equaling the 65 he shot in the first round of the Honda
Classic for his low round this year.
</P>
<P>
   Franco had 15-foot birdie putts on the fourth and fifth holes
and his only bogey came on No. 10 after he hit a 9-iron to the
left. He birdied three straight holes, finishing with a 2-foot
birdie putt on No. 14.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hit a 7-iron 2 feet from the pin,'' he said. ''That was a
great shot, my best shot of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuehne went right to work, starting on the back nine. He had
pars on the first two holes and then ran in birdies on seven of the
next eight holes to tie Franco for the lead.
</P>
<P>
   He bogeyed the par-4 fourth hole to drop a shot back, but
birdied No. 8 to tie for the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been working hard on my game, it comes as easily as it
goes,'' said Kuehne, who turned pro last June.
</P>
<P>
   ''Honestly, it seems like another day of work. You come in each
day and the emotions are the same. It's great to be the co-leader,
but the emotions are the same if I shoot 7 under or 3 over.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Stadler, Kevin Sutherland, Brian Gay and Jerry Smith
opened with 66s on the TPC at The Woodlands. Doug Barron, Fred
Funk, Dave Stockton Jr. and Paul Stankowski shot 67s.
</P>
<P>
   Stadler had the second double-eagle 2 on the PGA Tour this year,
holing a 245-yard 3-wood shot in the 521-yard 15th hole.
</P>
<P>
   ''No matter where it was, I knew I'd have a putt for an eagle,''
Stadler said. ''It just flew right of the fringe and took a little
bounce. I couldn't see it from there. It went kind of down over
that little rise. In she went.''
</P>
<P>
   Not many fans got to see the shot.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe 10 or 15 (fans) and probably eight of them were
marshals,'' Stadler said. ''There were maybe 100-150 people around,
but not many of them were at the green.
</P>
<P>
   David Sutherland's double eagle at the Honda Classic is the only
other one on the PGA Tour this year.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Sutton, with victories in two of his last three tournaments,
shot a 71. Defending champion Stuart Appleby of Australia shot a
69.
</P>
<P>
   John Daly and John Cook had an interesting time on No. 13, a
par-5 that features and an island greens with two bridges that
stick out like rabbit ears on a TV.
</P>
<P>
   Daly's ball rolled through the green and stopped on the bridge
on the right. Cook, playing in the same group, hit his approach on
the left bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Daly finished with a 74, and Cook shot a 69.

<HEADLINE> Student suspended for threatening to 'shoot' classmate with paperwad  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PLAINSBORO, N.J. (AP) -- A fourth-grader at a Middlesex County
elementary school has been suspended and ordered to undergo a
psychological evaluation after telling a classmate he was going to
''shoot'' another student with a wad of paper launched from a
rubber band, according to a published report.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hagood told The Times of Trenton he only intended to
fling a piece a paper at the student on April 12. But his use of
the word ''shoot'' prompted the school district to implement its
zero-tolerance policy for school violence.
</P>
<P>
   Kamaria Hagood said her son told a classmate he planned to shoot
a ''paper wasp'' at a girl in their class. A paper wasp is a piece
of paper launched with a rubber band, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of another student apparently heard about the
conversation and notified the district. The district then alerted
police, district spokeswoman Geraldine Hutner told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess they just overhead 'shoot' and ran with that,'' Mrs.
Hagood said.
</P>
<P>
   Hutner said district reports on the incident are considered
confidential, and she wouldn't elaborate on what happened at the
Upper Elementary School in Plainsboro.
</P>
<P>
   The Hagoods said the matter was handled in an insensitive
manner. Two police officers came to the Hagood's home at 12:30 a.m.
to question the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are obligated to investigate things of that nature right
away,'' said Plainsboro Police Capt. Timothy Matheny. ''If it were
(a gun), we would have really heard it if we waited until (the next
day).''
</P>
<P>
   The Hagoods said the district's insistence on a psychological
evaluation was unfair.
</P>
<P>
   The district spokeswoman said the exam is not considered a
punishment. ''We just wanted to make sure that students were
safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hagoods consented to the exam to get their son back in
school as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   More than a year after the Columbine High School killings,
schools across the country are still using a heavy hand to dole out
disciplinary measures for behavior that previously would not raise
many eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   In March, four kindergarten students in Sayreville were
suspended for playing cops and robbers on the school playground.
</P>
<P>
   Hagood said he believes a Michigan incident, in which a
6-year-old boy fatally shot a classmate, may have skewed the
investigation of Michael.
</P>
<P>
   ''In that shooting, an African-American boy shot a Caucasian
girl. And in our case you are talking about an African-American
male and a Caucasian female. That sends all kinds of waves. I think
race had something to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutner said race was not a factor.
</P>
<P>
   The Hagoods sent a letter of complaint to school Superintendent
John Fitzsimons, the school board and several administrators. A
copy of the letter was sent to the NAACP and the New Jersey Black
Ministers Council.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Hagood said he is considering a lawsuit, but may settle for

<HEADLINE> Money Sought in No Gun Ri Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Three lawyers for South Korean
survivors of an alleged wartime mass killing by U.S. soldiers urged
Washington on Thursday to expedite its probe of the case and
compensate survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are rumors that the U.S. government is dragging its feet
on the investigation it has promised to finish by the end of
June,'' Michael Choi, a lawyer from Philadelphia, told a news
conference in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Choi and two other American lawyers -- Robert Swift and Michael
Goss -- were in town for interviews with survivors of the Korean War
incident and a visit to the scene of the alleged mass killing.
</P>
<P>
   They warned that a delay in the U.S. investigation could result
in a lawsuit by the Korean survivors in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After the scene of the alleged incident in central South Korea,
the lawyers said they were appalled at the ''clear evidence of the
massacre,'' including bullet fragments stuck in cement holes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't a massacre. It was an annihilation of the villagers,
every single villager,'' Choi said in a telephone interview after
the visit.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting dozens of Korean survivors and American veterans, The
Associated Press reported in September that retreating U.S.
soldiers killed unarmed Korean civilians during the early days of
the 1950-53 Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors say 400 were killed, including many cowering under a
railroad bridge.
</P>
<P>
   They had been telling their story for years, but their accounts
had been dismissed by officials in Washington and in Seoul. After
the AP report, however, both the U.S. and South Korean governments
began investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The Army said last fall that its investigation could take a
year, but officials have said since that they are hoping it might
be completed by June, when Seoul and Washington plan special
ceremonies to mark the 50th anniversary of the start of the Korean
War on June 25

<HEADLINE> Pair win major awards for their inventions  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE WATSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A doctor whose desire to make medical products
better initiated a wave of less invasive surgery has won the
world's largest single award for inventors.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas J. Fogarty was given the Lemelson-Massachusetts
Institute of Technology prize -- along with $500,000 -- for American
invention and innovation during Thursday evening's award
celebration at the American Museum of Natural History.
</P>
<P>
   Fogarty, who has 63 U.S. patents in surgical devices, is best
known for creating the world's first balloon catheter for
cardiovascular therapy in 1963. The device pioneered the effort to
make surgery less invasive and led to a technique for treating
blocked arteries.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 million people have benefited from catheter-related
technology -- some of whom would have lost limbs under previous
methods.
</P>
<P>
   While the technique is now a staple of modern medicine, getting
doctors to accept it proved to be difficult at the time, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was such as radical deviation ... that they questioned it,
whether it would work, whether it was safe,'' Fogarty said, adding
that the process of getting people to use an invention is the final
obstacle for inventors.
</P>
<P>
   Since the innovation, Fogarty continued inventing by starting
and assisting more than a three dozen companies. He helped form a
venture capital fund, which works with young inventors who are
developing medical devices.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Jerome H. Lemelson established the Lemelson-MIT Program
with his wife, Dorothy, to honor the nation's finest inventors and
encourage youngsters to follow in their steps. Lemelson, who died
in 1997, had nearly 500 patents for many everyday devices,
including parts used in camcorders, computers and personal radios.
</P>
<P>
   ''We love inventors. We love innovation, and we would love to
see more of it,'' said Lester Thurow, the chairman of the
Lemelson-MIT prize board.
</P>
<P>
   Also honored during the evening gala was Al Gross for a lifetime
of innovation in the communications field.
</P>
<P>
   Gross, who won the Lifetime Achievement Award, created the
world's first walkie-talkie, built the first pager system during
World War II, and today assists a corporation in aerospace
technology.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona man once studied under Albert Einstein and continues
to get his kicks thinking about people using his inventions.
</P>
<P>
   ''A friend of mine in the CIA told me they had learned Saddam
Hussein has a beeper and a cellular phone,'' Gross said. ''And I
was watching the news once and saw President Clinton reaching down
to his waist and tucking a pager into his pants.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Lemelson said both men could be described as the
typical, yet extremely successful inventor.
</P>
<P>
   ''They contributed to society in a quiet way,'' she said. ''And
these two fellows obviously are very self-motivated and had to pull
themselves up by their bootstraps.''

<HEADLINE> Mexico Sen. OKs Bankruptcy Reform  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- In a move that analysts say will help end
Mexico's 5-year-old domestic credit drought, the Senate approved
Thursday a lower house bill to reform antiquated bankruptcy laws
that banks said prevented new lending.
</P>
<P>
   The new bankruptcy law replaces a 1940s code that allowed
businesses to delay payments to creditors for years, with no
interest-rate penalty for missed payments.
</P>
<P>
   The new code, already approved by the Chamber of Deputies, will
go into effect later this year. Mexican banks, citing legal
problems in collecting on debts, have offered few new loans to
businesses and consumers here since the 1994 peso crisis.

<HEADLINE> Nike Ends Talks With U. of Michigan  </HEADLINE>
By JIM IRWIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Nike Inc. said Thursday that it has ended
negotiations on the renewal of a six-year, multimillion-dollar
licensing agreement with the University of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   University president Lee Bollinger accused the company of
retaliating against Michigan for its involvement with the Worker
Rights Consortium, a student-driven coalition of schools demanding
that Nike provide better labor conditions for overseas workers.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Nike chairman Phil Knight withdrew plans to donate
$30 million to his alma mater, the University of Oregon, after that
school joined the consortium.
</P>
<P>
   ''Michigan seems to be the next target of a major attempt by
Nike to breach understandings and make some kind of corporate
statement,'' Bollinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Nike did not disclose the dollar value of the proposed new
contract with Michigan, one of 200 colleges and universities with
which it has licensing agreements.
</P>
<P>
   But the new deal would have been what Nike called its largest
university ''partnership'' -- providing funding and Nike footwear,
apparel and equipment to all 25 men's and women's varsity teams and
recreational sports programs through August 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Under Michigan's existing deal with Nike, which expires Aug. 31,
the company annually pays the athletic department $590,000.
</P>
<P>
   Nike also supplies $930,000 in products to be Michigan's
exclusive sporting goods provider -- and gets a promotional boost
from placing its logo on uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Kit Morris, Nike's director of college sports marketing, said in
a statement that the breakdown of talks with Michigan had nothing
to do with the university's membership in the Worker Rights
Consortium. But Morris said one of the changes Michigan sought in
the proposed contract -- regarding labor issues -- was
''problematic.''
</P>
<P>
   That change, Morris said, ''would give the university unilateral
authority to impose any standards, guidelines or principles that
they should adopt over the six-year term of the agreement, and that
kind of open-checkbook agree is something that we're simply
unprepared to agree to.''

<HEADLINE> Study Examines Flame Retardants  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Half the chemicals proposed by the government
for making upholstered furniture flame-resistant could pose a
health risk to people exposed to them in the home, a scientific
panel said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While researchers found eight of the 16 candidate flame
retardants to be safe, not enough information was available to say
the others wouldn't cause health problems, including cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Studies are needed on the other eight to find out how much
exposure people would actually have to these chemicals if they were
used on home furniture,'' said Donald Gardner, chairman of the
National Research Council panel that wrote the report. The council,
part of the National Academy of Sciences, advises the government on
scientific and technological issues.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner noted that none of the tested chemicals are currently
being used in the United States on furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Fires started on upholstered furniture are among the leading
causes of residential fire deaths, according to the Consumer
Product Safety Commission. The fires are often caused by small open
flames from matches, cigarette lighters and candles.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, the safety commission has been considering a
flammability standard for all residential upholstered furniture
sold in the United States. This prompted Congress to request a
study on the health risks posed by the flame-retardant chemicals
likely to be used to treat furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rep. Roger Wicker, whose Mississippi district
includes 30,000 furniture workers, wrote the House provision
requiring the study.
</P>
<P>
   Wicker said he wants to make sure the safety commission, by
pushing for flammability regulation, ''doesn't unnecessarily
endanger the health and safety of consumers, workers, and the
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   If the standard is enacted, the chemicals would be applied to as
much as 600 million square yards of fabric each year in the United
States, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The panel did not conduct its own testing, but gathered and
analyzed existing research on the chemicals. Because there were few
studies available, the panel intentionally overestimated the
possible exposure people would have from the treated furniture.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Jobless Rate Remains at High  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's unemployment rate in March remained at a
record high 4.9 percent, unchanged from February, the Management
and Coordination Agency announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The overall figure was better than the 5.0 percent economists
had forecast, but the rise in the rate for men to 5.2 percent from
February's 5.1 percent underscored the severity of the job
situation.
</P>
<P>
   The total number of jobless rose 100,000 from a year ago to a
record high 3.49 million, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa expressed concern, and
said the government must consider new job expansion measures.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have repeated that the job situation is not in good shape.
We had better compile new steps,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment also touched 4.9 percent in June and July last
year.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, the Labor Ministry said in a separate
survey that labor demand improved slightly in March, with 53 jobs
offered to every hundred people seeking work compared to 52 in
February.
</P>
<P>
   The new job offers ratio rose to 0.97 from 0.93, showing that
there were 97 new jobs available for every 100 people seeking work.
</P>
<P>
   The world's second-largest economy is struggling to emerge from
its deepest slump in decades, forcing companies to trim payrolls
and give up the custom of guaranteeing employees a job for life.

</P>
<P>
   ''My view is, that's a pretext for taking punitive actions
against universities for their very moderate and prudent efforts to
ensure that their products are made consistent with well-accepted
standards of international human rights,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nike recently has increased its minimum age requirement for
footwear workers to an industry-high 18 years of age; improved
indoor air quality of its footwear factories; raised wages for its
Indonesian footwear workers by more than 70 percent over the past
20 months; and established after-hours education programs for its
footwear workers, Morris said.

<HEADLINE> Georgetown Wins Women's Relay Race  </HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL, AP Track Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Having four runners who are used to the cold
paid off for Georgetown in the women's 3,200-meter relay in the
Penn Relays on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   With the temperature at an unspringlike 43 degrees and rain
falling intermittently, the Hoyas runners from Oregon and New York
breezed to a 25-meter victory over defending champion Florida in 8
minutes, 34.37 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ''The weather was a factor, but we made sure we warmed up
well,'' leadoff runner Tyrona Heath from Endicott, N.Y., said after
Georgetown's third victory in five years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The weather doesn't make for ideal times, but we're used to
running in weather like this,'' anchor runner Sasha Spencer from
Salem, Ore., said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the unfavorable weather, a crowd of 20,456 -- the largest
Thursday attendance in the meet's 106-year history -- showed up at
Franklin Field. The previous mark was 19,815 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Heath opened the relay with a solid 2:08.6 leg for 800 meters,,
putting Georgetown in second place, just behind Florida's Erin
Merten.
</P>
<P>
   Nickay Penado from Brooklyn, N.Y., followed with 2:09.2, but it
was good enough to give the Hoyas an 8-meter lead over the Gators.
Katrina de Boer from West Linn, Ore., turned in the fastest leg,
2:08.2, lengthening the lead to 35 meters, and Spencer finished
with 2:08.4.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same foursome that finished fourth last year in a
faster time, 8:31.68. The weather slowed the Hoyas this year, but
not their desire to win.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't matter how fast you run, it's how competitive you
are,'' Spencer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We felt we could break it open on any carry,'' coach Ron
Helmer said. ''Nickay broke it open a little, then Katrina really
pulled away.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer and Helmer also emphasized the importance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   ''Georgetown has a huge tradition at the Penn Relays and it's
important to retain the legacy we have here,'' Spencer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said we need to win the first race, so we can have a good
time the rest of the week,'' Helmer said. ''To start with a win is
huge.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know we can run. We may not win another race, but we are
capable. This is where we felt we had the best chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Heath and Penado also ran on Georgetown's team that won its heat
in the 1,600 relay and qualified for Saturday's final.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Peta-Gay Gayle became the first woman from Alabama to
win an individual running event in the history of the Relays,
taking the 400 hurdles at 57.85.
</P>
<P>
   Gayle benefitted from the absence of the two favorites, Tanya
Jarrett and Angel Patterson, both from Texas. Jarrett won the race
last year, while Patterson beat her teammate at the recent Texas
Relays.
</P>
<P>
   Gayle, a transfer from Central Arizona Community College, was
the national junior college runner-up in the 400 hurdles and 400
sprint in 1998 and the Pan Am junior champion in the hurdles in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett and Patterson were late scratches because Texas coach
Bev Kearney did not want to risk running them in the cold
conditions too often.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett and Patterson did run on Texas' 1,600-meter relay team
that qualified for Saturday's final.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Longhorns, seeking their sixth consecutive title,
did not have an easy time. Their first runner, Natasha Neal, was
bumped around badly, getting pushed three times, and No. 2 runner
Jarrett had a foot stepped on and lost a shoe right at the start of
her leg. Still, the Longhorns won their heat at 3:40.50, with the
help of Patterson's anchor of 53.6.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh had the fastest heat time, 3:37.09.
</P>
<P>
   Texas had a more comfortable time in advancing to Friday's final
in the 400 relay. The Longhorns, seeking their second straight
title, led all qualifiers at 45.25.
</P>
<P>
   The long distance races provided some interesting developments.
</P>
<P>
   Marjo Venalainen, a 28-year-old from Finland competing as a
sophomore for Division II Kennesaw State, a school about a
half-hour north of Atlanta, won the women's 3,000 in 9:19.09,
upsetting defending champion Amy Yoder of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Competing against Yoder and other big-name runners from
high-profile schools didn't faze Venalainen, who attends school
with her husband of 5 1-2 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been competing in Europe,'' she said. ''I didn't even
know about those people and those schools. I hadn't heard about the
Penn Relays until I came to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's Steve Slattery, competing in his first 3,000-meter
steeplechase this year, came from behind on the final lap and won
in 8:35.15.
</P>
<P>
   ''I train with the best training partner in the U.S. -- Mark
Davis,'' Slattery said. ''If I can run with him for a workout, I am
confident I can run with any collegian.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreigners won the men's and women's college 5,000s.
</P>
<P>
   Silah Masoi, 25, from Kenya, took the men's race in a pedestrian
13:45.87, leading a 1-2 Life finish, and Virginia Commonwealth's
Maria Elena Calle, the runner-up in last year's 3,000, won the
women's event in 16:06.03.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Johnson of Georgia Tech rallied in the stretch to win the
women's 10,000 at 34:31.30, and Steve Bohan of West Virginia took
the men's 10,000 at 29:04.37, meeting the NCAA qualifying standard.

<HEADLINE> Dole: No Glass Ceiling To Presidency  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE PFLEGER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole says her campaign for president
was about ''cutting-edge'' policies, inspiring voters, blue jeans
and motor cycles.
</P>
<P>
   But more importantly, it showed ''there is no glass ceiling at
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,'' the former Republican candidate said of
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Dole on Thursday night recounted her stint on the campaign trail
for about 600 women and a few men attending a dinner at the
Republican Women Leaders Forum.
</P>
<P>
   She told the story of an 11-year-old girl at a town hall meeting
in Nevada, Iowa, who asked whether Dole's face would be carved into
Mount Rushmore if she was elected.
</P>
<P>
   She talked about her proposals to protect children from gun
violence and Internet pornography, to help farmers and boost
critical economic sectors, such as the high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   And Dole described an unusual ride to a campaign event in New
Hampshire -- on the back of a motorcycle plastered with a ''Dole for
President'' bumper sticker.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Dole said, she had to stop at Wal-Mart for blue jeans. But
she startled GOP rival Steve Forbes when she ''roared'' up to the
podium.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now that is one way for a candidate to connect with voters,''
Dole boasted.
</P>
<P>
   Dole did not address the possibility of running with George W.
Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. But she
graciously accepted applause when Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash.,
introduced her as a person on Bush's ''short list'' of potential
running mates.
</P>

   Dole also addressed her viability against Democratic candidate
Al Gore, saying: ''It did me proud to see those polls where I was
beating Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole, the wife of Bob Dole, the 1996 Republican presidential
candidate, dropped her bid to become the country's first female
president last October.
</P>
<P>
   She said she believed her campaign failed because she ''started
cold,'' without campaign funds or an organization after resigning
her post as president of the nonpartisan American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew the political odds were against me,'' Dole said. ''But
in the end ... it isn't how heavy the odds are, but how deeply you
believe in matters.''

<HEADLINE> Maple Leafs 2, Devils 1  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN WAWROW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- The New Jersey Devils stifled Mats Sundin and the
Toronto Maple Leafs' top line, but couldn't stop third-liners
Wendel Clark and Darcy Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker, set up by Clark, scored 1:18 into the third period as
the Maple Leafs opened their second-round playoff series with a 2-1
victory Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Dmitri Yushkevich also scored, and Curtis Joseph stopped 32
shots as the Leafs won their third straight playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   Petr Sykora scored for the Devils, who lost for the first time
in the playoffs after a four-game sweep of the Florida Panthers in
the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 of the best-of-seven series is Saturday in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey outshot Toronto 33-21, and all five of the Maple
Leafs' playoff victories have come when the opposing team had more
shots on goal.
</P>
<P>
   Sundin and linemates Steve Thomas and Jonas Hoglund entered the
night accounting for 10 of the Leafs' 17 goals in a six-game
first-round series win over Ottawa, but were shut down by the
Devils.
</P>
<P>
   After trading second-period goals, the Leafs got the go-ahead
spark from their gritty third line.
</P>
<P>
   Clark carried the puck over the New Jersey blue line, stopped
and flipped a high pass to Tucker cutting up the middle. Tucker
batted down the puck, split two New Jersey defensemen and got a
shot off.
</P>
<P>
   Devils goalie Martin Brodeur made the initial stop, but couldn't
control the rebound. Tucker got the puck and snapped it behind the
sprawled goalie.
</P>
<P>
   The third line -- which includes Kevyn Adams -- was the Leafs'
best. Midway through the third period, Clark barreled into the New
Jersey zone and rifled a shot off the post. That got the sellout
crowd on its feet after the next whistle, everyone loudly cheering
Clark who was pictured on the video scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   The line had two more scoring chances after that, including one
during which Tucker was foiled by Brodeur on a breakaway with three
minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph sealed it by smothering Claude Lemieux's from point-blank
range with 1:29 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Yushkevich opened the scoring 1:07 into the second when his
point shot glanced off New Jersey's Sergei Nemchinov and bounced in
through Brodeur's pads.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils tied it less than five minutes later when Sykora
crossed the Toronto blue line and blasted a rising shot into the
top left corner, past Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   It may be the first playoff meeting between the two teams, but
the Maple Leafs staff did their best to try to fire up the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   As Louis Armstrong's ''What A Wonderful World'' played, the
Leafs' mascot Carlton The Bear was featured in a video touring
major U.S. cities. The clip, broadcast on the center-ice
scoreboard, ended abruptly with the mascot standing in a parking
lot in front of a garbage dump, with the caption indicating it to
be Newark, N.J.

<HEADLINE> Race Against Drought in India  </HEADLINE>
By NEELESH MISRA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KURLA, India (AP) -- Millions of desperate villagers scrounged
for food and water in drought-stricken western India Thursday as
the government and United Nations scrambled to provide relief from
the worsening crisis.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 million poor villagers have been affected by the
drought in the western desert state of Rajasthan and adjoining
Gujarat state, officials said. But 30 million others suffer from
water shortages in nine other states in the northern half of the
country, the national government said in a status report published
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of millions of cattle have died, and residents of
thousands of villages have fled their homes to other states.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are accelerating our programs,'' said G. Padmanabhan, a
senior rural development official with the United Nations
Development Program in New Delhi. ''There were several projects
which were to be completed over a year or more. We are now trying
to complete them in two months,'' he said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   The projects include building canals and reservoirs for the
storage and transport of water reserves.
</P>
<P>
   In many areas, villagers waited in vain for help to arrive. But
several used their bare hands to start digging their own tiny
wells, some reaching at about six feet before finding dirty,
brackish water. Then they constructed a circular boundary around
the wells, built a lid with crisscrossed wooden branches and
attached locks to keep others away from the water.
</P>
<P>
   When food and water ran out, the animals started dying. The
villagers fled but anointed their beloved animals with traditional
Hindu markings on their foreheads as a form of blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had 50 sheep. Forty are dead. The others are dying,'' said
Bansi Lal, a shepherd in the Mungre Ki Thani village. He pointed to
the carcasses lying strewn a few hundred yards away from each
other.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three years, nothing has grown on the dusty expanse
outside his village where dense barley fields once made the desert
green for a few months out of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Hungry camels sauntered along a narrow road through a dusty, dry
landscape. They walked past trees and shrubs shorn of leaves, eaten
by hungry goats and sheep.
</P>
<P>
   Since no crops grew, there has been little fodder for the
animals. The relatively rich farmers buy fodder brought from
neighboring states and sold at $3.50 for a maund, a unit of 20
pounds -- twice what the farmers paid earlier.

<HEADLINE> Elian Miami Relatives Bid Denied  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN BACHMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- A federal appeals court Thursday denied a request
by Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives to visit him and declined to
appoint a guardian for the boy other than his father.
</P>
<P>
   But the court still kept the relatives' appeal alive. It put off
a decision on the father's request that he be substituted for
Elian's great-uncle as the boy's representative in the case. Such a
move would allow the father to drop the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The court told the father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, that he could
intervene -- but the judges also said they would not consider
whether to remove the great-uncle from the case until May 11, when
arguments in the relatives' appeal are scheduled to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez cared for the boy for five
months, from his rescue at sea in November until federal agents
returned him to his father Saturday. Lazaro Gonzalez is appealing
the federal government's order that the 6-year-old boy be returned
to his Cuban father.
</P>
<P>
   The great-uncle claims the boy should get an asylum hearing; the
Justice Department contends that only Elian's father can speak for
him on immigration matters such as asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been ordered to stay in the United States until the
appeal is over. He is staying with his father, stepmother and half
brother at a rural retreat in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Miami relatives asked that they, their attorneys
and their doctors be given ''regular and reasonable access'' to
Elian until the court rules on their appeal, or that the court name
an outside guardian to look after him during that time.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th Circuit denied those requests, instead saying it
accepted the government's offer to supply two reports a month about
Elian from a psychiatrist and a social worker.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th Circuit also continued its order barring the boy from
any site in this country that has diplomatic immunity -- a move
designed to keep him from the custody of Cuban diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   ''Finally the court amplified and essentially reaffirmed the
ruling it had previously made to assure that under no way shape or
form is Elian Gonzalez leaving this country for Cuba until after
this appeal is heard,'' said Kendall Coffey, a lawyer for the Miami
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, Attorney General Janet Reno said the armed
agents who seized Elian had to have a ''show of force, not a use of
force, to show we were in control.'' And the psychiatrist who
examined Elian for the government said it's likely he didn't suffer
lasting harm from the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the pre-dawn hours of Saturday were ''the most
appropriate time with the least crowd'' for immigration agents to
conduct the raid. ''This appeared to be the safest time possible to
effect the transfer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian ''has had a lot of bad luck along the way. He's still
resilient, he's still strong, he's still a smiling little boy,''
Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials also said the case, including the
raid, cost more than $578,000 from Thanksgiving Day, when Elian was
found at sea, through Monday. The preliminary estimate does not
include the costs of the family's stay at Andrews Air Force Base
from Saturday through Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A group of nine Cubans left Havana on Thursday to see Elian in
Maryland: four schoolmates from his hometown of Cardenas, four of
their parents and Elian's doctor. President Fidel Castro saw them
off and then criticized U.S. officials for not allowing a larger
group to come. Vans carrying the group arrived Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Castro said that if the family has to wait a month or more for a
court ruling allowing Elian to return, ''it would be better if he
were with people that he knew.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, about 350 people marched in front of the White
House chanting ''Freedom for Elian, Human Rights for Elian.''
Groups arrived by bus or in their own cars from New Jersey,
Florida, and the Washington area, many carrying Cuban and American
flags and signs to protest the government's handling of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the way they took the boy,'' said Civica Perez of
Secaucus, N.J. ''And it's the way they never fight Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   Protesters carried signs denouncing President Clinton, while
many carried reproductions of an Associated Press photo of an armed
federal agent seizing Elian from the Miami home.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Castro had done this I would not have batted an eye,'' said
Marta Sanchez of Silver Spring, Md., whose family left Cuba for the
United States in 1961. ''But in America? Who's running this
country? The military?''

<HEADLINE> SF Official Indicted for Fraud  </HEADLINE>
By BOB EGELKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A city official who approved minority
contracts was indicted for fraud Thursday along with two companies
and four executives who allegedly used a minority contractor as a
front for a white-owned company.
</P>
<P>
   Scott-Norman Mechanical Inc. was fraudulently awarded $55
million in city airport contracts while it was controlled by
white-owned Scott Co. of California, allege indictments returned by
a federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Zula Jones, the second-highest official in the city's Human
Rights Commission, approved Scott-Norman as a minority-owned
company eligible for bid preferences under the city's minority
contracting program, even though she knew it was ineligible, the
indictment said. She faces 16 counts of fraud and making false
statements.
</P>
<P>
   ''The purpose of minority contracting programs is to ensure that
individuals and businesses who have been denied equal access to
public contracts are guaranteed a full and fair opportunity to do
public work,'' U.S. Attorney Robert Mueller said in a statement.
''Those who attempt to obtain fraudulent contracts under this
program deserve to be prosecuted.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has been investigating city contracting programs for
more than a year. Federal agents sealed the offices of the Human
Rights Commission one weekend last July to look for records. In
January, the agency subpoenaed Mayor Willie Brown's office for
records of his meetings with 16 companies and 23 business
executives and staffers connected with the contracting program,
dating to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to let the legal process take its appropriate course
of action,'' Brown spokeswoman Kandace Bender said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' lawyer, Carleton Briggs, declined comment. Jerrold Ladar,
lawyer for Joseph Guglielmo, the president and CEO of Scott Co.,
said Guglielmo had committed no fraud and would be exonerated.
Guglielmo faces 21 counts of fraud and making false statements.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Carey, lawyer for Alvin P. Norman Jr., president of
Scott-Norman Mechanical, did not immediately return a telephone
call to his office. Norman faces 20 counts.
</P>
<P>
   The others indicted are Robert T. Nurisso, Scott Co.'s executive
vice president, and Richard Davis, Scott's vice president and chief
financial officer. They face 20 counts each.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants are due in court May 18. Each charge is
punishable by up to five years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Canada Reviews Vietnam Relations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Canada is reviewing its relations with Vietnam to
protest the execution this week of a Canadian woman convicted of
heroin smuggling, Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite requests by Canadian officials for Vietnam to wait for
police documents that indicated Nguyen Thi Hiep was an unwitting
courier rather than a heroin smuggler, the 43-year-old woman was
executed by firing squad Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This unwarranted action by the Vietnamese government does not,
and cannot, allow for the continuation of 'business as usual'
between our countries,'' Axworthy said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   He said Canada's ambassador to Vietnam, Cecile Latour, who was
in Canada this week, would stay home until ''all aspects of
bilateral relations'' with Vietnam were reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Axworthy also withdrew Canadian officials from a training
program on the World Trade Organization for Vietnamese officials,
and said Canadian officials would be absent from events sponsored
by the Vietnamese government this weekend marking the 25th
anniversary of the end of the Vietnam war.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen moved to Canada from Vietnam in 1982 and became a
Canadian citizen. She and her elderly mother were arrested in 1996
at the Hanoi airport after customs officials found 12 pounds of
heroin in small packets in their suitcase. Her mother, Tran Thi
Cam, 75, remains in a Vietnamese prison serving a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Canada believe Nguyen was asked to bring a package she
believed was artwork to Canada from Vietnam, The Globe and Mail
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the Vietnamese foreign minister, Axworthy asked
that Tran be released on humanitarian grounds and that Nguyen's
remains be turned over to her family, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, Ruben ''Hurricane'' Carter -- a former pro boxer
who was wrongly incarcerated in the United States -- criticized
Vietnam for the execution.
</P>
<P>
   Carter told a news conference held by his Association in Defense
of the Wrongly Convicted that he had asked President Clinton last
year to help Canada pressure Vietnam to call off the execution of
Nguyen.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP)-- Bice Clemow, who drafted and lobbied for
the legislation that became the state's Freedom of Information Act,
died Wednesday. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   During Clemow's nearly 50-year career as a journalist, he was
news editor of Editor &AMP; Publisher magazine, an Associated Press
photo editor and a Time magazine writer.
</P>
<P>
   Clemow is best remembered for his work to draft and get through
the General Assembly the state's freedom of information law in
1975. The Connecticut Council on Freedom of Information gives an
annual award, the Bice Clemow Award, in honor of his effort.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Clemow wrote that the law was needed ''to assure that
public business is done in public and that public records are open
to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemow came to Connecticut in 1939. He launched the Hartford
Newsdaily, a tabloid-style newspaper, the following year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, he started Connecticut Life, a monthly magazine, which
lasted 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1940 and 1947, the year he took over the Metropolitan
News, the predecessor of the West Hartford News, Clemow held
government jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, Clemow stepped down as editor of the West Hartford News
but continued writing weekly columns as a contributing editor. He
wrote regularly until 1992.
Elmer Gertz:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Civil rights attorney Elmer Gertz, whose clients
included Jack Ruby, author Henry Miller and ''thrill killer''
Nathan Leopold, died Thursday. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Gertz became a national figure in the late 1950s, when he won
parole for Leopold, a University of Chicago student convicted in
the 1924 slaying of 14-year-old Bobby Franks. In its time, the case
was called the ''trial of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   He made news again in the early 1960s for defending Miller
against obscenity charges tied to his novel, ''Tropic of Cancer.''
The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately lifted a ban on the book.
</P>
<P>
   Gertz also argued against the death penalty for Jack Ruby, who
was convicted of killing Lee Harvey Oswald, the accused assassin of
President Kennedy. Ruby's death sentence was overturned, but he
died in prison of natural causes in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Gertz was chairman of the Bill of Rights Committee during the
Illinois Constitutional Convention of 1969-1970 and is credited
with including strong civil rights language that became a model for
other states.
</P>
<P>
   Gertz won a libel case in 1983 against the John Birch Society
magazine American Opinion for calling him a ''communist fronter.''
Alfred J. Scalpone:
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Alfred J. Scalpone, a former advertising and
television network executive and writer credited with creating the
slogan ''The family that prays together stays together'' died April
21 of congestive heart failure. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Scalpone was a volunteer consultant for Family Theater
Productions, a nonprofit television and radio production company,
for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   He began an advertising career as an office boy with Young and
Rubicam and became a copywriter, script writer and vice president.
He handled such programs as ''The Burns and Allen Show'' and ''The
Fred Astaire Packard Hour.''
</P>
<P>
   He helped create the Armed Forces Radio Service during World War
II. He also was a vice president for radio and television
programming at McCann Erickson, a vice president of CBS Television
in Los Angeles, and vice president at W.R. Grace &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Scalpone is credited in the Oxford Dictionary of Famous
Quotations as the author of the phrases ''The family that prays
together stays together'' and ''A world at prayer is a world at
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Both phrases were written for the Rev. Patrick Peyton, a Roman
Catholic priest who was the producer of the Family Theater weekly
radio series.

</P>
<P>
   ATHERTON, Calif. (AP) -- Richard S. Shevell, a retired Stanford
University professor who oversaw the design of the DC-10 aircraft,
died April 21 of lymphoma. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   As an engineer for Douglas Aircraft in the late 1960s, Shevell
oversaw the department that produced the designs for the DC-10,
conceived as a wide-bodied three-engine aircraft capable of making
routine coast-to-coast flights.
</P>
<P>
   Shevell took an academic post at Stanford in 1970, just as the
DC-10 was making its first commercial flights for American
Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft became controversial in the 1970s after a series of
crashes and other problems involving a cargo door. Federal Aviation
Administration officials deemed it safe in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 446 DC-10s were built before the model was taken out of
production in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Shevell wrote the 1983 textbook ''Fundamentals of Flight,''
which is still used at Stanford and other universities.
</P>
<P>
   He joined Douglas Aircraft in 1942 and worked there for 28
years.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Approves Basketball Changes  </HEADLINE>
By HANK LOWENKRON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The NCAA Division I board of directors
unanimously approved a package of basketball rules changes
Thursday, including a proposal to eliminate men's summer recruiting
in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ''The board is eliminating summer basketball environments as we
now know it,'' said Penn State president Graham Spanier, chairman
of the board of directors. ''We will scale back in 2001, then we
will replace it in 2002.''
</P>
<P>
   Spanier said the new program is designed to reduce ''the
unsavory influences affecting the lives of young people and the
integrity of our programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaches currently are allowed 24 days of recruiting during the
summer, including attending camps sponsored by shoe manufacturers.
Spanier said while the NCAA cannot prevent the camps from
continuing, it can prohibit coaches from attending them.
</P>
<P>
   The board's actions could be overturned by the membership,
though Spanier said that is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've had fairly broad representations in the discussions
and very strong support nationally from the NCAA's presidents
across the country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The board also approved the formation of a Division I basketball
issues committee, which will be chaired by Syracuse chancellor
Kenneth Shaw. The panel will be asked to design a new approach to
the summer effective in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals were among nine passed two weeks ago by the
Division I Management Council and forwarded to the board for
consideration at its quarterly meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are sending a clear message that there are going to be
changes,'' Spanier said. ''Those must be substantive changes that
return the recruiting and decision making process to athletes, to
parents, to high school coaches and to university coaches and
administrators.''
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA suspended several players this past season who
reportedly received financial support before they began attending
colleges, including gifts and money.
</P>
<P>
   Another change will allow men's and women's basketball recruits
to receive scholarships to attend classes in summer school before
their first semester in college if they enroll in at least six
hours of courses. The NCAA said it will provide $3 million per year
to provide up to 50 percent of an institution's cost for the
program. The program will be a five-year pilot program and be
assessed when it expires.
</P>
<P>
   Another proposal would limit initial scholarships to no more
than five in one year and eight over two years.
</P>
<P>
   The board also approved a two-tier system for punishing student
athletes who engage in forms of sports gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Under the first tier, student athletes who try to influence the
outcome of a game, influence a game's scoring margin, solicit or
accept a bet or take part in any form of gambling involving games
played by their school will permanently lose eligibility in all
college sports.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, student athletes who solicit or accept a bet in any
gambling activity involving intercollegiate athletics or
professional athletics will be ineligible for all regular and
postseason competition for at least a year and also will lose a
year of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   The board also approved legislation that would not allow midyear
transfer student-athletes in men's and women's basketball to be
eligible for competition until the following academic year. This
would apply to both two-year and four-year transfers and would be
effective Aug. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The board also approved the implementation of Life Skills
programs at member schools, programs that would focus on the total
development of student-athletes.

<HEADLINE> Bucks 104, Pacers 91  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE HERMAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Milwaukee Bucks found their offense and
shed a decade of playoff frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Allen and Sam Cassell scored 20 points apiece as Milwaukee
beat Indiana 104-91 Thursday night, the Bucks' first playoff
victory since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks evened the best-of-five Eastern Conference series at
one game apiece, taking the home-court advantage away from the
rattled Pacers as the first-round series heads to Milwaukee for the
next two games on Saturday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks had lost four straight playoff games to the Pacers,
including last year's 3-0 first-round sweep. But the poor shooting
in Sunday's 88-85 loss was forgotten in a hurry. The Bucks never
trailed, hit 15 of 21 shots in the first quarter, built the lead to
27 points late in the second period and to 31 in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers, losing by the largest margin since a 19-point defeat
to Chicago in the 1998 conference finals, never caught up.
</P>
<P>
   Rik Smits, who had 12 points in the first half, was ejected
after putting a forearm to Ervin Johnson's head as they fought for
a rebound midway through the third quarter. Jalen Rose, who had 26
points in Sunday's victory, had only 8 through three periods and 11
for the game. Reggie Miller, the Pacers' clutch player in so many
playoff series, picked up three fouls and a technical within one
minute late in the third and finished with 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee, whose last playoff victory was on May 1, 1990,
against Chicago, never allowed the Pacers more than three
consecutive points until the final seconds of the second quarter,
when two free throws by Rose and a basket by Smits cut the lead to
61-38 at the half.
</P>
<P>
   A 3-pointer by Allen and a slam dunk by Darvin Ham pushed the
lead to 30 points in the first four minutes of the third quarter,
then two free throws by Cassell with 7:29 left gave the Bucks their
biggest lead at 75-44.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana, which has reached the Eastern Conference finals series
four of the past six years, cut the lead to 21 points several times
late in the third quarter before the flurry of fouls by Miller.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks led 88-64 going into the final period. Scott Williams,
who finished with 15 points, hit two straight baskets at the start
of the quarter to push the lead back to 28.
</P>
<P>
   Austin Croshere, scoreless in the first game, led the Pacers
with 16 points. Travis Best, who scored the Pacers' final nine
points, added 14. Tim Thomas had 19 for the Bucks.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Milwaukee's Vinny Del Negro, who missed both of his field
goal attempts in the first game, was 5-for-5 in the second quarter
and 5-for-9 for 10 points for the game. ... Ham, trying for a
rebound early in the second quarter, fell hard on his hip and lay
on the floor several minutes before resuming play. ... Mark
Jackson, whose 11 assists in Game 1 matched Milwaukee's team total,
managed only five points and five assists in 25 minutes. ...
Milwaukee's Mirsad Turkcan left the game with 24 seconds to go
after he was hit in the nose.

<HEADLINE> S.F. Official Indicted for Fraud  </HEADLINE>
By BOB EGELKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A city official who approved minority
contracts was indicted for fraud Thursday along with two companies
and four executives who allegedly used a minority contractor as a
front for a white-owned company.
</P>
<P>
   Scott-Norman Mechanical Inc., which has been awarded $55 million
in city airport contracts, was controlled by white-owned Scott Co.
of California, allege indictments returned by a federal grand jury.
The indictments did not indicate how many of the contracts were
allegedly obtained by fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Zula Jones, the second-highest official in the city's Human
Rights Commission, approved Scott-Norman as a minority-owned
company eligible for bid preferences under the city's minority
contracting program, even though she knew it was ineligible, the
indictment said. She faces 16 counts of fraud and making false
statements.
</P>
<P>
   ''The purpose of minority contracting programs is to ensure that
individuals and businesses who have been denied equal access to
public contracts are guaranteed a full and fair opportunity to do
public work,'' U.S. Attorney Robert Mueller said in a statement.
''Those who attempt to obtain fraudulent contracts under this
program deserve to be prosecuted.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has been investigating city contracting programs for
more than a year. Federal agents sealed the offices of the Human
Rights Commission one weekend last July to look for records. In
January, the agency subpoenaed Mayor Willie Brown's office for
records of his meetings with 16 companies and 23 business
executives and staffers connected with the contracting program,
dating to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to let the legal process take its appropriate course
of action,'' Brown spokeswoman Kandace Bender said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' lawyer, Carleton Briggs, declined comment. Jerrold Ladar,
lawyer for Joseph Guglielmo, the president and CEO of Scott Co.,
said Guglielmo had committed no fraud and would be exonerated.
Guglielmo faces 21 counts of fraud and making false statements.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Carey, lawyer for Alvin P. Norman Jr., president of
Scott-Norman Mechanical, did not immediately return a telephone
call to his office. Norman faces 20 counts.
</P>
<P>
   The others indicted are Robert T. Nurisso, Scott Co.'s executive
vice president, and Richard Davis, Scott's vice president and chief
financial officer. They face 20 counts each.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants are due in court May 18. Each charge is
punishable by up to five years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani Has Prostate Cancer  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani disclosed Thursday that
he has prostate cancer and acknowledged that while the disease was
caught early, it could spell the end of his Senate run against
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing upbeat and energetic at a City Hall news conference,
Giuliani, 55, confirmed speculation that started Wednesday evening
when he was seen entering a hospital and leaving three hours later.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was diagnosed yesterday,'' Giuliani said. ''It's a treatable
form of prostate cancer. It was diagnosed at an early stage.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican mayor said he would continue his Senate run for
now but would make a more definitive statement in two to three
weeks after he decides on a course of treatment. He still plans
campaign appearances in Saratoga and Buffalo on Friday and
Saturday. He had additional tests performed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really need to know what the course of treatment is going to
be before I can evaluate,'' Giuliani said. ''And then, after I
determine that, then I will figure out does it make sense this year
or doesn't it or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Treatment of the cancer would almost certainly require as much
as several weeks away from City Hall and off the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Giuliani's reluctance to commit himself to continuing
the race, his campaign communications director, Juleanna Glover
Weiss, said the mayor would continue his campaign schedule. ''We
still anticipate that he will be the senator from New York,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, who was campaigning in the upstate village of
Penn Yan, spoke briefly by telephone with the mayor and wished him
''a speedy and complete recovery,'' said Clinton spokeswoman Karen
Dunn.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not even obliquely criticize Giuliani, as she has
done at many of her recent campaign appearances. Aides said that
given the news of the mayor's health, even a veiled political
attack would have been inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Lazio, who has considered challenging Giuliani for the
GOP Senate nomination, issued a statement offering his prayers and
support, adding that health issues transcend politics. Through his
spokesman, Lazio declined to say whether he would enter the race if
Giuliani dropped out. The Senate primary is in September.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer of the prostate, a gland involved in semen production, is
the second most common type of cancer in American men, but early
detection greatly increases the chance of successful treatment.
About 179,300 men were diagnosed with the disease in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, 92 percent of victims survive at least five years.
According to the American Cancer Society, two-thirds of men
diagnosed with the disease survive at least 10 years and half live
at least 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who have survived prostate cancer are former Sen.
Bob Dole and New York Yankees manager Joe Torre.
</P>
<P>
   Dole offered his support Thursday and praised Giuliani for going
public with his diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ''The good news is that Mayor Giuliani underwent routine
screenings,'' he said. ''We all hope that means he caught this at
an early stage, which is so important to our rate of success.''
</P>
<P>
   Treatments include radical prostatectomy -- removal of the
prostate -- and radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Catalona of Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, who
removed Torre's cancerous prostate last year, said that with
surgery, the patient is typically in the hospital for three days.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're usually able to return to normal activities within a
few weeks,'' he said, ''but they're anemic and it takes six to
eight weeks or somewhat longer to build their blood count up.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Giuliani should be able to resume his mayoral
schedule after that and also run for Senate, Catalona replied:
''Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he got regular prostate checkups because his
father died at 73 of prostate cancer in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ''It brings up very painful memories,'' said the mayor, who
rarely speaks about personal matters to the media. ''And, you know,
I miss my father every day of my life. And he's a very, very
important reason for why I'm standing here as the mayor of New York
City.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who can be testy, also smiled, laughed and joked
during his announcement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he would be nicer, he replied, ''No way.''

<HEADLINE> Murdoch Confidante Ron Boland Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Newspaperman Ron Boland, who helped
Rupert Murdoch build one of the world's largest media empires, has
died. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Boland died Wednesday, the company said. He was hospitalized
after suffering a stroke a few days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ron lived and breathed newspapers,'' Murdoch said in a
statement. ''Not only was he a dear friend, but he played a
critical role in the formation and ultimate success of News Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Boland was editor of Adelaide's The Sunday Mail when Murdoch
inherited it and its sister publication, the daily tabloid the
News, in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   They were Murdoch's first papers, his training ground and the
starting point from which he built his global newspaper, satellite
television, film and book publishing company.
</P>
<P>
   Boland was managing editor at the News in 1960, when the
ambitious young Murdoch bought the Sydney Mirror, his first
acquisition and a tenacious bid to break into the highly
competitive Sydney market.
</P>
<P>
   It paid off, and boldness and high-risk ventures became
Murdoch's trademarks as he built his empire, which now includes the
Fox Entertainment group, the New York Post and the London Times.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by two sons.

Miami Mayor Fires City Manager
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Just days after Miami Mayor Joe Carollo demanded the firing of
the police chief for not warning him about the federal raid to seize Elian
Gonzalez, Carollo fired city manager Donald Warshaw. Carollo insisted that the
firing had nothing to do with the 6-year-old Cuban refugee. Carollo had asked
City Manager Warshaw to fire Police Chief William O'Brien, saying he ''lost all
confidence'' in the chief for not telling him that federal agents were about to
raid the Gonzalez household early Saturday. Warshaw refused. Carollo said
Warshaw has been badmouthing him and trying to turn department heads against
him. The seizure of Elian plunged City Hall into political turmoil.

GDP Is Growing at 5.4 Percent
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy grew robustly as the country's total
output of goods and services, called the gross domestic product, rose at an
annual rate of 5.4 percent during the January-March quarter, the Commerce
Department said. But that sparked fresh inflation worries among economists and
investors. Workers enjoyed the biggest jump in wages and benefits in 10 years.
Consumer spending led the way by posting its largest increase in nearly 17
years. An inflation gauge tied to the GDP rose sharply, reflecting higher energy
prices.

Three More Papers Shut in Iran
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iranian hard-liners shut down three more newspapers
Thursday, including one owned by reformist President Mohammad Khatami's brother,
pressing their campaign against publications that have fueled public support for
reform. About 200 students demonstrated against the closures at the Shahid
Beheshti University in northern Tehran in the early hours of Friday, said an
Iranian journalist. The media closures, now numbering 16, are hampering
Khatami's allies' political ambitions. Only one reformist paper remained
publishing Thursday as campaigning started for the May 5 run-off elections,
which will decide 66 seats in the 290-seat parliament, or Majlis.

U.S. To Have Terrorism Field Test

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Next month, Cabinet secretaries, top state and local

largest-ever field test of the nation's ability to respond to a terrorist attack
with chemical or biological weapons. Driven by recent violent attacks here and
abroad, Congress ordered the test and appropriated $3.5 million last year to pay
for it. The test will take place during 10 days in May, federal officials
announced today. U.S. officials have concluded it only a matter of when -- not
whether -- some terrorist will use a weapon of mass destruction on a domestic

No Three Mile Island, Cancer Link
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- A 13-year study of people living near the Three Mile
Island nuclear plant found no link between the radiation released during the
1979 accident and cancer deaths among nearby residents. The University of
Pittsburgh study, posted on the Internet today, should give some reassurance to
people who live near the site of the nation's worst commercial nuclear accident.
But it does not eliminate the need to continue monitoring their health, the lead
researcher said. The accident, triggered by equipment malfunction and operator
error on March 28, 1979, caused about a third of the nuclear fuel to melt inside
a reactor just outside Middletown, about 10 miles from Harrisburg.

<HEADLINE> Britain Pushes for Belfast Accord  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The British and Irish
governments on Thursday invited key Northern Ireland parties to
fresh negotiations that they hope will get the province's suspended
Catholic-Protestant government back on track.
</P>
<P>
   Britain announced plans for a London summit next Tuesday
involving both governments and the Ulster Unionists, the province's
major British Protestant party; the Social Democratic and Labor
Party, the major Catholic-supported party; and Sinn Fein, the party
linked to the Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   All three parties briefly shared power in a Cabinet aimed at
serving as the bedrock for a lasting peace in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The Ulster Unionists agreed to take part only on condition that
the IRA began disarming in response and, when the outlawed group
refused, Britain suspended the Cabinet's powers and resumed direct
control in February.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the British and Irish governments have pressed both
Sinn Fein and the Ulster Unionists to reach a fresh understanding
that would allow the Cabinet to regain authority.
</P>
<P>
   But Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble has come under
increasing internal pressure not to resume any arrangements with
Sinn Fein.

<HEADLINE> Women's Cycling Sprint Postponed  </HEADLINE>
By TIM KORTE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRISCO, Texas (AP) -- Jennie Reed and Tanya Lindenmuth have
waited all year for a rematch. They can wait another night.
</P>
<P>
   Reed and Lindenmuth, who raced in the women's match sprint final
in last year's national championships, advanced again in the same
race Thursday night in the U.S. Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
   However, their showdown was postponed when the temperature
dropped and dew formed on the track. The danger was apparent when a
rider slipped and crashed in a men's sprint qualifying heat. He
wasn't injured.
</P>
<P>
   Suspended events will be staged Friday, including the men's
points race final and the rematch of Lindenmuth's championship
sprint victory over Reed at last year's national meet.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was warmed up and ready to go,'' said the 22-year-old Reed
of Kirkland, Wash., who lost her 1998 national title to Lindenmuth,
22, of Trexlertown, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   The two are familiar foes, and it's likely they'll duel over the
next three months for a ticket to the Sydney Olympics. Under this
year's selection process, coaches will pick the team based on
training and racing performances.
</P>
<P>
   ''Too bad they can't race tonight,'' U.S. sprint coach Des
Dickey said. ''It would have been the first bullet fired.
Everything between them this summer, every competition, is going to
be a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindenmuth survived an exciting semifinal against Tammy Thomas
of Yazoo City, Miss. In match sprint, riders position themselves
for a final lap sprint while trying to disrupt the other cyclist's
positioning.
</P>
<P>
   Lindenmuth beat Thomas in the first race in the best-of-three
format. In the second, Thomas took an early lead and had Lindenmuth
boxed out as they turned for the homestretch, but Lindenmuth
charged hard and won at the wire.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was tough,'' Lindenmuth said. ''My coach was pleased with
the fact that I didn't panic. Usually when you're matched up well
with someone, the person who makes one move wins.''
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of the morning preliminaries came from Jame Carney
of Flagstaff, Ariz., the four-time national champion in the points
race who dominated to win the first of two heats.
</P>
<P>
   In the points race, riders accumulate points during sprints on
designated laps. The winner is the cyclist who scores highest or,
as Carney did, laps the field and maintains the advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Carney has excelled at the race during his career and probably
would have raced at the Atlanta Olympics if not for a fall during a
promotional photo shoot in 1995. He lost 30 percent of his upper
lip in the face-first crash.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was pretty much looking like Freddie Krueger,'' Carney said.
</P>
<P>
   The dangers of bicycle racing were evident in a match sprint
race Thursday when Suzanne Marshall of Redwood City, Calif.,
clipped wheels with Shan Rayray of Federal Way, Wash., on the
Superdrome's 44-degree banked turn.
</P>
<P>
   The crash occurred more than one hour before dew condensed on
the track.
</P>
<P>
   Both riders tumbled about 10 feet in a near-vertical fall to the
concrete apron. After Rayray lay motionless for five minutes, she
was immobilized on a back board and carted away to a waiting
ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   A precautionary examination revealed no injuries and she was
expected to race again before the trials conclude Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Former City Councilman Sentenced  </HEADLINE>
By SHERRI CHUNN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- A former city councilman convicted of bribery and
conspiracy was sentenced Thursday to more than three years of home
confinement.
</P>
<P>
   Al Lipscomb was convicted in January of 65 counts of conspiracy
and bribery. He faced up to 645 years in prison and a $16.25
million fine for accepting monthly cash payments from Floyd
Richards, a taxicab company owner, in exchange for voting in the
company's favor on cab issues.
</P>
<P>
   Besides a 41-month sentence of house confinement, U.S. District
Judge Joe Kendall ordered Lipscomb to pay $14,000 in fines. The
74-year-old may leave his house only to receive medical care.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a victory for the facts and the law,'' said his lawyer,
Tom Melsheimer. ''I can assure you (Lipscomb and his family) are
quite relieved with the results.''

   Earlier this month, Lipscomb missed two sentencing hearings
because he suffered from pneumonia and congestive heart failure and
was too ill to appear, his lawyers told Kendall.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Mayor Ron Kirk, a longtime Lipscomb supporter who
testified on his behalf, said Kendall's sentence shows that ''mercy
is bountiful.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He made a point that this type of behavior isn't going to be
tolerated, but I think he exercised good judgment in confining Mr.
Lipscomb to house arrest given his physical and medical
condition,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Release of Columbine Tapes Defended  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE VOGT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- Widely criticized for releasing a graphic
videotape of the Columbine aftermath, the Jefferson County attorney
said Thursday officials did not want to make the tape public but
had no choice after a judge's order.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson County Attorney Frank Hutfless said the decision was
prompted by threats of legal action and reports that the tape had
been given to a television network.
</P>
<P>
   Hutfless also defended the musical soundtrack and the $25 cost
of the tape. He said the fee covers the county's costs and the
music had to be included because it was on the videotape viewed by
the judge.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Hutfless said he and Sheriff John Stone fought
the release because it ''was not in the best interest of the
victims or the community.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said officials were told the tape had already been given
to the media, and a judge had ruled there was ''no compelling
public interest'' to withhold it under the Colorado Open Records
Act.
</P>
<P>
   ''We simply had no choice but to release the videotapes. If we
did not release them, there would have been more lawsuits asking
for their release and we would have lost,'' Hutfless said.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly three-hour tape produced by the Littleton Fire
Department was given to victims' families Tuesday after they told a
judge they needed them for civil lawsuits against the sheriff's
office. They have sued over officers' handling of the April 20,
1999, attack on the school that left 15 dead, including two teen
gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   The tape was released to the public Wednesday, eight days after
the first anniversary of the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Some victims' families were outraged by the music added to part
of the tape, which included songs by Sarah McLachlan and Cheryl
Wheeler. They said the music was inappropriate for a training
video.
</P>
<P>
   McLachlan and her record label, Arista Records, demanded that
the music be removed from the tape, calling it exploitative.
</P>
<P>
   Hutfless said authorities couldn't remove the music because they
were ordered to hand over the exact tape reviewed by Jefferson
County District Judge Brook Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ''Had we edited out the music, we would have in effect tampered
with the videotape and violated the judge's order,'' Hutfless said.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson County sold all 107 copies it had by noon Thursday,
spokeswoman Michelle Frongillo said. Nearly 400 more copies have
been ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Hutfless said the $25 fee covers only the county's cost of
getting the videotapes copied and distributing them.

<HEADLINE> Political Fallout in Elian Case  </HEADLINE>
By RACHEL LA CORTE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Miami Mayor Joe Carollo fired the city manager
Thursday, just days after he demanded the man dismiss the police
chief for failing to warn the mayor about the raid to seize Elian
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Carollo had asked City Manager Donald Warshaw to fire Police
Chief William O'Brien, saying he ''lost all confidence'' in the
chief for not telling him that federal agents were about to raid
the Gonzalez household early Saturday. Warshaw refused.
</P>
<P>
   Carollo insisted Thursday that Warshaw's firing had nothing to
do with ''little Elian.'' Carollo said Warshaw has been criticizing
him, lying and trying to turn department heads against him.
</P>
<P>
   The seizure of the 6-year-old Cuban boy has plunged City Hall
into political turmoil. Only the city manager can fire the police
chief, and Warshaw's refusal set the stage for the confrontation at
a City Commission meeting Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Warshaw, who preceded O'Brien as chief, shook his head with a
look of disgust as Carollo spoke. The city commission can overturn
Carollo's decision if four out of five commissioners vote to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a painful thing to watch, obviously,'' Warshaw said
afterwards. ''I'm sad for all that's happening in our city. Please
be calm, the eyes of the world are watching us.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours after Elian was taking from the home of his Miami
relatives, Carollo said of O'Brien ''If I had that power ... I
would fire him.''
</P>
<P>
   The police chief had an hour of advance notice of the 5:15 a.m.
raid, but has said he didn't want to tip off the mayor, who unlike
O'Brien is Cuban-American and had openly sided with the Cuban boy's
Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a police issue, not a political issue,'' O'Brien has
said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor had also demanded O'Brien's firing for letting the
police department's second in command, Maj. John Brooks, get
involved in the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks rode in the van that whisked Elian away. Police said
Brooks did so so that other police officers on duty at the house
would realize that it was an official action. Officers on the scene
had only a moment's notice of the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Days before the raid, the mayor had declared that Miami police
officers would not help federal agents remove the boy from the
Little Havana home.
</P>
<P>
   City Commissioner Tomas Regalado sided with Carollo in calling
for the police chief's firing, saying: ''He has lost his ability to
direct the department.''
</P>
<P>
   City Commissioner Johnny Winton, who supports both O'Brien and
Warshaw, said: ''We have a mayor running around here pouring fuel
on the fire instead of providing leadership to our community. It's
a very, very sad statement for all of the citizens of our
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Protests broke out among Miami's Cuban-Americans after
Saturday's lightning raid, and police in riot gear arrested more
than 300 people and used tear gas to disperse crowds.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 crowded into the commission chamber Thursday night.
Some held pictures of people bruised, they say, by overzealous
police.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Richard Bennett Jr., the executive director of the
African American Council of Christian Clergy in Miami, stood
outside among a small group that opposed Carollo's action.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've heard of people being fired for their jobs for not
performing, but I've never heard of somebody being fired for just
doing their job,'' Bennett said. ''This is why this community is
divided. And this will divide it even more. Carollo is doing this
for his Cuban friends.''
</P>
<P>
   After the mayor spoke, the commission voted to create a
committee to investigate police involvement in the federal seizure
of Elian and any police brutality that followed during the
protests.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, some had called for an investigation into
alleged police brutality. Karla Martinez, 22, said she was arrested
Saturday while protesting and was knocked to the ground by a female
officer. ''To pick me up, she dragged me along the asphalt,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeb Bush said he met with Carollo on Thursday and
encouraged him to consider an investigation into the alleged police
abuse, rather than moving ahead with an attempt to fire the city
manager.
</P>
<P>
   ''I asked the mayor to be reflective rather than reactive,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Carollo became mayor after a fraud-ridden 1997 election that
resulted in the apparent victor, Xavier Suarez, being forced from
office.
</P>
<P>
   Carollo appointed Warshaw as city manager in 1998, after firing
Jose Garcia-Pedrosa three times. Garcia-Pedrosa, now one of the
lawyers representing Elian's Miami relatives, was reinstated all
three times by the commission, but chose to step down.

<HEADLINE> ACLU, Philadelphia Agree on Protests  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The American Civil Liberties Union and the
city have reached an agreement to allow large demonstrations before
the Republican National Convention this summer, but the
convention's host committee must still approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''This city, thankfully, recognizes that dissent is an integral
part of our democracy,'' ACLU legal director Stephan Presser said
Thursday. ''This city recognizes that we, in fact, are the
birthplace of the American democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement is contingent on the approval of Philadelphia
2000, host committee for the July 31-Aug. 3 convention. Co-chairman
David Cohen said he has asked the city to clarify some logistical
issues, and expects the agreement will be approved once those are
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Presser earlier threatened to sue if city officials did not
approve a demonstration permit by next month for the Pennsylvania
Consumer Action Network, which is leading the creation of an
anti-Republican coalition named ''R2K'' that hopes to coordinate a
mass rally.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, the city will allow a rally July 29 on
Washington Square. The next day, a parade will be allowed from a
park near City Hall up the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, a major
thoroughfare downtown, for a crowd of up to 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The rally would be several miles from the First Union Center,
the convention's main site, but would be close to many secondary
events associated with the meeting.

<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Ohio (AP) -- Brooks Lawrence, who pitched for the
St. Louis Cardinals and Cincinnati Reds and worked in the Reds'
front office, died Thursday at Mercy Hospital. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence had been fighting cancer. Family members and the
hospital declined to identify a cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence was 69-62 with a 4.25 ERA in two seasons with the
Cardinals (1954-55) and five with the Reds (1956-60).
</P>
<P>
   His best season was his first with Cincinnati, when he won 13
consecutive games and made the National League All-Star team. He
finished the year 19-10 with a 3.99 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring as a player, Lawrence worked 10 years at
International Harvester in Springfield and then spent 10 years
handling scouting, minor league player development, radio and
television work and season-ticket sales for the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral arrangements were pending at the Robert C. Henry funeral

<HEADLINE> Report: Inadequate Pensions Rampant  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The vast majority of the world's people have
inadequate pension coverage and face an increased risk of poverty
in old age, the International Labor Organization warned in a report
released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The lack of more complete pension coverage throughout the
world will become a growing problem as lifetimes are extended''
said Colin Gillion, the author of the study.
</P>
<P>
   The report said pension plans in Asia and Russia had been
severely weakened by financial turmoil, that African plans were
''very weak'' and that many in Latin America were ''performing
poorly.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillion also said pension plan managers and governments
worldwide would need ''great effort and great imagination'' to face
the challenge as aging populations constituted an increasing drain
on public revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The report said about 90 percent of the world's working-age
population had inadequate pension coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The report also suggests that European, U.S. and Canadian plans
will need far more resources -- either from higher taxes or higher
participation rates -- as a result of aging populations and the
increase in early retirements.
</P>
<P>
   Remedies, he said, included increasing the number of women in
employment, or raising the retirement age.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Suspect Can Review Evidence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- The government has restored the
security clearance of a nuclear scientist so he can assist his
defense against charges he mishandled secrets at Los Alamos
National Laboratory, his lawyer said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Wen Ho Lee, 60, is also allowed to travel to secure work areas
at the lab, which fired him last year, and at the federal
courthouse in Albuquerque, said lawyer John Cline. He is
transported in the custody of federal marshals, who keep him in leg
restraints.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is charged with 59 counts alleging he transferred protected
data from secured to unsecured computers and to computer tapes. He
is not accused of espionage. He could face life in prison if
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Cline said attorneys cannot conduct a defense without Lee's
active participation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last couple of weeks have been our first opportunity to
review the evidence in the case in depth with Dr. Lee and that's an
essential part of defending any case,'' Cline said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's legs remain shackled during his Los Alamos outings, but he
is not handcuffed, Cline said. During a four-hour session at Los
Alamos last week, Lee was admitted to a secure room that had a
computer with a ''read only'' function, Cline said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal marshals posted outside watched video monitors. But
there is no audio, so Lee can talk privately with his attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have until May 8 to iron out disputes over what
evidence they should be allowed to review before Lee's scheduled
Nov. 6 trial.

<HEADLINE> Jail Terms Handed in Sex Scandal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NICE, France (AP) -- A Belgian stripper and two photographers
were convicted of privacy violations Thursday, after the ex-husband
of Monaco's Princess Stephanie charged they trapped him in
embarrassing photos that ruined his marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Ducruet brought the case after pictures of him frolicking
with Fili Houteman, then the reigning Miss Nude Belgium, were
published in Italian magazines in September 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie was granted a speedy divorce from Ducruet the
following month.
</P>
<P>
   The magistrates' court in Nice found the three guilty of
breaching the intimacy of Ducruet's private life.
</P>
<P>
   Houteman and photographer Yves Hoogewys were given six-month
suspended prison sentences. Photographer Stephane de Lisiecki, who
Ducruet had accused of being the brains behind the operation, was
given a one-year suspended sentence.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Ducruet, who was Stephanie's bodyguard before
his marriage into the royal family, told the court he had been set
up and might even have been drugged when photos showing him in a
poolside romp in a French villa with Houteman were taken in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Houteman told the court that she was not aware of any plot and
had simply ''succumbed'' to Ducruet's advances. De Lisiecki had
also said he was not guilty of scheming.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal rocked Monaco, the tiny Riviera principality that
has been ruled by the Grimaldi family for over 700 years. Stephanie
is one of three children of Prince Rainier and the former American
actress Grace Kelly who was killed in a car crash in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie and Ducruet had two children. Both were born before
the couple married on July 1, 1995.

<HEADLINE> AP, Time Receive Press Club Honors  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Associated Press and Time magazine each won
two awards from the Overseas Press Club on Thursday, Time for its
coverage of Indonesia and East Timor and the AP for its Pulitzer
Prize-winning story on an alleged massacre by U.S. troops during
the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   Louis D. Boccardi, AP's president and CEO, also received the
club's President's Award for lifetime achievement. The club cited
Boccardi's success in moving the news cooperative into television
and digital photography and his leadership on freedom of
information and First Amendment issues.
</P>
<P>
   In accepting the award, Boccardi said it was ''a very special
honor. ... I accept it on behalf of legions of AP people who ...
have dedicated themselves to reporting the news, no matter what it

very lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Boccardi cited the courage of an AP photographer jailed in
Zimbabwe.

</P>
<P>
   Four AP journalists -- Special Correspondent Charles J. Hanley,
reporters Martha Mendoza and Sang-hun Choe, and investigative
researcher Randy Herschaft -- won for breaking the story of the
alleged massacre at No Gun Ri. The press club honored the piece for
best reporting in any medium showing a concern for the human
condition.
</P>
<P>
   The story cited a dozen American veterans who confirmed the
charges some Koreans had been making for years that U.S. soldiers
machine-gunned hundreds of Korean refugees at the hamlet in July
1950, including many cowering under a railroad bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Photographer John Stanmeyer, working through Saba Press Photos
for Time magazine, was honored in the category of best photographic
reporting requiring exceptional courage for the images he captured
of Indonesian police killing an independence supporter in East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
   John Colmey, David Liebhold and Time's Asia staff won best
magazine business reporting for writing about the vast fortune of
deposed Indonesian President Suharto and his family.

<HEADLINE> USS Arizona Crew Member Buried  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEARL HARBOR, Hawaii (AP) -- The man who had been the oldest
surviving crew member of the USS Arizona has been laid to rest with
shipmates in the hull of the battleship that sank during Japan's
attack on Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   National Park Service divers placed the cremated remains of
Capt. Francis Marion Falge, 96, of Carmel, Calif., in a gun turret
near the stern of the ship during a ceremony Wednesday. He died
Jan. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of World War II, 14 other Arizona survivors have
chosen to be buried with shipmates killed in the Dec. 7, 1941
attack. Some 945 sailors went down with the ship and have remained
entombed there since the Sunday-morning assault that drew the
United States into the war.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is very sacred ground,'' said Falge's son, Roger.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Falge, who was 12 at the time, said his father was on
shore leave attending Mass at the time of the attack. A Navy
lieutenant, Falge quickly went to the harbor and helped in rescue
efforts for the next several days, his son said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 334 sailors from the Arizona who survived, only 50 are
believed to be still living. Falge was the oldest member of the USS
Arizona Reunion Association when he died.
</P>
<P>
   Officers and sailors who served on the Arizona after its
commissioning in 1916 and before its sinking are eligible to have
their ashes scattered in the waters over the ship.
</P>
<P>
   But only those assigned to the Arizona at the time of the attack
are eligible for interment in the hull of the ship. This includes
those who were on leave from the ship at the time of the attack.
