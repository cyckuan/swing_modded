<P>
SHANGHAI, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Gold demand across the world for
the first quarter of this year reached a record 771 tons, up 17
percent over the same period of 1996, said a recent report of the
World Gold Council.
</P>
<P>
The report added that gold demand from the Chinese market,
including Hong Kong and Taiwan, was 110.1 tons, with 55.3 tons in
the mainland area alone.
</P>
<P>
A source with the Shanghai representative office of the World

<HEADLINE> Blair Vows to Build "Europe for People" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NOORDWIJK, The Netherlands, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Britain's new
Prime Minister, Tony Blair, called today for building a "Europe
for people", while vowing to defend his country's interests.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) has focused too much on the adaptation
of its own institutions, and not paid enough attention to things
which clearly matter to people, such as environment and
employment, said Blair.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister is in the Dutch seaside town to attend an
informal summit of the European Union (EU) aimed at paving the way
for a new EU treaty to be signed at the Amsterdam summit in June.
</P>
<P>
Blair said he will defend his country's interests.
</P>
<P>
London is still hostile to any surrender of sovereignty in the
areas of immigration and rights of asylum.
</P>
<P>
Border control is one of the key issues in a rewrite of
Europe's treaties designed to prepare the bloc for new members
from the east.
</P>
<P>
In a speech during lunch with the other 14 EU leaders before
their working session started, Blair underlined again that
Britain, together with France and Germany, should play a leading
role in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone knows that the (British) new government has taken a
more constructive approach towards Europe," he told the press in
Noordwijk.
</P>
<P>
Blair's Labor government has already promised its membership
for the Social Protocol, which sets up minimum labor standards,
and has agreed with the plan to incorporate it into the new EU
treaty.
</P>
<P>
But he emphasized during his meeting with European Commission
President Jacques Santer this morning that it should not lead to a
series of measures which could undermine the competitiveness of
British companies.
</P>
<P>
Friday's summit has provided Blair with the first
opportunity to meet his European partners since his Labor party
took office after the May 1 general election.
</P>
<P>
Blair's victory over the Euro-sceptic Conservative party was
considered crucial to the Inter-Governmental Conference (IGC)
treaty negotiations, which have been stymied in part by British
objections to further EU integration.
</P>
<P>
The new government has pledged to work with its EU partners,
and it lifted Conservative threats of veto on various parts of the
new treaty.

<HEADLINE> Ninth Plenum of HK SAR Preparatory Committee Closes in Beijing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The two-day Plenary Session of the
Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) ended here today with three documents adopted.
</P>
<P>
These documents include specific methods for forming the first
Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR, suggestions on what
national laws shall be added to or deleted from Annex 3 of the
Basic Law, and a decision on the swearing-in ceremony of relevant
Hong Kong SAR personnel when taking offices. Moreover, a press
communique was issued at the end of the session.
</P>
<P>
Wang Hanbin, vice-chairman of the Preparatory Committee
presided over the meeting while Vice-Premier and Chairman of the
Preparatory Committee Qian Qichen delivered a speech at the
closing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the drawing up the specific methods for forming the
first Legislative Council is a matter drawing all sides' attention
and also an important decision of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that the first Legislative Council will
be formed smoothly in accordance with democratic, open, and fair
principles.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the complex methods for electing the Legislative
Council of the Hong Kong SAR includes direct elections and
indirect elections by the functional constituency and the Election
Committee, he said this is an election system of gradual
development proceeding from the actual situation in Hong Kong,
which is called by people a major characteristic of the election
culture of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Qian quoted the late Deng Xiaoping as saying: "Hong Kong is not
practising the political systems of Britain and the United States
at present, nor will it copy from that of the western countries
too.
</P>
<P>
"In the future, Hong Kong will be of course governed by the
Hong Kong people themselves. Those Hong Kong people to govern Hong
Kong should be those who love both the motherland and Hong
Kong. Is it certain that such people will be brought forth by the
general election? Even with the use of general election, it will
require a gradual transition to be done step by step. It is
imperative to conform to the actual situation and decide their
system and way for management according to their characteristics."

<TEXT>
<P>
From the point of view historically, Qian said Britain has been
ruling Hong Kong for more than 100 years, there were no elections
in Hong Kong at all until the partial members of the Legislative
Council were elected by indirect elections beginning in 1985.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law not only stipulates that the Legislative Council
of the Hong Kong SAR will be formed by election, but set
forth the principle of gradual and orderly progress to develop
such an election culture for Hong Kong, and eventually obtain the
goal of all members of the Legislative Council being elected
through the general election.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the approval of the suggestions on what national laws
to be applied in the Hong Kong SAR may be added to or deleted from
the Annex 3 of the Basic Law will provide a guarantee for further
perfecting the laws when the Hong Kong SAR is founded.
</P>
<P>
At the closing of the meeting, Qian said the tasks for the
Preparatory Committee have been basically completed and the Hong
Kong SAR will be founded. The Preparatory Committee is an
organization set up by the National People's Congress, so the
issue on the completion of its work will be decided by the NPC
Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong's return to the motherland, he added, signifies
the all-round implementation of the principle of "one country, two
systems" in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Central government has time and again stressed that this
principle will remain unchanged for a long period of time because
it has become an important component part of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the remaining years of this century and in a fairly long
period in the coming century, he noted, China will adhere to this
socialist road with Chinese characteristics, namely, China will
take this principle as a basic state policy, not to change Hong
Kong's capitalist system or its way of life for 50 years or more.
</P>
<P>
He quoted President Jiang Zemin as saying that governing Hong
Kong by law constitutes an important part of governing the country
according to law. Safeguarding the authoritative Basic Law means
safeguarding the authority of the state's legal system, and this
is a common responsibility of the people across China, Qian said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The international community should
be patient and not expect too much too soon from president of the
Democratic Republic of Congo Laurent Kabila, South African deputy
president Thabo Mbeki said here today.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, who was involved in diplomacy shuttles that ensured the
smooth departure into exile of former Zairean president Mobutu
Sese Seko, said there were enormous problems that had to be
resolved before elections could be held.
</P>
<P>
Addressing journalists during the ongoing southern African
economic summit, Mbeki said the world should not lose sight of
the fact that Kabila was inheriting a bankrupt economy whose
state administration had collapsed.
</P>
<P>
"It would be unfair to say to someone who walked into Kinshasa
yesterday, set a date for election," said Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
On the exclusion of opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi from
the new Congo government amid international pressure that
Kabila's cabinet should be broad-based, Mbeki said, "we have not
sought to intervene in terms of the political personalities in
the Congo. We really do not know the personalities and i cannot
answer on the impact of these political personalities."

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Ports Authority (KPA)
has announced plans to expand the Mombasa Port to deal with the
ever-increasing cargo.
</P>
<P>
Eliud Mahihu, recently-appointed KPA Chairman was quoted as
saying that his corporation had acquired more than 3,000 acres at
Dongo Kundu in Kwale District towards the expansion.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the move was necessary due to the increasing
importance of the port to the East African region and
particularly for land locked countries like Uganda, Sudan and the
Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
According to the chairman, the port is also introducing a
cruise ship program in recognition of the country and especially
Mombasa as a favourate tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
The amount of cargo handled at the port increased from some
7,984,000 tons in 1995 to more than 8,694,000 tons last year,
reflecting improved regional economic performance.
</P>
<P>
The cargo increase at the port is mainly attributed to the
transit traffic increasing by 37.5 percent in 1996 with the
transit cargo increasing from 1.9 million tons in 1995 to 2.8
million tons last year.

<HEADLINE> Faction Leader Returns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The mood and the peace
prospective of south Mogadishu has been changed today by the
arrival of faction leader Osman Hassan Ali Atto and the
expectation of Hussein Mohamed Aidid who is to arrive in
Mogadishu shortly.
</P>
<P>
The two men who recently signed a peace accord in Sana of
Yemen early this month were expected to make their peace
agreement a practical. Both men have been in Nairobi for the last
few days.
</P>
<P>
The Somali faction leader, Mr Osman Hassan Ali Atto, has this
afternoon landed at the Gezira airstrip, 5 km south of the
capital. Mr Osman Ali Atto who has been abroad for more than a
year and half has been welcomed by hundreds of cheering
supporters guarded by 14 well armed battle wagons belonging to
his faction.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after his arrival, Mr Osman Ali Atto has addressed
his supporters at the headquarters of his faction in Bosnia
neighborhood of southern Mogadishu. Mr Atto told his people that
he is happy to have come back home after long absence for what
he called work and health matters.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the recent peace initiatives, Mr Atto said his
return back home is part of energizing and implementing the
trilateral peace agreement reached in Nairobi in October last
year by Mogadishu's factions. Mr Atto called the people of
Mogadishu to have all the tolerance and patience needed to make
the peace agreements fruitful. He also called the people of
Mogadishu to take part in strengthening the peace accord and the
cease-fire which is already holding in the front lines.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of heavily armed technicals have left for Ballidogle
airport, 90 km south of Mogadishu, to escort Mr Hussein Aidid and
his delegation who are being awaited by hundreds of jubilant
supporters. The people of south Mogadishu have today shown their
appreciation to the arrival of the faction leaders. The faction
leaders are expected to instruct their militia commanders to
separate the rival militiamen.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in more than a year, the public transport
buses have reached the hospital Benadir junction towards Afgoie
road. Also the civilian buses were moving back and forth at the
key junction of k-7 with little to be afraid of. Similarly, the
movement of the pedestrians has been open even in the strongholds
of Osman Atto's faction.

<HEADLINE> OAU Secretary General Appreciates Role Played by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahmed Salim, secretary
general of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) today
expressed his appreciation of the role played by the Republic of
Djibouti and the United Republic of Tanzania on inter-African
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
According to an OAU press release faxed to Xinhua office here,
Salim made the statement while receiving the credentials of two
newly appointed ambassadors to the OAU.
</P>
<P>
Receiving Dileita Mohamed Deleita, permanent representative
and ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the Republic
of Djibouti, Salim stated that the Republic of Djibouti was well
known for its commitment to the OAU, the Inter-Governmental
Authority for Development (IGAD) and inter-African regional
cooperation, citing the commendable role played by the government
and people of Djibouti particularly in efforts to achieve
national reconciliation in Somalia. He assured the new ambassador
of the full support of the OAU general secretariat in carrying
out his very important assignment.
</P>
<P>
When receiving the credentials of the newly appointed
ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary and the permanent
representative of the government of the United Republic of
Tanzania, Charles Stephen Kileo, Salim recalled the role of the
United Republic of Tanzania as host of the OAU liberation
committee throughout the struggle for political independence of
the southern African countries and particularly for the
demolition of apartheid in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Salim stated that the OAU agenda has now shifted to socio-
economic transformation, and integration of the economies of the
African continent, promotion of security and stability as well as
to democratization, an agenda he said Tanzania had since
embraced, adding that it was now time for all to join ranks with
the OAU to finally achieve the objectives of the founding fathers
of OAU.
</P>
<P>
He expressed optimism that Africa would reach great heights in
the next millennium if it remained united and committed to
managing its potentials better.

<HEADLINE> Eurotunnel to Resume Freight Services in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Eurotunnel was Thursday night given
permission to resume freight shuttle services through the Channel
Tunnel from the middle of next month, six months after they were
halted by last November's fire.
</P>
<P>
The Anglo-French Intergovernmental Commission, a joint body
that administers the tunnel, said Eurotunnel would have to conduct
a number of safety checks set out in a report from the tunnel
safety authority last week.
</P>
<P>
The Le Shuttle freight service could start again on June 15 if
these checks cleared Eurotunnel, it added.
</P>
<P>
Eurotunnel said that it would start a program of trials in the
next few days, namely running empty freight shuttles at first and
then moving on to trials with non-paying volunteers among road
haulers and finally to a commercial service on June 15, with three
trains each way an hour.
</P>
<P>
It will introduce a series of temporary safety measures
including a ban on carrying hazardous goods.
</P>
<P>
The move was a boost to the debt-ridden company which needs to
get traffic and revenue back up to pre-fire levels to meet the
conditions of its deal with banks to cut 2.2 billion pounds (3.6
billion US dollars) from its debts of 8.7 billion pounds (14.2
billion US dollars).

<HEADLINE> German Court Rules First Bosnian Serb Into Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- A Bosnian Serb was sentenced to five
years in prison today in the first trial in Germany relating to
war crimes in former Yugoslavia, according to German media
reports.
</P>
<P>
After a three-month trail, a court in the southern German city
of Munich ruled today that Novislav Djajic, 34, was found guilty
on charges of being an accessory to murder on 14 counts and an
accessory to attempted murder on one count.
</P>
<P>
Djajic is said to be a member of a Serbian civilian militia
which rounded up 15 Moslems and shot 14 of them dead in his home
village of Trnovace in Bosnia on June 22, 1992. The massacre
appeared to be a revenge act for the killing of three Serbs in an
explosion in the village earlier, the court said.
</P>
<P>
The only survivor, a boyhood friend of the defendant, was able
to escape by jumping into a river at the massacre scene. He later
appeared in the Munich court as a co-plaintiff.
</P>
<P>
Another Bosnia Serb is also appearing in a court in the western
German city of Duesseldorf on 14 counts of genocide in a trial
expected to last into the summer.

<HEADLINE> More Progress Made in Talks on China's Accession to WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Working Party on China's
Accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) today reached
basic consensus on the two provisions of "Judicial Review" and
"Nondiscrimination" of the draft protocol of China's WTO
accession.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement reached between China and the WTO members on
these two important provisions of the draft Protocol will
immensely improve the legal environment for the foreign
enterprises and individuals in their investment and trade in
China, reduce their operating cost in trade and investment and
therefore they are a `commercially viable' deal," China's Vice
Foreign Trade Minister and Chief Representative for trade talks
Long Yongtu said at the fourth meeting of the WP on China's
accession.
</P>
<P>
Before the three-day WP meeting ending today, China and WTO
members had informal multilateral consultations. China also had
bilateral talks with the United States, the European Union and
Canada. It will have more bilaterals with Argentina, Australia,
Brazil, Chile and Japan in the coming week.
</P>
<P>
China and Hungary signed an agreement to conclude their talks
on mutual market access during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The next WP meeting on China's WTO accession will be held in
Geneva in late July.

<HEADLINE> Presidential Elections Extended Again in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Iran's election headquarters this
evening announced that the deadline for today's presidential polls
has been extended for two hours, the second postponement within
one day.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters said the new deadline for voting has been
prolonged until 22:00 hours local time (17:30 GMT) due to
people's massive turnout in polling stations across the country.
</P>
<P>
As the pre-set deadline reached 18:00 hours local time (13:30
GMT), there were still many people awaiting their turn in the
queue in front of many polling stations.
</P>
<P>
Many political specialists hold that today's turnout is the
largest in the past 18 years, describing it as "incredible"
because many people, especially the youths, are longing for
democracy, freedom and economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Observers here estimated earlier that about 80 percent of the
eligible voters are expected to cast their ballots at various
polling stations.
</P>
<P>
Under the election law the winner must secure an absolute
majority of more than half of the votes cast. In the absence of
a clear winner, there will be a runoff between the top two
candidates in a week.
</P>
<P>
The competition between two front-runners has been so tense
and close in the past two weeks that many political analysts said
they find it hard to predict the result.
</P>
<P>
The two main contenders are hardliner parliament speaker, Ali
Akbar Nateq-Nouri, and former cultural and Islamic guidance
minister, Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Nateq-Nouri, 54, represents the Iranian conservative camp
called the Association of Combatant Clergymen (ACC) and enjoys
support of rich merchants. He is also backed by Iranian Supreme
Leader Ali Khamenei and at least half of the 270-seat Parliament
as well as the clerics of the religious cities of Qom and
Mashhad.
</P>
<P>
The white turban clergyman is maneuvering into position with
a policy of "privatization" and "more social justice." However,
he said that he would follow the same policies pioneered by
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani with an emphasis on the Second
Five-Year Development Plan (1995-1999).
</P>
<P>
Khatami, 54, who had been obscure from the political scene in
Tehran for more than four years, has focused his campaign
strategy on cultural issues such as freedom of press and
tolerance for expression of ideas by opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
The black turban clergyman has secured the backing of the
left-wing group called the Society of Combatant Clergymen (SCC)
and the pro-Rafsanjani liberal camp called G-6 and is counting
on youths and intellectuals for their votes.
</P>
<P>
Other two candidates, former information minister Mohammad
Mohammadi Reyshahri, also clergyman, and Deputy Judicial Chief
Saied Reza Zavareie, vowed to fight to the end though there is
no chance for them to win. They are widely regarded as outsiders
unlikely to have any impact on the elections but expected to
take votes away from Nateq-Nouri because they belong to the same
camp.

Process Joint Committee announced here today.
</P>

This work was originally started in the capital city of

delayed due to various difficulties in logistics.
</P>

Londuimbale and Vila Nova controlled by the National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).

<P>
NICOSIA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and Romania today signed a
protocol on upgrading bilateral cooperation in a wide spectrum of
fields including trade, industry, tourism, agriculture and

for investments and joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
It was also noted that Romania's participation in the 22nd
Cyprus International State Fair, which opened here Wednesday,
shows increased interest among business people in Romania to
improve the trade relations with Cyprus.

According to an Israel Television report, Baz, who returned to
Egypt this afternoon to report to Mubarak on his two-hour meeting
with the Israeli prime minister, will come back to the Jewish
state to hold further talks Sunday.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, Netanyahu and Mubarak agreed to meet
Tuesday in Sharm el-Sheikh of Egypt, following a series of
contacts between Netanyahu and Egyptian ambassador to Israel,
Mohammed Bassiouny, which led to a telephone conversation
between Netanyahu and Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Netanyahu said that "Egypt can, if it wants,
play a decisive role in getting out of the diplomatic crisis
(between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)."
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that through a series of meetings and
exchange of ideas, his country and its Arab neighbors would be
able to reactivate the stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told Israel
Radio today that the success of the summit depends largely on
Israel's agreement on a six-month freeze of the ongoing Jewish
settlement activities in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Moussa is due to arrive in Israel Monday to lay the
groundwork for the summit in meetings with Netanyahu, Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy and President Ezer Weizman.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, Mubarak called on Weizman, and invited the
Israeli president to meet with him, and they then agreed to
confer in the near future, apparently in Sharm el-Sheikh next
week.
</P>
<P>
The invitation triggered sharp criticism in Jerusalem that
Mubarak "was trying to make Netanyahu appear as the obstacle to
the resumption of the peace talks."

<TEXT>
<P>
Sources in the Prime Minister's Office expressed
dissatisfaction with both Mubarak and Weizman at their attempts
to hold a summit meeting, accusing them of trying to set up what
they called "a Netanyahu bypass road."
</P>
<P>
The sources criticized Weizman for being "out of line,"
noting that a meeting between him and Mubarak is "definitely too
much," though his previous two meetings with PNA President Yasser
Arafat were somehow accepted.
</P>
<P>
The same sources also slammed Egypt, and said the meeting is
an attempt to use Weizman to cover up Egypt's negative role in
the process.
</P>
<P>
They claimed that Egypt has systematically sabotaged every
initiative to solve the crisis, causing the Palestinians to take
harsher positions, while at the same time initiating public
moves intended to show Netanyahu up as the one who should be
responsible for the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu held a series of talks with Bassiouny, who
conveyed him a message from Mubarak. The Israeli premier made a
reply, urging Mubarak to assume a more positive stance in
efforts to get the peace talks back on track.
</P>
<P>
Reports here revealed that sources of the European Union (EU)
had told Israel that Egypt was preparing a new initiative for
the peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, as well as
those between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials said that U.S. Special Middle East
Coordinator Dennis Ross attempted to bring together all the
different peace initiatives during his next visit to the
region.
</P>
<P>
Ross is also expected to make a public call on both Israel
and the Palestinians to renew their peace negotiations, they
said.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between the two sides stalled again in March after
Israel started building a new Jewish neighborhood at Har Homa,
also known as Jabal Abu Ghoneim, in East Jerusalem, which the PNA
wants as capital of its independent state.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has said that Israel must stop the settlement
construction before talks can resume, while, Israel insists that
the PNA crack down on extremist activities so as to reestablish
full security cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Direct Talks on Cyprus Set to Start in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The first round of direct talks
between Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash is expected to start on July 7 and last for
seven to 10 days, Cyprus' Government Spokesman Manolis
Christofides announced here today.
</P>
<P>
"There is sound basis behind reports that July 7 is a likely
date for the start of talks," Christofides told his daily press
briefing, but refrained from giving any specific details.
</P>
<P>
Asked if there is an agenda for the talks, the spokesman
replied: "We have no concrete information about the talks, we
expect to be informed from the U.N. at the end of this month."
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot president said on Thursday night that direct
negotiations on the Cyprus' question are set to begin in July.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Antenna TV network, the president elaborated that
he did not expect the first round of talks to start in June, as
originally thought, because U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan will
be preoccupied with a U.N. conference on the environment,
scheduled for the end of June.
</P>
<P>
Clerides will be among several heads of state attending the
U.N. environment meeting in the U.N. headquarters in New York.
</P>
<P>
At the weekend, Kofi Annan and his Undersecretary-General Sir
Kieran Prendergast announced that both Clerides and Denktash had
indicated their willingness to go to New York to have
face-to-face talks, which would originally begin during the
second half of June.
</P>
<P>
Annan is expected to extend invitations to Clerides and
Denktash for direct talks after receiving a report from
Prendergast, who had been on a fact-finding mission for the past
two weeks in Cyprus, Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believed that the delay will give ample time
to U.N. resident representative in Cyprus, Gustave Feissel, and
other mediators to try to bridge differences between the two
communities on the island during the on-going proximity talks,
to prepare the ground for the face-to-face negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unresolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkish troops occupied its northern
third in the wake of a short-lived Greek Cypriot coup seeking
union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> China Battles Past Indonesia Into Sudirman Cup Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GLASGOW, Scotland, May 23 (Xinhua) -- China, the defending
champion, clinched a place in the Sudirman Cup mixed team
badminton final, but only after a tough clash against Indonesia on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese edging out their opponents 3-2 and will meet in the
final the winner of the other semifinal between Denmark and South
Korea being played on Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
With Susi Susanti of Indonesia scoring a surprise win over
world and All-England champion Ye Zhaoying, the outcome eventually
rested on the final women's doubles tie.
</P>
<P>
But, this time, there was never any hint of an upset as the
Olympic champions Ge Fei and Gu Jun cruised to a 15-3 15-3 victory
over Eliza and Rosiana Zelin.
</P>
<P>
China gained an early advantage with Liu Yong and Ge taking the
mixed doubles in straight games against Limpele Flandy and Minarti
Timur, winning 18-15, 15-13.
</P>
<P>
But Susanti, one of the most successful ever woman players, set
the match alight when she staged a thrilling fightback against
Ye. The Chinese player comfortably took the opening game 11-6, but
Susanti, the former world champion who has now dropped to number
five in the world, sent the tie into a third end by taking the
second 11-6.
</P>
<P>
The decider was totally one-sided with Susanti, who recently
married the former Olympic Champion Allan Budi Kusuma, in totally
dominant form, while Ye crumbled dramatically under the pressure
and failed to win a point in going down 11-6, 6-11, 11-0.
</P>
<P>
It was a win that raised Indonesia's hopes of reclaiming the
title that had eluded them since the inaugural year of 1989 in
Jakarta and helped set the stage for a dramatic climax.
</P>
<P>
China regained the advantage in the men's singles with
All-England Champion Dong Jiong crushing veteran Ardy Wiranata
15-2, 15-8, but Budiarto Sigit and Chandra Wijaya set-up the final
tie decider with a 15-8, 15-6 win over Liu Yong and Sun Jun in the
men's doubles.
</P>
<P>
"We all played our best, but China are stronger overall and
deserved the win," said Susanti. "I was delighted with my own form
and it gives me confidence for next week's individual
championships."
</P>
<P>
"We go a step further toward winning the cup again," said
Chinese coach Li Yongbo. "The Indonesians played well today and
the match is a close one. Susanti especially played well."

<HEADLINE> Drug Dealer Nabbed by Police in Cameroun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, May 23 (Xinhua) -- A farmer and trader was recently
nabbed by policemen in East Province of Cameroun while
transporting 70 kilograms of "indian hemp" to capital Yaounde,
local paper "Cameroun Tribune" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Djijiwa Saoufou, 67, was caught by Police Inspector Serfebe
Robert who was on a routine round with his two colleagues when a
"saviem" car drew up at Bertoua Motor Park for refuelling. Robert
suspected that some of the flour bags on top of the car contained
Indian hemp. Policemen began to check the bags and took out six
of many bags containing cassava flour. They found each of the six
bags contained a smaller bag well stuffed with Indian hemp.
</P>
<P>
Caught in dragnet, Djijiwa tried to "negotiate" with the
policemen. He proposed "huge sum of money" to the three policemen
to free him and cover up the crime, but failed. The policemen
arrested him and whisked him off to the police station in Bertoua
where the drug was weighted at 70 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
During police questioning, he revealed that he cultivates
Indian hemp in Pana Village in the East Province and indicated
that there are other Indian hemp farmers in the subdivison of the
province from whom he bought the drug in order to make up for his
own stock which is far below demand.
</P>
<P>
Djijiwa told the policemen he has been doing this drug
business for more than a year now. He said he bought the 70
kilograms of Indian hemp at 70000 Francs CFA and estimated that
he'll sell it to his regular customer at 4 million Francs CFA.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- A seminar of Angolan members of
parliament on "landmines consequences" was held here today under
the auspices of the International Red Cross Society and the UN
Children's Fund.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was aimed at helping members of the Angolan
National Assembly be realized with international activities
launched for removing landmines, dangers of landmines to human
beings and their affects for agricultural productions.
</P>
<P>
During the seminar, the members of parliament were briefed
about the state and consequences of landmines planted in Angola
bu the Angolan government officials.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that a total of 13 million landmines of 62
kinds made in 22 countries had been buried in Angola during
30-year-long anti-colonialism and civil wars, which has seriously
affected the country's agricultural production and development.
</P>
<P>
They revealed that out of 5-8 million hectares of arable land
in Angola, only 20-30 percent is under cultivation because of
underground landmines.
</P>
<P>
The landmines are also severely threatening human lives. A
survey conducted by the European Union in 1996 shows that one or
two Angolans are injured by landmines every day. So far, 75,000
Angolans have been disabled on the legs by landmines.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investments in Zambia Reach 132 million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 23 (xinhua) -- Annual inflow of foreign direct
investment (FDI) reached 132 million U.S. Dollars in Zambia last
year, according to Anglo American Managing Director Anderson
Mazoka.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia today quoted Mazoka as saying that 1997
promises to be another good year for Zambia's national economy,
although the prolonged heavy rains early in the year suggested
that agricultural growth will be slower than last year's 34
percent.
</P>
<P>
Zambia desperately needs substantial new and dramatically
increased investments in infrastructure and skills creation to
compete with some of its neighbors with better infrastructure and
stronger skills base, said Mazoka.
</P>
<P>
He said the privatization of copper mining industry marked a
"watershed" for the Zambian economy.
</P>
<P>
The full impact of privatization of the copper mining industry
will not be felt until the next century, but in the meantime the
infusion of new management and capital will reverse the decline
of recent years, said Mazoka.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan, Burundian Presidents Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Y. Museveni and
the visiting Burundian President Pierre Buyoya held discussions
on current situation in Burundi here today.
</P>
<P>
During their discussion which lasted more than four hours,

of the regional heads of state.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya said that he has announced the peace negotiations which

The peace talks will be aimed at reaching a peace agreement, a
cease-fire and a common understanding on constitutional issues,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Infrastructure Important in Africa: Says World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Vice-President for the Africa
region of the World Bank Calisto Madavo today said the
development of African economies will not be sustained unless
infrastructure on the continent is developed.
</P>
<P>
Addressing delegates at the 1997 southern Africa economic
summit in Harare, Madavo said Africa is beginning to attract
investors and it is evident there is money to be made through
investments.
</P>
<P>
Africa now has greater political and social stability, and
with the participation in economies by various segments,
infrastructure is becoming important.
</P>
<P>
"We need to deepen, broaden and sharpen infrastructure
development. The challenge in Africa should be to grow at annual
rate of 10 percent and not five percent. This would enable
Africa to address its problem of poverty," he said.
</P>
<P>
Unless something is done for the poor, he said, the continent
will not make much progress.
</P>
<P>
Currently, he said, Africa lacks in quality and quantity of
infrastructure as a result of postponed maintenance.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Africa will need 1.5 billion U.S. Dollars
in the next 10 years to improve its infrastructure, he said.

<HEADLINE> US Senate Approves Balanced-budget Outline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate approved today a
balanced-budget agreement for cutting taxes and spending to erase
U.S. federal deficits by 2002.
</P>
<P>
With strong support from both Republicans and Democrats alike,
the Senate adopted an outline of the deal by a vote of 78 to 22.
</P>
<P>
The agreement envisions 85 billion dollars in tax cuts over the
next five years plus savings from Medicare, defense and other
programs totaling 321 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Senate measure was an outline of overall tax and spending
totals for the next five years plus a statement of the compromises
President Clinton and leaders of the U.S. Congress reached during
months of bargaining.
</P>
<P>
The House also approved an almost identical plan on Wednesday
and the two chambers had planned to complete a compromise version
this week.
</P>
<P>
Actual changes in revenue and tax laws will have to be made in
15 separate bills the U.S. Congress will write later this year.
</P>
<P>
Even so, Senate approval pushed lawmakers a step closer to
forging the first U.S. federal surplus since 1969, when President
Johnson's income-tax surcharge produced 3 billion dollars in black
ink.
</P>
<P>
It also moved them toward a major political coup for Clinton
and congressional leaders that both sides could claim as a
significant accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
The passage of the agreement was hard-won after defeating
strong oppositions from some U.S. congressmen.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Senate thwarted Thursday a final potential threat to the
agreement to reject a motion to kill the package because it would
violate previously enacted spending limits for next year by 9
billion dollars. The Senate's leadership also turned back several
efforts to add billions more for schools and roads.
</P>
<P>
Even the balanced-budget agreement has been approved by the
U.S. Congress, it could all vanish if the economy ends its current
expansion, the third-longest in history, in the coming few years.

<HEADLINE> Albright: U.S. Has no Plan to Stay in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States has no plan to
continue the deployment of troops in Bosnia after June 1998, U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the State Department,
Albright also denied that she has disagreements over Bosnia with
Defense Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
"We have made clear that SFOR (Stabilization Forces) will end
in June 1988 and that that mission will be completed," said she.
</P>
<P>
However, she stressed that civilian implementation of the
Dayton peace accords for Bosnia had been lagging behind and needed
to be stepped up.
</P>
<P>
"We envision that civilian assistance, and an international
presence, will be required after June 1988," she added.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a senior State Department official hinted that it
may be possible for the U.S. troops to stay in Bosnia beyond the
deadline while Cohen has repeatedly decided to pull all the U.S.
troops out of Bosnia by then.
</P>
<P>
"There is not disagreement between me and the Pentagon,"
Albright told reporters. "SFOR ends June 1988, we have made that
very clear, and we have no plans for any lengthening of American
forces."
</P>
<P>
"We have determined that we need to invigorate the civilian
implementation and the cooperation between the civilian and the
military within the mandate that the military has to provide a
secure environment for the civilian implementation tasks to go
forward," she added.

<HEADLINE> Albright Disappointed over Formation of Congo Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said on Friday that the United States wanted the
Democratic Congo to form a government including others than just
President Laurent Kabila's alliance.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, who proclaimed to be the president of the Democratic
Republic of Congo this week after entering the capital of
Kinshasa, on Thursday announced partial formation of a government.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Albright said that the importance of
having a cabinet and a government for the Democratic Congo "is
inclusive of others than just his alliance."
</P>
<P>
The United States was disappointed over Kabila's formation of
the government, as it had repeatedly called for a transition
period for what it called "democratic elections", participated in
by all political parties.
</P>
<P>
Albright also expressed concerns over Rwandan refugees in
eastern Congo who had reports said suffered from massacres. She
said: "The situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo remains
a serious concern."

<HEADLINE> New Treatment Found for Flesh-eating Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- A group of Canadian doctors have
developed an antibody brew that could have wide application in
treating the flesh-eating disease, a report said today.
</P>
<P>
A study of the new treatment shows that it has reduced the
mortality of streptococcal diseases by as much as 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Mortality for flesh-eating disease was between 70 and 90
percent before the new treatment emerged, according to today's
Globe and Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Researchers have blended naturally occurring antibodies, known
as immunoglobulins, from several different blood donors to create
the new treatment.
</P>
<P>
"We obtain these antibodies that naturally occur in people's
blood. We extract them from blood donors... and give them back
(intravenously) to the people who have this disease," said Dr.
Bing Siang Gan of Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital.
</P>
<P>
"We are combining the immunity of a score of people and putting
it in one person," Dr. Gan was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The new treatment does not replace surgery or antibiotics but
is an additional way to attack the flesh-eating disease, Dr. Gan
added.
</P>
<P>
One of the first people to benefit from the treatment was
Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard, who contracted the flesh-eating
disease in 1994 and had to have a leg amputated.
</P>
<P>
Bouchard doctors turned to the procedure when traditional
antibiotics and surgical methods were not working and he was near
death.
</P>
<P>
The disease comes from streptococcus bacilli, and is easily
treated. But in a small number of cases the organism can bring on
deadly consequences.
</P>
<P>
Severe infections can lead to streptococcal toxic-shock
syndrome, which leads to organ failure and the flesh-eating
disease.
</P>
<P>
The number of cases of the disease is increasing, but it
remains relatively rare, with about 100 cases a year in Canada,
the paper said.

SARAJEVO, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Alija Izetbegovic, chairman of the
Bosnian presidency, on Friday talked with Croatian presidential
envoy Franjo Greguric on trade and other issues concerning the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Greguric said that they had discussed ways
to establish better economic cooperation and increase the export
of goods from Bosnia and the Muslim-Croat federation to Croatia
and the other way round.
</P>
<P>
Croatia enjoys a huge surplus in trade with Bosnia, which has
stirred loud complaints in Sarajevan media.
</P>
<P>
They also talked about the entrance of Croatian companies and
private businessmen into the energy and metal industries of
Bosnia, Greguric said.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian official said that the talk touched upon the issue
of the up coming summit between Izetbegovic and Croatian president

<HEADLINE> Canada Urges U.S. to Return to Salmon Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government today called
on the United States to "return in good faith to negotiations"
aimed at solving the Pacific salmon dispute.
</P>
<P>
Canada suspended talks on May 21 when the U.S. negotiator was
unable to advance a position on one of the key southern issues,
Fraser River sockeye.
</P>
<P>
"I am contacting U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
today to urge that the United States send its chief negotiator
back to the table with a mandate to reach agreement on the
dispute," said Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that "barring an immediate return to
negotiations, we will consider further options. Any further steps
we take must be aimed at resuming negotiations--not detracting
from them."
</P>
<P>
"On May 21, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans stepped up
enforcement of measures requiring foreign vessels to contact
Canadian authorities as they pass through Canadian waters," said
Fisheries and Oceans Minister Fred Mifflin.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian Minister added that his country will assess the
impact of these measures in the near future to determine their
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
Under the Department of Fisheries and Oceans regulations,
vessels that violated the regulations can be inspected, required
to go to a Canadian port or face arrest, depending on
circumstances. U.S. vessels going to and from the Alaskan Fishery
are subject to these regulations.
</P>
<P>
The talks to end the four-year deadlock in the Pacific Salmon
Treaty involve reducing the high levels of U.S. interception of
salmon heading through Alaskan waters in Canadian waters to breed,
and a balanced reduction in Canadian and American interception
each other's salmon stocks farther south off Vancouver Island, in
the Fraser River and Straits of Juan de Fuca.
</P>
<P>
Canadian officials say Canada has honored its treaty
obligations to take a limited share of West Coast commercial
salmon stocks.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. Alaskan catch, the officials say, has been
continuously excessive and has reached a 500-million U.S. dollars
imbalance in favor of the United States since 1985.

<HEADLINE> International Energy Agency Stresses Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The International Energy Agency (IEA)
today stressed the importance of environment protection for energy
policies of all its member countries, in order to attain the
greenhouse gas emission control objectives set by the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the governing board at ministerial level of IEA
held today in Paris, the ministers in charge of economic affairs
of IEA's 23 member countries agreed that the most pressing
challenge facing them is to make energy policies that will help
limit and reduce greenhouse gas emission, held responsible for
global climate change.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change will
meet in December in Kyoto, Japan, for the signing of an agreement
on greenhouse gas emission control by United Nations member
countries, said the ministers in a communique after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The ministers reaffirmed that energy security remains the most
important criterion guiding IEA activities.
</P>
<P>
They said that although the world oil market is evolving toward
greater competition, transparency, and efficiency, IEA countries
are more and more depending on oil import, with oil accounting for
40 percent of the energy consumption of these countries.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, most of the remaining oil reserves are concentrated
in the Middle East region, and the strategic and operational oil
stock in IEA net importing countries has been declining over the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also stressed cooperation with non-member
countries like China, Russia and India, and broadening exchanges
with oil producer countries, including those in the Middle East,
Central Asia, Trans-Caucasia, Africa and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
The IEA countries include Ireland, Australia, Austria, Belgium,
Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Canada, Luxembourg, the United
States, Norway, Portugal, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey,
Spain, Greece, New Zealand, Italy, Britain, France and Finland.

destination when its fledgling tourism industry expects to attract
500,000 foreign tourists next year, officials here said today.
</P>
<P>
A group of 14 foreign journalists associated with various

<HEADLINE> Khatami Wins Landslide Victory in Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Open-minded clergyman Seyed Mohammad
Khatami has secured the next presidency by winning a majority
of votes cast at the Friday presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The Election Headquarters of the Interior Ministry announced
just a few minutes ago that Khatami has won a total 15,490,659
votes which have been counted so far.
</P>
<P>
The figure means the front-runner obtained a lionshare of
68.16 percent of 22,726,364 votes accounted up to now. The
headquarters said that the vote counting is still continuing.
</P>
<P>
The accounted votes are from 27,036 polling stations at 238
towns and cities.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that Khatami has got enough votes to be the
next president since there are a total of 33 million eligible
voters in the country. About 25 million voters are estimated to
have turned out Friday.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters said that Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar
Nateq-Nouri, another front-runner in the presidential race, has so
far got 5,946,885 votes, 26.16 percent of the accounted votes.
</P>
<P>
The underdog candidate today extended congratulation to his
arch rival Khatami for his victory in the presidential election
race.
</P>
<P>
Nateq-Nouri said "I congratulate your election by the public
to the post of the president, to the leader, the people of Iran
and you."
</P>
<P>
The harlinder speaker pledged "I will do my best to cooperate
with you in every way."
</P>
<P>
"I hope we will witness the strengthening of the foundations of
the Islamic Republic of Iran and the principle laid down by late
(leader) Imam (Ayatollah) Khomeini," he added.
</P>
<P>
The turnout in elections was one of the highest held in the
past 18 years since the founding of the Islamic Republic of Iran
in 1979.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official on Relationship Between Shanghai and HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Minister of Communications Liu
Songjin said here today that the Shanghai international shipping
center that is under construction will maintain a complementary
relationship of mutual development with Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In a forum focusing on the "one country, two systems" principle
and Hong Kong's economy, Liu said the Shanghai port handled a
total of 160 million tons freight in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the volume of international containers last year
reached another record high of 1.97 million standard containers,
up 29 percent over the previous year, he noted, adding that the
port at present dispatches about 359 international container ships
each month.
</P>
<P>
Liu pointed out that Shanghai and Hong Kong have different
hinterland areas, due to their geographical locations.
</P>
<P>
As leader of the economic belt of the Pearl River and with
South China as its main hinterland, Hong Kong is mainly engaged in
entrepot transportation and its rate of containerization has
exceeded 90 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Shanghai leads the economic belt along the Yangtze,
with a containerization rate of only 52 percent, and an entrepot
transportation of only 35 percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
Because of geographical reasons and limited deep water channel
and harbor in Shanghai, it is necessary to establish a close
cooperative relationship between Shanghai and Hong Kong, Liu noted.
</P>
<P>
Of 359 ships the Shanghai port dispatches each month, he said,
more than 30 percent are bound for Hong Kong. After the return of
Hong Kong, the shipping links between Shanghai and Hong Kong will
be even closer, he said.

<P>
NANJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The treatment of the Huaihe River
and Taihu Lake is a key state project and related localities must
make concerted efforts to advance it, Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun
said at a national conference.
</P>
<P>
The State Council's Fourth Working Conference on Treatment of
Huaihe River and Taihu Lake, held in the city of Xuzhou in east
China's Jiangsu Province on May 23 and 24, reflected on
implementation of the State Council's decisions on the treatment
of Huaihe and Taihu since 1991 and assigned work for the years
ahead.
</P>
<P>
Great progress has been made in the treatment of the river and
the lake, and some projects have been completed and are yielding
economic returns, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The projects that are already under way in the Huaihe River
area and ten backbone projects in the Taihu Lake area should be
basically completed in the year 2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he stressed, the prevention and treatment of
water pollution in the regions must be dealt with properly.
</P>
<P>
Both the central and local government should increase the
investment according to the determined proportion, he said.
</P>
<P>
Huaihe and Taihu cover six provinces and cities in east
China. In the past six years or so, 3.4 billion yuan has been
poured into the treatment of the Taihu Lake area, and 5.776
billion yuan into the treatment of the Huaihe River.

<P>
In 1991, the Taihu Lake area was hit by severe floodings and
suffered some 13 billion yuan worth of direct economic loss. Soon
after the floodings, the State Council convened a meeting on the
control of the lake and decided on ten backbone projects, seven of
which are well under way.
</P>
<P>
The lake withnesses the third, seventh and sixth highest water
levels in 1993, 1995 and 1996 respectively since the founding of
new China in 1949. Because of the backbone projects, the
overflowing water was diverted, ensuring the safety of the area.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimated that the economic loss in the Taihu Lake area
will be reduced by more than three billion yuan if a flooding as
severe as the one in 1991 hit the area again under current
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The Huaihe River, which goes through Henan, Anhui, Shandong,
and Jiangsu provinces, was also hit by severe floods in 1991. The
State Council decided to control the river within a decade. So
far, the construction of 12 of the 18 key projects designated by
the State Council has started.
</P>
<P>
However, Jiang noted, because the water systems in the areas
are highly complicated, governments of concerned localities must
enhance exchange and coordination and subject regional interests
to overall interests.
</P>
<P>
Whoever hinders the smooth implementation of the projects and
causes delay will be held responsible, Jiang said.

HONG KONG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Thailand today expressed its
confidence in Hong Kong's future after the territory reverts to
the People's Republic of China on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
His country is supportive of the "One Country, Two Systems"

Thailand has recognized the new HKSAR passport and decided to
grant visa-free access to the passport holders in visiting
Thailand for a period of 30 days, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government took this decision because it is in the
mutual interest of Thailand and Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Such a move should not only reflect our full confidence in the
future of HKSAR and the commitment that China will honor the 1984
Sino-British Joint Declaration, but also contribute positively to

<HEADLINE> Egyptian President Returns Home From Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
returned home this afternoon after a few-hour meeting with
Jordanian King Hussein earlier today in a bid to revive the
flagging Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The summit at the Jordanian port city of Aqaba is part of
Egypt's extensive diplomacy to salvage Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks, which collapsed in mid-March after Israel started Har Homa
settlement project for Jews in Arab East Jerusalem,
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference held at the end of their meeting,
Hussein expressed appreciation to Egypt's intensified peace
efforts, hoping "a solution will be reached."
</P>
<P>
On his part, Mubarak said he cannot confirm one hundred percent
that efforts will succeed as circumstances are difficult.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hussein, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu
and himself share the view that the present situation of the peace
process "is worth a drive by any means."
</P>
<P>
"The peace process will be long but we do not have to be
desperate as if there would not be peace," he added.
</P>
<P>
While underlining the importance of U.S. role in the peace
process, Mubarak said Egyptian efforts come with "no preconditions
but discussions," referring to the recent trip to Israel by his
top advisor Osama el-Baz.
</P>
<P>
As a result of a flurry of telephone contacts in the past three
days between Mubarak and Netanyahu, they agreed to meet in the Red
Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh Tuesday to discuss "constructive"
ideas to revive the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has recently proposed a six-month freeze on the
construction of settlements until negotiations open on the future
of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, on his part, reportedly offered a compromise
proposal during talks with Baz, underwhich Israel will finish
infrastructure for Har Homa, but the house building will stop for
several months.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat, who
visited Egypt early this week, had lamented that the Mideast is
heading for "the abyss" if Netanyahu's policies were not blocked.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Egypt, the only two Arab countries that have signed
peace treaties with Israel, are serving as mediators in the
Mideast peace process.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Sets up Marking Stones at Sites of National Shame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The municipal government of Beijing
today held unveiling ceremonies for marking stones erected at
eight "Commemorative Sites of National Shame" in downtown and
suburban areas.
</P>
<P>
Each site is connected with the period of the War of Resistance
against the Japanese Aggression (1937-1945), when Beijing, then
named Beiping, was under the Japanese occupation.
</P>
<P>
Seven of the sites witnessed the slaughter of Chinese civilians
and resistance fighters by the Japanese troops by various
atrocities, such as being fed to wolfhounds and live burial.
</P>
<P>
The other site, the only one in downtown Beijing, is in Tiantan
(Temple of Heaven) Park, which was the headquarters of a Japanese
germ-warfare troop during the war.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred people, including leading officials of the
Beijing municipal government, experts on cultural relics, local
residents, and students, attended the ceremony in Tiantan Park.
</P>
<P>
The marking stone, 30cm in length and width and 175cm in
height, was made of white marble, with the name of the site on the
front side and detailed explanation on the other sides.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Beijing municipal government told the
gathering that the marking of these sites is of great significance
to foster the sense of national dignity and highlights the
national spirit of ceaseless self-improvement among the people.
</P>
<P>
Beijing now has more than 30 historical sites that records the
Japanese wartime atrocities.
</P>
<P>
The eight sites marked today were also listed recently among
the municipality's first group of "bases for education on patriotism"
among the Beijing residents.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The finance ministers from the
six states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) converged in the
Qatari capital Doha today to resume talks on a single customs
union that has eluded them for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources in Qatar said the meeting will focus on the
remaining list of products that should be classified under the
new customs system.
</P>
<P>
"Most imported products have been classified by the GCC
experts except only five percent," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The GCC states, which include Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, the
United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Oman, have sought to unify their
widely varied customs duties on foreign imports in line with a
1982 economic pact which calls for a common market.
</P>
<P>
But the plan has been put on hold by differences over the
level of the standard tariff, with Bahrain demanding high duties
as it relies heavily on taxes because of its poor oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia also wants high duties on selective products to
protect its burgeoning industries.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Accepts Extra U.S. Sugar Quota </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Sugar Regulatory
Administration Board has agreed to accept the 27,000-ton
additional sugar export quota given by Washington for the
1996-1997 quota year, Agriculture Secretary Salvador Escudero said
today.
</P>
<P>
Expecting a possible rise in sugar production this crop year,
the board decided to reverse its previous decision and decided to
meet the extra quota allocated by the United States earlier this
month, Escudero was quoted as saying by the Philippine News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
According to Escudero, who is also the sugar board chairman,
the country's sugar production in this harvest is expected to
reach 1.9 million tons, slightly higher than the
previously-projected level.
</P>
<P>
Escudero said the estimated 1.9-million-ton-production will be
enough to meet the additional shipments that would increase the
Philippine sugar quota to the U.S. market to 273,991 tons.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Agriculture Department decided to import more sugar
for the fourth quarter on account of a low harvest in its
sugar-producing states.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is the third largest quota holder under the
U.S. tariff rate quota system for sugar with a share of 13.5
percent, next only to the Dominican Republic and Brazil.

BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Beida-Founders Groups, a major
computer typesetting corporation, has successfully edged into the
Japanese market with its Japanese composition software system,
today's "Beijing Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
At the Great Hall of the People in Beijing Friday, a Japanese
company signed a contract with Beida-Founders to buy the latter's
software. The two also signed an agreement to enhance their
technological cooperation.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that a Chinese enterprise makes a
large-scale export of high-tech application software which bears
its own copyright and brand-name, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Beida-Founders, a computer group company run by Beijing
University, has, over the past decade, grown to be the largest
provider of Chinese character composition and printing systems
around the world.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, Beida-Founders took up 80 percent of market
share in Chinese character composition and printing both at home
and abroad.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it has developed electronic typesetting systems
with regard to the Japanese, Korean, Arabian, Vietnamese, and
Mongolian languages. IBM is acting as a marketing agent for
Founders electronic composition and printing systems.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, Beida-Founders had 32 branch companies
outside Beijing. In 1996, its total output value reached four
billion yuan (482 million US dollars) and pre-tax profits 230
million yuan (27.7 million US dollars).

<HEADLINE> American Chinese Artist Holds Cybernetic Sculptures Show in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Tsai Wen-Ying, an acclaimed
American Chinese artist, held a "homecoming" exhibition in Beijing
to showcase his recent cybernetic sculptures.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, jointly sponsored by the Ministry of Culture,
State Science and Technology Commission, and AT&AMP;T, the leading US
telecom carrier, is the first national-level show for cybernetic
art in China.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the artist's innovative "cybernetic" sculpture
installations that utilize engineering and high technology, Tsai's
exhibition features twenty of his works from the last quarter
century, including some of the artists' early cybernetic
sculptures of Victory, Semisphere, and Tuning Fork. In addition,
large-scale cybernetic pieces from the 1980s such as Electra and
Rising Fountain were also on display.
</P>
<P>
For the homecoming show, Tsai has created a series of new works
specifically for Beijing, composed of fiberglass rods that vibrate
in response to sound and motion. Viewers are able to interact with
the noise-and-movement-sensitive pieces.
</P>
<P>
Since its beginning on April 19, the four-week-long exhibition
has received thousands of Chinese visitors.
</P>
<P>
Born in Xiamen, Fujian Province, in 1928, Tsai went to US for
modern art study in 1950, and has displayed his works in galleries
across the world, including New York's Museum of Modern Art and
the Venice Biennale.
</P>
<P>
"I have been dreaming of having an exhibition in China for a
long time. As the dream comes true, I hope to see more and more
Chinese people join in the global development of technological
art," Tsai said.

<HEADLINE> HK Provisional Legislature Supports Recommendation of Chief Justice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Provisional Legislative
Council (PLC) unanimously supported the recommendation of Andrew
Li Kwok-nang as chief justice of the Court of Final Appeal (CFA)
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
Elsie Leung Oi-Sie, secretary of justice of the future HKSAR
moved a motion here today at the PLC plenary meeting to seek the
members' support for the recommendation of Li as the chief justice
of the CFA.
</P>
<P>
All legislators in the sitting echoed their support for the
recommendation of Li, whose appointment as the chief justice will
not come into effect until July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
As the Court of Final Appeal is established on July 1, 1997,
Hong Kong will for the first time in its history have its own
highest appellate court in Hong Kong, Leung told the members of
the interim legislature. The Court of Final Appeal will replace
the Privy Council based in London as the final appellate court
after the handover.
</P>
<P>
The secretary of justice said: "To ensure a smooth transition
of the Judiciary, preparations are in hand to establish the Court
of Final Appeal, and a prime task is the appointment of the chief
justice."
</P>
<P>
Executive Councilor Andrew Li Kwok-nang was unanimously
recommended by the Judicial Officers Recommendation Commission
(designate), an independent body set up according to the Basic Law
to advise the Chief Executive on judicial appointments. The
49-year-old lawyer was selected from a pool of over 140 qualified
candidates based on their judicial and professional caliber.
</P>
<P>
Leung reiterated that the commission has operated completely
independently throughout the selection process. "Indeed I believe
that speculations on the possibility of interference or undue
influence had been effectively and spectacularly quashed by the
unanimity of vote of the commission," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law requires that the chief justice of the Court of
Final Appeal be a Chinese citizen who is a permanent resident of
the HKSAR with no right of abode in any foreign country.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa has accepted the recommendation.
</P>
<P>
"The Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal is an important
post. As head of the HKSAR Judiciary, the Chief Justice will lead
the Judiciary into the next century," Leung told the council
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Quite a number of PLC members rose to voice their support for
the motion, including representatives of the Liberal Democratic
Party and the Hong Kong Progressive Alliance.
</P>
<P>
"After July 1, 1997, Hong Kong will have its own Court of Final
Appeal and its own Chief Justice. It is a sure step towards Hong
Kong people governing Hong Kong and a high degree of autonomy,"
said PLC member Ip Kwok Him at the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Solid Step towards Establishment of CFA, Independent HKSAR Judiciary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Provisional Legislative
Council (PLC) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR) endorsed, after a debate and through a unanimous voting,
here today a motion in support of the recommendation to appoint
Andrew Li Kwok-nang as the HKSAR's first Chief Justice of Court of
Final Appeal.
</P>
<P>
The motion was moved by SAR's Secretary of Justice, Elsie Leung
Oi-sie, while the recommendation was made by the Judicial Officers
Recommendation Commission (JORC) (Designate) recently, an
independent body set up in light of the Basic Law on the HKSAR to
advise HKSAR Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa on judicial
appointments.
</P>
<P>
Li will take office right after Hong Kong's handover at the
midnight on June 30 this year, after being appointed by the Chief
Executive.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Executive is required to obtain such an endorsement
from the Legislature on the appointment, according to the Basic
Law, which was formulated under the principle of "one country, two
systems" and adopted by China's National People's Congress on
April 4, 1990.
</P>
<P>
This is a solid step forward in the application of relevant
provisions of the Basic Law concerning the judicial system in Hong
Kong and it demonstrates the SAR government's determination to
implement the principle of "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong".
</P>
<P>
The whole process of recommendation, debate and endorsement of
the CFA Chief Justice nominee demonstrated a respect for and
determination of everyone involved to uphold the independence of
the Judiciary and the rule of law in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation, announced in Hong Kong on Tuesday, has
since met with very positive response from people in all sectors.
</P>
<P>
The Tuesday recommendation and the debate by the PLC members
here today consititute part of the preparatory work necessary to
be completed before July 1 this year, to ensure a timely
establishment of HKSAR's Judiciary.
</P>
<P>
According to the Basic Law, the laws now existing and in force
in Hong Kong shall be maintained after the handover, except for
any that contravenes the Basic Law or any that is subject to any
amendment by the legislature of the HKSAR. The Basic Law also
rules that Hong Kong's existing judicial system will, too, be
maintained except for those changes consequent upon the
establishment of the Court of Final Appeal of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
While resuming the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, the
Chinese government authorizes the HKSAR a high degree of autonomy
which entitles the enjoyment of an independent judicial power
including that of final adjudication, for the first time in Hong
Kong's history.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has never had an independent judiciary including the
Court of Final Appeal. The Privy Council of Britain instead has
had exercised the function.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law stipulates that the Chief Justice of the HKSAR's
Court of Final Appeal shall be a Chinese citizen who is a
permanent resident of the Region with no right of abode in any
foreign country.
</P>
<P>
And the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) Ordinance requires the
nominee for the post of the Chief Justice of CFA shall be up to
the criteria including serving Justices of Appeal, serving High
Court Judges, barristers who have practiced as a barrister or
solicitor in Hong Kong for at least 10 years, and retired Chief
Justices, retired Justices of Appeal and retired judges of the
High Court who qualify under the terms of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation and the endorsement have paved the way for a
smooth transition for Hong Kong's Judiciary. And people could well
expect that an independent judiciary will help ensure Hong Kong's
long-term stability and prosperity.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Fighter Killed in Clash with Israeli Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 24 (Xinhua) -- One fighter of the Lebanese
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or party of God, was killed and three
others were wounded in a clash with Israeli occupation forces in
the western sector of south Lebanon earlier this morning.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in south Lebanon said that the dawn clash
erupted when an Israeli patrol attempting to infiltrate toward the
village of Zibgin, some 105 kilometers south of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
A Hezbollah guerrilla was killed and three others serious
injured by shrapnels of air-to-surface missiles fired by Israeli
helicopters amid the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Israeli artillery also fired more than 30 shells at the hills
surrounding Zibgin on the north edge of the Israeli self carved
buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
At 10:30 a.m. (07:30 GMT), the Israeli troops in their outpost
of Rshaf, Bint Jbeil, resumed the bombardment and shelled the
vicinities of Kafra.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes also carried out reconnaissance missions at
low altitude over the area, according to the security sources.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of Hezbollah,
confirmed the casualties, and said in a statement issued in Beirut
that its guerrillas successfully blocked an Israeli force's
advance toward Zibgin.
</P>
<P>
It said that the guerrillas used machine-guns and
rocket-propelled grenades in the clash and forced the Israelis to
retreat, noting one resistance fighter died and three wounded.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Shiite fundamentalist Hezbollah spearheads a
guerrilla warfare in south Lebanon, the last active battlefront of
the long-standing Arab-Israeli conflict, in order to oust the
Israeli occupation forces out of the Lebanese land.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish state established the 1,100-square-kilometer
``security zone" in south Lebanon ostensibly to protect northern
Israel from cross-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Official Denies New Proposal on Renewing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 24 (Xinhua) -- David Bar-Ilan, Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's media adviser, today denied that
Israel has offered to temporarily halt the construction of the new
Jewish settlement at Har Homa in East Jerusalem, reported the
state-run Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Bar-Ilan was responding to a press report that Netanyahu
presented the proposal in his meeting here Friday with Osama
Baz, adviser to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. The report said
that the new proposal is aimed at reviving the stalemated
Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Baz arrived in Israel to lay the groundwork for the summit
meeting between Mubarak and Netanyahu due to take place in
Egypt's Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh Tuesday. Baz has
flown back to Cairo and is scheduled to return to Israel for
further talks with Israeli officials.
</P>
<P>
Bar-Ilan said that Netanyahu and Baz discussed various ideas
for breaking the impasse of the peace process, which has broken
off for over two months since Israel began the Har Homa
construction in March.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from Washington, officials at the U.S.
State Department are preparing for a proposal that Israel will
temperarily stop the Har Homa building in return for a
resumption of the peace talks. Israel will also begin
construction of housing units for the Palestinians, which are
adjacent to the Har Homa settlement site.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo
said on the Voice of Palestine radio today that the Palestinian
National Authority knew nothing about the Israeli proposal
regarding Har Homa. Rabbo described the report as an Israeli
trial balloon.

GLASGOW, Scotland, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Dong Jiong of
China will have a tough battle on his way to win the men's singles

</P>
<P>
According to the draw, the newly-crowned All-England Open

MOSCOW, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Russian and English versions of
the accord between Russia and NATO to be signed on May 27 have
already been worked out, Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov
said today.
</P>
<P>
Primakov described the accord, a basic document on Russian-NATO
relations, cooperation and security, a breakthrough in the
relations between Russia and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, Russia's opposition to NATO's eastward
expansion remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The document can help eliminate Russia's worry about the
enlargement of the western alliance, Primakov said, adding the
problem now is how to implement it.

<HEADLINE> Singapore, Brunei Sign Open-Skies Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Singapore and Brunei concluded
here today an open-skies agreement, replacing the air services
agreement between the two countries signed in January 1985.
</P>
<P>
The new agreement lifts restrictions on routing, frequency and
capacity, enabling the carriers of both countries to respond more
effectively to market forces, the Civil Aviation Authority of
Singapore (CAAS) said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Singapore Airlines operates seven weekly passenger
services to Brunei while Royal Brunei Airlines operates 17
services to Singapore with three services going beyond to
Calcutta, Dubai and Land.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, passenger and freight traffic growth
between Singapore and Brunei have been promising, the CAAS said.
</P>
<P>
The annual compound growth rate for air passenger and freight
movements between the two countries from 1992 to 1996 was 4.4
percent and 8.9 percent respectively. For 1996, air passenger and
freight movements increased by 7.1 percent to 283,781 passengers
and 5.5 percent to 8,610 tons respectively.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the open-skies agreement between Singapore and
Brunei is the first of its kind within the ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations), Mah Bow Tan, Singapore Minister for
Communications, said it marks "a major milestone in the bilateral
aviation relations between their two countries.
</P>
<P>
"By opening up such opportunities to the airlines, we hope to
further encourage the growth of air traffic between Brunei and
Singapore, to levels befitting of the close ties between the two
countries," Mah said.

WARSAW, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Poland's Foreign Minister Dariusz

between Russia and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),
which will decide the relations between Russia and the enlarged
NATO.
</P>
<P>

opposed the invitation of NATO membership applicant countries to
participate in the Russian-NATO talks as observers.

Rosati said Poland was not satisfied with the U.S. position,
adding no matter where Russia and NATO have their talks, Poland
should be there.

However, Rosati said he is happy that Russia and NATO are to
sign an accord on May 27.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Cathay Pacific Suspends A330 Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Cathay Pacific, one of the
two Hong Kong airline companies, announced today that it has
suspended operations of its A330-300 fleet of 11 aircraft,
following such a step taken by another airline company -- Dragon
Airliners Limited.
</P>
<P>
In a press release circulated here this afternoon, the Cathay
Pacific described the suspension as a "precautionary measure,"
without explaining the whys.
</P>
<P>
However, reporters here believe that this step was taken by the

company because of these planes' Rolls-Royce Trent engine
problems.
</P>
<P>
"Cathay Pacific operates with the greatest regard for passenger
and employee safety and is working towards a swift resolution of
the problem," the release said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this morning, the Dragon Airlines Limited, or
Dragonair,
announced that it has suspended operations of its A330-300 fleet
of four aircraft following concerns with the reliability of its
Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engines.
</P>
<P>
It said in a press release that the "precautionary measures"
were taken "to avoid exposing its passengers and staff to any
level of risk however small."
</P>
<P>
The Dragonair stated that it has chosen to take the measures of
suspending A330-300 operation until the engine manufacture can
provide sufficient assurance that the reliability problems of the
Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engine are resolved.
</P>
<P>
The flight-suspension measures were taken after a series of
Trent 700 engine failures on Dragonair and Cathay Pacific A330
aircraft over the past few weeks. Dragonair and Cathay are two of
only three carriers internationally who operate A330 airbus models
that use Trent 700 engines.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Dragonair A330 jet with 109 passengers and 16
crew
members aboard was forced to make an emergency landing after an
engine shutdown, the fifth such incident since last November.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman from the company has confirmed that the KA061 plane
flying to Malaysia was diverted to the Philippines on Friday noon
after the pilot closed down one of the two Rolls-Royce Trent
engines and landed at Subic Bay at about 13:30.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, about 200 passengers including Chief Executive of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Tung Chee-hwa were
stranded overnight after another Dragonair A330 suffered hydraulic
problems and was seven hours late leaving Hong Kong, it was
reported here.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak-Hussein Summit Champions Peace: Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The summit between Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and Jordan's King Hussein today is expected to
contribute to the efforts to revive the peace process, Egyptian
Ambassador in Amman Hani Riyad said today.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's few-hour visit to the Jordanian port city of Aqaba
comes at "a very appropriate time" as the Mideast peace talks have
been disrupted by Israel's insistence on the settlement policy,
Riyad told Egyptian Voice of Arab radio this morning.
</P>
<P>
The Aqaba summit is part of extensive Egyptian diplomacy to
revive Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, which collapsed in
mid-March after Israel broke ground for a housing project for Jews
in Arab East Jerusalem, the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
The Mubarak-Hussein meeting is expected to review the
development in the area, obstacles to the peace process and
promotion of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
It follows the two-day visit here early this week by
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat, who had
lamented that the Mideast is heading for "the abyss" if Israeli
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's policies were not blocked.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak had exchanged views on the phone Wednesday with the
Jordanian monarch on the peace process, the situation in East
Jerusalem and the ideas that emerged at meetings with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
In stepped-up Egyptian endeavors to kick-start the flagging
peace process, Mubarak will also meet with Netanyahu in the Red
Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh Tuesday to discuss "constructive"
ideas to revive the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
The summit was arranged after a flurry of telephone contacts in
the past three days. Mubarak's top advisor Osama el-Baz flew to
Israel Friday for a two-hour meeting with Netanyahu to pave the
way.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has recently proposed a six-month freeze on the
construction of settlements until negotiations open on the future
of Jerusalem, but Netanyahu insists his government will continue
settlement building.
</P>
<P>
In a rare gesture to solicit Egypt's mediating role, Netanyahu
urged Mubarak to continue his "positive political efforts" in a
message he entrusted with Egyptian Ambassador to Israel Mohamed
Bassyouni Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Egypt, the only two Arab countries that have signed
peace treaties with Israel, are deeply involved in the Mideast
peace process.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Court Issues Warrant of Arrest Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 24 (Xinhua) -- A subordinate court of Singapore
issued a warrant of arrest against defeated Workers' Party
candidate Tang Liang Hong Friday on what was reported to be
charges of 33 counts of tax evasion, according to the Straits
Times today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Tang was charged with 33 counts of evading
tax on income totaling 210,982 Singapore dollars (about 147,540 US
dollars) and the warrant of arrest was issued by District Judge
Mrs. Brenda Tan after the Workers' Party member, who is now in
Hong Kong, did not turn up to answer the charges.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS)
said that it was now up to the police to execute the warrant.
</P>
<P>
Tang Liang Hong, a lawyer himself, had issued a statement to
the Straits Times on Wednesday accusing the government of using
the IRAS to eliminate him from the political scene here.
</P>
<P>
In late January, after Tang fled Singapore soon after the
General Elections on January 2, the IRAS seized tax documents from
Tang's home and office in two early morning raids and the tax
authorities explained that the raids were conducted to prevent
relevant documents from being destroyed or tampered with.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued at Friday's hearing by the IRAS spokesman
said that since the middle of last year, the IRAS had been
monitoring Tang's tax affairs after receiving all his back years'
returns. The charges against him resulted from its investigations
into his affairs, and the amount of income evaded, totaling
210,982 Singapore dollars, was substantial, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also stressed that tax evasion was equivalent to
cheating and was a serious criminal offense.

Jordanian monarch on the peace process, the situation in East
Jerusalem and the ideas that emerged at meetings here early this
week with Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Arafat had lamented that the Mideast would be heading for the
"abyss," if Netanyahu's policies were not blocked.
</P>
<P>
In stepped-up Egyptian endeavors to kick-start the flagging
peace process, Mubarak will also meet with Netanyahu in the Red
Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh Tuesday to discuss "constructive"
ideas to revive the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has recently proposed a six-month freeze on the
construction of settlements until negotiations open on the future
of Jerusalem, but Netanyahu insists his government will continue
settlement building.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Egypt, the only two Arab countries that have signed
peace treaties with Israel, are deeply involved in the Mideast
peace process.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Likely to Win Iran's Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Moderate candidate Mohammad Khatami
has secured an overwhelming lead in Iran's presidential election
by winning 67.3 percent of the votes counted mid-day.
</P>
<P>
If this trend goes on, observers here said, the 54-year-old
former culture and Islamic guidance minister who is believed to be
relatively moderate and open-minded, is likely to defeat his chief
contender, hardline Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri to
become the fifth president of the Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
Of the total of more than 16 million votes counted from 20,501
polling stations in 202 cities till 12:30 p.m. Saturday, Khatami
has gained 11 million votes, or 67.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The latest official figures released by the election
headquarters of the Interior Ministry put Nateq-Nouri at second on
the list with nearly 4.5 million votes, or 27.06 percent, followed
by Reza Zavarei and Mohammad Mohammadi Reyshahri, both received
less than 3 percent of the ballots.
</P>
<P>
Results continue to pour in from provincial cities and towns on
the ballots cast Friday. The turnout rate in this election was the
highest over the past 18 years since the founding of the Islamic
Republic of Iran in 1979.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Dragonair Suspends A330-300 Flight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Dragon Airlines
Limited, or Dragonair, announced today that it has suspended
operations of its A330-300 fleet of four aircraft following
concerns with the reliability of its Rolls-Royce Trent 700
engines.
</P>
<P>
In a press release circulated here, the Dragonair said the
"precautionary measures" were taken "to avoid exposing its
passengers and staff to any level of risk however small."
</P>
<P>
The airbus company said that it has chosen to take the measures
of suspending A330-300 operation until the engine manufacture can
provide sufficient assurance that the reliability problems of the
engine are resolved.
</P>
<P>
The reliability concerns arise from an engine part in the
Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engine, the Dragonair explained.
</P>
<P>
The flight-suspension measures were taken after a series of
Trent 700 engine failures on Dragonair and Cathay Pacific A330
aircraft over the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Dragonair and Cathay are two of only three carriers
internationally who operate A330 airbus models that use Trent 700
engines.
</P>
<P>
The Dragonair A330 jet with 109 passengers and 16 crew members
aboard was forced to make an emergency landing on Friday after an
engine shutdown, the fifth such incident since last November.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman from the company has confirmed that the KA061 plane
flying to Malaysia was diverted to the Philippines on Friday noon
after the pilot closed down one of the two Rolls-Royce Trent
engines and landed at Subic Bay at about 13:30.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, about 200 passengers including Chief Executive of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Tung Chee-hwa were
stranded overnight after another Dragonair A330 suffered hydraulic
problems and was seven hours late leaving Hong Kong, it was
reported here.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Moderate candidate Seyed Mohammad
Khatami continues to lead Iran's presidential race on Friday by a
big margin as more votes counted, state-run radio said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Tehran Radio reported that out of 14 million valid votes
preliminarily counted as of 10:20 am today, Khatami has secured
more than 9.5 million votes, or 68.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The radio said that Khatami's chief rival, hardline candidate
Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri received some 3.7 million
votes, 26.74 percent of those counted.
</P>
<P>
The radio said the initial results came from 179 towns and
cities, mainly in rural areas, believed to be the base of support
of Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
The other two candidates could gain a small number of votes, the
radio said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said if the present situation continues, Khatami
is expected to secure enough votes to succeed President Hashemi
Rafsanjani who should step down after two terms in power.
</P>
<P>
It said that vote counting began last night shortly after the
end of the polling at 10:00 p.m. Friday, two hours later than
schedule because of a massive turnout.
</P>
<P>
A specialist said that the latest results are about half of the
total votes. Final results could come out later today,
informed sources here said.
</P>
<P>
The radio said a total of 129,041 votes are so far declared
invalid.

SEOUL, May 24 (Xinhiua) -- Choi Yong-soo of South Korea
defended his World Boxing Association (WBA) junior lightweight
title on Saturday with a unanimous decision over Japan's Koji
Matsumoto.
</P>
<P>
Matsumoto, the WBA's No. 9 contender, baffled Choi in the first
three rounds with his nimble footwork.
</P>
<P>
From the sixth round, 24-year-old Choi began punishing
Matsumoto with short hooks and powerful blows on the upper torso,
which reduced Matsumoto's speed.
</P>
<P>
Choi turned the 10th round into his best with a relentless
attack, making Matsumoto's face bleed.
</P>
<P>
It was Choi's fifth defense of the title he won from Argentine

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects U.S. Allegations on Chemical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran has rejected U.S. allegation
on transfer of Chinese chemical weapons to the Islamic Republic,
dismissing it as "thoroughly fabricated."
</P>
<P>
The statement was made by Iran's permanent representative to
the U.N. Kamal Kharazi and reported by Iran's official news
agency IRNA today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Kharazi as saying that "Washington has once
again resorted to baseless claims in an irresponsible manner in
connection with the peaceful activities of the Iranian chemical
industries."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told a Senate
Appropriation Subcommittee Thursday that the U.S. administration
"will cut off trade with two Chinese companies and individuals
for at least a year" on grounds of providing Iran with chemical
weapons technology.
</P>
<P>
Kharazi stressed that such statements, like similar cases in
the past, are aimed at depriving Iran of legal right to expand
its chemical industries for non-military purposes in accordance
with the articles of the chemical weapons treaty.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran is a signatory to the Treaty on
Non-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction and a victim of
these weapons during the Iraqi-Iranian war from 1980 to
1988.

COLOMBO, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Over 40 wild elephants were killed
in Sri Lanka last year, according to local newspaper reports

<HEADLINE> Local Elections Campaigning Ends in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Campaigning for local elections
on Monday across Central and East Nepal ended here with an
exchange of harsh words between leaders of two major political
parties, the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
Winding up his party's final campaign rally in the capital, a
top leader of the major ruling party, the Communist Party of Nepal
(United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML), expressed his confidence that
the party would secure a landslide victory in the imminent polls.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Nepali Congress (NC) party "now must learn
to function a responsible opposition party for another five
years," CPN-UML General Secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal said, hinting
that his party would win majority in the next parliamentary
election.
</P>
<P>
Results of the first phase of local elections held in West
Nepal last weekend showed the CPN-UML, the biggest partner in
Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand's three-party ruling
coalition, has won majority control of the local administration
bodies.
</P>
<P>
CPN-UML president Man Mohan Adhikari earlier has said his party
may consider a mid-term parliamentary election if it wins the
local elections.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML and the NC party currently holds 90 and 88 seats in
the powerful 205-seat lower house respectively, both short of the
magical number of 103 for forming a government.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, NC president Girija Prasad Koirala Friday at
another mass rally here accused the CPN-UML of winning the first
phase local elections by resorting to terror tactics, referring to
the widespread electoral violence during the polling day last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He told a crowd of party supporters that his party would "no
longer take things lying down" during the second phase polls on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Prime Minister Chand, who is from a rather
smaller National Democratic Party (RPP), said the government is
committed to holding free and fair elections and he claimed that
the first phase elections in West Nepal were held impartially.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a mass meeting in a city near Kathmandu
organized by his RPP party for the local elections.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Raises News Proposal To Renew Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu
has put forward a new proposal in a bid to renew peace talks with
the Palestinians, reported the state-run Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
He made the initiative during a meeting with Egyptian envoy
Osama Baz here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Baz, President Hosni Mubarak's political adviser, arrived in
Israel Friday to hold consultations with Prime Minister Netanyahu
in advance of a summit between Mubarak and Netanyahu Tuesday at
Egypt's Red Sea resort of Sharm e-Sheikh.
</P>
<P>
The summit was reportedly initiated by Egypt to revive the the
peace process deadlocked since Israel started the construction of
a new settlement at Har Homa in East Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has reportedly offered a compromise, under which
Israel will finish infrastructure for Har Homa, but the house
building will stop for several months.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Israel will start planning housing units for
the Palestinians in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Baz is now back to Cairo to report to Mubarak. He is due to
return to Israel for more talks with Israeli officials.
</P>
<P>
Before meeting Baz, Netanyahu conferred with U.S. Ambassador to
Israel Martin Indyk.
</P>
<P>
According to the radio, a senior Palestinian source said that
following Baz's visit, a visit to Israel by Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa scheduled for Monday has been
canceled. However, the Israeli Foreign Ministry has not received
any official notice of the cancellation.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat held talks with Mubarak
twice in Cairo earlier this week on the stalemated peace
talks. The Palestinians demand that Israel stop settlement
activities and freeze the construction of the Har Homa settlement
in particular before the peace talks possibly resume.

<HEADLINE> India Plans to Privatize Water, Sanitation Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government plans to
privatize water and sanitation sector in metropolitan and mega
cities as well as new townships, the Hindustan Times quoted highly
placed sources as saying here today.
</P>
<P>
The Urban Affairs and Employment Ministry is going to open the
doors to private sector for water supply augmenting schemes,
conveyance of raw water, its treatment, bulk supply to city water
supply authorities, maintenance of pumping stations, water
treatment plants and city distribution system.
</P>
<P>
A major motivating factor for favoring privatization was the
acute shortage of funds to meet the capital investment required to
provide water for all.
</P>
<P>
According to official estimates, about 513 billion rupees
(14.45 billion US dollars) is needed in this sector for the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
The investments by state governments, urban local bodies and
financial institutions during the ninth five-year plan (1997-2002)
are expected to be 40 billion rupees (1.126 billion dollars).
About 80 billion rupees (2.253 billion dollars) for this period
was expected from various internal and external agencies. This
still left a gaping shortfall of 393 billion rupees (11.07 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
A major incentive identified for attracting private capital was
to provide for tax holiday for select period as was done in cases
of enterprises engaged in developing, operating and maintaining
infrastructure facilities in the country.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indonesian Gov't Ready to Secure "Cooling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Life returns to normal today in
Indonesia as the 27 day nation-wide campaign ended at midnight
Friday and the country's three electoral contestants entered a
five-day cooling-down period to prepare for the May 29 general
election.
</P>
<P>
At Menteng area, Central Jakarta, no campaigning motorcades or
flags waving could be seen. Some peddlers are selling soft drinks
and candies.
</P>
<P>
The United Development Party (PPP), the ruling party Golkar and
the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) have put forward their
programs during the campaigns to vie for 425 seats at the 500-seat
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 75 seats are reserved for the armed forces who do
not vote in the election.
</P>
<P>
More than 124.74 million registered eligible voters are
expected to flock to the polls to cast their votes.
</P>
<P>
During the cooling-down week from May 24 to 28, the three
parties would not be allowed to carry out any form of campaign
activities.
</P>
<P>
In order to maintain security during the cooling-down period,
at least 20,000 security personnel were deployed in Jakarta and
its satellite towns of Bekasi, Bogor and Tangerang.
</P>
<P>
"The military is ready to overcome whatever condition. About
20,000 security officers which came from the army, navy, air force
and the police have been stationed in various places around
Jakarta," Jakarta military commander Setiyoso said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, chief of the Indonesian Armed Forces Feisal Tanjung
said the armed forces would take stern measures against those
violating rules during the cooling-down period.
</P>
<P>
"Don't hold activity, even the smallest one, that will disturb
the public order and stability during the cooling down period,"
coordinating minister for political and security affairs Soesilo
Soedarman said last night.
</P>
<P>
When evaluating the just concluded election campaign, Secretary
General of the Indonesian Election Institute Suryatna Subrata said
a total of 126 people were killed, mostly in campaign-related
traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
Jakarta police chief Hamami Nata said there were about 100
people who had been given medical treatment due to injuries after
being hit by stone throwing.
</P>
<P>
According to Minister/State Secretary Moerdiono the campaign
which were held in the form of rallies did not achieve their real
objectives.
</P>
<P>
President Soeharto also expressed the hope that the evaluation
of this year's election campaign should be done by the three
political parties and then the evaluation results should be
presented to the government for the sake of future campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia holds its general election every five years. The may
29 election is the sixth one since 1971 under the administration
of President Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Golkar, which has won each of the five elections in the past,
is optimistic about winning over 70.02 percent of the votes this
time.
</P>
<P>
The target of 70.02 percent it set for this year's election is
a two percentage increase from its victory at the 1992 elections
when it clinched 68 percent of the votes (or 282 seats). The PPP
and PDI won 17 percent (62 seats) and 15 percent (56 seats) of the
votes respectively.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that over 90 percent of the registered eligible
voters would take part in the forthcoming elections.

<P>
LIMA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Peru's main priority in regional
integration is to join the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA), formed by the United States, Canada and Mexico, Peruvian
First Vice President Ricardo Marquez said today.
</P>
<P>
NAFTA, the biggest trade bloc in the world, is a natural market
for Peruvian exports, Marquez said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Peru also laid priority in applying for
membership of the Southern Common Market (Mercosur), consisting of
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, the second biggest trade
bloc on the American continent.
</P>
<P>
Peru's recent withdrawal from the smaller Andean Community
trade zone will give the Peruvian government more time to cut high
industry costs and reduce the trade deficit, the vice
president said.
</P>
<P>
"Rapid integration will not help us until we become more
competitive," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that Peruvian businesses have made efforts to increase
their ability to compete in the international market. He also said
the government would step up activities to attract foreign
investment.

<P>
OPEC will hold its regular meeting on June 19 in Vienna. The
organization has established the production limit of 24.5 million
barrels a day for its 11 member countries since September 1993.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela's production quotas have been 2.359 million barrels
per day since 1993, though it was reported that Petroleos de
Venezuela, the state-owned oil company, and its subsidiaries,
produced 2.4 million barrels daily in April.
</P>
<P>
To extend the quotas is the best choice to prevent a discussion
about quotas and prices, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister added he is confident that OPEC will agree to the
Venezuelan proposal for regionalizing the world oil markets, which
would allow Venezuela to supply oil products to the American
continent.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, May 23 (Xinhua) -- European and Latin American
legislators have attacked the United States' anti-drug
certification policy for only penalizing producing countries.
</P>
<P>
The burden of fighting drugs should be shared, not unilaterally
imposed, said Jose Ignacio Salafranca, president of the European
Parliament for Latin America, at the end of the 13th Europe-Latin
America Interparliamentarian Union Conference here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers said the U.S. State Department's annual report which
certifies or decertifies countries based on their efforts in
fighting drugs makes no mention of the drug situation in the
U.S. itself.
</P>
<P>
The four-day forum urged parliaments to continue to work
together to fight drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentarians also discussed the process of
globalization and its repercussions on integration and
development. They said a balance needs to be found between the
globalization process and adequate regional policies.
</P>
<P>
They also called on the London and Paris Club groups of
creditors to look at new ways of helping to reduce the burden of
debt in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Problems of unemployment, debt, human rights and migration were
also discussed at the conference.

mining operations.
</P>
<P>
AHMSA is the biggest steel producer in Mexico, with 27 percent

percent of the country's total laminated steel exports.
</P>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES -- Argentina's Agriculture Ministry reduced its
estimates for the 1996-1997 harvest to 53.4 million tons because
of the month-long drought which has hit the country.
</P>
<P>
Even so, the harvest is still expected to be the best on record

came from trade with Mercosur partners, a 14.8 percent rise over
last year.
</P>
<P>
BRASILIA -- Trade between the Mercosur (Southern Common Market)
and the European Union (EU) grew by 60 percent between 1991 and
1995, up from 18.27 billion dollars to 27.84 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
EU exports to the four Mercosur countries increased more than
150 percent, while imports were up 4 percent during the same

<HEADLINE> Russia, Belarus Sign Charter of Union Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin and
his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko signed a
Russia-Belarus Union Charter here today, which is a vital part of
the Union Treaty signed on April 2.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents said at the signing ceremony that other
members of the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) are
welcomed to join the union.
</P>
<P>
Under the charter, the Russian-Belarusian union is aimed at
strengthening cooperation between Russia and Belarus in politics,
economy, society, military affairs, science and technology and
culture.
</P>
<P>
It said the living standards of the people in both countries
will be increased and favorable conditions be created for human
development and social progress.
</P>
<P>
The union will also establish its own legal system and provide
security for the two members.
</P>
<P>
The charter said that a common citizenship will be introduced
for the union and all citizens of Russia and Belarus are allowed
to apply for it.
</P>
<P>
However, the charter does not push the process of integration
of Russia and Belarus forward.
</P>
<P>
Though the supreme body of the union has decision-making powers
on such issues as social protection, formulation of unified
economic policies and coordination of military and foreign
policies, the presidents of both countries will have the right to
veto any decision contravening the constitutions of their
respective countries.

<HEADLINE> State Duma Urges Yeltsin to Sign Binding Accord With NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia's State Duma (lower house)
today called for the accord between Russia and NATO due to be
signed on May 27 to be legally binding.
</P>
<P>
Under the new Russia-NATO accord, the two sides will create a
joint council to give Moscow a say in matters directly affecting
its security.
</P>
<P>
Although the accord has not been published, it reportedly
offers binding guarantees that NATO will not build up its forces
on the territory of its new members nor base nuclear weapons
there.
</P>
<P>
Duma lawmakers said they regarded these guarantees as binding
and any attempt to alter these articles or to include Russia's
neighbors in NATO would be seen as contravening the accord.
</P>
<P>
The Duma urged President Boris Yeltsin to make further efforts to
conclude a legally binding agreement with NATO.
</P>
<P>
Both Russia and NATO have said the agreement is a "document"
not a treaty, and so does not require parliamentary approval.
</P>
<P>
The Duma also voted unanimously in favor of a statement
denouncing NATO's expansion as a "strategic mistake" which could
sow the seeds of distrust and tension in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Exemplary Bank-Finance Firm Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Executives of Thai Danu Bank
confirmed today that they had decided to shelve plans to merge
with Finance One, the country's largest finance company.
</P>
<P>
"All efforts to effect a merger have been abandoned," said
Pakorn Thavisin, the bank's chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
The merger had been touted by Thai financial authorities as the
model for badly needed consolidation in the country's finance
industry.
</P>
<P>
Finance One, rising fast in the last decade, is now badly
debt-ridden, and Thai financial authorities hoped to rescue it
through a proposed merger with a commercial bank.
</P>
<P>
The merger failure could set the stage for a possible Bank of
Thailand bailout, promising a rocky week ahead on the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
The bank cited various legal and technical obstacles to a
merger, but made no reference in its official statements to
concerns about the extent of bad debts at Finance One.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Amnuay Viravan said on Friday that if the
merger failed, Finance One would have to issue new shares to fund
increased reserves against bad debts.
</P>
<P>
If no one wants to buy the new shares, the Bank of Thailand
will have to step in, through its financial institutions
development fund.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand on Friday ordered Finance One to nearly
triple its registered capital to 12.42 billion baht (477.7 million
US dollars) within 30 days to prevent it from collapsing.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment Keeps Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- At least 6,000 foreign-funded
projects were approved in the first four months this year, today's
China Daily quoted a recent enterpreneurs' seminar as saying.
</P>
<P>
"During the first four months, both contracted and actually
received foreign capital totaled over 11 billion US dollars in
China," said an official at the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation (Moftec).
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment has been growing substantially in the past
three years, the official said.
</P>
<P>
China has, since 1993, ranked the world's second largest
investment target following the United States for four consecutive
years, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, more than 280,000 foreign-funded
enterprises, totaling 178 billion US dollars of foreign capital,
had been approved in China.
</P>
<P>
Ma Xiuhong, director-general of Moftec's foreign investment
administration, said that last month though actual capital inflow
continued to rise in the first three months of the year, the
growth tempo has slowed down.
</P>
<P>
She attributed the slow progress to last year's comparatively
large investment volume.
</P>
<P>
Fearful of soaring costs due to China's lifting of its
tax-exemption policy on imported capital goods for foreign-funded
enterprises, investors swarmed to register joint ventures in China
prior to the deadline -- April 1, 1996.
</P>
<P>
This fever resulted in surprisingly high foreign investment
throughout the country in the first four months of 1996.
</P>
<P>
China plans to attract 30 billion US dollars direct foreign
investments in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Sicilian Mafia Ranks 5th in European League Table </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Sicilian mafia, which has given its
name to criminal organizations worldwide, ranked only the fifth in
the turnover league table for mafia organizations in Europe, the
news magazine Il Mondo said today.
</P>
<P>
The magazine said that the biggest criminal gang in Europe was
the Russian Organizatsya, whose 5,700 clans were reckoned to
enjoy combined takings of some 200 billion U.S. dollars. The
second biggest one was Turkish mafia, which controls 80 percent of
the heroin trade in Europe and owns a turnover of 43 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The combined turnover of all Europe's mafia organizations was
about 351 billion dollars, 4.2 percent of the gross domestic
product of European countries.
</P>
<P>
The Sicilian mafia, or Cosa Nostra, with revenues of some 19
billion dollars, was outranked by Italian rivals, such as the
Neapolitan Camorra.
</P>
<P>
Drugs are the main earner for criminal organizations, but
prostitution is growing fast, with 600,000 sex workers earning
about 70 billion dollars for the mobs.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Willing to Establish Relations With U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Cuban Foreign Relations Minister
Roberto Robaina said today his country is interested in
establishing relations with the United States at any time, but
with no strings attached.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to maintain relations with the United States on
a basis of respect for the principles of independence, sovereignty,
and no intervention," said Robaina in an interview broadcast on
Cuban radio.
</P>
<P>
If the U.S. accepts those rules of the game, Cuba will not
raise any obstacle to solving the protracted conflict between the
two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. imposed a damaging economic, financial, and commercial
embargo against the island country after the Cuban revolution in
1959. Sanctions were stepped up last year when the U.S. passed the
so-called Helms-Burton law after two U.S. civilian planes were shot
down by Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Robaina condemned the law which punishes foreign companies
doing business with Cuba. The law has also been criticized by many
of the U.S.' major trading partners.

<HEADLINE> Uruguayan Parliament Asks Spain to Include Cuba in Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The General Assembly of Uruguay
today exhorted its Spanish counterpart to change its decision and
invite Cuba to participate as a full member in the Summit of
Presidents of the Iberoamerican Parliaments to be held in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
Hugo Batalla, president of the Uruguayan senate, and Carlos
Baraibar, president of the Chamber of Deputies, made the
exhortation in a letter to the presidents of the Courts of Spain.
</P>
<P>
The men requested in the letter to rectify the Spanish
parliament's recent decision of inviting Cuban National Assembly
of People's Power to participate in the summit only as an observer.
</P>
<P>
They said the Spanish decision has changed substantially the
previous criteria that Cuba is a full member for these events.
</P>
<P>
A few days ago, the Spanish parliament decided to invite Cuba
to the summit as "an observer" because it is not a democratic
country, a statement that caused "indignation" of the Latin
American Parliament (Parlatino).
</P>
<P>
Parlatino President Juan Adolfo Singer said in a letter dated
May 21 that "when international meetings are organized, the host
state cannot take upon itself the right to qualify or discriminate
those who should participate with their full rights in those
meetings."

<HEADLINE> Defectors Declare Holy War Against Afghan Northern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Defectors of Afghan northern
warlord Rashid Dostum yesterday declared a holy war against him,
vowing solidarity with the Islamic militia Taliban, according to
reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
"We are announcing a jihad (holy war) against Dostum. We are
with the Taliban now," the reports quoted rebel commander Mohammed
Pahlawan, brother of General Abdul Malik, as saying.
</P>
<P>
General Abdul, led the mutiny against Dostum Monday in Faryab,
400 kilometers northwest of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Dostum is now locked in fierce battles with Taliban forces and
the mutineers across six of his eight northern provinces, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban forces were stalled at the strategic Shibar Pass
that leads through the Hindu Kush mountain range to
Mazar-e-Sharif, Dostum's stronghold, 300 kilometers north of
Kabul.
</P>
<P>
But the pass was under siege Friday, with Taliban forces firing
long range rockets towards opposition positions atop the rugged
mountain peaks, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban also bolstered its forces about 130 kilometers (80
miles) north of the capital along the Salang Highway which leads
to the Shibar Pass and other passes through the Hindu Kush.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Taliban alliance, led by Dostum and ousted military
chief Ahmed Shah Massood, appeared to be stalling further
advancement towards their northern strongholds.
</P>
<P>
But this week's rebellion against Dostum represented the most
serious threat yet to his control of the northern one-third of
Afghanistan.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Afghan northern warlord Rashid
Dostum has admitted for the first time the loss of two key
provinces to the Islamic militia Taliban and its allies while
claiming elsewhere his domain is secure, according to reports
reaching here this evening.
</P>
<P>
The embattled Dostum lost northwestern Badghis province to the
Taliban, the reports quoted Dostum's spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman did not say when Badghis was lost.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that Dostum's side conceded its loss to
the Islamic student militia, which now control more than
two-thirds of the Afghan territory.
</P>
<P>
Faryab province next door to Badghis fell to the hands of the
right-hand man of Dostum, Abdul Malik, who staged a rebellion
against the northern warlord early this week, dealing Dostum a
surprising blow.
</P>
<P>
Dostum is locked in fierce battles with Taliban forces and the
mutineers across six of his eight northern provinces. A Taliban
victory over Dostum would complete a three-year campaign to
control all of Afghanistan.

BUENOS AIRES, May 23 (Xinhua) -- World champion Tommi Makinen
of Finland took one step closer to his third win of the season on
Friday when he finished the second leg of the Argentina rally with
a 61-second lead over title rival Colin McRae.
</P>
<P>
The Mitsubish driver started the day with an eight-second
advantage over his Subaru opponent but his lead was cut to five
seconds at the end of the 12th stage.
</P>
<P>
However, an unbeatable time on the next stage gave him a
lead of 22 seconds.
</P>
<P>
From then on, Makinen slowly edged out an advantage on the
twisty mountain roads that suited his car perfectly, with the
fastest time on four out of the remaining five stages of the
second day.
</P>
<P>
McRae was content to maintain his second spot, especially after
suffering differential problems on stage 14 and a power steering
failure on stage 16.
</P>
<P>
Spaniard Carlos Sainz, the only other main championship
contender, was still in third place in his Ford, but one minute 57
seconds adrift of Makinen at the end of the second leg.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Processing trade has become a
major part of the economic development of Dongguan, a city in
south China's Guangdong province, which had 11,583 businesses in
the processing trade by the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Its exports were worth 7.6 billion US dollars, or 95 percent of
the city's total exports, and their output value accounted for 85
percent of Dongguan's total industrial output value in 1996. The
export value of the electronics industry accounted for 25 percent
of the total exports.
</P>
<P>
Investors in the processing trade come from over twenty
countries and regions, and more than 150 companies have invested
in processing trade in Dongguan.
</P>
<P>
The city has improved supervisory procedures and management to

</P>
<P>
The value of the exports of foreign-funded enterprises exceeded

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the Basic
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) (101-102)
in a question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: How was the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR
selected?
</P>
<P>
Answer: The Basic Law stipulates that the Chief Executive of
the Hong Kong SAR be selected by election or through consultations
held locally and be appointed by the central government.
</P>
<P>
The method for selecting the Chief Executive will be specified
in the light of realities in the Hong Kong SAR and in accordance
with the principle of gradual and orderly progress.
</P>
<P>
The ultimate aim is selection of the Chief Executive by
universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative
nominating committee in accordance with democratic procedures.
</P>
<P>
According to Annex 1 -- Method for the Selection of the Chief
Executive of the Hong Kong SAR -- of
the Basic Law, the method for the selection of the Chief Executive
will be different with the passage of time after Hong Kong returns
to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The first Chief Executive has been selected in accordance with
"Decision of the National People's Congress on the Method for the
Formation of the First Government and the First Legislative
Council of the Hong Kong SAR."
</P>
<P>
That is to say, a candidate for the first Chief Executive
should be recommended by the Selection Committee for the First
Government of the Hong Kong SAR through local consultations or
through nomination and election after consultations, and the
recommended candidate would be reported to the central government
for appointment.
</P>
<P>
This Selection Committee, established by the Preparatory
Committee for the Hong Kong SAR, is composed of 400 members,
including Hong Kong deputies to the National People's Congress,
representatives of Hong Kong members of the National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, persons
with practical experience who have served in Hong Kong's
executive, legislative and advisory organs prior to the
establishment of the Hong Kong SAR, and persons representative of
various strata and sectors of society.
</P>
<P>
The second Chief Executive will be elected by a broadly
representative Election Committee in accordance with the Basic Law
and appointed by the central government.
</P>
<P>
The committee will be composed of 800 members from the
following sectors: industrial, commercial and financial sectors;
the professions, labor, social services, religious and other
sectors, members of the Legislative Council, representatives of
district-based organizations, Hong Kong deputies to the National
People's Congress, and representatives of Hong Kong members of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference.

<BODY>
<HEADLINE> Part 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the selection of the third Chief Executive and his or her
successors, Annex 1 to the Basic Law has this stipulation: "If
there is a need to amend the method for selecting Chief Executives
for terms subsequent to the year 2007, such amendments must be
made with the endorsement of a two-thirds majority of all the
members of the Legislative Council and the consent of the Chief
Executive, and they shall be reported to the Standing Committee of
the National People's Congress for approval."
</P>
<P>
Question: What does "through train" mean?
</P>
<P>
Answer: "Through train" originally refers to a direct passenger
train running between Kowloon and Guangzhou, a common means of
transportation for Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
Passengers in this train, after going through check-in and exit
formalities at the departure station, can ride directly to
Guangzhou without having to alight from the train at the border to
entry procedures.
</P>
<P>
The first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR ought to be
formed after China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong
Kong in 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese government, out of concern for a smooth
transition of government in Hong Kong and accepting relevant
suggestions from the British side, agreed that members of the last
Legislative Council created by the British Hong Kong government in
1995 may become members of the first Legislative Council of the
Hong Kong SAR after going through specified legal procedures if
composition of this last Hong Kong Legislative Council is in
conformity with relevant decisions of the National People's
Congress and relevant provisions of the Basic Law and if its
members meet certain qualifications.
</P>
<P>
In the light of this, the Chinese foreign minister and the
British foreign secretary reached agreements and understandings on
this question at the beginning of 1990 through the exchange of
seven diplomatic letters.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that members of the last Legislative Council of the
British Hong Kong government, after some simple formalities, may
become members of the first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong
SAR.
</P>
<P>
The third session of the Seventh National People's Congress
made a specific provision in this regard in its "Decision of the
National People's Congress on the Method for the Formation of the
First Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR."
</P>
<P>
This arrangement, which is conducive to a smooth transition in
Hong Kong, resembles the "Kowloon-Guangzhou through train," hence
its popular use in Hong Kong referring to the political
arrangement.

<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 middle school boys
have applied for entrance to a professional school of preschool
training in Guangzhou City.
</P>
<P>
The school plans to enroll 248 students this year, but 1,214
people, including 218 boys have registered for the entrance
examination, according to the Shanghai-based Xinming Evening News.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect so many applicants, especially male applicants
this year," said Wu Baiheng, headmaster of the school.
</P>
<P>
In China, most workers in kindergartens are women, which is not
necessarily good for the psychological development of the children.
</P>
<P>
The preschool education workers face more challenges in modern
society, and some of the teaching facilities in kindergartens are
more suitable for men to operate.
</P>
<P>
"I am very fond of children," said Chen Xin, a male student at
the No.4 Middle School of the city, who has applied to the school,
"I don't care what other people would say. I consider preschool
education to be my ideal career.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that quite a number of his classmates have followed
his example and applied to the school.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar ended mostly
steady Friday but gained on the French franc and rose sharply
against Australia's dollar from a surprise cut in Australian
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
In New York, the dollar closed at 115.66 yen, down a bit from
115.96 yen Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The dollar cost 1.6935 marks, up marginally from 1.6934 marks
Thursday and 1.6925 marks a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
The pound cost 1.6345 U.S. dollars, up from 1.6234 U.S.
dollars, partly recovering its sharp drop Thursday on evidence of
economic weakness in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The dollar settled at 5.7040 French francs, slightly higher
than 5.7015 Thursday, in advance of France's weekend elections.
But the Swiss franc's strength against the French franc indirectly
contributed to the dollar's weakness against the Swiss franc. It
settled in New York at 1.4032 Swiss francs, down from 1.4118
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar cost 76.7 cents, down from 78.15 cents
Thursday and the lowest level in three months.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Boeing on Wednesday urged
inspections of center fuel tanks on all 747 jumbo jets in service,
according to a report by the USA Today.
</P>
<P>
There are about 1,000 747s in use around the world, it said.
</P>
<P>
The call was made as part of the investigation into the
explosion of TWA Flight 800, a 747 that ripped apart after an
explosion in the center fuel tank, although the real cause of the
crash was still unsettled.
</P>
<P>
The proposals regarding some changes in the fuel tanks have
also raised the question as what is the explosive levels of fumes
in fuel tanks. About 40 percent of the U.S. fleet has fuel tanks
that could ultimately be affected by such changes.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration is awaiting an industry
study of the issue before deciding what to do next.
</P>
<P>
But after the initial inspections of ten 747s, no problems were
found with their center fuel tanks, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board, investigating the
crash, applauded the voluntary inspections, which will begin in
June and have no deadline, it said.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Approves Financing for Brazil's Agricultural </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 23 (Xinhua) --The World Bank today announced
the approval of a 60 million U.S. dollar loan to the Government of
Brazil to help finance the Agricultural Technology Development
Project.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural sector has been a key source of economic
growth in Brazil, with an average annual growth rate of 4 percent
from 1950 to 1986. Between 1992 and 1995, the agricultural sector
was the fastest growing sector in the economy, accounting for 10
percent of the GDP, 30 percent when agriculturally related
industries are taken into account, 30 percent of the value of
exports and 25 percent of employment.
</P>
<P>
The Northeast region, which will be one of the beneficiaries of
the project, holds the largest concentration of rural poor
population in the country and generally throughout Latin America.
One of the priorities for research and development will be the
generation and transfer of technology for poor, smallholder
farmers, particularly in the Northeast. Other priorities areas
will be the improvement of natural resource management, advanced
technologies and agribusiness development.
</P>
<P>
The total project costs are estimated at 120 million dollars.
In addition to the World Bank's loan, the remaining cost will be
financed by the Government of Brazil with a 30.5 million dollar
contribution and the beneficiaries and other participants will
contribute a total of 29.5 million dollars.

and Sexually Transmitted Diseases Control Project in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
The project is designed to finance health promotion and disease
prevention activities in Buenos Aires and in the provinces of
Cordoba and Santa Fe, where 85 percent of AIDS related cases in
the country are concentrated.
</P>
<P>
It will also increase existing diagnostic treatment and
counseling services in targeted areas and support HIV and STD
related research and development.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992 and 1993, when 1,000 AIDS/HIV cases were reported in
the country each year, the AIDS/HIV epidemic has increased
significantly. In the first semester of 1996 alone, 10,793 cases
were reported.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the number of reported cases in the hemisphere,
Argentina ranks fifth following the United States, Brazil, Mexico
and Canada. However, in terms of the number of cases per
population, Argentina ranks third. The country also has one of the
highest percentage of AIDS cases resulting from HIV transmission
associated with intravenous drug users.
</P>
<P>
The total project cost is some 30 million dollars.

NEW YORK, May 23 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks rallied today,
pushing several indexes to record highs, as investors took the
chance to boost the share prices while Federal Reserve takes a
wait-and-see attitude about rate raising.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 87.78 points to
7,345.91, up 151.24 for the week and beating last Thursday's
record close at 7,333.55.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 and the New York Stock Exchange
composite index also jumped to new highs, but most notable was the
Nasdaq market's return to record territory in four months.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly a 3-to-1
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, with volume totaling 416.26
million shares as against 426.95 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 11.37 to 847.03, and

</P>
<P>
The American Stock Exchange composite index rose 4.21 to
597.94.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of any fresh economic news to aggravate the
market's lingering inflation jitters, interest rates held steady
in the bond market after creeping toward worrisome levels during
the prior two sessions.
</P>
<P>
Bonds had been struggling since Tuesday, when Federal Reserve
officials left short-term interest rates unchanged.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said on Thursday that the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea had made some positive reaction to U.S.-South
Korean proposed peace talks and other U.S.-DPRK talks.
</P>
<P>
"I do think that in the last months there has been some
positive reaction to them, that in the talks that took place in
New York, there had been agreement in principle to have these
talks," Albright told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Last Month, DPRK officials met with U.S. and South Korean
officials in New York with the latters giving them a briefing on
U.S.-South Korean proposal of holding four-party peace talks and
then they held several meetings with other U.S. officials on
issues like missiles, MIAs etc.
</P>
<P>
All these talks ended without apparent results, and Albright
said there had been "a delay in finding the time" to stage the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
But she said: "I would say that we're very much on the right
track and that it's a matter of seeing what the conditions are
to make sure that those talks do in fact take place."

<HEADLINE> World Bank Approves Financing for Brazil's Agricultural  Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 23 (Xinhua) --The World Bank today announced
the approval of a 60 million U.S. dollar loan to the government of
Brazil to help finance its agricultural technology development
project.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural sector has been a key source of economic
growth in Brazil, with an average annual growth rate of 4 percent
from 1950 to 1986. Between 1992 and 1995, the agricultural sector
was the fastest growing sector in the economy, accounting for 10
percent of the GDP, 30 percent when agriculturally related
industries are taken into account, 30 percent of the value of
exports and 25 percent of employment.
</P>
<P>
The Northeast region, which will be one of the beneficiaries of
the project, holds the largest concentration of rural poor
population in the country and generally throughout Latin America.
One of the priorities for research and development will be the
generation and transfer of technology for poor, smallholder
farmers, particularly in the Northeast. Other priorities areas
will be the improvement of natural resource management, advanced
technologies and agribusiness development.
</P>
<P>
The total project costs are estimated at 120 million dollars.
In addition to the World Bank's loan, the remaining cost will be
financed by the government of Brazil with a 30.5 million dollar
contribution and the beneficiaries and other participants will
contribute a total of 29.5 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: EU Leaders Agree to Forge New Treaty in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NOORDWIJK, The Netherlands, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the
15 member nations of the European Union(EU) have agreed to forge a
new treaty for the Union in the upcoming Amsterdam summit, Dutch
Prime Minister Wim Kok said on Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the half-day informal summit
meeting of the 15 leaders in the Dutch seaside resort of
Noordwijk, Mr Kok, whose country holds EU's rotating presidency,
said that he was very optimistic that Friday's talks would help
smooth the way to a successful agreement on a new EU Treaty at
Amsterdam summit on June 16-17.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the leaders have made progress in defining
the future role and size of the European Commission, the EU's
executive body.
</P>
<P>
They have agreed to give the President more influence and more
say in the composition of the Commission.
</P>
<P>
"There is a fairly consensus on this issue and it is only have
to be confirmed in Amsterdam," Mr Kok told the press.
</P>
<P>
Although all the leaders stressed that the New Treaty would
come in Amsterdam, there are still a number of important issues
that remain to be solved, namely reweighting of votes in the
Council of Ministers, stepping up the European Parliament's
powers, France-Germany backed plan for the merger of EU and
Western European Union, the European defense club, and the
extension of qualified majority voting in the EU's decision-making
procedure.
</P>
<P>
Mr Kok said that, since it was an informal meeting, it was not
surprising that no concrete decision had been taken.
</P>
<P>
But after the exchange of views between the leaders on the
above-mentioned questions, it is expected that the negotiators in
the treaty review talks will get more room to strike a deal on
some of those issues.
</P>
<P>
Friday's summit meeting has provided Mr Blair the first
opportunity to meet his European partners since his Labour party
took office after winning the May 1 general election.
</P>
<P>
Blair's victory over the Euro-sceptic Conservative party was
considered crucial to the inter-governmental conference(IGC)
treaty negotiation, which have been stymied in part by British
objections to further EU integration.
</P>
<P>
"People know very well Britain of course wants to be a
constructive player in Europe," Blair told reporters as he arrived
at the summit.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, he underlined once again that Britain, together
with France and Germany, should play a leading role in Europe.
</P>
<P>
He called for a "radical shift" in the EU to refocus on
concerns of real interest to its citizens like jobs and
environment.
</P>
<P>
Blair's Labour Government has already promised its membership
for the Social Protocol, which sets down standards for worker
protection across the group, and agreed with the plan to
incorporate it into the new EU treaty.
</P>
<P>
But he emphasized during his meeting with European Commission
President Jacques Santer on Friday morning that it should not lead
to a series of measures which could undermine the competitiveness
of British companies.
</P>
<P>
Blair also warned that there was "no question" of Britain
passing control over its borders, including immigration and asylum
policy, to Europe as continental European states are pressing for
in the rewrite of the EU's treaties now being discussed.

<HEADLINE> EU Takes WTO Action over Indonesian Car Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) today
requested the establishment of a World Trade Organization (WTO)
dispute panel to rule on the compliance with WTO rules of
Indonesia's National Car program and other measures concerning
trade in automotive products.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have held two rounds of formal WTO consultations
in November and December of 1996, said a press release issued here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
This follows a request for formal WTO consultations with Brazil
concerning certain aspects of the Brazilian incentives to
investment in the automotive sector.
</P>
<P>
The EU maintains that both two countries are prime examples of
government-mandated trade distortions, including incentives to
investment coupled with high protection of their domestic markets
and discriminatory trade practices allowing companies investing
locally to import their products under preferential conditions.
</P>
<P>
The EU made the decision after an intense but so far
unproductive dialogue with the governments of the two countries
concerned. The decision was aimed at bringing their measures into
step with the WTO.
</P>
<P>
The EU said that these steps signalled the Union's commitment
to consolidate the market opening successes achieved during the
Uruguay Round.
