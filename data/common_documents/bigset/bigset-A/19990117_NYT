 Trump purchase of casino a safe bet with local economy  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ If you're looking for encouraging news about
the area economy, look no further than Donald Trump's willingness
to buy Kansas City's Flamingo Hilton Casino.
</P>
<P>
   Trump Hotels &AMP; Casino Resorts Inc. is apparently not only
willing to pay $15 million for the casino, but also is ready to
assume Hilton's obligations to city government, which amount to an
additional $30 million. This isn't quite half what Hilton spent to
develop the property, but given the local situation, it still seems
a strong vote of confidence in Kansas City's future.
</P>
<P>
   There are skeptics, of course, who see the deal as a steal
because casino ownership is like having a license to print money.
Tell that to Sam's Town, though, which packed it in after its
printing presses malfunctioned.
</P>
<P>
   Given the competition and the Flamingo's market position, this
is far from being a no-brainer. When casino developers began
pouring their investment millions into Kansas City, those
uncomfortable with the growing gambling presence were quick with
doomsday prophesies.
</P>
<P>
   The casino market is being overbuilt, they warned, implying some
sort of dire consequences. In fact, the investment money
represented a shot in the arm for Kansas City's construction
industry, regardless of how many casinos survived.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Sam's Town has been the only casualty, and
observers attributed its demise more to location than competition.
This theory seems validated by the decision of a major gaming
company to take Hilton's problem off its hands and take a flier on
a troubled operation.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Trump's interest in Kansas City significant is the
nature of the Flamingo's market, which is generally perceived as a
blue-collar, mostly working-class clientele. When the Trump people
run the pertinent numbers as they ponder deals, the strength of the
local economy gets considerable scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the key number was probably the area's
unemployment rate, which is well below the national rate. Trump's
financial strategists likely interpret this to mean the local
economy is strong enough to support a full-employment environment
for the foreseeable future. This, in turn, means there's no reason
those expected to patronize the Flamingo won't have lots of money
to spend on entertainment and recreation for long enough to make
this casino a sound investment.
</P>
<P>
   In a broader sense, the fact that industry experts believe the
area can support four major gambling operations is also a vote of
confidence in the Kansas City economy. This probably isn't what
gambling's opponents like to hear, but it seems to be the current
economic reality.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City has so far proved a reasonably strong market for
casino operators despite intense competition. This is more a
function of a strong economy than any lack of morality on the part
of those contributing to the casinos' profitability.
</P>
<P>
   The casinos do well by offering a good deal more than gambling.
It's apparent that aggressive, innovative operators are attracting
customers for their food and nongaming entertainment, as well as
for chances to flirt with Lady Luck.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that the injection of gaming into Kansas
City's economy is proving a positive experience.

SPIRITUALITY ASIDE, POPE'S VISIT PROMISES BIG PAYOFF IN MATERIAL
WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ From ``pope-on-a-rope'' soap to ``papal doughnuts,''
a visit by Pope John Paul II has become a way to enrich the
pocketbook as well as the soul.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's visit to St. Louis on Jan. 26-27 should be no
exception.
</P>
<P>
   More than any concert or convention, the visit will be a
bonanza. Planners expect at least 50,000 visitors and an economic
impact of $25 million. That doesn't include the underground economy
of souvenir vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, Amy Benson of St. Louis hears from someone hoping to
cash in.
</P>
<P>
   They call her family's Catholic Supply stores, hoping to add
their unlicensed items to the sizable papal displays. It might be a
Colorado outfit offering snow globes. Or maybe an artist designing
ornaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a temptation to get everything you can and put it out
there,'' Benson said, adjusting a display of papal medallions.
``But if they have something that's not very tasteful, we stay away
from it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Archdiocese of St. Louis has followed the model of the
Vatican itself, competing with unlicensed vendors rather than
trying to control them.
</P>
<P>
   The archdiocese has licensed 40 vendors to sell items, including
T-shirts, posters, keychains, cameras and teddy bears. About 60
vendors made their pitches to the archdiocese, which gave special
consideration to local firms and those owned by women and
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The archdiocese did not charge for licenses, but will keep 2
percent of merchandise sales. The money will help pay for papal
events or go to local charities.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the archdiocese won't get much money, it hopes to
give consumers a tasteful alternative for souvenirs. Kansas City
consumers can buy the goods at www.archstl.org and from official
vendors at the events.
</P>
<P>
   Monsignor Ted Wojcicki, a member of the planning committee, said
the only inappropriate proposal was for ``papal wine.'' The
archdiocese didn't want to sanction a product that seemed to
trivialize an important part of Catholic ritual.
</P>
<P>
   But Wojcicki knows that the unofficial kitsch will surface on
Jan. 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to sell what they want to sell. It's a free
country, and entrepreneurship is as American as apple pie,'' he
said. ``We just hope people respect the Holy Father by the items
they put out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, if restraint were only that easy.
</P>
<P>
   When the pope visited Baltimore in 1995, critics killed a
Pennsylvania baker's plans for a ``papal doughnut'' baked in the
likeness of the pope. Maryland vendors hawked the ``Miracle Mug,''
a coffee cup that caused the pontiff's image to appear when filled
with boiling water.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the ``pope-on-a-rope,'' a bar of soap with the
pope's likeness that could hang from a shower head.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Vatican has tried to get its share of the
profits, blending the commercial and the spiritual. The Vatican
sold more than 1 million CDs of the pope saying the rosary in
several languages. The pontiff's prolific writings are best
sellers, too.
</P>
<P>
   Not that brisk sales are guaranteed. Organizers of World Youth
Day in Denver and their merchandise supplier battled in court after
sales fell far short of expectations. Other vendors in cities such
as New York and Los Angeles have been disappointed when crowds
didn't materialize.
</P>
<P>
   As a tiny self-supporting city-state, the Vatican needs the
money it collects from sales at its museums and over the Internet.
Customers can buy replicas of paintings and statues that are among
the Vatican's treasures. The Vatican also has entered into a
partnership with department stores like Macy's and Marshall Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think good taste should prevail, even for them (the
Vatican). If they put it out and they're not offended, I guess it's
all right,'' said Owais Succari, director of the Institute for
Business and Professional Ethics at DePaul University, a Catholic
institution in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all part of the culture. A lot of things have been
commercialized,'' Succari added. ``But I think we really should
have a certain respect for historical figures, and that includes
the pope.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, the pope has condemned rampant materialism and
consumerism, especially in the industrialized world. But in an
address to the United Nations, John Paul also conceded that ``man
lives at the same time both in the world of material values and in
that of spiritual values.''
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders don't think it's wrong to sell items with the
pope's image. Just do it with respect, they say. An official
mission statement insists that the items can promote faith and
encourage love and respect for the pope.
</P>
<P>
   Vatican officials have said that selling items can help bring
the pope's message to believers all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Wojcicki is trying to ignore all that _ the dollars, the vendors
and the shoppers. He said his worries are more relevant to the
pope's visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can spend the whole day thinking about the economic side
of this,'' he said. ``We'd rather try to stay on top of the
spiritual aspects.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the unofficial products created for past papal
visits:
</P>
<P>
   - In Baltimore, T-shirts were sold with the pope _ armed with a
can of seasoning and crab mallets _ blessing a flock of crabs whose
claws are raised to the heavens. The caption: ``Go forth and
multiply!''
</P>
<P>
   - A Maryland microbrewery created a batch of commemorative beer
called ``Ale Mary.'' A St. Louis brewpub, the Tap Room, is
following suit with its Holy Smoke Papal Porter beer.
</P>
<P>
   - A San Antonio outfit, called Papalphernalia, created cardboard
miter masks with eye cutouts. They were called the ``Holey See.''
</P>
<P>
   - A Detroit company created lawn sprinklers that spurted out
from the outstretched hands of the pontiff. Their slogan was ``Let
Us Spray.''
</P>
<P>
   - Phoenix unveiled faux-concert T-shirts featuring the pope
playing a guitar. They featured a stadium date of the ``Raising
Hell Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   - A Chicago company sold Pope Scopes, periscopes similar to the
ones often used by the gallery at golf tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   - A Mexican potato-chip maker, a sponsor of the pope's visit
this month, has created ``papitas del papa'' _ or pope chips. They
feature images of the pope and the Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   - Carmel, Calif., saw posters depicting the pope and then-mayor
Clint Eastwood. The caption read: ``Thou Hast Made My Day.''

COLLEGES HOPE TO SHOW STUDENTS THAT PEERS DRINK RESPONSIBLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE CARROLL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: In the 1100s, the provost at the University of Paris
rode across campus on horseback with a band of archers, threatening
to shoot anyone found drunk and disorderly.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 900 years later, colleges and universities are still
trying to figure out how to deal with students who abuse alcohol.
The University of Kansas said recently it was launching a
communitywide effort, an approach the University of Missouri and
other schools also are taking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest struggle we face is just getting people to realize
there is something that can be done about this,'' said William
DeJong, director of the Higher Education Center for Alcohol and
Other Drug Prevention for the U.S. Department of Education. ``We
can make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to change, most agree, is creating a culture on campus
that encourages responsible drinking and makes students aware that
most of their peers do, in fact, drink responsibly.
</P>
<P>
   Since Northern Illinois University in DeKalb began an
advertising campaign along that line, it has greatly reduced its
binge drinking rate. Binge drinking generally is defined as downing
five or more drinks in one sitting.
</P>
<P>
   Universities are encouraging bars to eliminate specials such as
penny pitchers and are keeping gymnasiums open late on weekend
nights to give students an alcohol-free place to gather. Many also
are tightening their alcohol policies and encouraging their
community leaders to crack down on underage and illegal drinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to do all of these things,'' said Henry
Weschler, director of College Alcohol Studies at the Harvard School
of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no single approach that is going to solve it.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent string of deaths has prompted universities to take
another look at problem drinking.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997, fraternity pledges died from alcohol
poisoning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and at
Louisiana State University.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, a KU freshman from Overland Park, Kan., died after
she was struck by a vehicle driven by an intoxicated, underage
student. Last fall, a student at the University of Michigan-Ann
Arbor died after she fell out a window after drinking at a party.
</P>
<P>
   In Lawrence, Kan., a 21-member task force appointed in July
spent six months examining the extent of underage and harmful
drinking in the community.
</P>
<P>
   A survey last fall at KU found that 58 percent of the students
questioned said they had engaged in binge drinking within the
previous two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The national binge drinking rate among college students is 42.7
percent, according to a Harvard study that Weschler directed. KU's
rate matches the rate at the University of Colorado-Boulder but is
higher than the rates at the University of Missouri-Columbia (44
percent) and at Kansas State University (45 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Comparing the rates is difficult at best because the surveys may
not ask exactly the same questions or be conducted at the same time
of year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, whether we are at 58 percent or 50 percent
or 42 percent, it's a situation we need to address,'' KU Chancellor
Robert Hemenway said.
</P>
<P>
   MU is using an approach similar to the one at Northern Illinois,
said Kim Dude, director of MU's alcohol and drug abuse office. It
focuses on helping students understand that most of their fellow
students are making good choices. The school also is educating
admission recruiters, faculty, residence hall employees and others
to send the right message to students.
</P>
<P>
   MU thinks its efforts so far have helped it reduce its binge
drinking rate from 53 percent in the spring of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Hemenway created the KU-led task force in cooperation with the
city's mayor and the president of Haskell Indian Nations
University. This month, the three agreed to try to implement the 11
recommendations that the task force issued in December. The plan
includes:
</P>
<P>
   - Promoting responsible drinking. KU has applied for a state
grant to duplicate the advertising approach used at Northern
Illinois University.
</P>
<P>
   - Cracking down on students who persistently violate alcohol
policies on campus, possibly expelling them.
</P>
<P>
   - Increasing the fine for a minor in possession of alcohol from
$200 to $300 on the first offense and then $500 for subsequent
offenses.
</P>
<P>
   - Increasing enforcement and penalties for persons who use false
IDs and for those who make them.
</P>
<P>
   - Trying to reduce underage drinking at private house parties.
One suggestion was to pass a state law requiring anyone who buys a
keg to register for it so authorities can better track who is
supplying alcohol to minors.
</P>
<P>
   - Promoting more alcohol-free events.
</P>
<P>
   - Encouraging education efforts in high schools and middle
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``At KU, it boils down to a three-part program,'' Hemenway said.
``You have to reduce illegal consumption...regulate (use) more
effectively...and educate young people to make intelligent
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those three things _ reduce, regulate and educate _ are the
three pillars that we are going to sort of build our total program
at KU around.''
</P>
<P>
   KU student body president Kevin Yoder said he hopes that KU
administrators and community leaders do not take too
``heavy-handed'' an approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming at it from an iron fist...hasn't been shown to be
effective anywhere,'' said Yoder, a task force member.
</P>
<P>
   Disturbances broke out on a half-dozen campuses last spring, at
least partly because students were frustrated with alcohol
crackdowns. At Michigan State University, students started a huge
fire in the streets of East Lansing shortly after the university
announced it was banning alcohol at a popular tailgate spot during
the fall football season. MORE
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED: fall football season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The students were unhappy...but it proved to be a wise
decision,'' university spokesman Terry Denbow said. There's no more
unruly behavior in that tailgate lot, he said, and no more public
urinating. It's become an appropriate place for families, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional educational approaches that tell students not to
drink have had only limited success, those in the field say.
</P>
<P>
   That's why many schools now are focusing on preventing harmful
drinking. That's the emphasis KU plans to take.
</P>
<P>
   Task force members, however, kept bumping into the problem of
underage drinking, which is why some initiatives are geared toward
curbing it, said Jeff Weinberg, an assistant to the chancellor who
coordinated the task force.
</P>
<P>
   Yoder said the concern with underage drinking bothered him.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of stopping it, he said, ``I was more focused on
understanding that underage drinking exists and what are we going
to do to mitigate some of the risks associated with that?''
</P>
<P>
   Yoder did persuade the task force to recommend that KU explore
the idea of expanding its program to provide students safe rides
home from bars. But task force members said that would not
encourage the kind of healthful behavior they want to promote.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges do have to enforce the law, DeJong said, and the legal
drinking age throughout the nation is 21. That's not likely to
change, he said, even though some people, including a bar owner who
served on the KU task force, think it should be lowered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already done that once, during the Vietnam War,'' DeJong
said. ``It was a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowering the drinking age increased drinking among high school
and middle school students, he said, and increased deaths on the
highways. Colleges have no choice but to deal with their mix of
underage and legal drinkers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While enforcing the underage drinking laws, MU, Colorado and
Michigan State said they were concentrating on teaching students
how to drink in a manner that keeps them safe.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the keys to the Northern Illinois approach, said
Michael Haines, the school's coordinator of health enhancement
services. Advertisements in the college newspaper, for example,
tell students how to drink without getting a hangover, he said, or
what to do if a friend is drunk.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements also drive home the point that most students
drink responsibly, he said, because most students do. When students
realize that their peers do not drink as much as they thought they
did, it encourages them to drink less, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Haines started the campaign at Northern Illinois 10 years
ago, binge drinking there has decreased by 44.8 percent, to 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We give students information on how to protect themselves,''
Haines said. ``They seem to appreciate that.''

ABORTION CENTERS ACCUMULATE RECORD OF 6 DEATHS, 28 SUITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSIE STECKNER  
 and JODIE SNYDER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The owner of a Phoenix abortion clinic where a woman bled to
death operated a cross-country chain of abortion centers with a
troubled record, including six deaths, numerous injuries and
accusations that profits were put before patient care.
</P>
<P>
   An ``Arizona Republic'' investigation found that errors and
indifference allegedly exhibited in Phoenix were only the latest
questionable events at the low-cost, high-volume clinics owned by
New York physician Moshe Hachamovitch.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the physician who performed the abortion in Phoenix,
Dr. John Biskind, and clinic manager Carol Stuart were arrested on
charges of manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Hachamovitch also is being investigated by the Maricopa County
Attorney's Office. Meanwhile, he faces a state medical board
investigation and a lawsuit by the family of Lou Anne Herron, the
woman who died in April at A-Z Women's Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republic'' interviewed former clinic employees, and
reviewed court documents and health agency and medical board
records. They reveal:
</P>
<P>
   The deaths of six women. Two were Hachamovitch's own patients;
four others died after abortions by doctors who worked for the
chain. One, a 15-year-old, died after an abortion that was
performed by a doctor so ill that he himself died the day of her
funeral, her attorney says.
</P>
<P>
   A Texas health department investigation revealing conditions so
unsanitary at a Houston A to Z clinic that officials moved to
revoke its operating license because it was an ``immediate threat''
to patients.
</P>
<P>
   A San Antonio police investigation in which two former employees
alleged that abortions were secretly performed by an A to Z medical
assistant and an administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Hachamovitch, 62, who still operates clinics in the Bronx and
Long Island, refused to comment for this article. His attorneys in
New York and Arizona refused as well.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief interview with ``The Republic'' last year,
Hachamovitch dismissed suggestions that Herron's death was anything
but accidental.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that there was any wrongdoing or any criminal
intent,'' Hachamovitch said.
</P>
<P>
   As for himself, ``I have not done anything wrong. I still fully
support Dr. Biskind, not because of the mistake that he has done
but because of his (past) successes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hachamovitch's three Arizona clinics provided tens of thousands
of abortions over two decades but closed after Herron's death. He
once owned as many as 10 clinics around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Problems with his clinics have been well documented over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   Former colleagues and court documents said some of those
troubles may have stemmed from Hachamovitch's intense drive to make
money. He undercut competitors; drew women from neighboring states
with ads and toll-free phone numbers; focused on costly, late
second-trimester abortions; and had each clinic's financial reports
faxed daily to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hach was so interested in making money. That's the thing you
have to understand,'' said a doctor who worked for Hachamovitch in
Texas and spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hach . . . always talked about how fertile economically this
business was,'' the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Ramos, who had a business partnership with
Hachamovitch in Nevada until the two had a contract dispute, put it
this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hachamovitch is a very skilled physician. He's a good surgeon.
(But) it was very clear that he was trying to run his clinics with
minimum expense and maximum profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just got himself into too many things at the same time and
he just wasn't watching the pot.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Tel Aviv, where abortion was done but not condoned,
Hachamovitch arrived in the United States in the 1960s, just as the
country was on the brink of legalizing abortion. He finished his
residency at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx,
where he is now an assistant professor.
</P>
<P>
   New York was one of the few states where abortion already was
legal, and women would fly in from across the country for the
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Hachamovitch was a hospital resident in charge of treating women
who had complications from abortions. That, he later said in a
court deposition, led him to ``make sure that abortion was legal
and available and affordable and safe.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Hachamovitch and a partner had incorporated a practice
in Westchester County outside New York City.
</P>
<P>
   He later told a writer that he believed middle- and low-income
women needed access to low-cost procedures; rich women could always
get them.
</P>
<P>
   His instincts apparently were right: New York court records
referred to Hachamovitch as a doctor with a ``volume operation,''
with doctors performing 17,000 abortions in 18 months in the early
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The volume was about to increase. Hachamovitch received medical
licenses in Washington, D.C., and six states.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he set up clinics in states with booming populations.
There was Florida, Texas, Arizona and a brief foray into Nevada.
Many offered late second-trimester abortions, from 20 to 24 weeks,
which cost patients more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got into the business very, very early, and became sort of
an entrepreneur,'' said the doctor who once worked with him in
Texas. ``He spread out all over the country. He was making big, big
bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   He also expanded into the Bronx, where he started a clinic in
three apartments. Years later, abortion opponents turned him in to
authorities for violating building codes but he was allowed to
stay.
</P>
<P>
   That makeshift clinic was a far cry from that in upscale White
Plains, whose operations were followed in a 1984 book that
chronicled a day in the life of an abortion clinic.
</P>
<P>
   The author described a tidy and welcoming clinic, with cookies
in the waiting room. The White Plains clinic had a competent and
knowledgeable staff as well as a compassionate group counseling
session for patients and their husbands, the author found.
</P>
<P>
   But that depiction contrasts with the portrait of his clinics
painted in at least 28 lawsuits claiming negligence and other
problems.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Luz Maria Rodriguez, 40, who was eight to 10 weeks
pregnant, died from complications at the Bronx clinic. Right before
she was to be discharged, Rodriguez started turning blue from lack
of oxygen. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed and
paramedics were called. Rodriguez was taken by ambulance to a
hospital, where she remained in a coma for four days until her
death.
</P>
<P>
   A medical-malpractice review found that the doctor had not
removed all the contents of Rodriguez's womb, which led to
hemorrhaging. As the clinic owner, Hachamovitch was found guilty of
malpractice and paid part of a $1.5 million settlement to
Rodriguez's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Christina Goesswein, 19, was brought into the
Bronx clinic. She had had sponges inserted a day earlier to dilate
her cervix, but was vomiting and having severe pain. Hachamovitch
opened the clinic in the middle of the night and proceeded with the
abortion; Goesswein died hours later.
</P>
<P>
   A medical examiner ruled that she died from an embolism of
amniotic fluid. A lawsuit is still pending against Hachamovitch in
the case, alleging he should have recognized her symptoms and
should not have done the abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Board for Professional Medical Conduct found that
there was no lapse in care on Hachamovitch's part, but believed
he'd made a false record entry concerning the amount of blood
Goesswein lost.
</P>
<P>
   That and two other complaints of poor record keeping led the New
York board to suspend Hachamovitch's license for a year, but that
was knocked down to a one-month suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Hachamovitch fought the one-month penalty, fearing that even a
brief lapse would cost him business and expose him to action from
other state medical boards, court records show. He appealed to New
York state courts as well as to federal court, arguing that the
state had violated his constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
   His 6-year-long appeal continues.
</P>
<P>
   While Hachamovitch was fighting to protect his license in New
York, he was spending years cleaning up legal messes in his
now-defunct clinics in Dallas, Houston and San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some of his employees were questioning
conditions at his clinics and quality of patient care.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor who worked for Hachamovitch in Texas quit after four
years, saying his concerns for patients weren't heeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``His attitude was, `That wasn't my responsibility,' '' the
doctor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patient care was left entirely up to the personnel in the
office,'' he said. ``If he had someone really good, then patient
care was really good. The next person might come in and (that
person) was really horrible. Then that's what happened to patient
care _ it was horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor also claimed that employees in the Dallas and Houston
clinics used inadequate equipment, reused IVs, neglected to change
bed sheets between patients and reused suction equipment and
sponges inserted into women's cervixes. Similar claims would be
made later by an employee and doctor who worked at A-Z in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Hopkins, a former business manager for the San Antonio
clinic, also told Texas investigators that ``conditions were filthy
and that the records were in very poor order,'' according to Texas
Department of Public Safety records.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was pressured by Hachamovitch to do more of the
high-cost, late second-trimester abortions, and that she quit after
three months when he implied that she was stealing from the
business.
</P>
<P>
   Problems with drugs being misused by doctors at the Houston
clinic prompted Hachamovitch to voluntarily surrender his federal
license to dispense medicine in 1986 and 1987.
</P>
<P>
   By 1994, Texas health officials were so concerned about
Hachamovitch's Houston clinic that they went to court to have his
operating license yanked.
</P>
<P>
   Problems began when 15-year-old Jammie Garcia Yanez-Villegas
died from an infection after an abortion by Dr. John Coleman at A
to Z. Two weeks later, a health department inspection revealed
dirty and unsafe surgical instruments, inadequately trained
personnel and incomplete patient records.
</P>
<P>
   The state went to court to shut him down, and Hachamovitch
voluntarily closed the clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Yanez-Villegas' family later named him in a wrongful-death
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this 15-year-old Hispanic girl comes in for her abortion,
there's no counseling from anyone who spoke Spanish, the consent
forms are all in English,'' said her lawyer, Ted Amshoff.
</P>
<P>
   Hachamovitch's attorney argued that the teen did get adequate
counseling, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   Amshoff said there were also concerns over Coleman, a prominent
Houston gynecologist. At the time of the abortion, Coleman, who had
emphysema, needed supplemental oxygen and was being evaluated for a
lung transplant, Amshoff said. Employees were concerned about his
ability to operate given his health problems, Amshoff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``His staff in Houston told Hachamovitch that,'' Amshoff said.
``He (Hachamovitch) ignored that. He met with him and said `That's
no problem.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In a deposition, Hachamovitch said Coleman assured him he was
working at full capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . He insisted on going on and proved that he had the
stamina and tenacity,'' Hachamovitch said.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after Yanez-Villegas died, Coleman died at age 64 of
acute respiratory failure.
</P>
<P>
   The teen's lawyer also claimed the clinic was unsanitary and had
inadequate equipment.
</P>
<P>
   He obtained a clinic administrator's memo that she was getting
bids for used equipment because ``our ultrasounds are not
repairable.''
</P>
<P>
   In another memo, a second employee wrote that a repairman was
concerned about the machine used to sterilize equipment: ``He
wanted us to know that the remaining autoclave is not designed to
handle as many loads as we are running per day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yanez-Villegas case was later settled, but the terms are
confidential, Amshoff said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Hachamovitch's San Antonio clinic became tangled in a
Texas Department of Public Safety probe, though it suffered no
criminal penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were looking into allegations that two
non-doctors, who used to work at A to Z, performed as many as 250
abortions at another San Antonio clinic.
</P>
<P>
   One of the non-doctors admitted to investigators that he had
first learned to do the illegal abortions at A to Z by assisting in
the operating room. An A to Z business manager confirmed this,
saying the pair had performed abortions at Hachamovitch's clinic
but were later fired after some patients developed complications.
</P>
<P>
   The two non-doctors eventually went to prison on assault charges
for performing abortions at the other San Antonio clinic.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Hachamovitch closed his Dallas clinic in the face of
anti-abortion protests. A year later, Hachamovitch sold A to Z in
San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout these major battles, Hachamovitch also clashed with
patients in both Texas and New York, who alleged negligence at the
hands of his doctors in lawsuits dating as far back as 1985.
</P>
<P>
   One Texas woman alleged that a doctor ruptured her uterus, then
pulled her lower intestine through the uterus and out through the
cervix. Two others said they left clinics believing they had had
abortions, but later bore babies.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Hachamovitch still faces a malpractice case in the
death of a 28-year-old woman who died from complications of a
perforated uterus caused by a doctor at a Hachamovitch clinic.
</P>
<P>
   At times throughout his career, Hachamovitch would simply deny
knowing of any problems and disavow responsibility because he was
not the doctor treating the patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself an extremely good surgeon,'' Hachamovitch
said in a 1997 deposition in the case of a woman whose bleeding
would not stop after an abortion and ended up having a
hysterectomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``As such, I would not dictate to him (the surgeon who was being
sued) of how to operate or not operate on patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The court agreed, and dismissed him from the case.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview with ``The Republic'' last year about Biskind's
troubles, Hachamovitch explained that problems can be expected when
high numbers of procedures are performed. In the many years Biskind
worked at A-Z, he had two patients die, Hachamovitch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . He did thousands of patients successfully,''
Hachamovitch said. ``Yes, he had two or three or four problems. In
the ocean of all the cases this is really a drop.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Abortion Federation, uteruses are
perforated in less than 0.5 percent of legal abortions; the chance
of death is one for every 160,000 women.
</P>
<P>
   Former Arizona and Texas employees said there was a push to do
more late second-trimester abortions at Hachamovitch's clinics
because those brought in more money. In 1998, A-Z in Phoenix
charged $299 for women seven to 11 weeks pregnant, compared with
$1,250 for women 20 to 24 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   When Hachamovitch opened clinics in Arizona, he immediately
undercut other doctors' prices, said Dr. Brian Finkel, a Phoenix
abortion provider who worked for Hachamovitch for several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he could undercut prices, he knew he'd get more of the
market share,'' Finkel said. ``People will drive across town for
$25.''
</P>
<P>
   Hachamovitch eventually had at least three clinics in Arizona:
A-Z on McDowell Road, and Family Planning Institutes in west
Phoenix and Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   But, as elsewhere, there were problems.
</P>
<P>
   Biskind, who regularly flew in from Cleveland to work at A-Z,
came before the Arizona Board of Medical Examiners several times.
He was eventually censured for the death of a patient before he
gave up his license last year after Herron's death.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined
the A-Z clinic on McDowell Road for health hazards, including a
suction machine that was contaminated with blood, dirt and dried
soap.
</P>
<P>
   Shelia Allen, who worked for a month at A-Z in 1997 straight out
of trade school, remembered the clinic as chronically
short-staffed. Three days after starting there, she was in the
operating room helping with procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was always running around in a rush,'' she said. ``It
was always rush-rush. People didn't know what they were doing and
people would tell them exactly how to do it and not ask any
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Like patients in other states, Phoenix women sued A-Z clinic and
the doctors it employed. Each time, however, Hachamovitch was not
the doctor actually involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
   He was the target of seven complaints made to BOMEX. The board
issued three letters of concern in two of the cases _ one for
problems with medical records and one for failing to file fetal
death certificates. It dismissed the other complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, two new complaints are pending for inadequate
supervision of his clinics. One, from Herron's family, blames
Hachamovitch in part for her April death.
</P>
<P>
   Herron went to A-Z seeking a late second-trimester abortion. The
staff took several ultrasounds, which showed her to be 24 to 26
weeks pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Some employees told police they questioned whether Herron was
over the legal limit for an abortion. But Stuart told them that
Herron was Hachamovitch's private patient.
</P>
<P>
   Herron received the abortion; she bled to death over the next
three hours in the recovery room.
</P>
<P>
   The Herrons' attorney, Paul Lazarus, says Hachamovitch has to
take some of the blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``He certainly had a duty to properly train, supervise and
retain individuals who could meet the standard of care that people
who come into his office would expect,'' Lazarus said. ``We feel he
did not do that.'' &QL;

EYEWITNESSES DESCRIBE NIGHT JAIL INMATE DIED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few weeks after their son died in a struggle with guards at
the Madison Street Jail, Jaron and Deena Norberg found a haunting
message on their home answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello,'' a female voice said. ``I was there when Scott died,
and I need to talk to somebody about it, because they murdered him.
</P>
<P>
   ``And please _ I'm going to _ is anyone there, please?''
</P>
<P>
   The caller turned out to be Patricia Duran, 51, a jail clerk and
an eyewitness to the violent and controversial end to Scott
Norberg's life.
</P>
<P>
   Her sworn deposition became a key part of the Norberg family's
wrongful-death lawsuit that Maricopa County and its insurance
carrier settled this month for $8.25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Duran's testimony, along with that of a guard involved in the
confrontation and several inmates who saw it, harshly contradicts
Sheriff Joe Arpaio's staunch defense that his officers did nothing
wrong when they subdued Norberg on June 1, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The county settled the case Jan. 7 after spending $1 million
dollars in pretrial legal expenses. The settlement requires the
county's insurance carriers to pay the $8.25 million. Arpaio did
not acknowledge any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   After the settlement was announced, a combative Arpaio expressed
regret that he would be unable to put up a courtroom fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted a trial,'' he said. ``We were ready for a trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Had the case gone to trial, Arpaio would have confronted witness
accounts that:
</P>
<P>
   Detention officer David Gurney triggered the fracas that quickly
brought a half-dozen officers into Norberg's cell.
</P>
<P>
   As Norberg struggled in a black metal ``restraint chair,'' a
towel over his mouth, one officer warned that Norberg couldn't
breathe, and two others responded that they didn't care.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the county medical examiner's conclusion that
Norberg's death was the ``accidental'' result of ``positional
asphyxia,'' Norberg's inability to breathe was the result of
violent handling by the detention officers.
</P>
<P>
   Now the FBI and Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley are
investigating the death of Norberg, 35, a former football star at
Tempe High School and Brigham Young University whose life spiraled
down into drug abuse and a series of arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio last week declined an ``Arizona Republic'' request to
elaborate on his office's version of the incident. Instead, aide
Jack MacIntyre said the record at trial ``would have shown that
there was no assault, there was no manslaughter, there was no
criminal conduct whatsoever'' by detention officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were doing their job,'' MacIntyre said Friday. ``They're
not from some alien spaceship or Nazi muscle camp.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, trial jurors would have learned the grim details of
Norberg's death, the basic facts of which are undisputed:
</P>
<P>
   His mouth gagged with a towel, his arms handcuffed behind the
chair, his body zapped repeatedly with stun guns, Norberg's
panicked struggle ended when he could no longer breathe.
</P>
<P>
   His faced turned a purplish blue, testified Kimberly Walsh, a
detention officer who'd warned other officers that Norberg couldn't
breathe. He kicked spasmodically one time, she said, then died.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, who held the towel over Norberg's mouth, acknowledged
that she had complained about the incident to other officers
immediatedly after Norberg died.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was angry . . . how things were done,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Duran testified that she called the Norbergs' home because she
was upset by the Sheriff's Office descriptions of the incident and
by letters defending the office that were published in newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The letters ridiculed Norberg, ``saying that he was a drug
addict and he was a scumbag and he got what he deserved,'' she said
in her deposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, no, he didn't get what he deserved,'' Duran said.
``Nobody deserved what Scott got, because he didn't do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio's office blamed Norberg for everything. Four months after
his death, the office released an investigation that absolved
detention officers of any wrongdoing. Arpaio expressed
satisfaction, saying the report had been prepared by ``very
professional detectives.''
</P>
<P>
   According to that report, the incident began when the 6-foot-2,
234-pound Gurney approached Norberg in a cell and touched his arm.
Norberg, who stood 5-foot-11 and weighed 180 pounds, ``jumped up,
turned around and flexed his body'' in a menacing manner. Then, as
officers surrounded him, he began ``swinging his elbows at them.''
</P>
<P>
   Had the case gone to trial, Duran and others would have
presented a far different story. It was a story the sheriff's
investigators had themselves heard, but one they glossed over and
downplayed. While their report included careful transcripts of
interviews with detention officers, it simply paraphrased Duran's
comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said she felt that what happened should never have
happened,'' the Sheriff's Office reported. ``She said she thought
it was excessive.''
</P>
<P>
   Duran had followed Gurney to the cell to serve Norberg with
court papers that reflected his arrest the night before. Norberg,
who according to a neighbor had seemed ``scattered and confused,''
was charged with assaulting an officer who responded to a report
that he had threatened two girls.
</P>
<P>
   Another jail clerk who had attempted to interview Norberg had
noted that he was disoriented. She wrote in a report that Norberg
``just looks at interviewer and will not speak.'' She added that he
was a ``possible 918,'' code for someone in emotional or mental
distress.
</P>
<P>
   Duran testified that Gurney should have followed usual jail
procedure with troubled inmates _ simply handed him his pretrial
paperwork and left him alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm also here to tell you that any other officer would have
handed him his paperwork _ and I know that in my heart,'' Duran
said in a pretrial deposition. ``I'll die knowing that in my heart.
Anyone else would have handed him his paperwork, and Scott would
have never, ever, ever gone through any of that.''
</P>
<P>
   One inmate described Norberg's emotional distress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott began talking to himself. . . . He just kind of kept
rambling on to himself and acted very abnormally,'' James Heffron
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few times, Scott started speaking what seemed like some
unrecognizable language. It seemed like he was speaking in
tongues.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, another inmate in the crowded cell became
irritated at Norberg and threw a bologna sandwich at him, Heffron
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Norberg) did nothing in retaliation,'' he said. ``He just
sat there with the piece of bread on his shoulder for 10 or 15
minutes before it fell off.''
</P>
<P>
   Duran said that when Gurney entered the cell, Norberg was
sitting on the floor. Gurney ordered him to get up, and when
Norberg didn't respond, ``Gurney reached down, grabbed him, with
his left hand, grabbed his right arm, pulled him up, pulled out his
stun gun and stunned him in his upper body.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with investigators the night of Norberg's death,
Gurney offered a different account.
</P>
<P>
   Gurney said that when he touched Norberg, the prisoner took a
swing at him with his left fist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (Norberg's fist) probably moved about six to seven inches
before I put him in the bear hug,'' Gurney told investigators. ``At
that time the inmate became even more combative and started
screaming and . . . smashed me, pushed me, whatever you wanta call
it, into the, into the middle bunk'' of the holding cell.
</P>
<P>
   Court Commissioner Robert Bushor, who also was present at the
scene, also defended the officers' conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe there was any excessive use of force
throughout the incident,'' Bushor told sheriff's investigators. He
said Norberg had caused the incident by ``mouthing off'' to Gurney.
</P>
<P>
   However, inmate Rab Choudry's account is consistent with Duran's
description of an abrupt, unprovoked attack by Gurney.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the most confusing part, because we had no idea why
it was happening,'' said Choudry, who, like Norberg, had been
arrested the night before and was waiting to go before a judge.
``We thought maybe he (Norberg) had done something earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Jail surveillance videotape shows that there had been contact
between Gurney and Norberg about 80 minutes before the fatal
confrontation. It shows a dazed-looking Norberg in a hallway after
his interview with a pretrial services worker.
</P>
<P>
   The tape, which has no sound, shows detention officer Oldana
Musbach approach the shirtless Norberg as he wandered in obvious
confusion away from the desk where he had the interview.
</P>
<P>
   Norberg responded passively. He sat on the floor as Gurney
approached from the rear. Norberg put his hands over his head, and
Gurney dragged him by one leg into a holding cell. He had been
dragged twice previously by other officers.
</P>
<P>
   It was about this time that inmate Jarrett Blain saw Norberg,
according to a report by sheriff's investigators. Their report of
Blain's account adds a bizarre twist to the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Blain) stated that Norberg was talking funny, saying stuff
like he was `going to die in here,' '' the report says. Blain said
Norberg was not causing any problems or trying to fight with
anybody.
</P>
<P>
   Gurney's confrontation with Norberg triggered a furious
struggle. Duran testified that Norberg fell face first to the
floor. Then other officers rushed into the holding cell to help
Gurney.
</P>
<P>
   According to Choudry, they ``kicked, hit, whatever they could do
to inflict pain on this man.''
</P>
<P>
   Inmates shouted angrily at the guards, but none intervened as
Norberg was handcuffed behind his back and dragged by those
restraints, according to testimony of both officers and inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Martin Spidell acknowledged to a county investigator in
1996 that he told other officers, ``Maybe we should just kick his
ass so he quits fighting.'' At his deposition last year with
Norberg's attorney, however, Spidell refused to answer questions,
invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Inmate Herbert Thompson described Gurney as the most violent of
the guards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I seen this man (Gurney) choking him, kneeing him, trying to
step on his balls, pulled his shoe off and twisted his foot down
sideways on the cement and stomped it,'' he said in a deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Norberg panicked as officers dragged him out of the cell,
several inmates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was yelling, `Help me! Somebody please help me! Oh God!
Help me!' '' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the guards were yelling, Thompson said, ``All I
remember is one guard saying something to the fact _ `We just keep
hitting him and he keeps moving.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said he was so upset by what he saw that he wrote down
an account.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing looked like a pack of dogs trying to kill
somebody and didn't know how,'' Thompson wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Heffron said he was ``deeply traumatized'' by the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I saw,'' he said, ``was a mob that killed a man while he
pleaded for help.''
</P>
<P>
   Norberg struggled mightily as the guards tried to force him into
the restraint chair, flailing about with what they later described
as ``superhuman strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, the officer, said one of the guards stood on Norberg's
back. Duran said he ``put up quite a fight. . . . I've never seen
anybody fight so hard to stay out of that chair as Scott did.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, who held the towel clamped over Norberg's mouth,
testified that when she noticed that Norberg wasn't breathing, she
told Spidell.
</P>
<P>
   According to Walsh, Spidell responded, ``Who gives a
(expletive)? . . . He's still going to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said she then gave the same warning to Gurney, who said,
``Who gives a (expletive)?''
</P>
<P>
   Gurney gave a different account to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gurney, ``Officer Walsh leaned over to me and said,
`He looks like he is turning blue,' and I said, `I think he is.'''
</P>
<P>
   When Norberg went limp, nurse Kay Campbell told the officers to
release him from the restraint chair. Walsh joined Campbell in a
futile attempt at cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame it happened,'' Walsh said in a deposition last
year. . . . I mean, that night I was extremely upset. I tried to
save him, and he died. . . . I was also angry with myself. I was
just upset with the whole thing.'' &QL;

SCAMMING A GREAT GENERATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The TV anchorman Tom Brokaw says anyone who came of age during
the Great Depression and World War II is a member in good standing
of the world's greatest generation. He wrote a book that says so
right on the cover. It's called ``The Greatest Generation.''
</P>
<P>
   It's wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest generation _ isn't.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying it wasn't a pretty darn good generation. Maybe
even a great one. It certainly produced some of the greatest
individuals the nation has known.
</P>
<P>
   My mother and father, for example.
</P>
<P>
   And Jackie Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   And the Kennedy brother everybody still loves, even after the
revelations out about him and other women.
</P>
<P>
   According to Brokaw, though, these people and others represent
``the greatest generation any society has ever produced.''
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   They don't.
</P>
<P>
   It's true they lived through a Depression. It's true they risked
and (in many cases) lost their lives saving the world from Hitler.
It's true they were responsible for creating enormous wealth and
shaping much of the modern world. But that's only part of the
story.
</P>
<P>
   While fighting for freedom in Europe, they put
Japanese-Americans in internment camps and kept Black soldiers in
segregated outfits. &QL; 
GENERATION'S FAILURES
</P>
<P>
   The pitchmen pushing Brokaw's book say this was a generation
``united not only by common purpose, but also by common values _
duty, honor, economy, courage, service, love of family and country,
and, above all, responsibility for oneself.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, it was the kind of family where a mother's place was
``only'' in the home.
</P>
<P>
   And a country with few civil rights for people of color.
</P>
<P>
   This was a generation that staged the worst witch hunts since
Salem, ruining the reputations and even jailing some of its
greatest artistic and scientific minds because of an exaggerated
``red menace.''
</P>
<P>
   As for honor and duty, were these men and women greater than
those who fought in the Civil War? Were their economic and
technological advances more important than those of the Industrial
Revolution? Were their political leaders better than Lincoln?
</P>
<P>
   This isn't about history, though. It's about commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Why give the ``greatest generation`` title to people from the
1800s when none of them are around to buy books?
</P>
<P>
   And why hedge your bets?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Good Generation'' isn't sexy enough. ``The Great
Generation'' is better, but if you want big numbers, it's got to be
``The Greatest Generation.''
</P>
<P>
   It's working, too. It's selling.
</P>
<P>
   Although, you might not buy the part about this generation
believing ``above all'' in ``responsibility for oneself.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, they produced and are benefitting from one of the
largest socialist experiments ever conducted by a society. A series
of government-controlled programs offering health care, housing and
higher education for hundreds of thousands of former soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   And then went to work for businesses that still collect billions
of dollars in corporate welfare. &QL; 
A CHUCKLE IN ITALY
</P>
<P>
   Outside the U.S., I'm guessing there are a few countries who
also might get a chuckle out of Brokaw's claim that this was ``the
greatest generation any society has ever produced.''
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, there once was a generation that included fellows
named da Vinci, Machiavelli and Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it matters.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest generation had to come from the United States,
where it would get the greatest exposure. And reach the greatest
number of consumers. And engender the greatest sense of nostalgia.
And have the greatest chance of landing on the bestseller list.
</P>
<P>
   All of which proves nothing about my parents and their peers,
but does show how the men and women who followed them, including
Brokaw, may in fact compose ``the greatest generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Of shills. &QL;

NHL STILL AN UNDERDOG TO NBA, OTHER NOTES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
Hockey is obviously succeeding. The sport has made inroads to Texas
and Florida that have resulted in three NHL teams and copious
minor-league outfits.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The impact of adding key television markets such as Dallas/Fort
Worth, Miami, San Jose/San Francisco, Phoenix, Denver and Nashville
can't be disputed. The bottom line is more people are watching the
sport than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   But if the NHL believes it won't be hurt by the NBA's return,
it's not dealing with reality. The NHL hasn't come close to taking
the NBA's television audience, and there's no better example of
that than North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. The Stars are the best team in the NHL and have
been putting a winning product on the ice for the past three
seasons. The Mavericks have been one of the worst outfits in the
NBA, and fans aren't sure if they could even reach the playoffs
this season.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, more people in North Texas would rather watch the
Mavericks on television than the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that is history, part of that is upbringing, and part of
that is demographics. One NHL representative put it perfectly when
he said the NBA has a core audience and the NHL has a cult
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is the NHL isn't easy to watch on
television. It's hard to follow the puck, and it's difficult to
understand strategy in a game that moves pretty quickly but gives
viewers fewscoring plays. The best way to enjoy an NHL game is
watching from start to finish, so you can pick up the subtle
battles between players and key matches that coaches seek. Doing so
takes more than two hours.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA, on the other hand, gives you instant gratification.
Watch for 10 minutes, see a few highlight plays, check out a
``Seinfeld'' rerun for a half hour and come back for the final two
minutes of the game. It's a formula that's very TV-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have more people coming to Reunion Arena than ever
before. Their television ratings have almost tripled since last
season (but is only 4.0). Sales of Stars merchandise is going
through the roof, and all it takes is a visit to a local elementary
school to see that kids love this team.
</P>
<P>
   But to think the NBA's return isn't going to hurt the NHL's
fight for the fan dollar is ignoring the obvious. This is a fight
in which hockey still is a heavy underdog.
SLAP SHOTS Relax, already Former Stars defenseman Enrico Ciccone
said that as a Montreal Canadiens fan growing up, the player he
hated most was Washington Capitals pest Dale Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd wake up in the middle of the night with my fists in balls,
just hating him and hating him,'' said Ciccone, now a fighter. ``He
was definitely on my 11-year-old hit list.''
</P>
<P>
   The two are now Capitals teammates. Bad craftsmen Vancouver
Canucks general manager Brian Burke spent five years with the NHL
front office and had a big hand in forging the current collective
bargaining agreement during the 1994 lockout. Now, he says that
soaring salaries are not the fault of that agreement, but of the
owners and GMs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the tools are in place to hold salaries down,'' Burke
said. ``I just don't think we're using those tools in the right
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke is taking a hard line on Pavel Bure and said Thursday that
if he doesn't trade the holdout winger soon, he'll wait until the
March 23 trade deadline. Not fair The NHL had the right idea last
season when it decided to not force every team to have a
representative at the All-Star Game. This season, the league
decided to try to include every team and had some glaring
omissions.
</P>
<P>
   Jere Lehtinen might be the best player on the Stars from the
start of the season until now but will not be included. Even worse
is leaving off Los Angeles' Luc Robitaille, who has 14 goals and 18
assists. He might be the third-best left wing in the league.
Question of the week Q: Since fan balloting began in 1986, which
team has had the most starters elected to the All-Star Game?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Pittsburgh Penguins, led by Jaromir Jagr and Mario
Lemeiux's seven starts apiece, have 21. The Stars never have had a
player elected as a starter. The week ahead Monday: Philadelphia
Flyers at Ottawa Senators. The two hottest teams in hockey square
off with the possibility of an unbeaten streak on the line.
Wednesday: Toronto Maple Leafs at Stars _ Two of league's best
collide as the Maple Leafs seek revenge for a 5-1 loss. Jan. 24:
NHL All-Star Game. Five Stars representatives mean you have to
watch. Best of the best The Hockey News recently released a book,
``The Top 100 NHL Players of All Time'', and two of the players
have ties to the Stars. Here's the top 10, and the Stars' two
honorees: 1. Wayne Gretzky, Edmonton Oilers 2. Bobby Orr, Boston
Bruins 3. Gordie Howe, Detroit Red Wings 4. Mario Lemieuex,
Pittsburgh Penguins 5. Maurice Richard, Montreal Canadiens 6. Doug
Harvey, Montreal Canadiens 7. Jean Beliveau, Montreal Canadiens 8.
Bobby Hull, Chicago Blackhawks 9. Terry Sawchuk, Detroit Red Wings
10. Eddie Shore, Boston Bruins Others: 64. Brett Hull, St. Louis
Blues 86. Bob Gainey, Montreal Canadiens THE BUZZ Western
Conference: The Nashville Predators are hoping to become the first
expansion team to reach the playoffs in its first season. ``We're
right there knocking on the door for a playoff spot, and that is
our goal,'' captain Tom Fitzgerald said. ``We play the game to win,
not kill time before the summer arrives. Being a first-year team is
no exception.'' ... Nice to see that the fans finally snapped to
attention and voted Colorado's Peter Forsberg over Detroit's Sergei
Fedorov to start the All-Star Game at center. After being edged by
Forsberg in voting, Fedorov was left out of the game by league GMs.
... The Canucks' Bill Muckult is an easy choice as rookie of the
year at the midway point with 13 goals and 12 assists, but quietly
building a case is Colorado Avalanche center Chris Drury, who has
10 goals and 11 assists. ... The Kings have struggled on the power
play at 11.5 percent and have given up a league-high seven
short-handed goals, giving them the worst combined power play in
the NHL. ... Phoenix's five-man defense could get a real test now
that Gerald Diduck is out with a knee injury. The Coyotes signed
defenseman J.J. Daigneault last week.
</P>
<P>
   Eastern Conference: Now that the New York Islanders have made
the swap for Felix Potvin, they have one too many goalies. Tommy
Salo, who has five shutouts this season, is sitting at home hoping
for a trade. ``I am not very happy,'' Salo said. ... When Senators
goalie Damian Rhodes was credited with a goal two weeks ago, he
became the fifth goalie in NHL history to score. Rhodes didn't
actually shoot the puck in the net, but he was the last player to
touch it before the Devils knocked it into their own net. Islanders
goalie Billy Smith did the same thing in 1980, and Chris Osgood,
Martin Brodeur and Ron Hextall have shot pucks into empty nets. ...
The hottest road team in the NHL isn't the Stars or Flyers, but the
New Jersey Devils, who are 12-6-1 away from home. ... The Maple
Leafs are a healthy 15-7-2 at home, and team president Ken Dryden
said he's not worried about that magic leaving when the Maple Leafs
move out of Maple Leafs Garden on Feb. 13. ``It's not like this
franchise has a long history of winning here, so I don't think
moving ... should be a problem,'' Dryden said. ... The Flyers have
two of the longest unbeaten streaks of the decade, going 17 games
in 1996-97 and 15 games this season. The Pittsburgh Penguins have
the longest streak of the decade at 18 games (17-0-1). ... The
Tampa Bay Lightning are the latest team to tire of Craig Janney's
act. The enigmatic center is a good playmaker, but he continues to
build a reputation as locker-room poison. He has been told by the
organization to stay at home and await a trade. ... The Senators'
Ron Tugnutt is 11-5-3 with a league-low 1.73 goals-against average,
and said he thanks a stint in the minor leagues. Tugnutt, 31, was
sent to the American Hockey League in 1995-96 after six seasons in
the NHL. ``I played \R58 games\S with Portland. I look at that year
as a turning point.'' (Mike Heika writes for the Fort Worth

A LOOK AT THE MAVERICKS' MISSION FOR '99
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
The Mavericks open their 20th training camp Tuesday. They posted a
20-62 record last season, but showed promising signs down the
stretch. ``Star-Telegram'' staff writer Dwain Price answers 10
questions the Mavericks must address if they hope to compete for a
playoff spot.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Everybody says Steve Nash is a rising star in this league. Is
that true or is it management's way of covering itself because the
team gave up last summer's first-round pick for him?
</P>
<P>
   A: Nash has all the qualities to become a NBA star. In a way,
he's Jason Kidd minus the hotdog and mustard. And he can
consistently bury the jumper from the perimeter. Nash is a leader,
and fans will grow to love his personality and his insightful
approach to the game.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It appears the only ingredient preventing the Mavericks from
reaching the next level is some type of dominating presence inside.
Do they have one?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not really. If the Mavericks can re-sign Kurt Thomas, he
gives them a much-needed enforcer. Nobody consistently wins NBA
championships unless they have at least one enforcer. Samaki Walker
also is a rugged individual with star quality. But Thomas and
Walker are forwards, and the Mavericks need a rugged center.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is Shawn Bradley ever going to become the dominant center Don
Nelson thinks he can become?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's entirely up to Bradley. In the five years Bradley's
played in the NBA, he has not lived up to his potential. But he is
who he is. Coaches and teammates say he's lazy and doesn't work
very hard in the off-season. Every now and then Bradley will post
some incredible numbers to get his teammates' hopes up and have
coaches and fans saying ``wow.'' The Mavericks' best course of
action is to make sure they're solid at the other four positions,
then whatever they get from Bradley is a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Dirk Nowitzki built a nice resume against some bland
competition in Germany. Is he the real deal, or is he another in a
long line of players from overseas whose game is too soft to cut it
in the NBA?
</P>
<P>
   A: Nowitzki is a typical European star player: He has a lot of
offensive skills, but his defense is lacking. In due time, he'll be
a decent defensive player. But his offensive talents and
ballhandling skills are as good as any NBA player. And he has
tremendous range for a guy 6-foot-11. Nowitzki is a quicker version
of Toni Kukoc and has a better shooting eye than Detlef Schrempf,
two European players who have made it big in the NBA. Mavericks
fans should have great pleasure watching his development over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How come Michael Finley wasn't mentioned as a possible heir
apparent to Michael Jordan?
</P>
<P>
   A: Good question, and the answer is simple. Finley, who attended
high school near Chicago, plays on a bad team that receives very
little national press coverage. But the Jordan-Finley comparisons
are eerie. Finley has Jordan's incredible work ethic, uses Jordan's
trainer in the off-season, once played Jordan one-on-one when he
was in high school and was hand-picked by Jordan last season to
model Jordan's new apparel line. Also, remember Jordan scored a lot
of points, played a lot of minutes and lost a lot of NBA games
until he got a supporting cast. Well, Finley has been scoring a lot
of points, playing a lot of minutes and losing a lot of NBA games.
But the supporting cast is on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why does anyone think Don Nelson will turn the Mavericks into
winners?
</P>
<P>
   A: Remember when Jimmy Johnson took over the Cowboys in 1989,
and he had the good graces of owner Jerry Jones to make whatever
trades were necessary to turn the team around. Mavericks owner Ross
Rerot Jr. has given that same power to Nelson. Less than eight
months on the job, Johnson engineered the Herschel Walker 12-player
trade with Minnesota. Less than a month with the Mavericks, Nelson
pulled off the nine-player trade with the New Jersey Nets. Nelson
will keep renting players like Dennis Scott and Cedric Ceballos,
and they'll keep leaving if Nelson doesn't think they are a perfect
fit.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If the season started today, who would be the starters?
</P>
<P>
   A: Steve Nash at point guard, Michael Finley at two-guard, Dirk
Nowitzki at small forward, Samaki Walker at power forward and A.C.
Green at center. Nelson wants to start Thomas at power forward, but
Thomas is a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If the Mavs are unable to re-sign Thomas, is the power
forward spot in shambles?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not at all. In case you missed it last season, Samaki Walker
was a one-man wrecking crew before his season was cut short by
injuries. He was commanding _ and beating _ double teams, and
overpowering any one-on-one matchup. Even Charles Barkley was
scratching his head after Walker took him to school. If he ever
averages 35 minutes in this game, Walker will average 18 points and
10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will playing four games in one week adversely affect the
Mavericks?
</P>
<P>
   A: It shouldn't. They have a relatively young team, so playing
that many games in one week should be an advantage because they
should have fresher legs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: OK, since Finley, Nash and Walker are ``rising stars'' and
Nowitzki a promising rookie, when can the starving Mavericks fans
expect this team to at least reach the playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   A: If the Mavs can add a free-agent center such as Sam Perkins,
the playoffs probably could happen this season. Without Tom
Gugliotta, Minnesota will fade, leaving one Western Conference
playoff spot available. Realistically speaking, the Mavericks are a
quality center away from reaching the playoffs. If that piece of
news doesn't make Shawn Bradley work harder, nothing will. (Dwain

MAD DASH COMING FOR NBA TEAMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
On April 22, 1889, a new Oklahoma was formed when residents lined
up to stake greener pastures in the Great Land Run.
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Jan. 19, 1999, a new NBA will be forged when players line up
in search of greener contracts in the Great Free-Agent Run.
</P>
<P>
   With Michael Jordan now retired to golf, the NBA's A.M. Era _
like the Great Land Run _ will fittingly begin via shotgun start.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never seen anything like it. I expect full and total
chaos,'' said Indiana Pacers general manager Donnie Walsh. ``It'll
be a mad scramble.''
</P>
<P>
   When the ink dries on the league's new collective bargaining
agreement tomorrow, approximately 200 free agents will dash onto
the open market searching for lucrative contracts, a chance to win
a championship, or simply a place to call home. What is usually a
leisurely four-month period of signings and trades stretched over a
summer will suddenly be crow-barred into a frenzied two weeks that
will drastically restructure the NBA's balance of power.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the six-month labor lockout, the abbreviated regular
season is scheduled to start the weekend of Feb. 5-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cram city,'' said agent Steve Kauffman. ``Major decisions have
to be made in split seconds. In the end, some guys may wind up
being left out in the cold. It's going to be wild.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget wining and dining marquee players. It's all about signing
them. Quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many people you are interested in and you don't
want to lose one while waiting for another to make a decision,''
said Charlotte Hornets vice president Bob Bass. ``There won't be
the process of bringing in a major player and showing him the
facilities and having him talk to everyone. You'd like to find
someone right away and hope it's a home run.''
</P>
<P>
   The only sure thing in this unprecedented free-agency period is
that it won't produce double-take contracts such as the $126
million deal signed a year ago by Minnesota Timberwolves forward
Kevin Garnett. The new CBA took care of that, putting a maximum cap
on salaries based on experience in the league. None of the
contracts signed can now be worth more than $14 million in the
first year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly had \RGarnett's contract\S thrown in our faces by
agents who said, `Well, if you can afford that why can't you afford
this?','' said Utah Jazz owner Larry Miller. ``\RThe CBA\S put a
stop to that. They'll still make their money, but now we've got
control of the reigns.''
</P>
<P>
   Players will still have options, but because of the ceiling on
maximum salaries there won't be agent-driven, bidding wars
escalating into the absurd. While agents and players watch the
league's transaction wire like an investor eyeing the stock-market
ticker, the free-for-all will be inexpensive-for-none.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the salary cap is $30 million (with the possibly of it
increasing to $32 million) by Tuesday, the Bulls ($18 million),
Nuggets ($12 million, Suns ($11 million) and Rockets ($10 million)
are in the best financial shape to sign players. Of course, they
also have the most spots to fill as the Bulls and Rockets have only
four players signed.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of a list that resembles a high school blue-chip
recruiting page are forwards Scottie Pippen, Antonio McDyess, Tom
Gugliotta and Charles Barkley, point guard Rod Strickland, and
centers Vlade Divac and Isaac Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Now that long-time running mate Jordan has retired, Pippen is
expected to leave Chicago despite the fact that the Bulls can offer
him a pro-rated salary of $14 million this season. The Rockets and
the Suns are aggressively pursuing Pippen and McDyess, who also has
a meeting in Chicago scheduled tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Chicago's property to lose,'' Pippen said last week. ``But
that doesn't necessarily mean I'll end up here.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the CBA, teams can sign a player to a minimum
three-year contract and then trade him. The move would enable the
Bulls, for example, to sign Pippen and then trade him for players
or draft picks rather than losing him without compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are going to be very, very popular,'' said Pippen's
agent, Jimmy Sexton.
</P>
<P>
   McDyess, the Suns' property, could earn $86 million by staying
in Phoenix and only $67 million if he moves to Houston or Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denver's on at the top of the list,'' said his agent, Tony
Dutt. ``There's pressure on him to act fast. But the real test
won't be how fast he made the choice, but how well he made it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta, Minnesota's All-Star, must weigh $105 million to stay
put and $81 million to leave for suitors like Phoenix or the
Lakers, who are considering dealing forward Elden Campbell and
guard Eddie Jones. Barkley, property of the Rockets, said he'll let
the initial dust settle before deciding between the Rockets,
Seattle SuperSonics and possibly other teams.
</P>
<P>
   Another key pawn in the game will be former All-Star guard
Latrell Sprewell, whom the Golden State Warriors will undoubtedly
trade. The Miami Heat, San Antonio Spurs and Pacers have shown
interest, with the Heat's offer of Jamal Mashburn and P.J. Brown
thought to have the inside track.
</P>
<P>
   While it's unclear who the hottest player on the market is,
there's no doubt Houston is suddenly the most attractive
destination. With loads of money, popular coach Rudy Tomjanovich,
and the likelihood of Hakeem Olajuwon-Charles
Barkley-Pippen/McDyess front court, the Rockets are on most
players' short list.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the running for a lot of people, as this is not a bad
place to live,` Rockets vice president Carroll Dawson says.
``Watching TV reports during the lockout, I've seen 20 players a
day in town playing, and it looks like an All-Star game.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, Chicago's image is icier than its cruel winter
weather. General manager Jerry Krause seems determined to rebuild
rather than reload, but players aren't thrilled about the curse of
filling Jordan's Nikes. Center Luc Longley appears headed for
Phoenix, while backup guard Steve Kerr is hinting he'll land in
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cold as hell there, and they're rebuilding,'' said
free-agent guard Damon Stoudamire. ``Without Jordan, without
Pippen, they're a lottery team. That doesn't have much appeal to
me.'' (Richie Whitt writes for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sign here, please?! When the NBA's free-agent signing period
commences Tuesday, approximately 200 players will frantically
search for new, well-paid homes in what promises to be one of the
most frenzied months in league history. A look at where each

NCAA TOURNAMENT IS A SCANDAL IN WAITING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Should you want to sneak up on an NCAA suit and spook him toward
the nearest cardiac care unit, the operative three-letter word is
``bet'', not ``boo''.
</P>
<P>
   Every night as they try to drift off to dream land, NCAA
president Cedric Dempsey and his lieutenants see these words
flashing across their synapses: ``gambling scandal''.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA is frightened to the death penalty by gambling. In
particular, the organization is tossing and turning over the
possibility of the NCAA Tournament, its signature and money-making
event, being besmirched by a betting scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had more revelations of illegal sports wagering and
point shaving in the last year,'' Dempsey said in his annual state
of the association address at last week's NCAA Convention in San
Antonio. ``And, regrettably, we may only have seen the tip of the
iceberg. ... It's maybe the most insidious of all issues facing
college sports today.''
</P>
<P>
   At the convention, a proposal was submitted that would require
all officials who work the NCAA Tournament to undergo a criminal
background check. Several conferences have been running spot checks
on officials over the past few years. What is hard to fathom is why
the NCAA has waited so long to institute such safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   And, the NCAA cited a gambling survey by the University of
Michigan. The survey said that nearly 35 percent of all athletes
have gambled on sports while in college, with 45 percent of the
male athletes saying they've gambled on sports. Five percent of
male athletes said they have ``provided inside information for
gambling purposes, bet on a game in which they participated or
accepted money for performing poorly in a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I question the accuracy of a survey that elicits
responses from just 25 percent of the participants. And, I wonder
how many of the student-athletes honestly answered the questions.
After all, this wasn't the semester final in English Lit.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt that gambling is pervasive in our society.
Sports, we all have been told by the experts, mirror society. It
was estimated that last year's Final Four generated $80 million in
wagers _ more than Super Bowl XXXII. From office pools to lotteries
to big-time bookies, a large percentage of the populace is involved
in gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA is diligently disseminating anti-gambling information.
It distributes a seven-minute anti-gambling video to each Division
I team; all 64 teams that make the tournament are required to view
it. And at last year's Final Four, coaches, players and officials
were briefed by the NCAA's Bill Saum and an FBI agent.
</P>
<P>
   But the NCAA's anti-gambling efforts are as futile as holding
back the tide. Saum is the only NCAA employee assigned to the
gambling issue _ and he also deals with the issue of agents. The
NCAA has about two dozen enforcement agents enforcing its 489-page
book of arcane rules on recruiting, eligibility and conduct _ and
one man taking on organized gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The day before last year's Final Four in San Antonio, two former
Northwestern players were indicted for point shaving. The
Northwestern point-shaving scandal followed a point-shaving scandal
at Arizona State, which followed a point-shaving scandal at Tulane,
which followed a point-shaving scandal at Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the betting incidents we know about in college
basketball. Bet _ sorry about that, Ced _ that there are dozens
more we don't know about. And all of those incidents involved a
single school and regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the NCAA Tournament is clean. Dempsey says a gambling
scandal would be ruinous because it would cause the public to lose
confidence in the tournament's integrity.
</P>
<P>
   The odds _ aw, man, my bad, Ced _ are it will happen. Who knows
when or where, but it will happen. An NCAA Tournament gambling
scandal is a ticking time bomb, ready to explode.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Boom.'' (Wendell Barnhouse writes for the Fort Worth
Star-Telegram) &QL;

TOP QUESTION FOR '99: WILL Gordon BE CAUGHT? HEADLINE GOES HERE 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ Stock-car racing's annual rite of winter, the
Charlotte Motor Speedway Media Tour, is all about ``bench-racing.''
And as any fan of ``RPM 2Night'' will attest, talking about the
races is the next best thing to being at the races.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Approximately 200 media members spent last week touring various
NASCAR Winston Cup shops in anticipation of the 1999 season. A
dizzying array of team alliances, elaborate garages, sponsorship
packages and paint schemes was trotted out from here to
Spartanburg, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   This just in: Practically every Cup driver, crew chief, car
owner and CEO believes his team has raised the performance bar for
next month's Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Each is hoping to win whatever races Jeff Gordon
does not.
</P>
<P>
   So, let the speculation begin. From the back of the No. 9702
State Fair Corny Dogs bus, here are the most asked questions about
NASCAR's 51st season:
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there any reason to believe that Jeff Gordon will not win
his fourth Winston Cup championship this year?
</P>
<P>
   A: Unless Gordon and crew chief Ray Evernham opt to run a Vega
instead of the Chevrolet Monte Carlo, none whatsoever. On the heels
of a record-tying 13 race victories, including three of the last
four, Gordon and Evernham apparently are only hitting their stride.
Gordon may not win as many races in 1999. So what? The guy wins 10
races during his ``off'' years.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 24 team's proven advantages in shop preparation, pit
stops and strategy will allow Gordon to pile up those valuable
Winston Cup points until his detractors can't stand it no more.
</P>
<P>
   Additional motivation will be supplied by the return of team
founder Rick Hendrick, who has spent the past two years battling
bone marrow cancer and myriad legal problems.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there a sentimental favorite to win the championship?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sure, the driver who has little use for sentiment _ Mark
Martin. The 1998 points runnerup, and arguably the series' fiercest
competitor, Martin remains a popular choice to unseat Gordon.
Martin recently turned 40, as the clock continues to tick on his
quest to hand owner Jack Roush his first Cup championship. The No.
6 team's restrictor-plate engine program will have to improve
immediately at Daytona International Speedway _ or be served
another helping of self-doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Which driver would most media members like to see atop the
points chart?
</P>
<P>
   A: Your friend and his, Rusty Wallace. Rusty rocks. Rusty
shocks. Rusty can fill up a notebook and melt down a tape recorder
like you wouldn't believe. Rusty arguably is the frankest interview
in NASCAR, even with his quotes routinely sanitized of their
expletives. And incidentally _ as the most recent Ford Taurus tests
at Daytona proved _ Rusty still can drive the wheels off a stock
car. Damn right.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who else figures to challenge Gordon for R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco's season-ending millions?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Usual Suspects, including Martin, Wallace, Dale Jarrett,
Jeff Burton, Bobby Labonte and maybe Jeremy Mayfield. Of that
group, the ever-classy Jarrett seems most at-ease with the prospect
of having to chase down the 24. And Gordon said he expects to see
plenty of Burton's No. 99 in his rearview mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about Dale Earnhardt and his quest for an unprecedented
eighth Cup championship?
</P>
<P>
   A: In a word, ``fuggetaboutit''. Earnhardt will go into the
Daytona 500 as defending champion for the first time. And during
this tour, he began hinting that he would like to work out a new
contract that will keep him driving at Richard Childress Racing
once his current deal expires in 2000. That would be a bonus for
fans of Earnhardt and Dale Earnhardt Jr., who plans to join the Cup
circuit full time in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But realistically, Earnhardt's window of opportunity on breaking
out of his championship tie with Richard Petty was closed by Gordon
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are some of the more intriguing new alliances for 1999?
</P>
<P>
   A: Richard Childress Racing, Dale Earnhardt Inc. and Andy Petree
Racing have begun a shared aerodynamic research and development
program for their Chevrolets. Petree and No. 1 driver Ken Schrader
have added Kenny Wallace to their stable, which figures to become
NASCAR's version of The Comedy Zone.
</P>
<P>
   Prodigal son Kyle Petty has carted his pony tail, ear rings and
Pontiac Grand Prixs from Concord, N.C., to Level Cross, N.C.,
joining daddy King Richard at Petty Enterprises (and driver John
Andretti). Also, three-time Cup champion Darrell Waltrip, who is
determined to race through Y2K, has joined Travis Carter's Ford
stable as teammate to Jimmy Spencer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there a clear-cut favorite for Raybestos Rookie of the
Year?
</P>
<P>
   A: Tony Stewart is drawing the most preseason hype. The former
Pep Boys Indy Racing League champion will team with perennial
top-10 contender Bobby Labonte at Joe Gibbs Racing at its lavish
new facility.
</P>
<P>
   Like Stewart, Buckshot Jones and Elliott Sadler are winners and
graduates of NASCAR's Busch Grand National Series. Jones is working
out of his father's sparkling new $2 million facility. Sadler will
have all the knowledge of the famed Wood Brothers _ and their
owners' points covering the first four races _ at his disposal.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s five-race, 1999 Winston Cup
schedule include Texas Motor Speedway?
</P>
<P>
   A: Unfortunately for TMS general manager Eddie Gossage, no.
Little E, who won his first NASCAR Busch race in Fort Worth last
April, is scheduled to make his points-paying Cup debut in the
Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway on May 30. CMS was chosen
essentially because it is the Earnhardt clan's home track. The
reigning Busch champion and NASCAR's next superstar, Earnhardt Jr.
also will run Cup events at New Hampshire International Speedway
(July 11), Michigan Speedway (Aug. 22), Talladega Superspeedway
(Oct. 17) and the season-ender at Atlanta Motor Speedway (Nov. 21).
</P>
<P>
   Fans at TMS will have to console themselves with Junior's
appearance against Gordon in the BGN Coca-Cola 300 on March 27.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When can we expect the debut of the new Chevy Monte Carlo?
</P>
<P>
   A: Target race is The Winston non-points all-star event at CMS
on May 22, followed by the Coca-Cola 600 on May 30. Only two
versions of the new MC exist _ a high-downforce version built by
Bobby Hutchens at Richard Childress Racing and a superspeedway car
fabricated by Eddie Dickerson of Hendrick Motorsports. Dickerson is
anticipating NASCAR approval of final templates around Jan. 26,
followed by full-scale production.
</P>
<P>
   What does the car look like? It's so hush-hush, Gordon said he
has neither seen nor driven the car. But with the exception of the
rear deck lid, Dickerson said it looks very much like ``The
Intimidator'' concept car unveiled by Chevrolet last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Q: At 34 races over 40 weeks, is the Winston Cup schedule
maxed-out?
</P>
<P>
   A: Promoters seeking second Cup dates are betting millions it is
not. Developer Bruton Smith believes there is room for another four
Cup dates under the current system (with second races, naturally,
going to his TMS and the recently acquired Las Vegas Motor
Speedway).
</P>
<P>
   Smith also continues to take every opportunity to lobby NASCAR
president Bill France Jr. for an American and National League-style
series that would allow the schedule to grow to 40, 50 or 60
events. Smith also admits that devising a formula to separate the
stars by league looms as a major political headache.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why is the driver formerly known as Geoff Bodine now asking
to be called Geoffrey Bodine?
</P>
<P>
   A: Bodine said ``Geoffrey'' is what his mother always called
him, especially after he made her mad. Besides, he now wants to
separate himself from all those other drivers named ``Jeff.'' Like
that was a problem? But the boys in the back of the No. 9702 State
Fair Corny Dogs bus have a theory. Bodine turns 50 on April 18, and
what we may have here is the onset of a mid-life crisis. (In
NASCAR, a new Harley-Davidson usually cures that).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will the runaway popularity of Winston Cup continue if Dick
Trickle fails to find a full-time series ride this season?
</P>
<P>
   A: Absolutely. This train is leaving the station. But race
highlights on ESPN's ``SportsCenter'' just won't be as much
fun-fun-fun. (John Sturbin writes for the Fort Worth
Star-Telegram) &QL;

RANDALL CUNNINGHAM'S CAREER HAS BEEN BORN AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
MINNEAPOLIS _ By now, the story of quarterback Randall Cunningham's
return has been told many times.
<TEXT>
<P>
   How he went from playing in an old-timer's football game in 1996
to the Pro Bowl team in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   How he went from laying marble in Las Vegas to quarterback of
the most explosive team in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   How he went from a dangerous mobile quarterback with the Eagles
in his youth to a dangerous pocket passer at age 35.
</P>
<P>
   But as Cunningham prepares to take his Vikings (16-1) into
today's NFC Championship Game against the Atlanta Falcons (15-2) at
the Metrodome, the real story has nothing to do with his play on
the field.
</P>
<P>
   It's about his transformation from reviled egomaniac to beloved
teammate. It's about his conversion from a selfish superstar to the
peoples' choice.
</P>
<P>
   Grambling coach and former Washington Redskins quarterback Doug
Williams called Cunningham this week to wish him luck. Packers
defensive end Reggie White, who played with Cunningham on the
Philadelphia Eagles, said he should have won the league's most
valuable player award.
</P>
<P>
   Vikings coach Dennis Green calls him a team leader.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham credits his religious faith for changing his life and
resurrecting his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``(My marble company) didn't deal in grave stones,'' Cunningham
joked. ``But it sure looks like I've come back from the dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm the same person. I just play with more humility. I
thank God for everything. This is possible because of what He's
done inside of me, giving me peace and pulling down His grace upon
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Vikings receiver Cris Carter, a former Eagle who remembers the
old Cunningham, certainly likes the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing now is he's far more aware of other people
compared to just being concerned about himself,'' Carter said.
``He's really changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham's humility and spiritual renewal were born out of
lessons he learned during his brief retirement from football in
1996 following 11 seasons as the Eagles' scrambling quarterback.
Cunningham won two MVP trophies and was a perennial Pro Bowl
player.
</P>
<P>
   But he left the game as an unwanted superstar when the Eagles
decided to not re-sign him following the 1995 season and make
Rodney Peete their starter. No teams called, so he decided to go
home to Las Vegas and start a marble business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I owned the company, I did the work with my
employees,'' Cunningham said. ``To get down with those guys in the
trenches, laying tile and lining counter tops, dirt flying in you
face, your eyes burning at night and your back hurting in the
morning, it made me realize it was a whole lot tougher out there.
It shows another side of you when you humble yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, who became the Vikings' starter after Brad Johnson
was injured in the second game of the season, remains somewhat in
awe of his accomplishments. He showed that the time away took
little from his rifle arm or his outstanding athletic ability,
completing 259 of 425 passes for 3,704 yards and 34 touchdowns. He
was the league's top-ranked passer with a rating of 106.0, while
earning his fourth trip to the Pro Bowl and being named all-pro.
</P>
<P>
   The old Cunningham would have considered what has transpired as
vindication regarding his bitter departure from the Eagles. The new
Cunningham said he has no ill feeling toward the Eagles, blames
himself for part of the problem and prays for the Eagles and what
they are going through after a 3-13 season.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham said he's just thankful he joined the Vikings in
1997. He could have signed with the New Orleans Saints to be a
starter for more money, but he said God led him to the Vikings to
back up Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham said he would have been content with the same role
this season if Johnson had stayed healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, an ordained minister, is a believer. He said if
Cunningham would have came in with a different attitude the
quarterback situation could have torn the team apart, but said
Cunningham's humility has been a source of strength for the team
during this remarkable season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he says he doesn't care about his role on this team, he
really means it,'' Carter said. ``Things have just worked out well
with Brad's injuries. But I believe he's handled it tremendously
well, which he wouldn't have done in Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham maintains the success he's enjoyed this season won't
make him revert to the past. Instead he intends to use past
mistakes to help him deal with the present.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had success in the past and I have failed in the
past,'' Cunningham said. ``This time I am trying to take it in a
more mature way. I am truly blessed. I know now how to be thankful
for things I took for granted in the past.'' (Clarence E. Hill Jr.

HUNTERS USING 19TH-CENTURY GUNS TO BAG GEESE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB HOOD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
ROCHESTER, Texas _ When a bluish-white puff of smoke billowed from
the muzzle of Jimmy Heisz's double-barrel shotgun in a peanut field
here the other morning, it was a historic event for his hunting
companions.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sandwiched between the cloud of smoke and a heavy morning fog
that had completely blocked out the sky, a big Canada goose came
crashing to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The bird was Heisz's first of the morning taken with a 14-gauge
Wesley-Richards shotgun manufactured 149 years ago, a two-burner
loaded with No. 2 Bismuth shot packed in front of an equal amount
of Pyrodex powder.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was in the middle of a harvested peanut field near
here. Hunting guides Smokey and Kathy Rathbun of Webfoot Outfitters
in Rochester had chosen the spot for the morning hunt by scouting
this vast farming country for where the geese were feeding a day
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The Rathbuns had instructed six hunters with modern shotguns to
lie on their backs amid a spread of more than 100 Outlaw silhouette
decoys moments before dawn, with Heisz and two other muzzleloader
hunters to their right.
</P>
<P>
   The percussion cap muzzleloaders included Heisz's gun made in
1850, a Scott 10-gauge twin-burner manufactured in 1828 and used by
Jim Kern of Arlington, and a 15-gauge Dixie Gun Works doublebarrel
replica which closely resembled the 1828 shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the hunters had modern shotshell guns and
muzzleloaders was not intended to be a test of one against the
other. As with most hunters who choose to hunt with muzzleloaders,
it was a matter of choice _ an escape from the norm and a
pleasurable way to enjoy a bit of hunting history.
</P>
<P>
   Using authentic muzzleloaders for waterfowl hunting was all but
obliterated several years ago when the federal government banned
the use of lead shot and required hunters to use non-toxic shot.
Until Bismuth became available two years ago, steel shot was the
only legal choice.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for muzzleloaders, steel shot is harder than the
Damascus barrels of the antique shotguns and may not be used
without the threat of causing damage to the barrels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bismuth has changed all of that,'' Kern said. ``It is the
closest thing to lead shot and doesn't damage the barrels of these
old guns. Bismuth has opened up a whole new ballgame for
muzzleloaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Heisz's Canada goose was one of four bagged from a flight of
about 15 geese which had emerged suddenly out of the fog, tricked
by the Rathbun's excellent calling and the spread of decoys that
had been set in a banana-shaped pattern.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest attraction for geese here are the peanut and wheat
fields leased by Webfoot Outfitters. Scouting the fields the
evening before a hunt allows the guides to determine which fields
the geese are feeding in so they can set up their decoy spreads the
following morning.
</P>
<P>
   Lying on their backs near the edge of the decoys, the hunters
stared into the heavy fog above, anticipating the arrival of geese
from a nearby roosting area. Almost an hour passed before the first
sounds of honking geese could be heard.
</P>
<P>
   The fog was so thick that the geese could only be heard, not
seen, until they were right on top of the hunters. The Rathbuns'
calls quickly brought responses from the honking geese, but their
exact whereabouts was shielded by the dense, damp whiteness.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes passed. The honking of the geese grew louder. They were
coming closer, but where were they?
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a flight of about 15 Canadas sifted out of the fog and
over the decoys, only to disappear just as quickly to one side.
</P>
<P>
   The honking and the calls of the geese filled the air. The
hunters using modern arms fingered the safeties on their shotguns.
The muzzleloaders touched the hammers over their percussion caps.
</P>
<P>
   The geese reappeared again out of the fog, only this time there
were about 30 of them. Some cupped their wings and began a rapid
decent to the decoys. Others reduced the flapping of their wings
and swung their heads from side to side. The honking conversation
between the geese and the hunting guides was awesome.
</P>
<P>
   With geese overhead no more than 25 yards, Smokey Rathbun called
out to the hunters to ``take them.''
</P>
<P>
   The hunters sat up, raised their guns, and fired. Four geese,
including two shot by the muzzleloaders, tumbled from the flock.
The rest of the birds were swallowed once again by the fog.
</P>
<P>
   At ranges of up to 35 yards, the muzzleloaders proved just as
deadly as the modern arms. Outside that, the cartridge guns held
the advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing you learn when shooting geese with a muzzleloader is
that you must swing through when you fire,'' Kern said. ``You
should swing through with a modern shotgun, too, but with a
muzzleloader, the ignition is so much slower and the shot is coming
out of the barrel at a much slower speed than with conventional
arms, a more pronounced swing will put the shot out there in an
elongated pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Other things a muzzleloader learns amid the haste of reloading
when flocks of honking geese are overhead and are stretching
hunters' nerves to near the breaking point, Kern said, is that the
system doesn't work if you pour a measure or shot down the barrel
ahead of the powder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things can get pretty exciting when you are trying to reload a
muzzleloader with geese right on top of you,'' Kern said. ``There
is a certain system that you must follow _ powder first, a fiber
wad, followed by a card wad, then the shot and a fiber wad on top.
If you forget what you are doing, it can be pretty interesting.
</P>
<P>
   As the morning pressed on, an occasional flock of Canada geese
neared the decoys under the dense fog. Occasionally, a few
speckledbellies appeared, but this was a day for mostly Canada
geese _ and muzzleloaders. (Bob Hood writes for the Fort Worth

HOPI WEDDING TRADITIONS SURVIVE ANOTHER GENERATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY WALKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   POLACCA, Ariz. _ The bride walked up the hill, barefoot in the
dusty driveway, wearing a manta, the black one-shoulder dress of
the Hopi maiden. Her eyes downcast, Delight was beautiful,
dignified, somber; a modern woman following an ancient tradition.
</P>
<P>
   She carried a basket of blue corn meal tied in a cloth. With her
were her two daughters, Mariah, 3, and Miranda, 5, and her female
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   According to custom, the aunts and cousins of the groom formed a
noisy blockade to try to turn back the bride. To symbolically fight
for their man, they held signs humorously mocking the bride, such
as one urging her to ``Speed on by.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Chill out!'' little Mariah yelled at the protesters, not
understanding. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Delight Dalton and Frank Poocha grew up on the Hopi reservation.
She is from the most traditional area, Third Mesa, and speaks the
Hopi language. Frank's mother, Idella Poocha, a fifth-grade
teacher, is Pima. His Hopi father, Fritz Poocha, was a day school
principal at Polacca and Moencopi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have three brothers, and for a long time my dad wanted us to
have Hopi weddings, to keep the tradition alive,'' Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   When Frank's father died, he left each son a cow for their
weddings. But there were to be no Hopi weddings for Frank's
brothers; they all married Navajos and didn't have the ceremony.
When Frank and Dee were joined in a civil marriage at Phoenix City
Hall a year ago, Frank's mom gave them a dinner. Dee's family
arrived with multiple truckloads of food, in the traditional way.
</P>
<P>
   And the two families began planning the wedding Frank's late
father wanted. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Delight, 35, and Frank, 34, have been together for six years.
They live in central Phoenix with their daughters, a chow named
Buffy, and Hopi baskets on the walls of their home.
</P>
<P>
   Delight has worked for 12 years at American Express, where she
is a telephone customer representative. Frank plays trumpet,
keyboards and acoustic guitar in a Native American band,
Clan/Destine. The band performs all over the Valley and many other
parts of the country. Clan/Destine has traveled to Germany twice to
represent the state on behalf of the Arizona Office of Tourism, and
to Australia as part of an exchange of indigenous peoples' arts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   So why a Hopi wedding?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for us,'' Frank said. ``We are in that era where our
culture is the connecting link. Either we learn and continue the
religion, or it's gone.'' The realization makes him feel almost
desperate, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Just in their parents' generation, Frank said, many of the
traditions have been lost. He said the next two generations are
crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grew up on the reservation doing all the things little Hopi
boys and girls do. But now we have to teach our little kids how to
be as Hopi as they can, trying to teach them a way of life.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Frank and Delight's wedding was part of the teaching, and it
involved many family members. Idella's godparents, who live in
Moencopi near Tuba City, worked with Dee's mother, Sylvia Dalton,
and aunts to plan the events.
</P>
<P>
   Once the couple agreed to the wedding, they had little say in
it. Almost every weekend for a year, they made the five-hour trip
from Phoenix to Hopiland, helping get ready.
</P>
<P>
   The work seems endless.
</P>
<P>
   ``We more or less have to prove that our family is worthy of
having him,'' Delight said of the massive food exchanges that are
central to Hopi weddings. ``In Hopi tradition, when the man gets
married, he belongs to me.''
</P>
<P>
   By tradition, during the opening part of the wedding, the bride
grinds corn at her mother-in-law's home while the men weave her
wedding robes in the kiva. Corn is sacred to the Hopis.
</P>
<P>
   No one in Frank's family weaves anymore, so his family members
divided the responsibility of hiring weavers. Each family provided
some of the special clothing for Delight and her daughters. And
Delight's duties were lightened.
</P>
<P>
   ``My aunts told me I was so lucky I don't have to grind corn for
four days,'' Delight said before the wed ding. ``They said, `Your
arms hurt, your back hurts, your knees hurt.' '' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The ceremonial parts of a Hopi wedding usually last at least a
week. This one was compressed into three days over a long weekend.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, the arrival of the bride at the home of the
groom's mother was the first major event of the Hopi wedding _ not
counting the mud fight earlier in the day, when the women from both
sides of the families pelted each other with wet dirt, a muddy mock
battle over Frank.
</P>
<P>
   Frank was waiting, still wearing his work gloves. He had been
chopping wood and doing strenuous preparation, waiting anxiously.
He hadn't seen his wife and children in almost two weeks. They had
been in Hotevilla, working just as hard.
</P>
<P>
   In procession behind the bride were a line of 20 pickup trucks
stretching down the highway. The bride and daughters entered her
mother-in-law's home and were seated to one side.
</P>
<P>
   The house, a double-wide mobile home in the shadow of First
Mesa, had been cleared of almost all furnishings in anticipation of
the arrival of the bride's family from Hotevilla, on Third Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   Delight's family was ready to pay for Frank. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Her family paid two years' worth of corn harvest to Frank's
family, and there is more to come to pay off the debt of her robes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it'll take three years,'' said Delight's sister, Lynn
Nuvamsa, who was one of the family members who kept track of
donations. ``We're shooting for a year and a half.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus do Hopi weddings stretch backward and forward in time,
forming a complex web of obliga tory preparation and payback. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The trucks following Delight backed up to the front porch.
Unloading began with piki bread. The traditional tissue-like bread
of the Hopis was folded in the square style for weddings, instead
of the usual rolls. So much piki was stacked against one wall under
plastic that the mound was the size of a tall single bed. Several
of Delight's female relatives slept in the room with it that night
to safeguard it.
</P>
<P>
   Next came ten 30-gallon barrels of blue corn meal, and enough
five-gal lon buckets of corn meal to fill three-quarters of the
floor space of the room where Delight stayed. Each barrel and
bucket represented weeks of backbreaking work over the past year.
Delight's family had divided up the work: the harvesting, shelling,
washing, coarsely grinding, roasting the corn in big cauldrons, and
finally grinding it into blue cornmeal.
</P>
<P>
   Next came ``lazy flour,'' as one auntie called it, smiling as
she said it. Sack after 25-pound sack of Blue Bird white flour was
passed down the chain of men unloading it, 35 sacks to each truck.
There were seven or eight trucks full.
</P>
<P>
   The flour was too heavy to store in the mobile home, but it had
to be passed through the home.
</P>
<P>
   With each item that came into the house, the men said, ``Kwa
kwai,'' and the women said, ``Askwali.'' Both expressions mean
``thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   The sacks of flour emitted puffs of white as they were tossed
down rows of hands, out a window and into trucks belonging to the
groom's relatives. After the trucks were full, the flour was
stacked on palettes in a big tent.
</P>
<P>
   Last were the baked goods, a boggling array of cakes, pies,
yeast breads, cookies, doughnuts, brown ies, quick breads. Goods
filled waiting shelves in the back room, top to bottom, stacked.
</P>
<P>
   The food was Delight's dowry, donated by her immediate family
and clan family members. It would be divided up among Frank's
family members who helped with the wed ding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Askwali, askwali,'' Delight said. The unloading of 20 trucks
took an hour. There was a palpable sense of quiet pride.
</P>
<P>
   Delight was now ``me-we,'' the in-law. She had been accepted by
Frank's family. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In a Hopi wedding, the bride's family brings the hearth-oriented
goods, showing their prowess as homemakers with huge amounts of
flour, cornmeal, baked goods. The groom's family takes back to her
village the supplies a hunter would bring: meat, firewood,
clothing, groceries.
</P>
<P>
   At least 12 sheep died for this wedding, plus a cow left by
Frank's dad.
</P>
<P>
   Frank's family fed massive quanti ties of food to guests. After
the unloading and stacking the first evening, Friday, the big meals
com menced.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the house, 20 feet of cooking fires and a windbreak had
been set up. A fire pit was dug, and an outdoor kitchen
constructed. The kitchen included shelving from the family's piki
house up on the mesa, where the women bake piki bread on flat
stones.
</P>
<P>
   An outdoor dining tent sheltered seating at tables for about 45
people. Indoors, guests sat on the floor around tablecloths covered
with food, including mutton stew cooked outdoors in huge cauldrons.
Frank's family brought a potluck array of salads, macaroni and
cheese, ham, meatloaf, stew with squash, red and yellow watermelon,
chili beans. The aunties in charge were as organized as a drill
team.
</P>
<P>
   As the sun set, lights twinkled on the mesa above. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Long before the sun came up Saturday morning, juniper and pi non
pine smoke rose from the cooking fires, and a rooster crowed
somewhere between the house and the mesa. Frank and Delight and the
girls knelt in the living room over tubs of warm water to have
their hair symbolically washed.
</P>
<P>
   Mariah, in her pajamas, cried a bit. Mandy was quiet and poised,
remarkably so, as she would be throughout the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The water was saved to take back to Hotevilla, where Delight's
mom used it to mop the floors, a symbolic marking of the space.
Frank had a brief, chilly ritual bath on the front porch in a
washtub, and after it, Delight's mom gave him a blanket.
</P>
<P>
   The family sat together, cornmeal applied to the faces of
Delight and the girls. They also held ears of corn. Family members
took turns rubbing small amounts of cornmeal gently on their arms.
Delight's hair was in two pigtails wrapped with yarn and her bangs
cut on either side in the traditional married-woman style. Then
there was a lull, as the participants waited for the sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're going to throw the corn stuff at the sun,''
one of the teenagers in attendance told another. She was right.
Accompanied by their mothers, Delight and Frank walked toward the
sunrise and tossed cornmeal, an offering with a prayer to the sun. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Saturday was devoted to food and ``lady things,'' as
Frank termed the food preparations.
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast was as big a spread as the meal the night before, with
a couple of delicacies that the older Hopis relished and the
younger ones avoided: boiled sheeps' heads and intestines, and a
pudding made of blue cornmeal and sheeps' blood.
</P>
<P>
   After breakfast, the men left for the mesa with bundles that
contained the ceremonial bridal clothing. They went to the kiva, to
smoke and pray over the robes.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 women in aprons sat on the floor to make two ceremonial
wedding blue-corn dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Both were made with the same filling of blue cornmeal and a
little sugar, mixed in tubs with hot water to the proper
consistency. Stuffed into rehydrated corn leaves and tied into
triangles, they became ``tsukuviki.'' Fashioned into slender
rectangles and wrapped in corn husks with double ties, they are
called ``somiviki.'' Both were boiled and served at subsequent
meals.
</P>
<P>
   Delight, wearing a lace-trimmed apron over her black dress,
still barefoot, led the preparations with her mother. She had never
made any of these dishes before, but she was the perfect bride,
intent and patient. Mandy, in an apron just her size, made the blue
corn dishes with her mother and grandmother, serious and focused
beyond her years.
</P>
<P>
   Delight also prepared ``pik-ami,'' a pudding of sweet corn flour
and sugar. That dish was put into the fire pit and covered to bake
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Frank's Pima aunts from Blackwater on the Gila River reservation
made their traditional food, too _ chumuth, paper-thin flour
tortillas as big as pizza pans.
</P>
<P>
   At noon, Delight's paternal Sun Clan aunts and her maternal Corn
Clan relatives went into action. They drove up to the mesa,
unloaded food from trucks, and passed it down the ladder to the men
in the underground kiva with the robes.
</P>
<P>
   When the men returned two hours later, they were fed again.
</P>
<P>
   Special hominy had been soaking since dawn in four big washtubs.
Frank's relatives had cracked and dried each piece of hominy by
hand for a special wedding stew. Cooked with diced mutton, the
kernels flowered like popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   All day long, food was exchanged. The Hotevilla contingent
brought blue corn in buckets for the tsukuviki and somiviki; dried
ears of corn were placed in the empty containers for them to take
home. Frank's relatives brought over clothes they had made and
basket after basket of groceries, to be taken the next day to
Delight's village.
</P>
<P>
   When 3-year-old Mariah was given a shawl, she put it on and
started dancing.
</P>
<P>
   At the wedding dinner of cracked hominy stew, no soda pop was
served, in deference to the stricter traditions of Third Mesa. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Sunday morning dawned, and soon thereafter Delight and her
daughters had a final ceremonial hair washing. Frank and Delight
were exhausted from lack of sleep, but this was the last big day.
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast featured the sweet pik-ami pudding. And for the first
time there were as many men as women, Frank's deer clan and
immediate family relations.
</P>
<P>
   Sheets were spread on the floor for the dressing of the bride.
Delight wore her black dress. Over their little-girl clothes, Mandy
and Mariah were dressed in long-sleeved dresses made for the
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Over the dresses the girls wore their own black mantas,
one-shoulder maiden dresses secured with a red, woven belt that had
to be wrapped and tucked a certain way. The men put the sashes on
Delight and the girls.
</P>
<P>
   Two women worked on each side of Delight to put her hair into
the married-woman style, wrapped with yarn. The emotional meaning
of the ceremonies was now coming home to Delight, who kept
swallowing a lump in her throat.
</P>
<P>
   The dressing took a long time, and the arduous nature of the
process caused one unmarried guest to make a laughing reference to
a place where getting married is a far quicker affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Las Vegas is looking pretty good,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Working patiently, aunties dressed the girls' hair in a
short-haired version of the Hopi maiden butterfly style, wrapping
yards of yarn around each section of hair, fanning it out at the
top and bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Special shoes and leggings made of perfectly white buckskin were
fitted onto Delight and each girl. A cloth shawl with lace trim was
tied around each one's shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for your Hopi makeup,'' one of the aunties told
Mandy. The faces were gently powdered with cornmeal.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was time to don the ``ovah,'' the white wool blankets,
with tassels on the corners to represent corn and fertility. Prayer
feathers had been attached in the kiva.
</P>
<P>
   Delight explained before the wedding that the robes were ``my
ticket to heaven.'' They have a dual purpose: The robes that the
Hopi bride wears at her wedding will someday serve as her shroud.
</P>
<P>
   The men stepped forward to the ovah, two holding each one by the
corners. As they unfolded them, cornmeal from the religious
ceremonies in the kiva puffed into the air like pale smoke.
</P>
<P>
   When Delight and the girls were dressed, they were seated with
Frank in a row of chairs, though Mariah had on so many layers she
could barely bend at the waist to sit.
</P>
<P>
   Delight then made a thank-you speech, her poise cracking for the
first time. ``Askwali,'' she started. Then she said in Hopi, ``I
want to thank everyone who has labored very hard in order for this
to happen, and because of that, we are very happy. We are finishing
beautifully.''
</P>
<P>
   The men stepped forward, one by one, to talk to the couple.
Tears rolled down faces throughout the room, and even those who
didn't speak Hopi were affected. The speakers talked about family,
and love, and how to live the Hopi life. They gave practical
advice, too, such as avoidance of alcohol. After each person spoke,
cornmeal was tossed in a trail toward the open door.
</P>
<P>
   The talks went on. By the time Frank's mother, Idella, stepped
forward and described getting old, and how hard it was, and how
lucky Delight and Frank were to have each other, everyone was
sobbing.
</P>
<P>
   It was beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   They were married.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the talks were finished and hugs exchanged, Frank's
family's trucks were loaded and ready to roll to Hotevilla. There
was meat already butchered, and several live sheep in a trailer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to more flour, loads of groceries, and a load of
firewood, there was one truckload of bags of clothing, shawls, and
dresses for Delight and the girls, much of it handmade.
</P>
<P>
   Delight carried the traditional bride's ``suitcase'' of woven
reeds, rolled around the ceremonial sash, its hanging tassels
symbolizing rain.
</P>
<P>
   The group assembled, Idella in front, carrying blue cornmeal in
a basket wrapped with a cloth. Frank and Delight walked down the
hill, married in the Hopi way. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   They drove to Hotevilla. They unloaded.
</P>
<P>
   They ate another big meal.
</P>
<P>
   Frank's uncle gave him a blanket. Later that evening, Delight's
relatives tried on her wedding robes and she showed them all her
shawls. She gave a shawl and meat, flour and groceries to each of
those who had contributed.
</P>
<P>
   The wedding obligates the couple to return to the reservation
even more often. Since Frank now belongs to Dee's family, he will
be responsible for planting and harvesting crops for them each
year, carving kachina dolls for his girls, taking care of his wife
and the womenfolk in her family.
</P>
<P>
   Delight's robes have to stay in her mother's home until they are
all paid for, years down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Only when that happens will this Hopi wedding be over. &QL;

   Texas went the last seven minutes, 33 seconds without making a
shot from the floor, while Kansas State failed to hit a field goal
over the last 6:22.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns made enough free throws to hold off the Wildcats
and send the season's largest home crowd away happy with a 65-59
Big 12 Conference win before 10,172 at the Frank Erwin Center.
</P>
<P>
   UT is 9-8 overall and 5-0 in conference, but the Longhorns' five
Big 12 opponents thus far have a combined league record of 6-17;
their next three (Kansas, Oklahoma State and Oklahoma) are 11-1.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Gabe Muoneke led Texas with 20 points in just 29 minutes
as a result of foul trouble and a hyperextended left elbow that
forced him to leave the game with 2{ minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   X-rays on the elbow showed no fracture, but Muoneke, the
Longhorns' leading scorer, is listed as questionable for UT's
showdown with Kansas in Lawrence on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a lot to overcome because Gabe is such a big part of
this team,'' point guard Ivan Wagner said. ``Because we have so few
people, we've been having to deal with adversity all season long,
(so) we're prepared for it.''
</P>
<P>
   After beginning the second half 5-of-11 from the foul line, the
Longhorns hit four consecutive free throws in the last 30 seconds
for the final points of the game.
</P>
<P>
   K-State (12-6, 1-4) had closed to within 61-59 on two free
throws by Shawn Rhodes on a questionable over-the-back foul call on
a Chris Mihm rebound.
</P>
<P>
   But William Clay drained two free throws with 30 seconds to go
and Kris Clack, who was slowed by flu symptoms, grabbed a rebound
off a missed 3-pointer and dropped in a pair with 23 seconds left
to give Texas the win.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-foot Mihm had his fourth double-double in the last six
games, with 13 points and a game-high 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of offense in the final minutes was the capper to an
unusual game in which Texas had an early 15-0 run and held a
20-point lead (34-14) with 5:35 left in the first half, only to see
K-State respond with an 18-1 spurt to pull within 35-32 at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   By the game's end, the Longhorns staved off a solid effort from
the Wildcats, who have now dropped 17 of their 18 road games in the
Big 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could bottle that first 11 minutes,'' Texas coach
Rick Barnes said. ``We were really good the first 11 minutes. They
couldn't get the ball into the paint area, and we were really doing
some good things there. But they're too good a team (for that to
have continued). They do some real nice things on the offensive
end, and they execute probably as well as any team we've played.''
</P>
<P>
   The early run was so promising that at one point Barnes turned
to his assistant coaches on the bench and asked, ``Are we this
good?''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the early run, the Longhorns won their second
consecutive game while being outshot from the floor, after going
0-6 in such games earlier in the season.
</P>
<P>
   Texas made 21 of 59 shots from the field (35.6 percent) and
17-of-29 (58.6 percent) from the foul line, but forced 25 turnovers
and held the Wildcats to a 37.3 percent shooting effort (19-of-51).
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't turn it over 25 times and shoot 37 percent and win
on the road,'' Kansas State coach Tom Asbury said.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns forced four of those turnovers and got a pair of
blocked shots by Mihm during a 2:24 span midway through the first
half and it added up to 15 straight points.
</P>
<P>
   After Clay hit a 3-pointer, Wagner, who had five steals, fed
Muoneke for a three-point play.
</P>
<P>
   Clack, who has 17 steals in Texas' last four games, swiped the
ball from the Wildcats' Josh Reid and fed Mihm a nice bounce pass
for a layup.
</P>
<P>
   A Mihm block on one end was finished by a Wagner trey, followed
by a Clack steal and dunk.
</P>
<P>
   Wendell Carter closed the run, putting Texas ahead 28-11 with a
bucket in the paint after the Wildcats' Josh Kimm turned the ball
over on a double dribble.
</P>
<P>
   But K-State outscored UT 18-1 over the last 8:44 of the half.
</P>
<P>
   Reid had nine of his team-high 18 points in that stretch,
including two 3-pointers, and Cortez Groves closed it with a steal
from Wagner and a spinning layup as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you fall down like that, you know you have to step it
up,'' Reid said. ``The last time we came here we fell down and got
blown out by 40 points (104-63 on Jan. 12, 1997), and we weren't
going to let that happen again.''

It's all downhill for Salt Lake as illicit tactics come to light
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By BILL SULLIVAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Just a few years ago, locals fretted mostly over the potential for
polygamy jokes and complaints about 3.2 beer.
</P>
<P>
   In Salt Lake City, those may be remembered as the good old days
of an increasingly troubling Olympic experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said the Olympics would bring the kind of publicity money
can't buy,'' Stephen Pace, an outspoken Olympics critic and the
head of Utahans for Responsible Spending, told reporters last week
</P>
<P>
   ``They were right about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Since November, the once idyllic notion of hosting the world has
been tarnished by stories of vote buying, under-the-table payments,
cozy scholarship, job and internship deals _ even rumors of illicit
sex.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened to turn a relatively out-of-the-way city _ one
culturally and politically dominated by the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter Day Saints (The Mormons) _ into an Olympic Sodom and
Gomorrah?
</P>
<P>
   Frustration, in part. Greed, almost certainly. And to a large
extent, perhaps, the seductive nature of doing business behind
closed doors, without public knowledge or consent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This culture of corruption has taken root,'' Utah Governor
Mike Leavitt said, ``because of a lack of accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually from the time the Utah capital was awarded the 2002
Games back in 1995, the Salt Lake Organizing Committee (SLOC) came
under fire for its secretive ways. City and state officials who
inquired about finances and budget concerns routinely were given a
standard response.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trust us.''
</P>
<P>
   That modus operandi began to come into greater question in the
summer of 1997, when then-Chief Executive Officer Tom Welch was
forced to resign in the wake of charges of spouse abuse, casting
the Utah Olympic operation in a bad light nationally for the first
time. (Welch and wife Alma since have divorced.)
</P>
<P>
   SLOC's response to greater scrutiny? To dig in even deeper,
imposing a media gag order on employees, who were required to refer
even the most innocuous of questions to designated spokesmen.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even amid growing concerns over budget shortfalls and
possible taxpayer exposure, Welch's successor, Frank Joklik, and
the committee were able to conduct business pretty much as usual.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few months ago, at least.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble began in late November when a local television
reporter obtained a letter written by SLOC second-in-command Dave
Johnson to Sonia Essomba, daughter of an IOC member from Cameroon.
The correspondence indicated that a $10,000 tuition payment would
be the last of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, SLOC was forced to acknowledge a scholarship program
that had distributed more than $400,000 to 13 individuals, six of
them with IOC connections.
</P>
<P>
   The revelations _ and the staggering behind-the-curtain price of
doing Olympic business _ began to snowball.
</P>
<P>
   Among other embarrassing disclosures: Some $70,000 in cash was
paid to various IOC delegates, including $50,000 to Jean-Claude
Ganga of the Republic of Congo, who also allegedly received free
medical treatment and reportedly profited an additional $60,000
from a friendly real estate deal.
</P>
<P>
   Free medical services were arranged for other visitors with
Olympic ties. Another IOC delegate, Sergio Santander Fantini, is
said to have snared a $10,000 ``campaign contribution'' in his bid
for mayor of Santiago, Chile. Jobs and internships were provided
others with IOC ties, mostly by private companies, one by the city.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the revelations, Joklik and Johnson resigned last
week, while Welch was stripped of his $10,000 a month consulting
job and a $500,000 pension. Meanwhile, Salt Lake City Mayor Deedee
Corradini, who played a high-profile role in landing the Games, has
announced she would not seek a third term.
</P>
<P>
   The worst, however, may be yet to come as the United States
Justice Department looks into the possibility of tax evasion and
fraud charges, with a grand jury scheduled to convene as early as
this week.
</P>
<P>
   While Utahans bemoan the controversy that is sure to tarnish
their Olympic dream, some historical perspective may help explain a
process gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Salt Lake City was awarded the Games in 1995, the
quest was nearly 30 years old, with no shortage of setbacks and
disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   In January of 1966, the city was chosen as the U.S. candidate
for the 1972 Games, which eventually went to Sapporo, Japan. After
Denver won the 1976 bidding, only to bail out, Salt Lake again was
presented as an alternative, losing this time to Innsbruck,
Austria.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-1985, Salt Lake City competed against Anchorage, Alaska,
Reno, Nev., and Lake Placid, N.Y., for the U.S. spot in the running
for the 1992 and '94 Games. Anchorage was chosen for both years,
but lost out to Albertville, France, and Lillehammer, Norway,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Enough? Hardly. By June of 1989, Salt Lake was pounding the
Olympic bricks once more, again earning the USOC's backing in the
international field. This time, the Games were awarded to Nagano,
Japan, by a vote of 46 to 42.
</P>
<P>
   After those five failures, Salt Lake City was named in January
1995 as one of four finalists for the 2002 Games, joining Quebec,
Canada, Sion, Switzerland, and Ostersund, Sweden. In the following
three months, 54 IOC delegates visited Utah as part of the final
push.
</P>
<P>
   In what now appears more than a little ironic, the U.S. entry
received a record 54 votes, 40 more than runners-up Sion and
Ostersund in the most lopsided outcome ever.
</P>
<P>
   Some might suggest that the Salt Lake bidders came to realize
that a clean, relatively safe community with nearby mountains, a
history of good snow and a modern, world-class airport wasn't
enough to get the job done. An internal investigation conducted by
the USOC, in fact, has revealed concerns about elaborate
hospitality and gift-giving dating back to a 1989 visit by a USOC
site selection team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bidding for the Games uncovers every wart a city has,'' Tom
Welch said in a January 1997 interview with the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   To their chagrin, Utahans only now are being allowed to peek
behind the curtains and see them.

Tarnished image of Olympics may threaten financial stability
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By BILL SULLIVAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It began with a report on a Salt Lake City television station.
On the other side of the world, an 80-year-old Swiss fanned the
flames, giving full voice to what previously had been mostly
whispers and innuendo.
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough, the fires were burning out of control back in Salt
Lake and points in between.
</P>
<P>
   As increasingly tawdry tales of sex, lies and ethically
questionable cash payments and sweetheart deals threatened to
engulf the Olympic movement, Michael Payne rushed off to make
another stop _ and an ironic one at that.
</P>
<P>
   Payne was headed to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   As the International Olympic Committee's chief marketing
officer, Payne was hoping to put out a few blazes in particular _
most notably in the corporate offices of Coca-Cola, an Olympic
sponsor since 1928 and currently on board through 2008. The
following day, he was scheduled to address the concerns of
officials from United Parcel Service and Home Depot, other clients
beginning to harbor second thoughts about being identified with the
budding five-ring circus.
</P>
<P>
   In a city openly scorned by IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch
just 2{ years earlier, the image of an IOC official returning, hat
in hand, said much about an organization in sudden and violent
turmoil. So smug and superior in the summer of '96, the Lords of
the Rings were back in Georgia with considerably less
self-satisfied expressions, hoping to kiss, make up and keep the
checks coming.
</P>
<P>
   The cash cow that the world's most famous sporting event has
become wasn't on its deathbed by any means, but vital signs were
beginning to deteriorate. Already, the potential financial fallout
from the Olympic bribery scandal is almost unsettling to the powers
that be as any tales of illicit payments and dirty deeds _ perhaps
even more.
</P>
<P>
   Consider:
</P>
<P>
   Texaco-Caltex, the American oil company, ended 12 months of
negotiations by taking a pass on a $6.3 million sponsorship
arrangement for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia,
citing a downturn in the industry as the determining factor.
</P>
<P>
   In Utah, Salt Lake Organizing Committee (SLOC) officials were
fielding inquiries from anxious partners beginning to question the
wisdom of their investments.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, David D'Alessandro, president of John Hancock Mutual
Life Insurance Company _ a worldwide Olympic corporate sponsor _
was asking the IOC to extend its investigation beyond Salt Lake,
suggesting that anything less would mean ``the rings won't be
tarnished, they'll be broken.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is in the midst of a $40 million commitment through
the 2000 Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. West, the telephone carrier, delayed a $5 million payment
to the Salt Lake City effort in the wake of the scandal before
finally handing over the check Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Even before news of the trouble began to spread, organizing
committees for Sydney and Salt Lake were struggling to meet
obligations. Of Salt Lake's $1.45 billion budget, $859 million is
supposed to come from corporate sources, with about $250 million of
that yet to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   For now, finding new money may take a back seat to keeping
current clients in line, as Payne's dash to Georgia suggests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Games are going to be based on the support of our
sponsors,'' John Krimsky, Deputy Secretary General of the United
States Olympic Committee, said. ``It's a very fragile relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their brand, their product, their service is tied closely to
what they put their name on.''
</P>
<P>
   All this, of course, is an easier sell when the tie is to Tara
Lipinski's golden night in Nagano or Picabo Street blasting down a
Japanese hill or Michael Johnson grabbing history-making double
gold in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   When the connection is with IOC delegates conducting global
shakedown tours of overeager bid committee officials, corporate
checkbooks may close in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   In Utah, this has become cause for alarm as citizens begin to
assess damage that could extend far beyond a tarnished image.
</P>
<P>
   Already, taxpayers are out $59 million to build the already
completed bobsled and luge run, plus support facilities, near Park
City. SLOC also is expected to provide an additional $40 million to
maintain and operate the facilities after the Games have come and
gone.
</P>
<P>
   That's $99 million already on the line, with the Games still
more than three years away. Should SLOC fail to make budget, the
city and state could be liable for that and any additional debts
incurred _ a particularly bitter pill in light of the organizing
committee's penchant for conducting business in secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are already facing tough times with a growing city,'' said
Salt Lake City council member Deeda Seed, a longtime SLOC critic.
``(Now) we've heard that it may be more difficult in terms of
revenues. We need to have some serious discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``For one thing, the city shouldn't have to pay for corruption.
It takes two to corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let the IOC pay.''
</P>
<P>
   The threat of lingering bills has some Utah legislators mulling
a referendum on whether the Games should be held at all. A recent
poll showed that 70 percent of the state's residents still wanted
to see the Olympics go on as planned, but that was taken before
revelations that the public may eventually face a major tax burden.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, a Utah Olympic push that dates back to the mid-1960s
has gone badly awry long before the flame residents actually had
bargained for is scheduled to be lit. While the IOC has set a Jan.
24 date for releasing the results of an already completed internal
investigation that has resulted in 13 members being asked to
explain their actions, USOC and Salt Lake officials are hoping to
straighten things out by the end of February.
</P>
<P>
   That may be optimistic. In addition to its own national
governing body, SLOC is being investigated by its own ethics board,
the IOC and _ perhaps even more ominously _ the United States
Department of Justice, which is looking into possible fraud and tax
evasion. A grand jury could begin hearing evidence as early as this
week.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of it all, the USOC has been conducting its own
internal inquiry of potentially questionable SLOC ties. Last
Thursday, Alfredo LaMont _ in charge of international relations for
the USOC _ resigned because of an ``undisclosed business
relationship'' with former SLOC president and one-time bid
committee head Tom Welch.
</P>
<P>
   Legal bills alone surely will add to SLOC's mounting financial
woes. And the bad news and unflattering headlines aren't likely to
end soon as Utah residents already in shock wait for the other shoe
to drop.
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Few Olympic veterans have been shocked by the revelation that
IOC members were not always averse to requesting impromptu palm
readings. Rumors of elaborate gifts and under-the-table payments
have been part of the scene for years.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Lewis, for one, was particularly blunt in his reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone believes this is the first time this has
happened,'' the nine-time gold-medal winner and former UH star said
last week. ``I don't know of any organization that has more power
or makes more money that is less regulated in the entire world than
the IOC.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis dismisses suggestions that the IOC can be trusted to clean
up its own mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IOC is investigating itself,'' he said. ``So, like
everybody else, we are all a little skeptical.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk of improprieties has only increased with the growth of the
Games. The budget for Sydney now is expected to top $3.54 billion _
an enormous figure to track and account for by just about anyone's
standards.
</P>
<P>
   How much scandal will cut into that pie remains to be seen,
though the degree of exposure seems particularly great in an
industry where image and integrity make up much of the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The timing couldn't be much worse. For the most part, the Games
have been in a financial upswing since the success of the 1984
Summer Olympics in Los Angles, but even before the recent
revelations, there were signs of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Television ratings for the 1998 Nagano Games were down from four
years earlier in Lillehammer, due in part to the 14-hour (Houston
to Nagano) time difference that all but eliminated live coverage.
Failing to make the projections on which advertising rates were
based, CBS eventually had to provide compensatory spots for
sponsors on subsequent broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney, next on the Olympic agenda, will present many of the
same logistical problems for NBC, which has contracted to televise
the Olympics through 2008. A further complication for TV: The
Sydney Games will be held Sept. 15-Oct. 1, 2000 (Spring in
Australia), making for greater competition from college and
professional football in the United States on weekends and from the
start of the fall TV season on rival networks.
</P>
<P>
   As such, the 2000 Games have potential to continue the ratings
slump that began in Nagano, which could further frighten sponsors
and cut into future rights fees. The Salt Lake Games are more
time-slot friendly to American television, of course, but SLOC's
current difficulties have created a different sort of negative.
</P>
<P>
   Can credibility be restored?
</P>
<P>
   Some skeptics, such as Lewis, liken having Samaranch oversee the
housecleaning to putting the fox in charge of safeguarding the hen
house. Others note that the speed with which the IOC wrapped up its
internal investigation and identified the culprits hints strongly
that the organization knew who the crooks were all along and
preferred to turn the other way until forced to do otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Even if some kind of order can be restored in Utah, it's likely
that brushfires will pop up elsewhere in the months to come.
</P>
<P>
   Some, in fact, already have.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Toronto Sun quoted a senior member of the city's
failed 1996 Olympic bid describing a variety of scams by IOC
members.
</P>
<P>
   Prospective visitors would request two first-class, round-trip
plane tickets (as IOC rules dictated at the time), then either cash
the tickets and not make the trip at all or convert them to economy
class and keep the difference.
</P>
<P>
   During a period when Toronto, Atlanta and Salt Lake City all
were mounting Olympic bids, some IOC members requested first-class,
round-trip tickets to each city, then would cash two sets of
tickets and take connecting flights within North America, again
pocketing the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Those incidents, according to the Sun, were documented by the
Toronto bid team and presented to the IOC _ which evidently took no
action.
</P>
<P>
   On the heels of that story, a senior member of Sydney's bid team
hinted at other dirty dealings, saying he had been approached by
one IOC delegate and an intermediary soliciting bribes in the midst
of the ultimately successful Australian effort.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, investigators into allegations of wrongdoing related
to Nagano's successful bid for the '98 Winter Games may find only a
trail of ashes.
</P>
<P>
   According to one bid committee report, about $18 million was
spent on Nagano's efforts to land the Games, more than half of it
going into ``public relations efforts.'' A senior official from
that bid committee said last week, however, that a 90-volume
accounting book detailing transactions was burned in 1992 because
it contained ``secret information.''
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, Michael Payne did his best to put a positive spin on
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has allowed us to address unequivocally some of the
rumors that have been around for some time and be able to weed out
any unacceptable and unethical behavior,'' the IOC money man told
reporters after meeting with executives at Coca-Cola and UPS and
speaking by phone with Home Depot officers.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction, evidently, was mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident they will do what they said they would do -
take swift and decisive action,'' Coca-Cola spokesman Ben Deutsch
said.
</P>
<P>
   UPS, however, declined to commit beyond Sydney, saying a
decision would be made later this year, though the company
expressed a willingness to keep an open mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I think it's going to come out better,'' spokeswoman
Susan Rosenberg said. ``It has forced everybody to go back in and
do some analysis and close scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``For better or worse, it may be held up to higher standards,
and now they are going to enforce and clarify what those standards
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, a McDonald's representative said late last week that
the global fast-food giant had no plans to curtail its involvement
with the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, these are very different times for the Lords of the
Rings, who suddenly find themselves dragged out from under the
table, their activities exposed to the harsh light of day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the sponsors and public opinion are waiting for the
reaction of the IOC, how we can clean our house,'' Samaranch said.
``The reaction will be on the 24th.''
</P>
<P>
   The repercussions, most likely, will last far beyond.

Barkley likes Rockets plus star
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Free agent Charles Barkley said Saturday that the Rockets remained
his first choice as the team for which to play _ if Houston lands a
free agent who will help it win this season.
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen and Antonio McDyess, two of the highest-profile
free agents on the market, are said to be considering signing with
the Rockets. And should one do so, Barkley said he wouldn't be far
behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston is No. 1 in my heart,'' said Barkley, who is in Las
Vegas for the Mike Tyson fight. ``Houston is still No. 1, and they
will always be No. 1. But I think they're handicapped right now.
They have to sign Antonio McDyess or Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I'm just hanging back, seeing what happens. If I
leave Houston, then I'm going to meet with the stars on every team
(with which he's considering signing). I want to see what their
thinking is and what their goals are for the season. All good free
agents shop around, don't they?''
</P>
<P>
   And several teams have Barkley on their shopping lists. The
rumor mill had Barkley visiting New York this weekend, but Barkley
said he had no plans to meet with the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Seattle SuperSonics appear to have the inside track
should Barkley decide against re-signing with the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Westphal, Barkley's former coach in Phoenix, took over the
Sonics this season, and joining Barkley in Las Vegas were Seattle
stars Vin Baker and Gary Payton.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is interesting to me,'' Barkley said, ``They called,
but I told them that while I'm interested, I'm not going to talk
just yet. I think I'm going to wait and see what everyone does (in
the free-agent market). Maybe we'll talk next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'd say that right now, Seattle is very interesting to me.
Paul Westphal is one (reason), but Seattle is a darned good team _
they have very good players there. I could see myself fitting in
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially because Barkley said he didn't care what role he
played with the Sonics, or how much money he's paid.
</P>
<P>
   After recovering from offseason surgeries to repair a double
hernia and a torn right triceps tendon, Barkley said he just wants
to go someplace where he could help a team win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could start, or I could be the sixth man, whatever,'' he
said. ``I really don't care. I just want to be a contributor on a
winning team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money? I don't care about that, either. I'd play for one
of the (salary-cap) exceptions _ whatever. I just want to go to a
good team, and Seattle looks like a really good team. They have a
lot of talent.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barkley, 35, said he wouldn't call his Las Vegas jaunt a
recruiting trip for the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   ``A recruiting trip, is that what you'd call it?,'' said Barkley
of his time with Payton and Baker. ``No, this is more just good
friends who want to meet face-to-face.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets remain No. 1 _ if they get a player such as
Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what, should they sign Pippen, that would change
my whole realm of thinking,'' Barkley said. ``But I don't think I'm
going to talk to anybody just yet. Like I said, I'm going to stay
out and see what happens. As for the Rockets, I really believe that
Scottie Pippen and Antonio McDyess are holding all the cards right
now. Let's see how they play them.''

Rockets' free-agent pursuit depends on crucial signing
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; PriceBy JONATHAN FEIGEN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Saturday, Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich and his staff handed out
tickets to the season's first preseason game, next Saturday night.
Now he and Rockets officials have less than a week to make sure
they will not have to play in it.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets claim just three healthy players and three draft
picks, and their pursuit of free agents that would allow them to
play full-court basketball against the Spurs is on hold until the
NBA's new collective-bargaining agreement is sealed, likely
Tuesday. That would allow the Rockets to bring in, they hope, Suns
free agent Antonio McDyess or Bulls free agent Scottie Pippen and
then let the chain reaction begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get excited about all the names and having them a part of
the team,'' said Brent Price, one of the three healthy Rockets
under contract. ``If you're talking Pippen vs. McDyess, they're
different players that bring different qualities to the team.
Pippen offensively and defensively can do it all. He's got
experience. He knows what it takes to win a championship. And
McDyess as far as talent goes, there's explosion, shot-blocking and
scoring ability. And to put him side by side with Hakeem (Olajuwon)
is a very exciting possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always exciting when there's free agents moving. It's
exciting to me to see who I'm playing with and exactly who's going
to be on the court. It's going to be chaotic at first. But things
will settle down and we'll get back to real competition out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the competition is to get the players to put on the
court. McDyess' agent, Tony Dutt, said McDyess remains undecided.
Pippen has made it clear he would like to play for the Rockets. But
he might receive contract offers larger than the Rockets could put
together, if the Bulls can reach a deal to sign him and then trade
him to a team that could pay more than the roughly $9 million of
cap space the Rockets have available.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rockets have always shown the desire to win a
championship,'' Rockets free agent Eddie Johnson said. ``They won
two when (Michael) Jordan was out and they've always shown desire
to put a team on the floor that can win the championship. I like
that, especially as an older player. Free agents like that also.''
</P>
<P>
   Until one of the two targeted free agents signs somewhere,
everything is on hold. But if Pippen or McDyess ends up playing for
the Rockets, the rest of this season's roster likely will come from
the rookies and last season's roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say for sure, but it sure looks like it,'' Tomjanovich
said. ``But you could get a free agent for those minimums.''
</P>
<P>
   While Rockets management awaits answers, here's a look at the
players waiting to cut deals.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Barkley _ Asked this week where he would play this
season, Barkley did not hesitate to divulge his plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Palm Springs,'' he said. But beyond the Pro-Am of the Bob Hope
Desert Classic remains uncertain. Even when Barkley will confirm
plans beyond this week's golf game with a former player named
Jordan is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley has made it clear he would like to return to the Rockets
_ under the right conditions. The contract is not one of the
conditions, giving the Rockets room to sign McDyess or Pippen and
still bring back Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, 35, has said he would play for the minimum, for a team
that could chase a championship, and with Pippen or McDyess the
Rockets would qualify. Without one of the free-agent stars, Barkley
likely would consider Seattle a more viable contender, and he still
could consider New York and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't made a decision,'' Barkley said. ``I want to sit
down and talk to the six teams (that have shown interest in him).
I'm going to sit back and be patient. I'm not in a hurry. I'll make
my decision when everybody (decides).''
</P>
<P>
   Othella Harrington _ Harrington has made it clear he would like
to remain in Houston, even if it means competing in a frontcourt
crowded with McDyess and Barkley for playing time. But Harrington
likely will draw interest that could pay at least as much and
possibly offer more of what he truly seeks _ playing time.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington has said he is ready to compete for playing time, but
might have to choose between the Rockets' potentially crowded
frontcourt and a clearer shot at an increased role.
</P>
<P>
   He will have at least some time to play the field and get a
clearer idea of where he fits. Harrington likely would fit in the
Rockets' plans as a salary-cap exception, and as such sign after
the Rockets have filled the $30 million of cap money. But time will
move far faster when contracts may be signed than in the wait since
the lockout ended.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Maloney _ The Rockets would like to have Maloney back and
he could return. But the backcourt would be crowded with point
guards, with Price and rookie Bryce Drew in place.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Cuttino Mobley, a natural shooting guard, might be ready
to help at the position, especially defensively. And if the Rockets
sign Pippen, Mobley would have help running the offense if he is
needed in spot duty at the point, making the position deep.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Rockets, the Magic and Bucks have shown the most
interest in Maloney. But Maloney has started the past two seasons
for the Rockets, and the Rockets will try to bring him back,
especially once the other pieces are in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Matt would like to stay,'' said Maloney's agent,
Keith Glass. ``We have to check everything out we can. There is
some interest in Matt. The Rockets are certainly interested. I know
they're involved in some other things. I'm thrilled with interest
in Matt. We didn't know how it would be, but I'm absolutely
thrilled. We would like to stay in Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Bullard _ The Pistons and Magic are interested, but Bullard
wants to be back in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the luxury of being a free agent, you can field other
offers,'' Bullard said. ``But the best situation for me is here.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Bullard's agent, Herb Rudoy: ``His instruction to me is to
try to get it worked out. He loves being there, loves Rudy and
wants to stay. (Rockets vice president Carroll Dawson) and I are
going to talk about it. Whatever they want, we're going to be
cooperative.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets want his shot, especially in the frontcourt. With
Pippen, Bullard likely would find more open shots. With McDyess, he
would help prevent teams from helping too much on McDyess and
Olajuwon inside.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Johnson _ The phone in Johnson's agent's office has not
been ringing off the hook. But Johnson does not seem to mind. He
said he wants to be back in Houston and the Rockets have indicated
they want him back.
</P>
<P>
   As a 10-year veteran, he would receive the $1 million minimum,
but under the new league agreement would cost $500,000 of cap
space.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get to 39, you're not surprised when teams are not
calling, age is such a taboo in sports,'' Johnson said. ``Teams
recognize I've been able to overcome that age tag. I still have the
ability to make a difference. There is some interest, of course,
but my goal all along has been to come back to Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   Mario Elie _ The Rockets have spoken to Elie's agent and Elie
would come back for the right offer. But he will not wait for the
Rockets to work through their other free-agent issues. If a team
offers what he wants most _ a chance at another championship and a
multiyear contract _ he said he would jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a preference,'' Elie said. ``I just want the best
situation whether it is here or elsewhere. I'm happy. The phone has
been ringing. I still want to win. I want to finish my career on a
winning note.''
</P>
<P>
   That probably will not be in Houston. Elie said that at least
eight teams have shown interest. San Antonio could be the favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Stephens _ Regardless of which ``impact'' free agent the
Rockets bring in, they likely will make some changes in the offense
to create more movement and penetration. But they will not change
enough for Stephens to fit as easily as other free agents from last
season's roster, or that might come in at the minimum. An
outstanding one-on-one talent, Stephens could get a shot from a
more one-on-one oriented team.
</P>
<P>
   Emanual Davis, Serge Zwikker _ Davis and Zwikker will spend the
season in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Clyde Drexler _ Whereabouts unknown.

STANFORD TOO MUCH FOR UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With five minutes remaining, the game ended and
the clinic began.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford did all the teaching.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA challenged the Cardinal in a way it had not been challenged
in Pac-10 play. But even the Bruins' best effort, on their home
floor, with a rowdy crowd, was not enough. Stanford broke open a
close game and defeated UCLA 72-59 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Leading 54-53 with 5:31 remaining _ and with UCLA's most
effective player, center Dan Gadzuric, on the bench with five fouls
_ the Cardinal shifted into a dimension of poise and precision the
baby Bruins simply do not possess.
</P>
<P>
   A 10-0 surge later, the No.4 Cardinal was in total command,
leading 64-53 and cruising to its 11th consecutive victory. The
game ended with a frustration foul by Baron Davis (on Stanford
guard Art Lee) and objects being hurling onto the court from the
UCLA student section.
</P>
<P>
   But for 35 minutes, it was a riveting duel of tactics and
talent, structure and spirit. The dominant theme was Stanford's
smothering defense. Acutely aware of Davis' every move, the
Cardinal dropped four players into the paint at the slightest hint
of penetration. It smothered UCLA's greatest weapon and forced the
Bruins into perimeter shots and wild attempts from the low post.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, UCLA played defense with the same energy it used to
confound Arizona and Cal _ except Stanford operates on a higher
level. When the Bruins overplayed in the low post, attempting to
cut off entry passes to Mark Madsen and Tim Young, the Cardinal
countered with lob passes to open space under the basket.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were most effective when harassing Lee and Kris
Weems, thereby throttling the Cardinal offense at its origin. The
Bruins challenged every pass and contested every rebound _
something woefully lacking in previous matchups with Stanford. It
was by far UCLA's best defensive performance of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not nearly enough. The Bruins lost Gadzuric (who had
a team-high 15 points) to fouls with just under seven minutes
remaining, and their energy seemed to depart with him. Freshman
Jerome Moiso was in foul trouble throughout and mostly ineffective,
leaving the Bruins outmanned underneath.
</P>
<P>
   The margin would have been greater, except Stanford made just 32
of 49 free throws. UCLA was 6 of 15 from the line.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in styles matched the difference in preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford held a 90-minute practice Friday at Pauley Pavilion
that emphasized tactics. It reviewed a plethora of set plays,
adjusting here and there to counteract UCLA's tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Cardinal practiced its man-to-man and zone defenses
with an ongoing dissertation by coach Mike Montgomery. His theme:
Limit the Bruins' offensive rebounding, don't gamble for passes or
position and force them to make difficult shots.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours after Stanford departed, UCLA arrived. The Bruins shot
free throws for 45 minutes, watched videotape for 30 minutes and
disbanded.
</P>
<P>
   It was a typical Friday, especially following a victory; because
the Bruins rely heavily on transition and athleticism, coach Steve
Lavin keeps their legs as fresh as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But he had seen enough from his players _ both this week and
this season _ to take a tempered optimism with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team does tend to step up to challenges,'' Lavin said.
``You saw it the way they responded to Kentucky, against Oregon,
Cal, Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford is unique in its precision and balance, however. In
Pac-10 play, every starter averages double figures. Collapse on the
big men, and the guards beat you. Pressure the guards, and the big
guys get busy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't pick your poison,'' Lavin said. ``You have to match
them (begin ital)mano-a-mano(end ital) and play 40 minutes of
hard-nosed basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that, for sure. Stanford controlled the tempo from the
opening tip, jumping to a 9-4 lead and drawing two quick fouls on
Gadzuric and Moiso. Lavin removed them immediately, guessing
correctly that the Bruins could stay in striking range with a small
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Gadzuric and Moiso were back on the court when the second half
began, and Gadzuric made three early baskets _ including a
ferocious dunk _ to jump-start UCLA's attack.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to contain UCLA's quickness, Stanford switched to a zone
defense midway through the half. It worked as designed, sending
UCLA's offense into instant stagnation. The Bruins scored once in
eight possessions as Stanford reclaimed the lead and rolled to
victory.

KINGS LIFELESS IN DEFEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Looking ahead to the upcoming All-Star
break, the Kings set a goal of winning their last few games before
the hiatus, all at home, to position themselves for a strong run to
a playoff berth in the season's final two-plus months.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it sounded like a good idea, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Jaromir Jagr and the Pittsburgh Penguins took full
advantage of a flat Kings team Saturday night, recording a 5-1
victory before a crowd of 16,005 at the Forum. The score would have
been worse for the Kings, but two near-goals by the Penguins were
disallowed by the video goal judge.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings rewarded their fourth sellout crowd with one of their
most lifeless performances of the season, strange considering
they'd played only once in the previous four nights and the
Penguins had played the night before, losing in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   But Kings coach Larry Robinson had been wary of the Penguins
precisely because they had lost the night before, and he told his
players exactly that at the end of Saturday morning's practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `We've got to be ready for tonight, this team is
going to come and come hard,''' defenseman Mattias Norstrom said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kings _ playing without defenseman Steve Duchesne,
sidelined with back spasms and listed as day to day _ failed to
heed Robinson's warning.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings (16-23-4) were a collective no-show against the
Penguins (20-12-7), who have spent this season seemingly oblivious
to the potential distraction of seeing their franchise sink into
bankruptcy. The Penguins, who lost to the Kings in Pittsburgh by a
3-0 margin in December, won this game largely on the strength of
special teams, scoring two power-play goals and a shorthanded goal.
</P>
<P>
   The shorthanded score, by Ian Moran, was one Kings goalie Jamie
Storr would have liked to have had back, and it was the goal that
gave the Penguins a 1-0 lead 10:39 into the game. Moran beat Storr
between the pads with a seemingly harmless 40-foot slap shot from
the right boards.
</P>
<P>
   Just 51 seconds later, Jagr skated around Donald Audette at the
blue line, then stickhandled past Rob Blake and flipped the puck
past Storr, giving the Penguins two goals on their first three
shots of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Things only got worse in the second period, after Blake was sent
off for a high-sticking penalty at 6:36. The Penguins capitalized
on the subsequent power play, with Alexei Kovalev carrying the puck
from the right point to behind the Kings' net, then centering to
former King Robert Lang for an easy one-timer that was his 18th
goal this season.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the Penguins were content to protect their lead,
and the Kings were extremely cooperative, failing to muster a shot
in the second period until a 60-footer by Yanic Perreault at the
9:27 mark. In fact, the Kings managed only six shots at Penguins
goalie Tom Barrasso in the game's first 32 minutes, and the teams
combined for only 35 shots on goal in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings gained a minimal amount of life with 5:11 left in the
second period when Garry Galley scored his first goal this season,
a slap shot from the top of the right faceoff circle with the Kings
on a power play.
</P>
<P>
   But 2:19 later, the Kings got caught deep in the attacking zone,
allowing a 2-on-1 rush to the Penguins. Dan Kesa, covered by Doug
Bodger, passed across to Jan Hrdina, who was unchecked by Sean
O'Donnell. Hrdina redirected Kesa's pass into a wide-open net,
blunting the Kings' comeback hopes.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins had blown third-period leads and suffered defeats
in their previous two games, ending their 47-0-6 streak when
leading after two periods under coach Kevin Constantine. But there
would be no collapse on this night, with Kevin Hatcher padding
Pittsburgh's margin with a power-play goal early in the third
period.

TYSON SLUGGISH IN VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Mike Tyson is oh-so-lucky that power is the last
thing to go.
</P>
<P>
   Francois Botha, a relatively obscure fighter from South Africa,
was poised to do the impossible Saturday at the MGM Grand. For
four-plus rounds, he had Tyson where he wanted him: frustrated,
confused and behind on the score cards.
</P>
<P>
   And then, as if the boxing gods weren't quite ready to say
goodbye to Iron Mike, the former two-time champion fired a straight
right into the willing chin of a brave opponent with seconds left
in the fifth round and that was that.
</P>
<P>
   Botha was able to stagger to his feet but it was too late: He'd
been counted out by referee Richard Steele one second before the
end of the round.
</P>
<P>
   Instantly, Botha's opportunity to make history and the prospect
of a fascinating final seven rounds had vanished.
</P>
<P>
   The punch was vintage Tyson (46-3, with 40 knockouts). He had
his entire 223 pounds behind it and Botha (39-1, 24 KOs) obliged by
meeting it while moving forward _ an unpleasant combination for the
person on the receiving end.
</P>
<P>
   The near-full house of roughly 12,519, who paid to see either
such or Tyson snap as he did when he bit Evander Holyfield's ears
in his last fight 19 months ago, loved it. They cheered wildly when
it happened and oohed and aahed every time the replay was shown on
the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   However, that's about all they had to cheer about in regard to
Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   He was admittedly rusty as the result of the layoff, but his
skills may have also eroded dramatically. That, and Botha's
strategy, had those at the MGM thinking the unthinkable for a good
20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson cited the layoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tremendous amount of rust,'' he said. ``I told my trainer,
`Don't worry, I'll catch him late, I'll catch him late.'
(Cornerman) Stacey (McKinley) and those guys got a little excited,
but I was OK.''
</P>
<P>
   At the opening bell, Tyson did the things he supposedly learned
from new trainer Tommy Brooks: He jabbed and moved his head as he
had early in his career.
</P>
<P>
   That lasted all of a half round as Botha, who weighed a pudgy
233 pounds, began to frustrate the 7-1 favorite with a shockingly
effective game plan. Simply, he kept his distance from Tyson's
bombs and held him when danger seemed to be approaching. At the
same time, he repeatedly found the opportunity to throw effective
combinations.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, who became a stationary target and threw single punches
ala the two Holyfield fights, was so frustrated he locked Botha's
left arm under his own at the end of the round and wouldn't let go.
Steele attempted to separate the two but couldn't get it done,
which set off a brief melee in the ring that for a moment had
everyone thinking the same thing: Tyson didn't lose it again, did
he?
</P>
<P>
   He lost a point in the second round when he hit Botha in the
face with a forearm after the bell. But, beyond that, he behaved.
</P>
<P>
   He was losing the fight, though.
</P>
<P>
   Botha baffled Tyson with his tactics throughout and seemed to
gain confidence with every round. He talked to Tyson in an attempt
to unnerve him whenever the two clinched, he smiled repeatedly and
even taunted the once-awesome champion late in the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Botha appeared to gain even more ill-advised
bravado. He engaged Tyson in two brief toe-to-toe exchanges early
in the round and survived.
</P>
<P>
   And then his luck ran out. Tyson was bound to land a big shot
and finally he did late in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Botha fell to his side. He attempted to rise but fell on his
face. He tried it again with the same result before finally finding
his way to his feet. At that moment, Steele waved him off and he
staggered backward into the ropes _ clearly unable to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was winning,'' Botha said. ``Oh, what a fighter (Tyson). Oh
my, what a dummy (himself). I was going to beat him.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson touched off another little incident when he rushed toward
Botha. It seemed clear that he had good intentions, though: He
wanted to hold up his beaten opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately afterward, Tyson showed unusual class. He hugged
Botha warmly and congratulated him on a good effort _ an effort
that was better than his in all but one way.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Tyson seemed to have neither the fury one might expect
after waiting so long to begin his second comeback nor the skills
his fans somehow still expect from him. He looked powerful but
otherwise ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is to have him fight again in April and again a few
months later _ against, possibly, Axel Schulz and Vaughn Bean _ and
then face Holyfield for the third time.
</P>
<P>
   If this Tyson shows up to face his nemesis, have pity on him: He
likely will be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to fight, I need to put on better shows,'' Tyson said.
``I'm not looking to jump into the mix real quick. I need to do one
step at a time, go back to the gym and start working right away.''
</P>
<P>
   In other bouts, Goyo Vargas (39-6-1, 28 KOs) survived a 12-round
knockdown to outpoint Ben Tackie (18-1, 11 KOs) in a 12-round
lightweight bout.
</P>
<P>
   Zab Judah (19-0, 14 KOs) stopped Wilfredo Negron (17-4, 14 KOs)
at 1:44 of the fourth round of a scheduled 12-round junior
welterweight fight.
</P>
<P>
   Judah will next fight Vince Phillips for the title.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Whitaker (18-0, 16 KOs) defeated Alex Stewart (43-9, 40
KOs) when the scheduled 10-round heavyweight fight was stopped
because of a cut under Stewart's right eye.

ONE PUNCH LIFTS TYSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS---With one thundering right hand taken out of mothball
from the late 1980s, Mike Tyson stormed dramatically back into the
fistic limelight Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   It landed flush on the jaw of Francois Botha, who was counted
out at 2:59 of the fifth by referee Dick Steele, as Botha
floundered haplessly on the mat.
</P>
<P>
   But for a frenzied time in this brief but interesting match at
the MGM Grand Garden, it seemed as though Mike Tyson once again had
come unraveled and would face the prospect of yet another shameful
disqualification.
</P>
<P>
   There he after the first round had ended throwing wild punches
at Botha, who was throwing wild punches right back at Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   It was a riotous scene, as the referee, Dick Steele, was unable
to halt the hostilities and as both fighters' cornermen rushed in
to separate the enraged combatants.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the two men were escorted back to their corners, as
phalanx of armed Las Vegas police stood around the ring to make
sure law and order would prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Between rounds, the chairman of the Nevada State Athletic
commission, Mark Ratner, got into the ring and spoke to Steele.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to make sure everything was under control,''
said Ratner later.
</P>
<P>
   It was, although Steele would deduct a point from Tyson in the
second round for throwing an illegal punch (his elbow, a familiar
Tyson tactic).
</P>
<P>
   After that, things settled down and, incredibly, Francois Botha,
a 30-year-old, 6-2, 233-pounder from South Africa, was the fellow
doing all the trashing talking, as well as a lot of the heavy
punching.
</P>
<P>
   This was no waltz for Tyson, who up until his climatic punch
showed the rust of his 18-month suspension from the Evander
Holyfield folly.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, weighing a hefty 223, was slow and sluggish against his
similarly slow-motion opponent, who fought smartly, tying up Tyson
inside and keeping him off balance with left jabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just took me a little time to get going,'' said Tyson.
``But I knew I'd get him. Everyone was worried, but I wasn't. I'm a
warrior. I knew I'd get him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I say?'' said Botha. ``Tyson just caught me. I got
careless.''
</P>
<P>
   Up until that moment when Tyson caught Botha with the kind of
terrifying, wicked punch that left people like Michael Spinks and
Trevor Berbick and Larry Holmes and many others unconscious back in
the 1980s when Tyson was earning his fearsome reputation, Botha was
performing exceptionally.
</P>
<P>
   He clipped Tyson several times with a straight right hands, and
kept avoiding Tyson's lunging left hooks and right hands.
</P>
<P>
   I actually had Botha ahead by a point when the end came and when
the crowd erupted with loud cheers, the loudest being from Shelly
Finkel, Dan Goossen and all the other new members of Team Tyson who
would have lost a ton of future profits had Tyson been upset.
</P>
<P>
   Botha actually taunted Tyson throughout the fight, constantly
talking to him and even mocking him with theatrical facial
expressions.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to most pre-fight analysis, Botha wasn't a bum.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't scared one bit of Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Tyson wasn't scared of him, either, but for almost
five minutes he certainly didn't faintly resemble the fighter who
once was so intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for a time, it seemed as though the impossible might
happen.
</P>
<P>
   But Mike Tyson still can hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't see the punch coming,'' said Botha. ``I've never
been hit that hard before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just caught him good,'' said Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   He did.
</P>
<P>
   Still, until that moment, he was quite ordinary against an
ordinary fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyson still has a lot of prove if he's to become the
heavyweight champion again.
</P>
<P>
   He won't have the luxury of fighting a Francois Botha if he
wants to reach such a goal.

TROJANS FALL INTO DEEPER HOLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Pacific-10 season is barely one-third
completed, but USC appears finished.
</P>
<P>
   At least when you consider the lofty goals the Trojans
entertained as far back as, oh, Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   USC's chances of making the NCAA Tournament seem about as good
as one of its guards making a 3-point shot these days.
</P>
<P>
   A dire assessment? Perhaps, but that's where USC finds itself
following a lethargic 89-75 loss to California before 5,112 at the
Sports Arena on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   After just six conference games, the Trojans have a few
unflattering facts to ponder.
</P>
<P>
   _They were swept by the Bay Area schools on their homecourt.
</P>
<P>
   _They have lost three straight games and four of their past
five.
</P>
<P>
   _They are 1-3 at the Sports Arena in Pac-10 play.
</P>
<P>
   _The starting guards have shot 4 for 26 the past two games.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, USC coach Henry Bibby was asked how his weekend was
going.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not over yet, OK?'' Bibby said, alluding to the fact the
Trojans play 10th-ranked UCLA on Wednesday. ``We sure have to play
better than we did (against Cal) or it's going to be
embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans (10-5, 2-4) are in the midst of what players deemed
a make-or-break three-game homestand, and are currently 0-2 after
double-digit losses to Stanford and Cal (11-4, 2-3).
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look good,'' Bibby said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe all our games are must-win,'' center Brian
Scalabrine added. ``We're two games below .500. It's kind of
amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   The culprits against Cal were two chronic problems the Trojans
have battled recently: poor outside shooting and porous inside
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Even armed with the information that Cal was without 7-foot
center Francisco Elson, who suffered a concussion Thursday night
against UCLA, USC couldn't handle the Bears under the basket.
</P>
<P>
   Cal forwards Carl Boyd and Michael Gill each had 17 points,
which was a career-high for Boyd. That's worse than it sounds,
because Boyd averages just 6.4 points per game while Gill averages
9.0.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't stop those guys,'' Bibby said. ``That's what hurt
us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't respond to too much tonight. We didn't play any
defense. They scored any time they wanted to. They beat us on the
boards.''
</P>
<P>
   It was probably an ominous sign that Cal jumped out to a 7-0
lead, but the Trojans battled back and actually led 32-29 with 1:20
left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Trojans went to sleep. Boyd stole a ball and drove for
a layup, forward Sean Lampley scored a layup and guard Thomas
Kilgore sank a jump shot at the buzzer to give the Bears a 35-32
halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was the key to the game,'' Bibby said. ``Two
layups and a jump shot. That was a momentum swing.''
</P>
<P>
   USC was still in a slumber to start the second half, as the
Bears started with an 18-6 run that extended their lead to 53-38
with 14:21 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we should be coming out with more intensity,'' said
forward Greg Lakey, who had a career-high 17 points and eight
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   This loss was often uglier than Thursday's 72-55 loss to
Stanford, which at least is ranked fourth in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a lack of desire,'' Bibby said. ``We're
playing some pretty good teams. We're a young basketball team.
We're starting (first-year players) Brandon Granville, Sam Clancy
and Brian Scalabrine. We're playing against good, veteran teams.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans have been hurt by the sudden disappearance of their
offense. They made three of 19 shots from 3-point range, and went 0
for 9 in the second half. Starting guards Granville and Elias Ayuso
were 2 for 14 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem like our wide-open jumpers are falling,''
Scalabrine said. ``I just know it's a lot harder to get a wide-open
look than it was five games ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans are now forced to regroup, with UCLA ahead, and
seven road games still remaining on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cal is 2-3. It's not like it's a runaway yet,'' Bibby said.
``It's not too far away yet. There is some life and we can be in
the hunt but we've got to go get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: USC yell leader Ruben Rodriguez suffered a possible
broken wrist early in the second half after he fell awkwardly while
attempting a slam dunk during a timeout.... The Trojans drew their
second-straight crowd of more than 5,000.... USC guard Quincy
Wilder had a career-high 18 points.

TYSON SHAKES OFF RUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Mike Tyson wasn't Mike Tyson Saturday night but
fortunately he didn't have to be because Francois Botha couldn't
help being Francois Botha.
</P>
<P>
   After four rounds, the South African heavyweight seemed to have
the clearly rusty Tyson frustrated and befuddled but his growing
confidence fatally turned to overconfidence three minutes later and
when it did, Tyson turned over a straight right hand and the next
thing Botha was doing was turning over on his back.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson looked out of sync and lacking in the kind of punching
power and speed that had always been his trademarks, until Botha
stood right in front of him late in the fifth round and tried to
land a slow, wide right to the face of the two-time heavyweight
champion.
</P>
<P>
   As Botha's right shoulder moved, Tyson reacted, countering what
he knew was coming with a straight right hand of his own that
landed square in the middle of Botha's face before Botha's right
ever got near Tyson. Botha collapsed in a heap of broken flesh,
like a folding chair.
</P>
<P>
   Botha's eyes rolled up in his head and a vacant look came over
him as he lay on the floor, first on his backside and then
tottering forward as if he was going to use his face for support.
Three times he struggled to get up and three times he fell back,
his legs unable to support him, his mind clouded by the sound of
Chinese chimes ringing in his head.
</P>
<P>
   As referee Richard Steele reached 10 at 2:59 of the round, Botha
finally got up on legs that had been knocked stiff and he staggered
backward, slumping into the ropes. Those four strands of red were
all that were keeping him upright, but he slumped back down toward
the floor anyway and Tyson rushed in and tried to pull him back up,
knowing what had been a nasty affair was suddenly over.
</P>
<P>
   By that juncture, Botha had won all four rounds on the cards of
judges Dalby Shirley and Dave Moretti and was leading, 39-36, on
that of Bill Graham, growing confident enough in his dominance that
he several times stood with both hands down, taunting Tyson minutes
before he found himself wondering why it had suddenly gotten so
dark at the MGM Grand Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I was trying to bait him,'' said Botha. ``I just walked
into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Up to that point, Tyson had looked like a guy who hadn't fought
in 19 months, which was exactly what he was. He at times looked
like a shot fighter, winging wild punches, flying off balance, and
getting drilled by some solid right hands and combinations from an
opponent whose hand speed was far slower than Tyson's but not so
slow that Tyson could avoid his fists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a tremendous amount of rust,'' said Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, at one point late in the fourth round, Botha shoeshined
Tyson, winging punches with both hands off his sides as Tyson bent
over and covered up. When he did, the crowd could be heard
laughing, an emotion usually reserved for Tyson's cowering
opponents in the past.
</P>
<P>
   But this was no longer the feared Tyson of old. The two beatings
from Evander Holyfield have taken much of that bullying mystique
away from him and now every fight is just that, a fight.
</P>
<P>
   This makes life difficult for a little man like Tyson, who is
small by heavyweight standards. It doesn't mean he can't win, as he
showed Saturday night, but it does mean he'll now have to fight to
do.
</P>
<P>
   Botha (39-2) came in at a portly 233, nearly 10 pounds heavier
than he had been for his two best fights, a win over Axel Schulz
for the International Boxing Federation title several years ago and
a 12th-round loss at the hands of Michael Moorer in his next
outing. Why he did that was difficult to fathom since his ability
to move in the early rounds seemed central to any chance he had at
victory but perhaps he had his own plan afoot.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson had come in at a career-high 223 but carried the weight
far differently, his body taut and without a hint of fat while
Botha was loose around the belly and seemed even more flacid as
they pushed him into the ring after his long, lonely walk from his
locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Botha looked tense as he shrugged off the white buffalo hide he
had worn into the ring but so did Tyson, who came in wearing a
black T-shirt that read ``Be Real,'' black trunks, and a black
kufi, a Muslim prayer cap.
</P>
<P>
   As the national anthem was being performed, Panama Lewis,
Botha's banned trainer, tried to make his way to ringside, from
where his instructions could be heard by Botha in his corner but he
was blocked by several members of the Nevada State Athletic
Commission and Botha was left to his own devices.
</P>
<P>
   As Botha stood at his corner pacing slowly, Tyson went to a
neutral corner and prayed silently, his gloved fists held to the
sky as Botha was being introduced. Less than three minutes later,
the fight was on and three minutes after that there was nearly a
second straight riot at a Tyson fight at the MGM when both boxers
were wrestling as the round ended and Tyson appeared to try to snap
Botha's arm in a clinch.
</P>
<P>
   As he did, Botha screamed and Tyson put his left forearm in his
face as Steele tried to figure out what to do. Not content to wait
for justice, Botha then rifled a punch after the bell off Tyson's
head and both sets of cornermen poured into the ring to separate
them as a wall of security guards rushed the ring.
</P>
<P>
   When order was restored, the second round began with a wild-eyed
Tyson whistling wild, amateurish punches that didn't land, while
Botha occasionally landed some solid shots. More and more the two
began to wrestle again in the clinches until Tyson tried to push
Botha in the face with an open glove and Steele took a point away.
</P>
<P>
   Botha later admitted he had hoped to goad Tyson into just such
an incident and he succeeded as Tyson's self-control seemed to be
nonexistent at that point.
</P>
<P>
   In the third round, Botha began to open up and scored with some
powerful right hands to the head as Tyson looked lost, although not
hurt. By then Tyson's right eye had begun to puff slightly and the
crowd seemed stunned.
</P>
<P>
   Botha finally landed a big right hand to the head early in Round
4 but Tyson kept coming forward, looking to land one of those
powerful combinations that remained dangerous. It was at that
juncture that Botha began to clown, dropping his hands and staring
at an opponent unsure of just what to do.
</P>
<P>
   When he did, his demise had begun.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long to unfold.

BAD OUTING HAS BRUINS FIT TO BE TIED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Bruins reached the midpoint of their season
Saturday night and arrived there with one of the worst games
they've played in their three seasons plus on FleetStreet. But one
thing the 27-team NHL affords is the chance to play poorly, even
for two-thirds of the game, and still manage a point, as the Bruins
did in their 2-2 tie against the league-worst Tampa Bay Lightning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we did everything possible not to win it,'' said Bruins
head coach Pat Burns, his club hitting midseason banged up and
struggling in an 0-2-1 mini-tailspin. ``But we tried not to lose
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth was, the Bruins came within a skate-blade of stealing the
victory, turned back by a sensational skate save by former Boston
netminder Bill Ranford with 67 seconds left in overtime. Faced with
an unprotected Sergei Samsonov on his doorstep, Ranford dropped
into one of those Dominik Hasek-like rolls and flips _ kicking up
both legs while on his back _ and turned back Samsonov's backhand
sweep that was labeled for inside the left post.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my arms up,'' said Bruins captain Ray Bourque, his
hoped-for celebration cut short by a fraction of an inch. ``I've
seen Billy make some incredible saves _ and that was another one of
'em.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of the evening, the best goaltending story was in the
Boston net, where Rob Tallas was on his way to running his record
vs. Tampa to 5-0-1. By early in the second period, when the Bolts
held a 1-0 lead, Tallas already had made 24 stops. At the other
end, Ranford had faced but five shots. When Bourque finally hit
Ranford with a long-range slapper for Boston's fourth shot overall,
with 6:00 gone in the second, the sellout crowd of 17,565 offered a
sarcastic jeer. Remember the days when Steve Kasper was leading the
lethargic, veteran-heavy Bruins? It had that feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game should have been over after the first two periods,''
said Tampa coach Jacques Demers. ``But we needed a great save by
our goaltender in overtime, off that little poison.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``little poison'' was Samsonov, and Demers offered the
description only as a compliment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't mean that to insult him,'' he said. ``It's just that
he's a little poison _ he's all over the place. He's a great little
find for Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Pavel Kubina, a 21-year-old defenseman from the Czech Republic,
hasn't been a bad find for the Bolts. With 1:02 gone in the second,
he cracked the blue line, turned Bourque inside out with a fake,
and closed to within 20 feet to beat Tallas with a wrister.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until 8:12 of the second, when Ken Baumgartner did
some old-fashioned pumpkin smashing, that the Bruins finally got
their game going. Baumgartner picked a fight with Tampa's No. 1
whack job, Andrei Nazarov, and The Bomber won quickly with a
righthand jab that bloodied the big Russian's nose. Suddenly, some
shots began to be delivered from Boston's dormant sticks.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's equalizer came off the stick of Jason Allison, who
hadn't scored in a month. Cutting behind the net, left to right, he
curled out from behind the right post and waved a backhander over
the puck. With Darcy Tucker still on has back, and Ranford down,
Allison muscled a blind backhander that sailed high into the net at
19:20. It wasn't out of the skate-and-shoot handbook, but it did
give Allison his third goal in 22 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins appeared to pocket a win at 9:42 of the third when
Rob DiMaio, streaking out of the penalty box, collected a perfect
Dmitri Khristich relay and raced in alone on Ranford. The closest
Bolt was Benoit ``Bye-Bye'' Hogue, left about 15 feet behind in
DiMaio's vapor trail. DiMaio raced in, dropped Ranford with a fake,
and tucked in the backhander for the 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bolts, easily on course to earn the No. 1 draft pick for
the third time in franchise history (now in year No. 8), salvaged
the point when Chris Gratton connected on a wrister from the right
circle. He swooped up from the goal line, turned in the right
faceoff dot, and connected far side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on my post _ I got caught looking to one side,'' said
Tallas, who has played well enough in the first half to split the
job with Dafoe in the second half (we'll see how that plays out).
</P>
<P>
   The point came down to Samsonov vs. Ranford, the L'il Poison
first collecting the puck just a stick length away from the right
post. As he pulled it to his backhand and moved toward the left
post, Ranford put his paddle to the ice and tracked Samsonov as he
made the lateral move. As Samsonov lifted the shot, Ranford was
rolling on his back and lifting his legs, a move that this morning
will have Hasek filing a copyright lawsuit. Skate save.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Sammy had it; I thought it was in,'' said Burns, his
club 19-15-7 and clinging to the last Eastern Conference playoff
spot.

RANFORD RECOVERY SAVES THE DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Bruins had Bill Ranford where they wanted him late
in overtime of Saturday night's game against Tampa Bay at the
FleetCenter. After nearly three hours of play, Boston was on the
verge of the winning score, with Sergei Samsonov skating in alone,
the puck on his stick.
</P>
<P>
   But after Samsonov faked Ranford to the ice and carried the puck
across to the far side of what appeared to be an open net, the
former Bruins goalie somehow cartwheeled a skate in front of
Samsonov's shot, preserving a 2-2 tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucky,'' Ranford said. ``He put a hell of a move on me, and I
was down and out. I threw everything I had at him, and if you give
a guy that much time, a guy with that much skill ...''
</P>
<P>
   Ranford was talking minutes after the game, attempting to
explain how the contest had climaxed _ actually anticlimaxed _ with
one play 3:53 into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done that before _ it's not the first time I've done
that,'' Ranford said. ``It doesn't always work, and it's not
pretty. In fact, it's pretty ugly. It's not like I planned it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had already committed myself and I was dead in the water.
The puck jumped a little bit on him, and he might have lost a
little control.''
</P>
<P>
   The aesthetic qualities of this save might not have met
Ranford's standards. But his sense of drama could not have been
much better. The play made for a disappointing conclusion from the
Bruins' perspective, a heroic ending from Tampa Bay's view. Both
teams displayed resourcefulness, and the Bruins' recovery from a
miserable start appeared sufficient to overtake the Lightning.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had gained momentum and seemed destined to win in
overtime. They had nearly clinched the victory as P.J. Axelsson
draped himself over Ranford after being hooked by Petr Svoboda,
leaving the net open. The Bruins played with a man advantage and,
for part of the power play, a two-stick advantage before Rob
Zamuner cleared with his glove. Even with Tampa Bay at full
strength, the Bruins were in command.
</P>
<P>
   On the key late play, Dmitri Khristich took possession with his
back to the goal just outside the right faceoff circle, then laid
off to Samsonov, who faked to Ranford's left. Ranford went down
with his stick. Then, as Samsonov slipped to the far side, Ranford
rolled onto his back, kicking his legs out and up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried for the corner but he made a good stop,'' Samsonov
said. ``I thought I had him. I tried to shoot up high, but I
couldn't get it up as high as I wanted and it hit his skate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't any time to think about it. I did what I had to
do, and I thought I had him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning must have thought they had the Bruins as well.
Tampa Bay dominated the first period, but a Jason Allison goal with
20 seconds remaining in the second period tied the game and
resuscitated the Bruins. Then, early in the third period, Rob
DiMaio broke in alone on Ranford, who committed and left the far
side open, for the go-ahead goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should easily have won,'' Ranford said. ``We were unlucky
on their first goal, and on the second goal, we've got to be more
aware. They went from being out of the game to being in the game
and leading. We were dominating the first half, but then they took
it to us in the second half of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got their legs and turned it on and fought hard. But we
kept battling to the end, and that is something we haven't been
doing.''

TYSON SHAKES OFF RUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Mike Tyson wasn't Mike Tyson Saturday night but
fortunately he didn't have to be because Francois Botha couldn't
help being Francois Botha.
</P>
<P>
   After four rounds, the South African heavyweight seemed to have
the clearly rusty Tyson frustrated and befuddled but his growing
confidence fatally turned to overconfidence three minutes later and
when it did, Tyson turned over a straight right hand and the next
thing Botha was doing was turning over on his back.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson looked out of sync and lacking in the kind of punching
power and speed that had always been his trademarks, until Botha
stood right in front of him late in the fifth round and tried to
land a slow, wide right to the face of the two-time heavyweight
champion.
</P>
<P>
   As Botha's right shoulder moved, Tyson reacted, countering what
he knew was coming with a straight right hand of his own that
landed square in the middle of Botha's face before Botha's right
ever got near Tyson. Botha collapsed in a heap of broken flesh,
like a folding chair.
</P>
<P>
   Botha's eyes rolled up in his head and a vacant look came over
him as he lay on the floor, first on his backside and then
tottering forward as if he was going to use his face for support.
Three times he struggled to get up and three times he fell back,
his legs unable to support him, his mind clouded by the sound of
Chinese chimes ringing in his head.
</P>
<P>
   As referee Richard Steele reached 10 at 2:59 of the round, Botha
finally got up on legs that had been knocked stiff and he staggered
backward, slumping into the ropes. Those four strands of red were
all that were keeping him upright, but he slumped back down toward
the floor anyway and Tyson rushed in and tried to pull him back up,
knowing what had been a nasty affair was suddenly over.
</P>
<P>
   By that juncture, Botha had won all four rounds on the cards of
judges Dalby Shirley and Dave Moretti and was leading, 39-36, on
that of Bill Graham, growing confident enough in his dominance that
he several times stood with both hands down, taunting Tyson minutes
before he found himself wondering why it had suddenly gotten so
dark at the MGM Grand Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I was trying to bait him,'' said Botha. ``I just walked
into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Up to that point, Tyson had looked like a guy who hadn't fought
in 19 months, which was exactly what he was. He at times looked
like a shot fighter, winging wild punches, flying off balance, and
getting drilled by some solid right hands and combinations from an
opponent whose hand speed was far slower than Tyson's but not so
slow that Tyson could avoid his fists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a tremendous amount of rust,'' said Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, at one point late in the fourth round, Botha shoeshined
Tyson, winging punches with both hands off his sides as Tyson bent
over and covered up. When he did, the crowd could be heard
laughing, an emotion usually reserved for Tyson's cowering
opponents in the past.
</P>
<P>
   But this was no longer the feared Tyson of old. The two beatings
from Evander Holyfield have taken much of that bullying mystique
away from him and now every fight is just that, a fight.
</P>
<P>
   This makes life difficult for a little man like Tyson, who is
small by heavyweight standards. It doesn't mean he can't win, as he
showed Saturday night, but it does mean he'll now have to fight to
do.
</P>
<P>
   Botha (39-2) came in at a portly 233, nearly 10 pounds heavier
than he had been for his two best fights, a win over Axel Schulz
for the International Boxing Federation title several years ago and
a 12th-round loss at the hands of Michael Moorer in his next
outing. Why he did that was difficult to fathom since his ability
to move in the early rounds seemed central to any chance he had at
victory but perhaps he had his own plan afoot.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson had come in at a career-high 223 but carried the weight
far differently, his body taut and without a hint of fat while
Botha was loose around the belly and seemed even more flacid as
they pushed him into the ring after his long, lonely walk from his
locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Botha looked tense as he shrugged off the white buffalo hide he
had worn into the ring but so did Tyson, who came in wearing a
black T-shirt that read ``Be Real,'' black trunks, and a black
kufi, a Muslim prayer cap.
</P>
<P>
   As the national anthem was being performed, Panama Lewis,
Botha's banned trainer, tried to make his way to ringside, from
where his instructions could be heard by Botha in his corner but he
was blocked by several members of the Nevada State Athletic
Commission and Botha was left to his own devices.
</P>
<P>
   As Botha stood at his corner pacing slowly, Tyson went to a
neutral corner and prayed silently, his gloved fists held to the
sky as Botha was being introduced. Less than three minutes later,
the fight was on and three minutes after that there was nearly a
second straight riot at a Tyson fight at the MGM when both boxers
were wrestling as the round ended and Tyson appeared to try to snap
Botha's arm in a clinch.
</P>
<P>
   As he did, Botha screamed and Tyson put his left forearm in his
face as Steele tried to figure out what to do. Not content to wait
for justice, Botha then rifled a punch after the bell off Tyson's
head and both sets of cornermen poured into the ring to separate
them as a wall of security guards rushed the ring.
</P>
<P>
   When order was restored, the second round began with a wild-eyed
Tyson whistling wild, amateurish punches that didn't land, while
Botha occasionally landed some solid shots. More and more the two
began to wrestle again in the clinches until Tyson tried to push
Botha in the face with an open glove and Steele took a point away.
</P>
<P>
   Botha later admitted he had hoped to goad Tyson into just such
an incident and he succeeded as Tyson's self-control seemed to be
nonexistent at that point.
</P>
<P>
   In the third round, Botha began to open up and scored with some
powerful right hands to the head as Tyson looked lost, although not
hurt. By then Tyson's right eye had begun to puff slightly and the
crowd seemed stunned.
</P>
<P>
   Botha finally landed a big right hand to the head early in Round
4 but Tyson kept coming forward, looking to land one of those
powerful combinations that remained dangerous. It was at that
juncture that Botha began to clown, dropping his hands and staring
at an opponent unsure of just what to do.
</P>
<P>
   When he did, his demise had begun.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long to unfold.

BAD OUTING HAS BRUINS FIT TO BE TIED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Bruins reached the midpoint of their season
Saturday night and arrived there with one of the worst games
they've played in their three seasons plus on FleetStreet. But one
thing the 27-team NHL affords is the chance to play poorly, even
for two-thirds of the game, and still manage a point, as the Bruins
did in their 2-2 tie against the league-worst Tampa Bay Lightning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we did everything possible not to win it,'' said Bruins
head coach Pat Burns, his club hitting midseason banged up and
struggling in an 0-2-1 mini-tailspin. ``But we tried not to lose
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth was, the Bruins came within a skate-blade of stealing the
victory, turned back by a sensational skate save by former Boston
netminder Bill Ranford with 67 seconds left in overtime. Faced with
an unprotected Sergei Samsonov on his doorstep, Ranford dropped
into one of those Dominik Hasek-like rolls and flips _ kicking up
both legs while on his back _ and turned back Samsonov's backhand
sweep that was labeled for inside the left post.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my arms up,'' said Bruins captain Ray Bourque, his
hoped-for celebration cut short by a fraction of an inch. ``I've
seen Billy make some incredible saves _ and that was another one of
'em.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of the evening, the best goaltending story was in the
Boston net, where Rob Tallas was on his way to running his record
vs. Tampa to 5-0-1. By early in the second period, when the Bolts
held a 1-0 lead, Tallas already had made 24 stops. At the other
end, Ranford had faced but five shots. When Bourque finally hit
Ranford with a long-range slapper for Boston's fourth shot overall,
with 6:00 gone in the second, the sellout crowd of 17,565 offered a
sarcastic jeer. Remember the days when Steve Kasper was leading the
lethargic, veteran-heavy Bruins? It had that feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game should have been over after the first two periods,''
said Tampa coach Jacques Demers. ``But we needed a great save by
our goaltender in overtime, off that little poison.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``little poison'' was Samsonov, and Demers offered the
description only as a compliment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't mean that to insult him,'' he said. ``It's just that
he's a little poison _ he's all over the place. He's a great little
find for Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Pavel Kubina, a 21-year-old defenseman from the Czech Republic,
hasn't been a bad find for the Bolts. With 1:02 gone in the second,
he cracked the blue line, turned Bourque inside out with a fake,
and closed to within 20 feet to beat Tallas with a wrister.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until 8:12 of the second, when Ken Baumgartner did
some old-fashioned pumpkin smashing, that the Bruins finally got
their game going. Baumgartner picked a fight with Tampa's No. 1
whack job, Andrei Nazarov, and The Bomber won quickly with a
righthand jab that bloodied the big Russian's nose. Suddenly, some
shots began to be delivered from Boston's dormant sticks.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's equalizer came off the stick of Jason Allison, who
hadn't scored in a month. Cutting behind the net, left to right, he
curled out from behind the right post and waved a backhander over
the puck. With Darcy Tucker still on has back, and Ranford down,
Allison muscled a blind backhander that sailed high into the net at
19:20. It wasn't out of the skate-and-shoot handbook, but it did
give Allison his third goal in 22 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins appeared to pocket a win at 9:42 of the third when
Rob DiMaio, streaking out of the penalty box, collected a perfect
Dmitri Khristich relay and raced in alone on Ranford. The closest
Bolt was Benoit ``Bye-Bye'' Hogue, left about 15 feet behind in
DiMaio's vapor trail. DiMaio raced in, dropped Ranford with a fake,
and tucked in the backhander for the 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bolts, easily on course to earn the No. 1 draft pick for
the third time in franchise history (now in year No. 8), salvaged
the point when Chris Gratton connected on a wrister from the right
circle. He swooped up from the goal line, turned in the right
faceoff dot, and connected far side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on my post _ I got caught looking to one side,'' said
Tallas, who has played well enough in the first half to split the
job with Dafoe in the second half (we'll see how that plays out).
</P>
<P>
   The point came down to Samsonov vs. Ranford, the L'il Poison
first collecting the puck just a stick length away from the right
post. As he pulled it to his backhand and moved toward the left
post, Ranford put his paddle to the ice and tracked Samsonov as he
made the lateral move. As Samsonov lifted the shot, Ranford was
rolling on his back and lifting his legs, a move that this morning
will have Hasek filing a copyright lawsuit. Skate save.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Sammy had it; I thought it was in,'' said Burns, his
club 19-15-7 and clinging to the last Eastern Conference playoff
spot.

JAGR TALKS ABOUT DISTRACTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rumors have been around for nearly two years, a combination
of the Pittsburgh Penguins' empty coffers and the empty seats at
most of the Kings' home games.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night was a night the Kings could only wish they'd had
Jaromir Jagr on their side. The Penguins' star scored a dazzling
goal in a 5-1 victory over the Kings, and afterward, he was asked
to address rumors that Pittsburgh's bankruptcy ultimately could
cause him to be sent to a different team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I heard that two years ago,'' Jagr said, referring
to rumors that the Kings tried to purchase his contract in 1997.
``If the owners or the general manager think they have to trade me,
that's their decision. I love to play for Pittsburgh. If they can't
afford me, then I'd love to play in L.A. or New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Penguins' financial woes have been a distraction,
Jagr said, ``I don't really think about it. We're getting paid,
we're getting a paycheck like everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Hit parade (subhed)
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to quantifying Mattias Norstrom's value to the
Kings, statistics aren't much help.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Blake's defense partner has just four points this season,
but according to statistics provided by the National Hockey League,
Norstrom began play Saturday with 115 hits, second to Nashville's
Bob Boughner (119) among defensemen in the league, and fourth among
all players. Detroit's Darren McCarty (136) and New Jersey's Bobby
Holik (131) were Nos. 1 and 2 on the hit parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I realize the role I have on this team,'' Norstrom
said. ``When I play out there, I try to play physical. It's not
like I'm running around looking for hits. But if I can, I try to
take the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time, I'm playing against the top line, the top
players. Hopefully, I can frustrate them by taking the body, and
with that come the hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the physical toll to himself from delivering so many
hits, Norstrom said, ``Actually, halfway through the season, I feel
surprisingly fresh. Knock on wood, I've been pretty healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his negligible offensive statistics, which don't tell the
story of his worth to the Kings, Norstrom said, ``For me, ever
since I've been here and even in Sweden, I've been a stay-at-home
defenseman. If the team has success, I have success. It's great to
score goals. But it's not something I miss.''
</P>
<P>
   One who got away (subhed)
</P>
<P>
   During the 1993-94 season, center Robert Lang, then of the
Kings, went on an end-to-end rush and tucked the puck into the net
against the New York Rangers for his first NHL goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were predicting big things for the Czech native, who
had been their seventh-round choice in the 1990 draft, but things
never worked out for him in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1996-97 season, Lang was back playing in his native land,
but last season, he returned to the NHL, first in Boston, then in
Pittsburgh, with a stop in between to win a gold medal for the
Czech Republic at the Winter Olympics in Nagano.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the 28-year-old Lang is the Penguins' third-leading
scorer, and scored his 18th goal Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always been a good player,'' Blake said. ``They really
didn't give him a chance here. He wasn't playing a lot of minutes,
wasn't playing on the power play. He's very talented. He played on
the fourth line here. Back then, our fourth line probably couldn't
have played in the minors.''
</P>
<P>
   Loose pucks (subhed)
</P>
<P>
   Winger Russ Courtnall decided by mutual agreement with Coach
Larry Robinson not to return to the lineup Saturday from the broken
ankle that has sidelined him for two months. ``The smart thing to
do is to have another couple of good practices, then play in the
Colorado or New Jersey games (Tuesday or Thursday),'' Courtnall
said. ... Winger Craig Johnson on his separated rib cartilage:
``It's still sore. Right now, I've got to ice it and wait for them
to scar over.'' Johnson is listed as week to week to return to the
Kings' lineup.

Tyson gives Botha blast from past
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By W.H. STICKNEY JR. &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
LAS VEGAS _ Francois Botha on Saturday night emerged from his fight
against Mike Tyson with his ears intact.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the first four rounds, it appeared he might come
away with the scalp of the former heavyweight champion, too.
</P>
<P>
   But with one second left in the fifth round, Tyson with a short
right hand to the chin dropped the big South African and ended what
the ``White Buffalo'' had earlier termed his chance at greatness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked right into it,'' said Botha, the No. 2-ranked
heavyweight by the International Boxing Federation. ``I just tried
to fight him and I walked right into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Tyson connected, he looked like the same angry and
confused fighter who 19 months ago bit the ears of IBF/World Boxing
Association heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield and earned a
suspension of his boxing license by the Nevada State Athletic
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   When he approached the pay-per-view TV microphones once his work
was done, Tyson sounded like that same fighter, filled with anger
and fury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need respect,'' he said. ``You show me respect and stop
writing all these trash articles, I'll show you respect. I'm a man,
I'm not afraid to die. But when I die, I'm going straight to
Paradise.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm not worried because I'm in a hurry to die. And no
one's going to write bad about me without me retaliating back.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all due respect, there are people who are trying to
assassinate my character, get the judges in Indiana upset, the
judges in Maryland upset. I'm a man and I can only take so much.
I'm not going to sit back and take so much punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need love, just like everybody else. You can't talk about
me, disrespect me. I have children, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The references to judges in Indiana and Maryland were about
pending litigation involving Tyson in both states.
</P>
<P>
   He is due for a hearing in Maryland later this month, an
offshoot from an auto accident in which he was involved last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The results of that hearing could affect a parole hearing in
Indiana, also later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was Tyson's first bout since the biting incident, which
also took place at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the first round, it appeared Tyson had made little
progress in the last year and a half at managing his rage or
getting his boxing skills together.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of rust,'' he said afterward. ``A lot of
rust.''
</P>
<P>
   There were a lot of questionable tactics, too. When the bell
sounded ending the first round, Tyson, in a clinch, with his right
arm wrapped around the left of Botha, employed a twist that had
Botha yelling in pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, he was just holding me and I twisted him around,'' said
Tyson. ``He was just holding me and I was just lucky enough to get
a shot and knock him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson started slowly and his first few punches missed the mark
by a wide margin.
</P>
<P>
   Botha, meanwhile, was having a field day. He landed at will and
employed the same sort of smothering tactics used by Holyfield to
stem whatever power Tyson might have.
</P>
<P>
   In the second round, Tyson was again at the mercy of Botha. He
openly argued with referee Richard Steele over what he thought were
illegal tactics by the South African. But it was Tyson who would
have a point deducted by the referee, who later said it was for
``unnecessary roughness.''
</P>
<P>
   As was the case at the end of the first round, when the two
fighters went after one another after the bell and had to be
separated by handlers from both corners. The second round ended
with punches being thrown after the bell.
</P>
<P>
   In the third and fourth rounds, Botha continued to confuse and
punish Tyson. In the fourth, he began toying with the 32-year-old
former champ.
</P>
<P>
   With his arms down around his waist instead of up in a defensive
posture, Botha wiggled a glove in Tyson's direction as he kept up a
steady stream of talk that continued through the first four rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was in control,'' said Botha, ``and slowly but
surely was going to win the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   But Botha came out of the fourth round with a cut on the bridge
of his nose, the result of one of the few punches from Tyson that
landed.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson began the fifth round with a solid left jab, began to find
the range with his punches much more frequently than before and
with the straight right hand secured his first victory in nearly
three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was controlling the fight real easily and staying away from
his punches,'' said Botha. ``Then I let my guard down. I was
playing around too much. It just shows you, you can't get careless.
I did and I paid dearly for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is now 46-3 with 40 knockouts. Botha, who briefly held the
IBF heavyweight title in 1994, is 39-2 with one no-decision and 24
KOs.
</P>
<P>
   After the fight was over, Tyson was whisked back to the dressing
room where he had to take stitches to close a wound over his right
eye.
</P>
<P>
   But the win he had wanted so dearly was in the bag, no matter
how sluggishly it was obtained.
</P>
<P>
   ``My trainer got excited, just a little bit,'' Tyson said of
Tommy Brooks. ``And I told him, `It's a long fight, I'm working on
him, I'll slow him down.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little worried at first because he went out, he
started looping his punches,'' said Brooks. ``He came back to the
corner and I told him you've got to throw your straight punches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been working for 2{ months on firing at the body. He was
head-hunting. But he came out, settled down and started throwing
straight punches.''

PEPPERDINE CONTINUES HOME SUCCESS

<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU _ Road games have not been very kind to Pepperdine this
season. Home games, however, are another story.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves improved to 8-1 at the Firestone Fieldhouse this year
with a 79-70 victory over San Francisco on Saturday night in a West
Coast Conference game.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine has now won 18 of its last 21 home games dating back
to the start of last season.
</P>
<P>
   Jelani Gardner once again led the Waves (12-7, 3-1) offensively.
Gardner, the conference's seventh-leading scorer (averaging 13.5
points a game heading into Saturday), had 20 points and seven
assists. He has led the Waves in scoring in each of the last six
games.
</P>
<P>
   Kelvin Gibbs added 17 points for Pepperdine, which has won three
of its past four games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Team defense, that's what's been the key,'' said Pepperdine
center Nick Sheppard, who put up 13 points and six rebounds, when
asked about the team's improvement since a 31-point loss to Gonzaga
last week. ``Our defense has really stepped it up.''
</P>
<P>
   For San Francisco (8-11, 0-3), it was yet another loss in a
rapidly disappointing season. The team raced out at the start of
the season, going 7-1 _ including a win over Xavier and a close
three-point loss to UCLA. But injuries and the loss of point guard
Dony Wilcher, who left the program, have sent the Dons spiraling to
10 losses in their past 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   The big bright spot for San Francisco was Gerald Zimmerman, the
conference's second-leading scorer. Zimmerman, who scored a
career-high 32 points in a loss to Loyola Marymount on Friday,
poured in 31 against Pepperdine. Ali Thomas added 18 points.

KINGS LIFELESS IN DEFEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ At the end of Saturday morning's practice, Kings
coach Larry Robinson gathered his players around him and told them
he was worried.
</P>
<P>
   Their level of attention wasn't what it should be. And Saturday
night, Robinson's fears were proven to be well-founded.
</P>
<P>
   Before a crowd of 16,005 at the Forum, only the fourth sellout
this season, the Kings snoozed their way through a 5-1 loss to the
Pittsburgh Penguins, failing to win for the third time in their
last four games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't focused,'' Robinson said. ``We weren't focused the
other day in practice, we weren't focused this morning at the
skate, and that's just the feeling I got. Again, I was right.
Everything we talked about at the meeting, we did the exact
opposite. We played right into their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The score would have been worse for the Kings (16-23-4), but two
near goals by the Penguins were disallowed by the video goal judge.
The Kings were playing without defenseman Steve Duchesne, sidelined
with back spasms and listed as day to day. But he was hardly the
only no-show in a game in which the highly skilled Penguins were
allowed to free-wheel around the ice all night.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins (20-12-7), who lost to the Kings in Pittsburgh by a
3-0 margin in December, won this game largely on the strength of
special teams, scoring a pair of power-play goals and a shorthanded
goal.
</P>
<P>
   The shorthanded score, by Ian Moran, was not one Kings goalie
Jamie Storr should have allowed, and it was the goal that gave the
Penguins a 1-0 lead 10:39 into the game. Moran beat Storr between
the pads with a seemingly harmless 40-foot slap shot from the right
boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went under the toe of my pad,'' Storr said. ``It was one of
those saves I should have had.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said: ``You can be on top of your game and have
something like that deflate you. And there wasn't a lot to deflate.
We looked like the team that had played three games in four nights.
They gave us a clinic.''
</P>
<P>
   Just 51 seconds later, Jaromir Jagr skated around Donald Audette
at the blue line, then stickhandled past Rob Blake and flipped the
puck past Storr, giving the Penguins two goals on their first three
shots of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we had the 2-0 lead,'' Jagr said, ``they had to change
their style and open the game up.''
</P>
<P>
   Things got worse in the second period, after Blake was sent off
for a high-sticking penalty at 6:36. The Penguins capitalized on
the subsequent power play, with Alexei Kovalev carrying the puck
from the right point to behind the Kings' net, then centering to
former King Robert Lang for an easy one-timer that was his 18th
goal this season.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the Penguins were content to protect their lead,
and the Kings were extremely cooperative, failing to muster a shot
in the second period until a 60-footer by Yanic Perreault at the
9:27 mark. In fact, the Kings managed only six shots at Penguins
goalie Tom Barrasso in the game's first 32 minutes, and the teams
combined for only 35 shots on goal in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings gained a minimal amount of life with 5:11 left in the
second period when Garry Galley scored his first goal this season,
a slap shot from the top of the right faceoff circle with the Kings
on a power play.
</P>
<P>
   But 2:19 later, the Kings got caught deep in the attacking zone,
allowing a 2-on-1 rush to the Penguins. Dan Kesa, covered by Doug
Bodger, passed across to Jan Hrdina, who was unchecked by Sean
O'Donnell. Hrdina redirected Kesa's pass into a wide-open net,
blunting the Kings' comeback hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got our first goal, we started to turn it around,''
Robinson said. ``Then, we gave them a goal. If they don't get the
fourth one, we'd started to pick our game up a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Hatcher scored the game's final goal on a power play early
in the third period.

TYSON WINS   WITH ONE PUNCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Mike Tyson is oh-so-lucky that power is the last
thing to go.
</P>
<P>
   Francois Botha, a relatively obscure fighter from South Africa,
was poised to do the impossible Saturday at the MGM Grand. For
four-plus rounds, he had Tyson where he wanted him: frustrated,
confused and behind on all score cards.
</P>
<P>
   And then, as if the boxing gods weren't quite ready to say
goodbye to Iron Mike at 32, the former two-time champion fired a
straight right into the willing chin of a brave opponent late in
the fifth round of a scheduled 10-round heayvweight bout and that
was that.
</P>
<P>
   Botha was able to stagger to his feet but it was too late: He'd
been counted out by referee Richard Steele one second before the
end of the round. Instantly, Botha's opportunity to make history
and the prospect of a fascinating final seven rounds had vanished.
</P>
<P>
   The punch was vintage Tyson (46-3, with 40 knockouts). He had
his entire 223 pounds behind it and Botha (39-1, 24 KOs) obliged by
walking into the pile driver _ an unpleasant combination for the
person on the receiving end of such violence.
</P>
<P>
   The near-full house of roughly 12,519, who paid to see either
such distruction or Tyson snap as he did when he bit Evander
Holyfield's ears in his last fight 19 months ago, loved it. They
cheered wildly when it happened and oohed and aahed every time the
replay was shown on the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   However, that's about all they had to cheer about in regard to
Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, he was either extremely rusty as the result of the
layoff or his skills have eroded further. That, and Botha's
strategy, had those at the MGM thinking the unthinkable for a good
20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson cited the layoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tremendous amount of rust,'' he said. ``I told my trainer,
`Don't worry, I'll catch him late, I'll catch him late.'
(Cornerman) Stacey (McKinley) and those guys got a little excited,
but I was OK.''
</P>
<P>
   At the opening bell, Tyson did the things he supposedly learned
from new trainer Tommy Brooks: He jabbed and moved his head as he
had early in his career.
</P>
<P>
   That lasted all of a half round as Botha, who weighed a pudgy
233 pounds, began to frustrate the 7-1 favorite with a shockingly
effective game plan.
</P>
<P>
   Simply, he kept his distance from Tyson's bombs and held him
when danger seemed to be approaching. At the same time, he
repeatedly found the opportunity to throw effective combinations.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson became a stationary target as he was against Holyfield and
very frustrated, so frustrated he locked Botha's left arm under his
own at the end of the first round and wouldn't let go.
</P>
<P>
   Steele attempted to separate the two but couldn't get it done,
which set off a brief melee in the ring that for a moment had
everyone thinking the same thing: Tyson didn't lose it again, did
he?
</P>
<P>
   He lost a point in the second round when he hit Botha in the
face with a forearm.
</P>
<P>
   But, beyond that, he behaved. In fact, he had more difficulty
controlling the fight than himself.
</P>
<P>
   Botha baffled Tyson with his tactics throughout and seemed to
gain confidence with every round. He talked to Tyson in an attempt
to unnerve him whenever the two clinched, he smiled repeatedly and
even taunted the once-awesome champion late in the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Botha appeared to gain even more ill-advised
bravado. He engaged Tyson in two brief toe-to-toe exchanges early
in the round and survived. And then his luck ran out: Tyson, back
to throwing big punches rather than combinations, was bound to land
one and finally he did.
</P>
<P>
   Botha fell to his side. He attempted to rise but fell on his
face. He tried it again with the same result before finally finding
his way to his feet. At that moment, Steele waved him off and he
staggered backward into the ropes _ clearly unable to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was winning,'' Botha said. ``Oh, what a fighter (Tyson). Oh
my, what a dummy (himself). I was going to beat him.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson touched off another short-lived incident when he rushed
toward Botha as he stumbled backward. It seemed clear that he had
good intentions, though: He wanted to catch his beaten opponent
before he fell.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately afterward, Tyson showed more unusual class. He
hugged Botha warmly and congratulated him on a good effort _ an
effort that was better than his in all but one way.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Tyson seemed to have neither the fury one might expect
after waiting so long to begin his second comeback nor the skills
his fans somehow still expect from him. He looked powerful but
otherwise ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is to have him fight again in April and again a few
months later _ the candidates include Axel Schulz, Vaughn Bean and
Lou Savarese _ and then face Holyfield for the third time.
</P>
<P>
   If this Tyson shows up to face his nemesis, who beat him twice,
have pity on him: He likely will be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to fight, I need to put on better shows,'' Tyson said.
``I'm not looking to jump into the mix real quick. I need to do one
step at a time, go back to the gym and start working right away.''
</P>
<P>
   In other bouts, Goyo Vargas (39-6-1, 28 KOs) survived a 12-round
knockdown to oupoint Ben Tackie (18-1, 11 KOs) in a 12-round
lightweight bout.
</P>
<P>
   Zab Judah (19-0, 14 KOs) stopped Wilfredo Negron (17-4, 14 KOs)
at 1:44 of the fourth round of a scheduled 12-round junior
welterweight fight.
</P>
<P>
   Judah will next fight Vince Phillips for the title.

STANFORD TOO MUCH FOR UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With five minutes remaining, the game ended and
the clinic began.
</P>
<P>
   And Stanford did all the teaching.
</P>
<P>
   For 35 minutes, UCLA challenged the Cardinal in a way it had not
been challenged in Pac-10 play, but even the Bruins' best effort
was not enough. Stanford broke open a close game and defeated UCLA
72-59 on Saturday night, before a crowd of 12,992 at Pauley
Pavilion that included Stanford sophomore Chelsea Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't get rattled when they go on the road in a hostile
environment,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin said. ``That's why they
win, and they did it tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading 54-53 with 5:31 remaining _ and with UCLA's most
effective player, center Dan Gadzuric, on the bench with five fouls
_ the Cardinal shifted into a dimension of poise and precision the
baby Bruins simply do not possess.
</P>
<P>
   After a 10-0 surge, the No.4 Cardinal was in total command and
cruised to its 11th consecutive victory. The game ended with a
frustration foul by Baron Davis on Stanford guard Art Lee, and with
objects thrown onto the court from the UCLA student section. (A
piece of candy hit Davis on the lip.)
</P>
<P>
   But until Stanford's late surge, which included a stifling zone
defense, it was a riveting duel of tactics and talent, structure
and spirit.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant theme was Stanford's smothering defense. The
Cardinal was acutely aware of Davis' every move and dropped four
players into the paint at the slightest hint of penetration. The
strategy choked off UCLA's greatest weapon and forced the Bruins to
the perimeter. They shot 40.6 percent from the field and made 1 of
14 shots from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worked,'' Davis said. ``We didn't execute on the offensive
end. That was our biggest problem of the night.''
</P>
<P>
   Foul trouble was a close second. UCLA (12-4, 4-2) had five
players disqualified, and it committed 35 fouls to Stanford's 19.
</P>
<P>
   The costliest was Gadzuric's fifth, with 6:45 left and the
Bruins trailing 51-49. He departed with 15 points _ his best game
of the season _ and seemed to take UCLA's spirit with him, as
Stanford's game-breaking run began one minute later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an unusual game,'' Lavin said, careful not to directly
criticize the officiating and incur the Pac-10's wrath. ``I've
never seen anything quite like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor had the Cardinal, but for a different reason. UCLA's
uber-aggressive defense challenged every pass and every rebound,
but the Bruins also grabbed and clawed continuously. Perhaps they
were overly excited. Perhaps they were frustrated by Stanford's
structured offense. Either way, the Cardinal didn't think enough
fouls were called.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was brutal,'' coach Mike Montgomery said. ``I've never
seen anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford controlled the tempo from the outset, jumping to a 9-4
lead and drawing two quick fouls on Gadzuric and Jerome Moiso.
Lavin removed them immediately, guessing correctly that the Bruins
could stay in striking range with a small lineup for the remainder
of the first half. The Bruins trailed 33-27 at halftime and were
thrilled about it.
</P>
<P>
   Gadzuric and Moiso were back on the court when the second half
began, and Gadzuric made three early baskets _ including a
ferocious dunk _ to jump-start UCLA's attack.
</P>
<P>
   A technical foul on Stanford guard David Moseley, followed by
another Gadzuric dunk, gave UCLA a 47-42 lead with 12:14 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Now, we've got them,''' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to contain UCLA's quickness, Stanford switched to a 2-3
zone. It worked as designed _ and as practiced Friday afternoon _
sending UCLA's offense into instant stagnation. The Bruins scored
six points in 10 minutes against the zone, and Stanford took
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had seen some tape of them struggling in zone in other
games,'' Montgomery said. ``It ended up working well for us. It
bought us some time and enabled us to gain the lead.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins did some of their best work without guard Earl
Watson, who missed five minutes in the second half because of a cut
finger on his right (shooting) hand. Watson returned with eight
minutes left and immediately hit Moiso for a lay-up. But by that
point, the Cardinal was in charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``They executed well in the stretch, and we didn't execute well
against the zone,'' Lavin said. ``A lot had to do with foul
trouble, and Earl had the stitches on his finger.''
</P>
<P>
   The margin was 11 with 90 seconds left when the crowd departed,
leaving the Bruins deflated and defeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seemed to give up,'' Davis said angrily. ``It seemed like
we just gave up.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not? The clinic was over.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Watson said he might be out a week or two because of his
cut finger.

GADZURIC'S PLAY ONLY GOES SO FAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The selfless, seamless play of the Stanford men's basketball
team last season so inspired former basketball great Bill Bradley
he was moved to write his fourth book, ``Values of the Game.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the way UCLA center Dan Gadzuric played in the second
half of the Bruins' 72-59 loss Saturday to the back and intact
Stanford squad, it looked like he had spent the intermission
reading Bradley's chapter on resilience.
</P>
<P>
   Gadzuric didn't let his early foul trouble keep him down and in
doing so he very nearly turned the game around. He contributed five
points and an assist during a marvelous three-minute run early in
the second half after a 3-pointer by Ryan Bailey had given the
10th-ranked Bruins their first lead, at 38-37.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates seemed to feed off Gadzuric's energy, and when the
6-foot-10 freshman dunked over Stanford's 6-9 junior Mark Madsen to
give the Bruins their largest lead of the night at 47-42, the No.4
Cardinal suddenly looked vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Gadzuric looked like Godzilla when he stole the ball and
converted a twisting five-foot jumper at the other end to keep the
Bruins ahead 49-46. Shortly after that, though, he picked up his
fourth foul while fighting David Moseley for a defensive rebound.
</P>
<P>
   As the air left Gadzuric's game, the rest of the Bruins got
deflated.
</P>
<P>
   With the Bruins down by three and clawing to regain the lead,
Gadzuric was whistled for an over-the-back foul, his fifth, while
tipping in a shot with 6:45 left.
</P>
<P>
   He retired to the bench with 15 points, four rebounds, two
steals and one assists in 19 compact minutes. He took the momentum
with him when he left the floor and the wily Cardinal moved in
quickly to fill the vacuum, rising above the din of a pumped-up
Pauley Pavilion crowd of 12,922 to record its 11 consecutive win.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was Dan's breakout game,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin said
afterward. ``His physical presence, his confidence, was
outstanding. He dominated both ends of the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Gadzuric wasn't so sure. He just knew he had to come out in the
second half and play as aggressively as he had at the game's start.
He had scored the opening basket on a dunk, then spent most of the
rest of the half on the bench after picking up his second foul with
13:57 left.
</P>
<P>
   Hacks happen when you're surrounded by as much tall timber as
was Gadzuric. He gave up four inches and three years of experience
to his Cardinal counterpart, Tim Young, and it showed in the early
going.
</P>
<P>
   After 20 minutes Young had five points, four rebounds, three
blocks and two assists. That looked a lot better than Gadzuric's
four points, zero rebounds, zero blocked shots and zero assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach told me to keep playing aggressive and if I fouled out,
I fouled out,'' Gadzuric said. ``So I just came out strong and
played hard.''

TYSON WINS   WITH ONE PUNCH
</HEADLINE>

By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Mike Tyson is oh-so-lucky that power is the last
thing to go.
</P>
<P>
   Francois Botha, a relatively obscure fighter from South Africa,
was poised to do the impossible Saturday at the MGM Grand. For
four-plus rounds, he had Tyson where he wanted him: frustrated,
confused and behind on all score cards.
</P>
<P>
   And then, as if the boxing gods weren't quite ready to say
goodbye to Iron Mike at 32, the former two-time champion fired a
straight right into the willing chin of a brave opponent late in
the fifth round of a scheduled 10-round heayvweight bout and that
was that.
</P>
<P>
   Botha was able to stagger to his feet but it was too late: He'd
been counted out by referee Richard Steele one second before the
end of the round. Instantly, Botha's opportunity to make history
and the prospect of a fascinating final seven rounds had vanished.
</P>
<P>
   The punch was vintage Tyson (46-3, with 40 knockouts). He had
his entire 223 pounds behind it and Botha (39-1, 24 KOs) obliged by
walking into the pile driver _ an unpleasant combination for the
person on the receiving end of such violence.
</P>
<P>
   The near-full house of roughly 12,519, who paid to see either
such distruction or Tyson snap as he did when he bit Evander
Holyfield's ears in his last fight 19 months ago, loved it. They
cheered wildly when it happened and oohed and aahed every time the
replay was shown on the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   However, that's about all they had to cheer about in regard to
Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, he was either extremely rusty as the result of the
layoff or his skills have eroded further. That, and Botha's
strategy, had those at the MGM thinking the unthinkable for a good
20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson cited the layoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tremendous amount of rust,'' he said. ``I told my trainer,
`Don't worry, I'll catch him late, I'll catch him late.'
(Cornerman) Stacey (McKinley) and those guys got a little excited,
but I was OK.''
</P>
<P>
   At the opening bell, Tyson did the things he supposedly learned
from new trainer Tommy Brooks: He jabbed and moved his head as he
had early in his career.
</P>
<P>
   That lasted all of a half round as Botha, who weighed a pudgy
233 pounds, began to frustrate the 7-1 favorite with a shockingly
effective game plan.
</P>
<P>
   Simply, he kept his distance from Tyson's bombs and held him
when danger seemed to be approaching. At the same time, he
repeatedly found the opportunity to throw effective combinations.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson became a stationary target as he was against Holyfield and
very frustrated, so frustrated he locked Botha's left arm under his
own at the end of the first round and wouldn't let go.
</P>
<P>
   Steele attempted to separate the two but couldn't get it done,
which set off a brief melee in the ring that for a moment had
everyone thinking the same thing: Tyson didn't lose it again, did
he?
</P>
<P>
   He lost a point in the second round when he hit Botha in the
face with a forearm.
</P>
<P>
   But, beyond that, he behaved. In fact, he had more difficulty
controlling the fight than himself.
</P>
<P>
   Botha baffled Tyson with his tactics throughout and seemed to
gain confidence with every round. He talked to Tyson in an attempt
to unnerve him whenever the two clinched, he smiled repeatedly and
even taunted the once-awesome champion late in the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Botha appeared to gain even more ill-advised
bravado. He engaged Tyson in two brief toe-to-toe exchanges early
in the round and survived. And then his luck ran out: Tyson, back
to throwing big punches rather than combinations, was bound to land
one and finally he did.
</P>
<P>
   Botha fell to his side. He attempted to rise but fell on his
face. He tried it again with the same result before finally finding
his way to his feet. At that moment, Steele waved him off and he
staggered backward into the ropes _ clearly unable to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was winning,'' Botha said. ``Oh, what a fighter (Tyson). Oh
my, what a dummy (himself). I was going to beat him.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson touched off another short-lived incident when he rushed
toward Botha as he stumbled backward. It seemed clear that he had
good intentions, though: He wanted to catch his beaten opponent
before he fell.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately afterward, Tyson showed more unusual class. He
hugged Botha warmly and congratulated him on a good effort _ an
effort that was better than his in all but one way.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Tyson seemed to have neither the fury one might expect
after waiting so long to begin his second comeback nor the skills
his fans somehow still expect from him. He looked powerful but
otherwise ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is to have him fight again in April and again a few
months later _ the candidates include Axel Schulz, Vaughn Bean and
Lou Savarese _ and then face Holyfield for the third time.
</P>
<P>
   If this Tyson shows up to face his nemesis, who beat him twice,
have pity on him: He likely will be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to fight, I need to put on better shows,'' Tyson said.
``I'm not looking to jump into the mix real quick. I need to do one
step at a time, go back to the gym and start working right away.''
</P>
<P>
   In other bouts, Goyo Vargas (39-6-1, 28 KOs) survived a 12-round
knockdown to oupoint Ben Tackie (18-1, 11 KOs) in a 12-round
lightweight bout.
</P>
<P>
   Zab Judah (19-0, 14 KOs) stopped Wilfredo Negron (17-4, 14 KOs)
at 1:44 of the fourth round of a scheduled 12-round junior
welterweight fight.
</P>
<P>
   Judah will next fight Vince Phillips for the title.

TYSON TAKES THE 5TH  
 SHORT RIGHT STOPS BOTHA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ One punch is Mike Tyson's signature.
</P>
<P>
   It's his only expression. Little else about this heavyweight
jumble of contradictions makes much sense.
</P>
<P>
   The anger, controversy and profanity have turned him into a
nihilistic figure who defies a reasonable explanation in every
language but one.
</P>
<P>
   The punch.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson (46-3, 40 KOs) let the punch speak for him all over again
Saturday night with the beautiful delivery of a right hand for a
fifth-round knockout of South African Frans Botha (39-2, 24 KOs) at
the MGM Grand.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson had a lot of crazy things to say after the victory in his
first bout since he bit Evander Holyfield's ears in June 1997. He
talked about dying and respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need respect,'' he said. ``Everybody has been writing a lot
of trashy articles about me. I'm a man. I'm angry. I need to be
loved like everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not afraid to die. When I die, I'm going to paradise.''
</P>
<P>
   But there isn't much love in a sport that Tyson himself has
called ``the hurt business.''
</P>
<P>
   The ring is only paradise for a punch. And within those ropes,
Tyson is still very much alive with the one thing, perhaps the only
thing, he does best.
</P>
<P>
   The South African walked straight into a Tyson right that was as
deadly as any he has ever thrown. It was textbook perfect.
</P>
<P>
   At 2:59 of the round, Botha, nicknamed the White Buffalo, hit
the canvas like a slaughtered calf. He tried to climb to his feet,
but he collapsed on the ropes and then rolled around in a
semiconscious state.
</P>
<P>
   It marked the emphatic end to what had been an ugly
confrontation. Tyson, showing the effects of 19 idle months, missed
wildly with hooks.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Botha was surprisingly effective with tactics
that included a lot clutching, grabbing and talking.
</P>
<P>
   He was clearly trying to enrage Tyson. For a while, it appeared
he might succeed. At the end of the first, the two fighters had to
separated by the corners.
</P>
<P>
   As referee Richard Steele tried to break up the two fighters,
Tyson threw an elbow. Botha retaliated. You could almost hear the
ticking in the Tyson time bomb. It looked as if he was about to
explode.
</P>
<P>
   Before the the second round, Marc Ratner, executive director of
the Nevada State Athletic Commission, climbed into the ring and
spoke to Steele, who followed with a warning to both fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't win with a foul,'' Steele said.
</P>
<P>
   But the fouls continued. At the end of the second, Tyson was
penalized one point for a head butt and an elbow as Steele again
tried to break up the two.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, Tyson, cut above his right eye, repeatedly looked
at Steele as though he were frustrated by Botha's tactics.
</P>
<P>
   But it was working. After four rounds, Botha led on three of the
judges' score cards.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, it didn't matter. Tyson was about to apply his
signature on a bout worth $10 million to him and $1.85 million to
Botha.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Muhammad Ali watched.
</P>
<P>
   Ali arrived and took a seat alongside actor Jack Nicholson about
an hour before Tyson answered an opening bell for the first time in
19 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ali, Ali,'' the crowd chanted in a nostalgic tone full of
echoes from a very different time. A bygone time. And probably a
better one.
</P>
<P>
   For Tyson, there were none of the chants that always accompany
and help to define a legend. He's become a curiosity, if not a
cartoon character in an X-rated comic book. Ali was a reason to
celebrate. He and the fans became one. His fight was their fight.
The link was almost choreography. Folk art.
</P>
<P>
   But Tyson is a peep show. His nitroglycerin mix of anger,
insecurity, contempt, fear and loathing for seemingly everything,
perhaps even himself, is no celebration.
</P>
<P>
   People gather to watch him fight the way they stop and stand to
look up at a man poised to jump off a towering ledge of a tall
building.
</P>
<P>
   Will desperation shove him off the edge? Or just sheer lunacy?
With Tyson, nobody can ever be sure of anything. Only the hint of
imminent danger is there.
</P>
<P>
   So there the audience was Saturday night, gathered around a ring
as though it were a gallows. A couple of condemned men were about
to enter the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Botha was condemned by the simple fate of having neither speed
nor power. Tyson was too much for Botha and, one day, maybe too
much for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Even in victory, he walked the walk of a man condemned by his
own inability to control the runaway rage that has always left him
perilously balanced with one foot on the ledge and the other other
dangling in the depths of demise. &QL;

NEW MEXICO SURPRISES ARI ZONA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL CORO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE _ Arizona senior Jason Terry said all along that his
team lacked the killer instinct to come out strong since the new
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats got part of that fixed with its best first half in
the core of a plane engine that is The Pit. But killer instinct
also means burying a team when you have it down.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Arizona put itself in a position to lose. Just as Terry
rallied the Wildcats back from 10 down after being 15 up with a
go-ahead runner, Arizona watched New Mexico use the final 4.6
seconds to get a buzzer-beating layup from Damion Walker in the
Lobos' 79-78 victory Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Between what seemed like a long 4.6 seconds to Arizona and
officiating that had A.J. Bramlett and Eugene Edgerson saddled with
four fouls in the second half, Arizona Coach Lute Olson said his
500th game coaching the Wildcats will be his last in Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   ``The home next year will be the end of the series
unequivocally,'' Olson said of the 81-year duel.
</P>
<P>
   No. 7 Arizona let No. 16 New Mexico, standing-room-only crowd,
and the pride of Tempe Corona del Sol High School, guard Lamont
Long, back into the game and wound up losing for the third straight
time at The Pit. The last two Arizona losses at The Pit came in
seasons that the Wildcats reached the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't play much better than we did except for those lulls
in the second half,'' Arizona center and Albuquerque native A.J.
Bramlett said. ``I wanted to beat them more than anybody, but we
came out a better team for battling them all the way down to the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona (12-2) led the Lobos (16-2), 43-28, at the half off an
8-0 run, but it all vanished in less than nine minutes of the
second half. With New Mexico star center Kenny Thomas in foul
trouble, Long took over to make up for a two-point first half with
20 second-half points.
</P>
<P>
   His pair of free throws put New Mexico ahead, 75-65, with four
minutes remaining, capping a 25-8 Lobos run that came during
Bramlett's and Edgerson's foul trouble. Bramlett went from one to
four fouls less than five minutes into the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats rallied, as they have all season, behind senior
guard Jason Terry, but did it late. Terry's solo offensive effort
and a Ruben Douglas steal and layup pulled Arizona within one,
77-76, before Terry hit the last of his 17 second-half points on a
running jumper to put the Wildcats ahead with 4.6 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico did not take its final timeout. John Robinson's
upcourt dribble drew four defenders atop the three-point line,
where he fed into Walker for the winner, even with Michael Wright's
deflection on the shot. It was the third time the Lobos have
rallied from 15 down this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach told me if I don't have anything good to say to not say
anything at all,'' Terry said.
</P>
<P>
   After trips to Brigham Young, UCLA and Arizona State, Wright and
Douglas shrugged off the raucous environment with brilliant first
halves.
</P>
<P>
   Wright outpowered New Mexico, racking up 13 points and 12
rebounds in the first half. He and Bramlett escorted Thomas to 10
minutes of first-half bench time because of foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas came out aggressively to quiet the Lobos faithful
quickly. His steal, three-point play and jumper got Arizona ahead
10-3.
</P>
<P>
   With Thomas and Long out, New Mexico went to the perimeter and
hit 4 of 15 three-pointers rather than its normal 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' fourth foul sat him again 6:49 into the second half
after Walker's nine points in three minutes recharged the Lobos
howlers. New Mexico scored on its first eight possessions of the
half to trim the lead to 49-46. &QL;

 &HT;    Questions surround `sheikh,' jewelry scheme
 &HT;    By Mary McLachlin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH _ If it happened _ and at least two witnesses
say it did _ the scene on the tarmac at Palm Beach International
Airport played out like a cheesy, made-for-TV movie:
</P>
<P>
   A huge, bearded man in flowing robes and headdress _ a sheikh,
perhaps? _ emerges from a private aviation company and boards an
unmarked jet parked at the far end of a ramp. With him are two
women wearing ``I Dream of Jeannie'' harem outfits. A young man in
a dark suit, Arabic-looking headdress and sunglasses stands beside
the plane, arms crossed, on guard.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, a limousine pulls up to the Hawker Siddeley HS125
and three men get out _ a dapper yachtsman-type, an elderly
businessman and another dark-suited guard in silk-scarf headgear
and sunglasses. The guard frisks the other two before they board
the plane.
</P>
<P>
   When they step down 20-30 minutes later, and get back into the
limousine, one carries a wooden box. Inside: a jewel-encrusted
dagger.
</P>
<P>
   After the limo leaves, everybody else goes back into the
aviation office. The women, described as looking ``like a couple of
hookers dressed up in an Arab costume,'' disappear. The guards pull
off their makeshift kaffiyehs. And the ``sheikh'' sheds his sheets
and heads for the parking lot in ordinary shirt-and-pants outfit.
</P>
<P>
   The bizarre performance, described by reluctant witnesses in a
lawsuit, allegedly was staged in October 1995 as part of an
elaborate scheme to bilk the businessman out of millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents theorize that the charade was set up to make
Detroit broadcasting magnate Aben Johnson believe the claims of his
companion, local jewel dealer Jack Hasson, that he had connections
to the world's richest man, the Sultan of Brunei _ and that the
sultan was interested in buying the collection of estate jewelry
Hasson had sold Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Hasson allegedly told Johnson he had a line to the sultan
through his friendship with golfer Jack Nicklaus _ a claim denied
by Nicklaus, who has testified that he never met the sultan.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 71, sued the former Palm Beach Gardens jewelry merchant
last year, claiming most of the goods Hasson sold him from December
1988 to June 1997 were fake, or that Hasson lied about their
origins and value. The suit seeks restitution and damages totaling
$180 million, the largest jewelry fraud claim against an individual
on record.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 former customers have sued Hasson in the past
decade, including Jack and Barbara Nicklaus, claiming he cheated
them in various ways. Hasson sometimes countered with slander suits
but eventually settled all the complaints, most under confidential
terms. However, details are emerging as the former customers are
called as pre-trial witnesses in Johnson's suit.
</P>
<P>
   Hasson has denied Johnson's allegations and sued him for
slander, claiming he drove him out of the jewelry business.
</P>
<P>
   Several people who worked for Hasson or were associated with him
have testified they've been questioned by FBI agents and called
before a federal grand jury investigating Hasson's dealings. The
FBI won't confirm or deny the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Six people have been questioned under oath so far about the
alleged airplane incident. Three gave corroborating testimony,
according to transcripts of their depositions; two, including one
of the ``harem,'' refused to answer, saying it could incriminate
them; and the 340-pound boat carpenter alleged to have played the
``sheikh'' denied everything.
</P>
<P>
   The mysterious ``Arab'' on the airplane, according to court
documents, was supposed to be ``Prince Akmed,'' nephew and personal
representative of the Sultan of Brunei. And the bejeweled dagger
given to Johnson was supposed to be a token of the potentate's
esteem and appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   It was all an elaborate hoax, the suit alleges, designed to make
Johnson think he was meeting with a member of the royal family of
Brunei aboard the ``prince's'' private jet and to keep Johnson
spending money with Hasson.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson paid Hasson roughly $50 million for jewelry after the
alleged incident, in addition to the $30 million he'd already
spent.
</P>
<P>
   Hasson owned two private jets in 1995, according to the
testimony of his chief pilot at the time. Jimmie Wade Keeling, 62,
said he got a telephone call one morning telling him to move the
older model plane as far out on a ramp as possible and cover or
remove Hasson's ``Jack of Diamonds'' logo _ a diamond with a
jumping marlin and sailfish.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot said he couldn't remember whether the call was from
Hasson or his friend and business partner, Ted Keys. And even
though he was curious, he said, he never questioned the order.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my business to ask my boss why he has me do
something,'' he said, a theme repeated by other witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Keeling said he told co-pilot Tim McCarty to get some washable
paint to cover the logo on the tail. McCarty, 31, testified that he
went to a Kmart and bought children's fingerpaint to obscure the
outside logo and that he scraped off an inside logo with a razor
blade.
</P>
<P>
   Keeling said he sat in the pilot's seat, kept the air
conditioning running and watched the scene unfold.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the captain and mate of Hasson's sportfishing yacht
had left the Sailfish Marina, where the 55-foot ``Jack of
Diamonds'' was docked, and driven to the airport, according to the
mate's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Hughes, 35, said the captain, Sean O'Neill, told him
that Hasson wanted them to bring dark suits, but O'Neill didn't say
why. Hughes testified that after they put on the suits, Ted Keys
and Jimmy Speiser, an employee of Hasson's, helped them tie pieces
of black or dark blue silky material around their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said Speiser told him to get into a limo, driven by Keys,
which would pick up Hasson and a friend, and that he and O'Neill
were to keep their mouths shut and not say anything to anyone.
O'Neill stood by the stairs leading to the plane, Hughes testified.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill, 27, refused to answer any questions during his
deposition, claiming Fifth Amendment rights against
self-incrimination. Lawyer John Tierney wouldn't even let O'Neill
give his birthdate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been advised by the Assistant United States Attorney
that he is a target of a federal indictment . . . because of this
subject matter, and we're not going to answer any questions,''
Tierney told Johnson's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Keys nor Speiser has given a deposition yet, and Speiser
could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Keys said in an interview that he had testified before the
federal grand jury and had not claimed a Fifth Amendment privilege.
Regarding the scene at the airport, he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``The people that I know who have testified _ that is, the
pilot, co-pilot and the mate _ to my knowledge, have told the
complete truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Eaton, 49, alleged to be one of the harem women, pleaded
the Fifth Amendment 50 times during her deposition. She refused to
answer questions about the airplane incident or about a sworn
statement she made in October, in which she said the only time she
had been on Hasson's plane was when he had paid for her and another
woman to pose as sexy ``flight attendants . . . for scenery'' while
he showed it to a prospective buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes testified that he didn't know Eaton when he saw her in
the ``genie'' outfit, but recognized her six months later when
Hasson sent him to her for a massage. He said he had sex with her
``three or four'' times, but didn't pay for it and didn't know if
Hasson paid her.
</P>
<P>
   When Johnson's lawyer asked Eaton if she had used her home on
Gun Club Road to entertain men or provide sexual favors, she
pleaded the Fifth Amendment. She did testify that police had raided
her house in 1992 and charged her with offering to commit
prostitution; she said she was ordered to perform community service
and the record was sealed.
</P>
<P>
   Records show Eaton also was arrested in 1991 on a disorderly
conduct charge _ dancing topless on the deck of a boat in Miami's
Bayside Marina _ for which she paid a fine and court costs.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents allege Hasson also recruited Eaton to play the
role of ``Ms. Fricker,'' daughter of a wealthy _ and imaginary _
client from whose estate he wanted Johnson to buy millions of
dollars worth of jewelry. When questioned about it, Eaton refused
to answer, citing her right to avoid self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Speiser, a marine carpenter who stands 6'2'' and weighs
340, denied posing as ``Prince Akmed.'' Speiser, whose brother
James worked for Hasson, testified that he didn't know where Brunei
is but had heard of it ``in the news once in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicklaus, whose name and friendship Hasson allegedly
invoked as a connection to the Sultan of Brunei, testified that he
designed a golf course for Prince Hakeem of Brunei, but had never
met his uncle, the sultan.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus said he and his wife discovered through a routine
insurance appraisal that the ruby in a $35,000 diamond and ruby
ring bought from Hasson was synthetic. When they complained,
Nicklaus testified, Hasson apologized and replaced it _ with
another synthetic stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point then we had all the jewelry appraised,''
Nicklaus said, ``and the jewelry was (worth) substantially less
than what I'd paid for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple sued in 1997, claiming fraud. Hasson settled by
agreeing to buy back 13 pieces of jewelry for $380,000 and to never
identify the jewelry as having belonged to the Nicklauses or refer
to them as having been his customers.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus testified that Hasson refused to take back one item, a
wooden family tree with little gold bears on it, representing
himself, his wife and their children _ an idea he'd had for a
family Christmas present and that Hasson had assigned an employee
to make.
</P>
<P>
   The Bear Tree fell apart, Nicklaus testified, and the ``solid
gold'' bears turned out to be ``plastic and lead and paper and with
a thin coat of gold leaf or paint'' over them.
</P>
<P>
   It stuck in his craw, Nicklaus said, especially after Hasson
said his employee had worked extra during the holidays on the tree
and suggested Nicklaus give him a present.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I bought him a couple of nice fishing rods for Christmas,''
Nicklaus said, ``for making sure I got my paper Bear Tree.''

 &HT;    HEALTH/SCIENCE: Tiny tube can open arteries, stop pain
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS, GRAPHIC
 &HT;    By Dan Moffett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ At 76, Max Frenkel lost two of the joys
of his life _ ballroom dancing and table tennis _ to legs that were
crippled by clogged circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Pain and cramping came with each step, and even standing became
an ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, Frenkel's problem would have been dismissed as an
unfortunate function of aging that medical science could do little
to rectify.
</P>
<P>
   But today Frenkel is dancing again _ three times a week with
wife Paula _ and taking on all comers on the ping-pong table. The
West Palm Beach retiree's recovery is evidence of what physicians
are calling a quiet revolution in cardiovascular surgery.
</P>
<P>
   A tiny metal tube, about a half-inch long, that could easily be
mistaken for the spring in a ballpoint pen is what put the bounce
back in Frenkel's feet.
</P>
<P>
   It is called a stent, and few inventions in the 1990s have made
such powerful impacts in so many different arenas.
</P>
<P>
   In the courtrooms, competing corporations have battled over who
should control development rights to the technology. On Wall
Street, investors have made huge profits by backing companies that
marketed the device.
</P>
<P>
   But it is in the operating room where the collapsible stent is
making its most enduring contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen a dramatic increase in the use of stents
throughout the circulation (system),'' said Dr. Barry Katzen,
medical director of the Miami Cardiac and Vascular Institute. ``The
quiet revolution is that we have developed more applications to
address quality of life issues in ways we haven't been able to
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzen performed the angioplasty procedure on Frenkel last year,
inserting a stent into the arteries of both legs to return normal
blood flow and treat the advanced peripheral vascular disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within three days after my operation, I was walking without
pain and in a week I was dancing again,'' Frenkel said. ``The
results were outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   In stenting, a surgeon inserts the coil _ usually a cage of
surgical-grade stainless steel that resembles chicken wire _ by
running a catheter through a small incision made to the femoral
artery in the groin. A mild sedative to aid relaxation is used, but
not a general anesthetic.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors ask patients to move or breathe deeply so that x-rays
can be taken to direct the catheter to the proper place where the
stent is deployed.
</P>
<P>
   A balloon containing the stent is threaded to the weak spot; the
balloon is deflated, and the stent spring-loads into place. A
typical procedure lasts 90 minutes and patients are released from
the hospital after about two days.
</P>
<P>
   The stent acts as latticed scaffolding, permanently implanting
itself into the wall of the vessel, holding it open and preventing
it from collapsing again, an occurrence called restenosis.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, Frenkel had angioplasty without the stent and his
symptoms returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell the difference with the stents,'' he said. ``I
think it definitely feels better with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The stent, despite its conceptual simplicity, has had a history
of false starts and complications on its way to acceptance.
Implanting metal tubes in arteries was first attempted 30 years
ago, but the technology was not advanced enough for successful
results.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '80s, with the rising popularity of balloon
angioplasty, Dr. Julio Palmaz of the University of Texas Health
Science Center in San Antonio created the modern prototype for the
collapsible stent. Palmaz, with Dr. Richard Schatz, developed a
stainless steel wire tube with soldered joints that could be
crimped over a balloon delivery system. In 1994, that stent was
approved for coronary applications by the Food and Drug
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Cordis, a Johnson &AMP; Johnson company that owns the Palmaz-Schatz
stent, has taken competitors Guidant, Boston Scientific and
Arterial Vascular Engineering to court claiming infringements of
its patents. The competing companies have argued successfully to
date that their stents are significantly different in design.
</P>
<P>
   Stock soars for stent makers
</P>
<P>
   Most of the later models are more flexible or are coated to
prevent clotting, one of the most troublesome complications with
the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Guidant's stock price has quadrupled to about $110 per share as
its portion of the stent market has grown over the past two years.
Worldwide sales of stents are expected to approach $2 billion by
the year 2001, with about 56 percent of all coronary angioplasties
(about 200,000 yearly in the United States) using the device.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be misled by the humble appearance of the half-inch tube.
Each stent, which is sold with the catheter to deploy it, sells for
about $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Aorta repairs may be next
</P>
<P>
   New models are in production with a constellation of eclectic
names: The Gianturco, the Wallstent, the Multilink Duet and Phytis
stents. They are being touted for their diamond coatings,
radioactivity or revolutionary architecture.
</P>
<P>
   The potential uses for stents are only beginning to be
understood. Studies show that patients who receive them during
coronary angioplasty are much less likely to need heart bypass
surgery later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really has been an explosion in the quality of the
technology,'' said a physician at Good Samaritan Medical Center in
West Palm Beach. ``But there's one thing you have to keep in mind:
You're not really curing anybody; you're just fixing the plumbing.
It's not magic. Still, it's gratifying when you see you're able to
treat someone and avoid major surgical procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Katzen is working to perfect a stent graft that would
repair aneurysms in the aorta, the main blood vessel to the heart.
Each year in the United States, 25,000 people die from ruptured
aortas, the 13th leading cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to see a dramatic improvement in the quality and
number of stents available,'' said Katzen, 52, who has been the
Miami institute's director and lead researcher for 10 years.
``Patients have more alternatives that are minimally invasive today
and they will have even more in the near future.''

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: Group warns AIDS infection rate on rise
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After years of holding steady, HIV infection rates are
rising among young gay men in Atlanta, possibly because of
recreational drug abuse, an AIDS advocacy group is warning.
</P>
<P>
   The problem isn't contaminated syringe needles, the usual route
of infection when illegal drugs are involved. It's unprotected sex
that occurs when people are high and their inhibitions are low, due
to the influence of psychedelic drugs like Ecstasy and crystal
methamphetamine, say AID Atlanta officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a steady increase in the number of positive (HIV)
test results, particularly among young gay men,'' said Mark King,
director of education at the AIDS service organization.
``Anecdotally, what we're hearing is that very often substance
abuse has been a factor in their infection.''
</P>
<P>
   AID Atlanta, which offers free anonymous HIV testing, reports
that the number of positive test results in 1998 jumped by nearly
50 percent over 1997 figures _ even though the agency performed
fewer tests overall in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 2.7 percent of 4,144 people tested for HIV were
positive for the AIDS virus, compared to 1.8 percent of 4,290
tested in 1997. Before 1997, the percentage of positive HIV tests
had been flat for several years, so the spike in numbers raised
immediate concerns, King said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Georgia Department of Health does not yet track HIV
infections, it's unclear whether the higher percentage of positive
tests also is occurring statewide. AID Atlanta is one of the more
popular local agencies for HIV testing because its service is free.
Its clients include a wide cross-section of people at risk for
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   State health officials are working on a plan to track HIV
infections within the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, about 2 percent of people who take HIV tests are
found to be infected, said Paul Bartels, a prevention case manager
at AID Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that our (rate) is almost 3 percent is cause for
concern,'' Bartels said.
</P>
<P>
   Drug abuse and unsafe sex have become issues for the gay
community nationwide. The Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York
recently canceled an annual AIDS fund-raising party because it had
become associated with recreational drug use and unprotected sex.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, three ambulances were dispatched to a party at the
Colony Square Hotel attended primarily by gay men, King said,
because people had overdosed on gamma-hydroxybutyrate, or GHB,
which can cause blackouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have here is a culture in which substance use is
widely accepted and very little judgment is cast on it,'' King
said. But he emphasized that this drug culture thrives only in
small portion of the gay community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most gay men in the metro area live lives like all of us do,
they go to work and they go home, and are as surprised and
concerned about drug use as everyone else,'' King said. ``That
being said, I think there are after-hours dance clubs in which
certainly well over half the people in attendance are on one drug
or another. And I'm being conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lee Anisman, whose Buckhead practice, Pride Medical Group,
is roughly 70 percent gay males, said he is seeing a definite
correlation between overindulgence in drugs and alcohol and a new
wave of HIV infections, particularly in men in their 20s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is disheartening, to say the least,'' Anisman said.
``It's always a similar story: `I was out this weekend. . . I did
too many drugs, I mixed drugs with alcohol and I don't even
remember what I ended up doing. But I ended up in some stranger's
house, and I don't know if I used a condom.' Six months later they
show up HIV positive.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to these concerns, AID Atlanta and Pride Medical
Group are hosting a forum Wednesday to discuss the drug culture and
educate people about the risks of drug abuse. The forum, called
``BUZZED,'' is at 7 p.m. at Grady High School in midtown Atlanta.
(Information: 404-872-0600).
</P>
<P>
   King says the forum's purpose is not to criticize drug users,
but to inform them of the risks and to urge them to take
precautions against HIV infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can come to this forum and know you're not going to get
slammed, humiliated or lectured to,'' he said. ``If you just want
information about what this drug might do to you long-term, or how
to avoid overdosing, you will get it in a non-judgmental way.''
</P>
<P>
   King acknowledges that the agency's seminar will likely draw
fire from both those who feel drug use shouldn't be condoned and
those who say AID Atlanta is making much ado about nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to remember that our mission is to reduce HIV
infection,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   Drug abuse probably isn't the only element contributing to the
rising infection rates; complacency probably is a factor as well,
doctors and AIDS educators agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Younger people tend to underestimate the seriousness of HIV as
a disease,'' Bartels said.

people have the misperception that HIV is easily treated and

who have lived through much of the 20-year AIDS epidemic, are
emotionally exhausted and ready to relax their precautions.

Anisman said. ``There are also some people who feel, `I'm going to
get the virus anyway, so what's the difference?'

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: Group warns AIDS infection rate on rise
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After years of holding steady, HIV infection rates are
rising among young gay men in Atlanta, possibly because of
recreational drug abuse, an AIDS advocacy group is warning.
</P>
<P>
   The problem isn't contaminated syringe needles, the usual route
of infection when illegal drugs are involved. It's unprotected sex
that occurs when people are high and their inhibitions are low, due
to the influence of psychedelic drugs like Ecstasy and crystal
methamphetamine, say AID Atlanta officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a steady increase in the number of positive (HIV)
test results, particularly among young gay men,'' said Mark King,
director of education at the AIDS service organization.
``Anecdotally, what we're hearing is that very often substance
abuse has been a factor in their infection.''
</P>
<P>
   AID Atlanta, which offers free anonymous HIV testing, reports
that the number of positive test results in 1998 jumped by nearly
50 percent over 1997 figures _ even though the agency performed
fewer tests overall in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 2.7 percent of 4,144 people tested for HIV were
positive for the AIDS virus, compared to 1.8 percent of 4,290
tested in 1997. Before 1997, the percentage of positive HIV tests
had been flat for several years, so the spike in numbers raised
immediate concerns, King said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Georgia Department of Health does not yet track HIV
infections, it's unclear whether the higher percentage of positive
tests also is occurring statewide. AID Atlanta is one of the more
popular local agencies for HIV testing because its service is free.
Its clients include a wide cross-section of people at risk for
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   State health officials are working on a plan to track HIV
infections within the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, about 2 percent of people who take HIV tests are
found to be infected, said Paul Bartels, a prevention case manager
at AID Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that our (rate) is almost 3 percent is cause for
concern,'' Bartels said.
</P>
<P>
   Drug abuse and unsafe sex have become issues for the gay
community nationwide. The Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York
recently canceled an annual AIDS fund-raising party because it had
become associated with recreational drug use and unprotected sex.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, three ambulances were dispatched to a party at the
Colony Square Hotel attended primarily by gay men, King said,
because people had overdosed on gamma-hydroxybutyrate, or GHB,
which can cause blackouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have here is a culture in which substance use is
widely accepted and very little judgment is cast on it,'' King
said. But he emphasized that this drug culture thrives only in
small portion of the gay community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most gay men in the metro area live lives like all of us do,
they go to work and they go home, and are as surprised and
concerned about drug use as everyone else,'' King said. ``That
being said, I think there are after-hours dance clubs in which
certainly well over half the people in attendance are on one drug
or another. And I'm being conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lee Anisman, whose Buckhead practice, Pride Medical Group,
is roughly 70 percent gay males, said he is seeing a definite
correlation between overindulgence in drugs and alcohol and a new
wave of HIV infections, particularly in men in their 20s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is disheartening, to say the least,'' Anisman said.
``It's always a similar story: `I was out this weekend. . . I did
too many drugs, I mixed drugs with alcohol and I don't even
remember what I ended up doing. But I ended up in some stranger's
house, and I don't know if I used a condom.' Six months later they
show up HIV positive.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to these concerns, AID Atlanta and Pride Medical
Group are hosting a forum Wednesday to discuss the drug culture and
educate people about the risks of drug abuse. The forum, called
``BUZZED,'' is at 7 p.m. at Grady High School in midtown Atlanta.
(Information: 404-872-0600).
</P>
<P>
   King says the forum's purpose is not to criticize drug users,
but to inform them of the risks and to urge them to take
precautions against HIV infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can come to this forum and know you're not going to get
slammed, humiliated or lectured to,'' he said. ``If you just want
information about what this drug might do to you long-term, or how
to avoid overdosing, you will get it in a non-judgmental way.''
</P>
<P>
   King acknowledges that the agency's seminar will likely draw
fire from both those who feel drug use shouldn't be condoned and
those who say AID Atlanta is making much ado about nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to remember that our mission is to reduce HIV
infection,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   Drug abuse probably isn't the only element contributing to the
rising infection rates; complacency probably is a factor as well,
doctors and AIDS educators agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Younger people tend to underestimate the seriousness of HIV as
a disease,'' Bartels said.
</P>
<P>
   Because powerful new drugs have greatly extended the life spans
of HIV-positive people and improved their quality of life, many
people have the misperception that HIV is easily treated and
controlled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a patient say to me, `Oh, it's just like living with
diabetes,' '' said Charles Dickey, a therapist with Anisman's
practice. ``That is totally erroneous.''
</P>
<P>
   The HIV drugs exact an enormous price, both financially and

 &HT;    Two-thirds of Americans believe Ray didn't act alone in King's
death, poll shows
 &HT;    WITH POLLSIDE
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Only one man was ever sought or charged in the
assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., but 31 years
after King's death, more than two-thirds of the country believes
that others besides James Earl Ray were involved in the killing, a
new Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll reveals.
</P>
<P>
   Results of the Journal-Constitution's Southern Focus Poll
suggest that the percentage of Americans who believe Ray was not
involved at all in the King shooting is greater than those who
believe Ray acted alone.
</P>
<P>
   Ray pleaded guilty in 1969 to killing the civil rights leader
but recanted within days. He maintained his innocence until his
death in April at the age of 70. The King family believes Ray is
innocent and supported his efforts over the last few years to
obtain the trial that he circumvented with his plea.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone poll showed that 12 percent of the public believes
Ray alone was reponsible. An additional 46 percent of Americans
believe Ray was partly responsible for King's death but others were
probably involved. Another 25 percent of Southerners (23 percent of
non-Southerners) believe that people other than Ray killed King.
The remainder said they didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 818 Southerners and 394 non-Southerners was
conducted Sept. 23-Nov. 15, 1998, and has a margin of error of plus
or minus 5 percentage points. Generally, there was little regional
difference in the responses given by Southerners and
non-Southerners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very happy that other people share our conclusions that
there were others involved,'' said Dexter Scott King, son of the
slain civil rights leader. ``It's encouraging because ... there was
never a full-blown trial to get to the bottom of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   At the instigation of the Kings, the Justice Department opened a
limited probe last year to investigate documents a former FBI agent
said he found in Ray's car in 1968 and also claims by a former
Memphis restaurant owner that he was paid $100,000 to hire an
assassin to kill King. The probe is continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Though most respondents said they believed others besides Ray
were involved, there was less support for more investigation.
Fifty-five percent of Southern and non-Southern respondents believe
no further investigation is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to stop dredging all this stuff up,'' said poll
respondent Amy Cecil, a 49-year-old nursing home employee from
Lexington, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Dexter King said some people may feel a sense of hopelessness
because the murder happened such a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's understandable,'' he said. ``People honestly feel that
there's nothing that can be done, so why waste your time?''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five percent of poll respondents (and 50 percent of
African-American respondents) said they would like to see more
federal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many questions,'' said Beverly Niemzak, 40, a
homemaker in Gadsden, Ala. ``I don't know that the investigation
was ever taken far enough. ... There are too many things that just
shout that it wasn't done the right way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it was the government or something like that.
Just other people who had the same sentiments as him (Ray).''
</P>
<P>
   The House Select Committee on Assassinations reached a similar
conclusion in 1978 when it said after a two-year investigation that
Ray likely was involved in a conspiracy with two white supremacists
from St. Louis who were already dead by the time of the panel's
probe.
</P>
<P>
   African-Americans in particular are likely to believe people
other than Ray were involved. In the South, 42 percent of blacks
said they believed Ray was not involved in the slaying, that others
were responsible. Outside the South, 46 percent of blacks believed
Ray was innocent of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothea Wise, a 34-year-old African-American from Durham, N.C.,
typified the response.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government may have had a little play in it,'' said Wise,
a customer service representative for Central Carolina Bank.
``James Earl Ray was just the man to be used and to take the fall
for everybody else. He was just a pawn.''
</P>
<P>
   On one point, poll respondents reached a strong consensus:
King's family has done a good job of preserving his memory.
</P>
<P>
   Despite complaints by some critics that the Kings have not done
as much as they could have to carry on King's work, the family got
high grades from most Americans _ an ``A'' grade from 50 percent of
Southerners and 47 percent of non-Southerners, and a ``B'' from 24
percent in the South and 26 percent of people in the rest of the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very encouraged by that,'' Dexter King said. ``We have
always sought to continue and follow in my father's footsteps by
the example he set through service to others. In spite of the
controversy out there, people realize we're committed to our work
and our cause.''

 &HT;    Documents' legitimacy `positive development' in probe of King
death
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For former FBI agent Donald Wilson, there is some
sense of vindication.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Wilson came forward with two documents he said he
retrieved from James Earl Ray's car in Atlanta in April 1968 but
had kept hidden for 30 years. At the time, a bureau spokesman
called the documents a ``total fabrication.''
</P>
<P>
   However, scientific examination of the documents since then
suggests that they could be legitimate, according to federal
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   While that characterization falls short of confirming the
documents' validity, Wilson said he believed that was ``a very
positive development.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's encouraging,'' said Dexter Scott King. ``I hope this will
lead to something.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno ordered a limited probe in August
into two aspects of the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr. in Memphis, Tenn., on April 4, 1968: Wilson's documents
and a public statement by former restaurant owner Loyd Jowers that
a mobster paid him $100,000 to hire a hit man. Reno approved the
investigation at the urging of Coretta Scott King and her four
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investigation is well under way,'' said Justice Department
spokesman Myron Marlin, who declined to give a timetable for when
the probe might be completed.
</P>
<P>
   Jowers' attorney, Lewis Garrison, said his client wants to
receive immunity before talking with Justice Department
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're calling and writing pretty regularly,'' Garrison said
of the federal investigators. ``But he's still a little fearful.''
</P>
<P>
   Jowers, 72 and in ill health, used to own a restaurant on the
ground floor of the building from which authorities say Ray fired
the fatal shot from a second-floor bathroom window. Jowers has told
the Kings that the shot came from a brushy area behind the
restaurant and that the shooter handed him the rifle moments after
the assassination. Jowers claims to have hidden the rifle and then
given it to an unnamed conspirator the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, who died in April at age 70 from liver disease, claimed he
was set up by a smuggler he only knew as Raul. Ray had pleaded
guilty in 1969 in exchange for a 99-year sentence but recanted
within days and tried unsuccessfully to obtain a trial. The King
family supported his efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings point to Wilson's documents as significant because
both have the name ``Raul'' written on them. ``That speaks for
itself,'' Wilson said. ``It doesn't extricate Ray from the arena of
responsibility, but it gives credibility to the existence of this
mystery man Raul.''

 &HT;    Park works on plan for Everglades
 &HT;    By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The federal government's $7.8 billion
Everglades rescue plan would provide more water for suburbs while
failing to restore South Florida's marshes and bays, scientists at
Everglades National Park say.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than scrap the plan, park leaders say they want to
help the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers fix it.
</P>
<P>
   That fixing has gone on furiously in recent weeks, as corps
engineers, South Florida water managers and other federal and state
officials have looked for ways to put more water into the park
during rainy seasons without drowning marshes to the north.
</P>
<P>
   But time is running short: The corps is set to finish the plan's
final draft in April, three months before submitting it to
Congress. Environmentalists, farmers and water utility directors
are trying to shape the blueprint.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists, heartened by the plan yet frustrated by its
shortcomings, said they hope the park's blunt critique can help
steer it closer to a true Everglades restoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're far apart at all,'' park Superintendent
Richard Ring said Friday after meeting in Washington with corps
restoration chief Stu Appelbaum and other federal officials. ``The
(plan) does a lot of good things. It doesn't get close enough in
certain key areas.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the park's scientists concluded Dec. 31 that the corps'
draft proposal _ made public in October _ would not fully restore
any part of the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   They said it would only add modest amounts of water to estuaries
in the southern part of the park, and could undermine pollution
cleanup efforts. It would leave too much territory fragmented by
canals and levees, especially in the northern Everglades. And
cities and suburbs would see big boosts in their water supplies
long before most of the environment got help.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is insufficient evidence to substantiate the claims that
(the plan) will result in the recovery of a healthy, sustainable
ecosystem,'' the scientists wrote. ``Rather, we find substantial,
credible, and compelling evidence to the contrary.''
</P>
<P>
   The corps' proposal is aimed at creating more than 300 wells and
251,000 acres of marshes, reservoirs and quarries _ enough land to
blanket Manhattan a dozen times _ to reverse some of the worst
features of the South Florida's federally created drainage system.
</P>
<P>
   The engineers say the new features would store hundreds of
billions of gallons of water that canals now flush in muddy
torrents out to sea. That water would serve the region's growing
population, expected to double in the next 50 years, while
restoring some of the free flows that farming and development have
robbed from the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Other state and federal agencies have offered more positive
critiques, asserting that the plan would improve fishing in Lake
Okeechobee and Florida Bay, prevent droughts and aid imperiled
endangered species such as wood storks and manatees.
</P>
<P>
   Even Ring offered a conciliatory message in a letter to the
corps Thursday (1/14), saying the plan would create ``substantial
improvements'' over South Florida's sprawl-ridden status quo.
</P>
<P>
   He said Friday that his agency's criticisms were meant to help
the corps, not attack it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure wouldn't want anybody beating around the bush on
anything the park service was doing,'' Ring said.
</P>
<P>
   The corps' Appelbaum added: ``These issues are not new issues.
We've been working steadily to make progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, the corps and other agencies have drafted proposals for
looping additional water from the West Palm Beach Canal and other
coastal waterways back into the Everglades. They also have sped up
their proposed timetable for elevating a stretch of Tamiami Trail
so water can sluice more freely into the park.
</P>
<P>
   Ring and Appelbaum said it's too early to say how much the new
features would add to the project's price, which is already
expected to be roughly $400 million a year for 20 years. Park
scientists said the plan should include a proposal to scrape
polluted muck from the bottom of Lake Okeechobee, which could cost
$1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups largely support the corps plan, calling it
the Everglades' last chance. Still, some activists have organized a
telephone campaign to buoy Ring and his staff, Broward County
environmentalist Patti Webster said.
</P>
<P>
   Their message: ``Stick to your guns,'' Webster said.

 &HT;    `Kiplinger' rates Fla. prepaid college plan among worst in U.S.
 &HT;    By Don Horine
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ With a couple of weeks to go until the
1998-99 enrollment deadline, the Florida Prepaid College Program
got some unwanted publicity last week: A respected national
publication ripped the program as one of the worst in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The prepaid tuition programs run by Florida and Alabama received
grades of C- _ the two lowest ratings _ by Kiplinger's Personal
Finance Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   There were two reasons. First, Kiplinger's said it considers
savings plans _ which 20 states have in place and 20 others are
planning to start _ as superior to prepaid-tuition plans because
they have a gentler impact on financial aid eligibility and have
the potential of earning higher returns because they are usually
invested partly in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Kiplinger's noted, Florida and Alabama require
purchasers to take on a risk that other states do not. If a student
for whom a Florida or Alabama contract has been purchased doesn't
go to college, the purchaser gets back only the amount put in _
with no interest.
</P>
<P>
   In prepaid-tuition plans, purchasers pay for four years of
college and sometimes dormitory costs at current prices. When a
student is ready for his freshman year, the account will cover
tuition, no matter how much it has gone up.
</P>
<P>
   According to Florida officials, its plan is the largest of its
kind in the country, having sold more contracts than all other
states combined. By Jan. 29, when the current enrollment period
ends, officials project the program will have sold 500,000
contracts since 1987, most of them for tuition and others for
housing.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Wallace, executive director of Florida's program, disagreed
with Kiplinger's assessment that investment plans were better than
prepaid plans. While purchasers of investment plans can earn
interest, they also run the risk of losing a lot if the economy
goes downhill, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under our program, no matter what happens to you, or inflation
or the economy or the cost of education, you are guaranteed your
costs will be paid for,'' he said. ``You can't put a price tag on
that. They didn't give good enough weight to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace agreed with Kiplinger's that Florida imposes a heavy
penalty if a student doesn't use the plan. To minimize that, he
said, officials are asking the legislature this year to allow
students to receive as much money from their prepaid plan toward
tuition at a trade school as they would have received under a state
university or community college contract.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace doubted the article would have much of an effect on the
number of signed contracts returned by Jan. 29. About
three-quarters of the contracts usually come in during the last two
weeks ``and I suspect it'll be the same this year,'' he said.53E

 &HT;    `Flaring' satellites ignite astronomical debate
 &HT;    By Michael Browning
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Piercing the night with sudden shards of
light, a new globe-girdling array of 79 communications satellites
called Iridium, lofted by Motorola Inc., is already arcing across
the heavens, emitting brilliant ``flares'' from their
super-reflective antenna-panels, bedazzling and bedeviling
astronomers by turns.
</P>
<P>
   For earthlings able to afford the $3,000 cellphones capable of
using the satellites, the Iridium satellites are a modern miracle,
enabling instant wireless voice and data communication between any
two points, anywhere on the planet. The $500 pager units for the
network are manufactured locally, at Motorola's Boynton Beach
plant. The $5 billion system has already been successfully tested,
and Motorola hopes to have 5 million subscribers by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Six necklaces of 11 satellites each now surround the earth,
arrayed longitudinally, creating a bead-like electronic cage within
which the world slowly spins. Because some of the satellites have
malfunctioned and others are being used as backups, there are 13
more aloft than are actually needed.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere on Earth is unreachable anymore, thanks to this new
network.
</P>
<P>
   But an unanticipated side effect of the satellites _ brilliant
solar reflections of light as they pass overhead _ has caused
concern among astronomers, some of whom see the satellites as yet
another source of light pollution in a world where the magic and
majesty of the star-sown night sky are already under assault from
myriad streetlights and neon signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think it's a shame that yet another natural resource
has to be ruined by an unregulated commercial venture,'' said Mike
Stebbins, a computer analyst who is past president of the New
Hampshire Astronomical Society. ``Why should those of us who do not
wish to call the North Pole have to endure the clutter of those who
do?''
</P>
<P>
   Too new to gauge effect
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Fredrickson, president of the Astronomical Society of
the Palm Beaches, said the flares were too new a phenomenon to have
impacted club members yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect that eventually the Iridium flares will become a
nuisance to people taking shots of different parts of the sky,
looking for comets, asteroids and novae in distant galaxies,''
Fredrickson said. ``We will have a ROBOscope project doing exactly
that, and I feel like it's just a matter of time before someone
takes a picture of one of these flares.''
</P>
<P>
   But, added Fredrickson, for people who are interested in
satellites, rockets and space flight, rather than ``pure
astronomy,'' the flares may prove exciting.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer intensity of the Iridium flares has to be seen to be
believed. For up to 20 seconds, the evening or early morning sky
will suddenly emit an eye-needling flash, 100 times brighter than
the planet Venus, equal to all the light of a crescent moon. Then,
as swiftly and unexpectedly as it appeared, the spark of light
vanishes.
</P>
<P>
   So bright are the flares that they can sometimes be seen in
broad daylight.
</P>
<P>
   Computer programs available over the Internet can help predict
to the second exactly when the flares will be visible and precisely
where in the sky they will appear.
</P>
<P>
   Renowned satellite observer Paul Maley, of the NASA/Johnson
Space Center Astronomical Society, was the first to correctly
identify the cause of the flares in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I learned that a bright glint had been observed by one
amateur astronomer in Canada (Dr. Brian K. Hunter of Ontario), then
another, it occurred to me that these might not be accidents,'' he
recalled. ``Many satellites can occasionally flare up to look like
very bright stars for short periods. But the super high brightness
of the Iridiums was the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the days went on, I began to do some reading on the
constellation design. Through professional contacts I was able to
get in touch with someone at Motorola. After that, things began to
fall into place.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the designers at Motorola were as surprised as
anyone to find that the satellites were flaring. It turned out that
the triple-vaned door-size Main Mission Antennas (MMAs), made of
aluminum and coated with silverized Teflon, were almost perfect
mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-degree tilt of the antennas away from the axis of the
satellite would catch the sunlight and flash it down to Earth at
certain times and in certain places.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite watchers began to speak of the ``Golden Hour'' and the
``box,'' the time and place in the sky where Iridium flares were
most likely to appear.
</P>
<P>
   The satellites do not always live up to predictions. Some are
tumbling in orbit, useless. Others, for reasons as yet unexplained,
flare twice. The brightness of the flares varies, depending on how
far away from the center of the satellite's exact north-south path
the observer is standing; they are brightest in a narrow swath
about three miles wide.
</P>
<P>
   Two computer programmers, Rob Matson and Randy John, wrote a
program that is available on the Internet
(http://members.aol.com/skysatrj/) and Maley still recalls the
thrill of awaiting the launching of multiple Iridium satellites
aboard American, Russian and Chinese rockets. As the satellites
slipped into north-south orbit, all five flared gloriously, in
sequence.
</P>
<P>
   ``In August 1997, I was able to videotape the flaring of all
five recently launched objects within a two-minute period as they
passed west of Houston,'' Maley said. ``It was quite unbelievable
to see one after the other brightening up to surpass the brilliance
of every star in the sky that morning.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iridium satellites contain no iridium. The name comes from a
miscalculated number. It was originally believed that 77 satellites
would be needed to cover the Earth completely, and 77 was the
atomic number for iridium on the periodic table of elements. Later
it was found that only 66 were needed, but since 66 was the atomic
number for the element dysprosium, and ``dysprosium'' doesn't sound
as catchy as ``iridium,'' Motorola decided to keep the original
name.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike high-orbit communication satellites, which relay a
terrestrial signal straight back to Earth, the Iridium array move
in low Earth orbit, handing off the signal from one satellite to
the next, like the baton in a relay race, until it reaches the
proper destination and is beamed down to a ground relay station.
Because the satellites travel north to south and south to north in
six orbital planes, the farther north or south you are, the more
flares you will see.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the North Pole, theoretically you could see as many as
1,000 flares a month,'' Maley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Blessing or a Curse?'' asked Florida-based astronomer Philip
Chien in one of the first articles to discuss the Iridium flares,
in the May 1998 issue of Sky &AMP; Telescope. Chien concluded that,
because the flares are so brief, and relatively predictable,
astronomers ought to be able to plan around them.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of other light pollution
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more than 8,000 artificial objects in space, and
every one of them has the potential for leaving a streak on a
long-duration photographic exposure. So in percentage terms,
(these) additional objects and a handful of upper rocket stages do
not add up to a very large addition,'' Chien wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider the Iridium satellites as `light pollution,'
'' said Lee Dolan, responding to a question posted in connection
with this article on CompuServe's Astronomy Forum. ``Around where I
live (in a garden condominium complex) there are bright sodium
vapor lamps under the eaves, and I have enough trouble finding a
place around here where I don't have any lights shining in my eyes.
Tell me about light pollution!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I must admit to being an Iridium addict,'' e-mailed Malcolm
Ellis of Cambridgeshire, England, replying to the same question.
``I find the predictability a great boon and conversation piece,
when I can say to friends, `Come outside and see this.' And there
spot, on time, a glorious flare. Even my 3-year-old grandson and
6-year-old granddaughter are impressed with my apparent
knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Maley believes the satellites are an exciting new celestial
phenomenon, one that should literally spark people's interest in
the heavens. ``They are so highly visible, they are bound to draw
the public's attention to the sky.''
</P>

 &HT;    Paying the state's tobacco lawyers: It's not over yet
 &HT;    By Osler McCarthy
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The great Texas tobacco case was supposed to be
over.
</P>
<P>
   The injured party _ the state of Texas _ has been getting money
from its judgment in the largest single legal settlement in
history. The state's lawyers have already received their first $200
million paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   Squabbling and fighting and hair-pulling over the attorneys'
fees all was supposed to have ended.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The $17.3 billion Texas tobacco litigation is destined for
another stop in federal court to find a way to settle the festering
dispute over how much the five private lawyers hired by the state
should be paid.
</P>
<P>
   At issue: Attorney General John Cornyn, who has been on the job
for two weeks, has announced an investigation of the lawyers'
conduct. He says they might have acted illegally or unethically in
representing the state. If he were to allege wrongdoing, he could
sue the lawyers, who were hired by his predecessor. If he were to
win, he could strip them of any fees in the case.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands now, the lawyers are being paid by the tobacco
industry. But a pending federal court order awards the lawyers part
of the state's take in the case. Because of Cornyn's investigation,
they have refused to sign over their right to being paid by the
state instead of the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he wants us to do is to renounce the court order
immediately while he, Cornyn, takes his sweet time investigating,''
said University of Texas law professor Charles Silver, who
represents the lawyers former Attorney General Dan Morales hired.
``Why should we go on forever litigating this?''
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of taxpayers footing the bill for legal fees is
the very thing that Cornyn and fellow Republican Gov. George W.
Bush have worked to guard against throughout the long-running
dispute over fees.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco lawsuit sought to reimburse the state for the cost
of treating ill smokers. The case was settled in January 1998
without going to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn has said the attorney fees being paid by the tobacco
industry _ calculated at $3.3 billion over 25 years _ are too high.
He rekindled fears last week that he might try to challenge the
fees, which were set by an arbitration panel. In a letter last week
to John Eddie Williams of Houston, one of the private lawyers,
Cornyn said the fee is ``clearly excessive and unreasonable.'' He
wrote that the lawyers ``should be more than satisfied with a
smaller award.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver said the prospect that Cornyn may be trying to force a
showdown on fees could force them to litigate Cornyn's concerns
before the federal judge supervising the lawsuit and perhaps to
choose to collect from the state. The alternative could be facing a
suit brought by Cornyn in state court, before a new judge
unfamiliar with the case.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over attorney's fees flared anew two weeks ago when
the private lawyers asked U.S. District Judge David Folsom for more
time before making their decision to take their fee from the
tobacco companies. Under an agreement with Bush and seven
legislators who sued to protest the attorney fees, all agreed to
let arbitrators decide the amount of the fees the tobacco companies
would pay. The agreement left open the option for the lawyers to be
paid by the state.
</P>
<P>
   When the lawyers refused to sign away that option on Dec. 30,
Bush and Cornyn characterized that as an attempt by the lawyers to
get more money from the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Cornyn would oppose any effort from these attorneys to
come after any taxpayer money,'' said Cornyn's spokesman, Ted
Delisi.
</P>
<P>
   Silver said his clients simply want to give Cornyn time to
complete his investigation and had no intention of asking the state
for more money. But he said if Cornyn challenges the arbitration
award, the lawyers might be forced to come after the state for
their paycheck. The arbitrators awarded the lawyers 19 percent of
the state's $17.3 billion award _ calculated to be $3.3 billion
over 25 years. The federal court order set their fee at 15 percent
of the state's award _ or $2.6 billion over 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Cornyn was not threatening to challenge their
arbitration fees, the lawyers might be better off claiming their
money from the state. Under the rules of multibillion-dollar
finance, $2.6 billion could be worth more than $3.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That's because if the lawyers collect from the state, they could
file and lien and take their money up front. Because of inflation,
$2.6 billion now would be worth more than $2.6 billion 25 years
from now.
</P>
<P>
   If the private attorneys collect from the tobacco companies,
they must be paid from a $500 million a year fund set up to pay
lawyers in all the states' tobacco cases. That amount would not
grow with inflation and would become smaller over time, as more and
more lawyers who sued the industry on behalf of other states share
in the pot of money.
</P>
<P>
   The private lawyers have asked for a conference with Folsom, who
is expected to set a hearing soon. Cornyn has not offered details
of the possible wrongdoing his office is investigating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to investigate the facts surrounding the tobacco
litigation to determine if civil or criminal wrongdoing has been
committed,'' he said last week, without offering details.
</P>
<P>
   Some, including the private lawyers, have questioned whether
Houston attorney Marc Murr, who was awarded $1 million in fees,
performed any substantive work on the case. Morales hired Murr, a
friend and former colleague, as an adviser on the case. Others have
said the private lawyers might have acted against the state's
interest by arranging to be paid separately from the state instead
of letting the full award come to the state and then taking their
share from that.
</P>
<P>
   Morales said Cornyn's investigation is a proper step for a new
officeholder _ and he is confident Cornyn will find everything was
proper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Admittedly, this has been a complex and sophisticated
litigation matter,'' Morales said. ``I do not begrudge John one
iota to fully investigation the litigation.''

in decades has set off a frenzy among Republican and Democratic
prospects who believe they must begin to raise money almost
immediately or they may find it impossible to catch up. In many
ways, this year is more crucial than 2000 in determining whom the

agree, for now the survival of candidates comes down not to issue

   MILITARY-SPENDING (Washington) _ Not much has changed in the
office deep inside the Pentagon where Franklin C. Spinney has
worked ever since he had a few moments of notoriety in the 1980s
with this shocking assessment: the more Reagan spent on defense,
the less the military was ready to fight. Nearly two decades later,
Clinton has proposed the largest increase in Pentagon spending
since those heady days, and to Spinney (and a few stray voices in
Washington), the same is true today. By Steven Lee Myers.

 &HT;    Child abuse resulting in death reflects trend
 &HT;    By Shannon Joyce
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ In the past month, authorities believe
two Western Slope children were killed and one was seriously
injured by men who were caring for them but who were not their
biological fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Local mental health and social service professionals say the
incidents reflect a dangerous pattern among young parents who
cannot control their anger.
</P>
<P>
   And if the cases are proven in court, these incidences would
parallel national statistics that show when a child is abused by a
person who is not the biological parent, eight times out of 10 it's
a man.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we tend to see in young parents is the inability to deal
with the frustrations of child rearing and their own feelings,''
said Tom Papin, director of the Mesa County Department of Human
Services.
</P>
<P>
   When these parents become frustrated or angry with their kids,
Papin said, they often resort to beatings.
</P>
<P>
   But Sally Schaefer, the CEO of Hilltop Community Resources Inc.,
a local organization that provides social services to young
parents, said it's more than the men not being able to control
their tempers. Fathers, Schaefer said _ especially those who are
the primary caretakers of their children or stepchildren _ have
fewer places to turn for help than young mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer said Hilltop has a pre-natal care program and a support
group for young mothers, but the funding for its young fathers
program was cut several years ago. Several local organizations
offer parenting classes for couples, she said, but the lack of
programs aimed at young men and their problems creates a detectable
void.
</P>
<P>
   According to authorities, the recent spate of high-profile child
abuse cases started two weeks before Christmas:
</P>
<P>
   _ On Dec. 10, 1998, Ashley Brown, 3, suffered at least three
blows to her head, immediately knocking her unconscious. She died a
week later.
</P>
<P>
   Her stepfather, Michael Hunter, 18, was arrested and charged
with first-degree murder and child abuse resulting in death. Hunter
said Ashley fell from a two-foot tall doll house onto a carpeted
floor and then wouldn't wake up after she took a nap, according to
court records.
</P>
<P>
   Court records stated Hunter has an extensive criminal record,
including convictions for burglary and arson. He was cited with
child abuse and neglect on Nov. 20, 1998, for allowing Ashley's
sister to play in the street.
</P>
<P>
   _ On Jan. 4, 14-month-old Kayanna Pierce suffered three fatal
skull fractures, according to court records. Her mother's
boyfriend, Jeremiah ``Jerry'' Duran, 20, was arrested and charged
with first-degree murder in the death. Duran and the girl's mother,
Bethany Gerard, told investigators the girl was choking and stopped
breathing, according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   Both Duran and Gerard had been investigated for child abuse
twice, according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   _ On Jan. 5, a 3-year-old Montrose boy was allegedly beaten and
submerged in scalding water, suffering second-degree burns, police
said. Christopher Krebs, 25, the child's mother's boyfriend, was
arrested and held in jail in the boy's beating.
</P>
<P>
   Krebs said the boy fell into the water, but authorities didn't
find any injuries to suggest the boy tried to catch himself from
falling, according to court records. The boy's biological father
said he had also expressed concerns that the boy and his 6-year-old
brother might have been abused.
</P>
<P>
   There are some similarities between either all or some of the
cases. For example, Krebs and Duran are not married to the alleged
victims' mothers, and Krebs and Hunter were watching the toddlers
while their mothers worked when the injuries occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Also, all three cases reflect trends found in studies of child
abuse, including that when a child is abused by someone who is not
a parent, the abuser is likely to be a young man.
</P>
<P>
   A study published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services in 1993 stated 28 percent of abused children are abused by
someone who is not their biological parent. Of those children, 90
percent were abused by a man and 40 percent were abused by someone
under the age of 26.
</P>
<P>
   For children who are abused by a biological parent, the abusers
are almost evenly split between mothers and fathers.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of a child's death, Papin, with the Mesa County
Department of Human Services, said many people wonder why the child
wasn't removed from the home before the child died.
</P>
<P>
   Because of confidentiality rules, Papin said he could not
comment on specific cases. But he said, even if the person has a
past criminal history, Human Services can do little without clear
evidence the child is in danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't take every child out of the home,'' Papin said.
``There are so many gray areas; we can't just walk in and shoot
from the hip.''
</P>
<P>
   In a case like Ashley's, when the suspect in a child's murder
was investigated by his agency, Papin said Human Services conducts
an internal review of the agency's work and files a report with the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Legally, there's not much else concerned parents can do if they
suspect a stepparent or partner of their ex-spouse is abusing their
child. In addition to filing a complaint with Human Services, the
law also allows parents to file a complaint in divorce court.
</P>
<P>
   If the person has a violent criminal history, a judge can
prohibit a parent or stepparent from having contact with the child.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a perception regarding the power we have,'' Papin
said. ``We don't have the authority to remove a child.''
</P>
<P>
   Papin said social workers work closely with law enforcement
officers, the child's school, the courts and the Colorado West
Mental Heath Center on each case.
</P>
<P>
   Once a complaint is received, he said, social workers review any
past complaints and develop a plan of action.
</P>
<P>
   Usually a social worker is sent to the home to interview the
family and decide if the children are safe, Papin said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's first goal is to keep a family together, Papin
said, but if caseworkers believe the child is in danger, either the
police or the courts can help them remove the child from the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are checks and balances,'' Papin said. ``We can't send a
social worker to your house and say, `Give me your kid.''' In some
cases, Papin said, the case is closed during the initial review; in
others, the separated family has to follow a regimen of counseling
and supervised visitation.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer, with Hilltop, and Papin agree that in many cases, the
counseling must focus on ways to deal with anger.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer said unless a parent knows other disciplinary
techniques, inexperienced parents revert back to basic emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have parenting skills, you go to the basic
instincts; yelling and hitting,'' Schaefer said. ``If you don't
have any other tools, that's what's left.''

<P>
   San Francisco writer  &UR; Marilyn Wann &LR; 's piercingly funny _ OK,
jolly, but the word seems un-PC _ book ``Fat!So?'' (Ten Speed;
$12.95) includes a set of cut-out trading cards portraying ``The
Heroes and Villains of Fat History.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the villains: Weight Watcher  &UR; Jean Nidetch &LR; ; cq  &UR; Irving &LR; 
 &UR; Fisher &LR; , who invented calorie-counting in 1906; and former Surgeon
General &UR; C. Everett Koop, &LR;  who held a news conference to ``declare
war on fat (and fatsoes).''
</P>
<P>
   Among the heroes: Wagnerian soprano  &UR; Amalie Materna &LR; , who
``created the fat lady icon in opera'';  &UR; Saartjie Baartman &LR; , a
South African tribal woman who became a circus attraction, the
Hottentot Venus; and  &UR; Rene Laennec &LR; , inventor of the stethoscope.
</P>
<P>
   Wann quotes Laennec's account of examining a fat young woman in
1816. ``Owing to her stoutness little information could be gathered
by application of the hand and percussion. ... I recalled a
well-known acoustic phenomenon: namely, if you place your ear
against one end of a wooden beam the scratch of a pin at the other
extremity is most distinctly audible. ... Taking a sheaf of paper I
rolled it into a very tight roll. ... I was both surprised and
gratified at being able to hear the beating of the heart with much
greater clearness and distinctness than I had ever done before.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; IN THE THICK OF BATTLE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco writer  &UR; Marilyn Wann &LR; 's piercingly funny _ OK,
jolly, but the word seems un-PC _ book ``Fat!So?'' (Ten Speed;
$12.95) includes a set of cut-out trading cards portraying ``The
Heroes and Villains of Fat History.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the villains: Weight Watcher  &UR; Jean Nidetch &LR; ; cq  &UR; Irving &LR; 
 &UR; Fisher &LR; , who invented calorie-counting in 1906; and former Surgeon
General &UR; C. Everett Koop, &LR;  who held a news conference to ``declare
war on fat (and fatsoes).''
</P>
<P>
   Among the heroes: Wagnerian soprano  &UR; Amalie Materna &LR; , who
``created the fat lady icon in opera'';  &UR; Saartjie Baartman &LR; , a
South African tribal woman who became a circus attraction, the
Hottentot Venus; and  &UR; Rene Laennec &LR; , inventor of the stethoscope.
</P>
<P>
   Wann quotes Laennec's account of examining a fat young woman in
1816. ``Owing to her stoutness little information could be gathered
by application of the hand and percussion. ... I recalled a
well-known acoustic phenomenon: namely, if you place your ear
against one end of a wooden beam the scratch of a pin at the other
extremity is most distinctly audible. ... Taking a sheaf of paper I
rolled it into a very tight roll. ... I was both surprised and
gratified at being able to hear the beating of the heart with much
greater clearness and distinctness than I had ever done before.''

</P>
<P>
   The tramps are coming. Samuel Beckett's immortal tramps,
Vladimir and Estragon, that is. In Chicago Monday night, they will
be swapping vaudeville routines and musing metaphysically at the
Goodman Theater in ``Waiting for Godot.'' Starring Andre De Shields
and Ross Lehman and directed by Michael Maggio, the production will
run through Feb. 20. Information: (312) 443-3800.

   HOUSE HUNTING
</P>
<P>
   In 1754, trustees of the British Museum, founded by an act of
Parliament a year earlier, purchased for the museum's home, the
Montagu House, which stood among fields and streams on the
outskirts of London in Bloomsbury. Montagu House was soon outgrown
as the collections of books, manuscripts, natural history specimens
and antiquities increased. In 1823, Robert Smirke was commissioned
to design a home that, with its Greek Revival facade, has become
the international symbol of a museum. The institution is still
growing and changing, and from Saturday to April 18 it will be the
subject of ``Building the British Museum,'' an exhibition devoted
to the history of the homes it has occupied for nearly 250 years.

   TRAVEL NEWS
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Today's news is that the London Symphony Orchestra,
led by Sir Colin Davis, will play this week in New Jersey and New
York. Yesteryear's news is that the orchestra, founded in 1904, was
to arrive in 1912 aboard the RMS Titanic to begin the first U.S.
tour by a British orchestra. But when the 21-day, 23-city,
32-concert tour was rescheduled from late April to April 2, the
ensemble departed on March 28 aboard the RMS Baltic. The oldest
surviving orchestra in London will be spotlighting Edward Elgar
(its music director in 1911-12) and Beethoven on Saturday at
Prudential Hall at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark
and at Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center on Sunday and Jan. 25
and 26 in the Great Performers' series ``The Glory of Britain: Sir
Edward Elgar.'' P.S.: This time, the orchestra will arrive by
plane. Information, New Jersey: (888) 466-5722. Information, New
York: (212) 721-6500.

   LOCAL HERO
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ His name adorns streets, avenues, parks,
neighborhoods, bridges and a triumphal arch. But George Washington
(1732-1799), commander in chief of the Continental Army and first
president of the United States, was not a New Yorker. Still, as a
general, he knew victory and defeat in New York and as president he
was a New York resident from April 1789 to the summer of 1790. From
Saturday through July 4, the city as he experienced it will be the
focus of ``Washington's New York,'' an exhibition at the Museum of
the City of New York comprising art and artifacts from the
Revolution through his presidency. Information: (212) 534-1672.

   Marine Midland Bank in Buffalo, a unit of HSBC Group, has named
Partners &AMP; Shevack/Wolf in New York, part of Wolf Group, to handle
its marketing communications account, which had been at the Buffalo
office of Eric Mower &AMP; Associates. Billings were estimated at $25
million.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after a three-month review that had been
narrowed to Shevack/Wolf and two other New York-based finalists,
both of which withdrew from consideration in November: the Bates
USA unit of Cordiant Communications Group PLC and the D'Arcy Masius
Benton &AMP; Bowles Communications unit of MacManus Group.
</P>
<P>
   DDB Needham Ends Bermuda Relationship
</P>
<P>
   DDB Needham New York has resigned the Bermuda Department of
Tourism account, which the agency had handled for a decade, by
withdrawing from a review that began last month. Billings were
estimated at $10 million to $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Tate, president at DDB Needham New York _ part of the DDB
Needham Worldwide unit of Omnicom Group _ attributed the withdrawal
to ``the increasingly political environment surrounding tourism in
Bermuda,'' which led the agency ``to apply our talent and energy
where we believe our chances are significantly greater.'' His
reference was to the fact that the review began after an election
that brought a change in parties controlling the Bermuda
government.
</P>
<P>
   The other agencies participating in the review have not been
identified; Adweek reported last week that 15 or more had been
invited to take part.
</P>
<P>
   Hachette Closes a Magazine
</P>
<P>
   Hachette Filipacchi Magazines in New York, a unit of Lagardere
Group, has made a number of personnel changes as it closed a
publication.
</P>
<P>
   John Fennell, executive vice president and chief operating
officer, said that the company closed Eating Well magazine because
it had not been attracting enough advertising or circulation.
Eating Well was started in 1990 by Telemedia Inc.; Hachette bought
a 50 percent stake in November 1996.
</P>
<P>
   E. Michelle Amlong, 34, who had been publisher at Eating Well,
becomes associate publisher at George magazine, succeeding Deborah
Marcogliese, who left. Lawrence Brittan, 34, who had been
advertising director at Eating Well, was named to the vacant post
of advertising director at Family Life magazine.
</P>
<P>

SOUTHWEST'S SPIRIT RIDES ON VAN GOGH'S COATTAILS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., states of the Southwest, Northwest and Plains)  (js) 
 BY JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles County Museum of Art had been an
excited beehive of activity in recent months as it prepared to open
its biggest show in years, ``Van Gogh: Masterpieces From the Van
Gogh Museum, Amsterdam.'' Already the show, which opened Sunday,
has been extended by six weeks into May, and nearly a third of the
tickets, which are going for as much as $20 each, have been sold.
</P>
<P>
   But the greatest beneficiary of this blockbuster exhibition may
not be the LACMA, as the county museum is known: it could well
prove to be the highly regarded, if nearly forgotten Southwest
Museum, which is exhibiting American Indian artifacts in a corner
of the county museum's newly refurbished exhibition space where the
van Goghs are on display. The institution is wagering that the huge
crowds expected at the van Gogh show will stay around to see the
magnificent and rare Navajo and Pueblo textiles it is showing. In
short, it is hoped that the popularity of the Dutch master will
help in the rebirth of the Southwest Museum. The Southwest Museum
was founded in 1907 and is the oldest museum in this city. It is
considered by many experts to be one of the top three or four
collections of American Indian artifacts in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The collection, only about 2 percent of which is ever on
display, focuses on the Indians of the Southwest, the Great Basin,
California, the Plains and the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   It includes about 140,000 photographs recording aspects of
Indian culture and life that have long since disappeared; in fact,
many of these items were acquired near the turn of the century when
experts realized Indian tribes were moving inexorably from the wild
to reservations, and that this was the last opportunity for
preserving artifacts from the old way of life.
</P>
<P>
   The collection is considered encyclopedic and irreplaceable. It
is also nearly unknown, except to scholars, and that is where the
popularity of the melancholy painter may help. The hope is that
visitors to the van Gogh show will saunter into the Southwest
Museum's annex at the site, and that that may draw them later to
visit the museum's principal space in the out-of-the-way
neighborhood of Mount Washington, about halfway between downtown
Los Angeles and Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   At the least, the Southwest Museum's three-year lease of the
space from the county museum, which could be extended by decades if
this strategy proves a success, has opened up the vast storerooms
of the museum. Only a couple dozen of the more than 200 textiles
and rugs on display have ever been seen in public, and the museum
hopes to rotate the displays regularly to give viewers more of a
glimpse of its holdings.
</P>
<P>
   The story goes back to the 1980s, when the Southwest Museum
weathered several crises, some of which had been building for
years. Tough financial times coupled with its meager endowment, now
valued at about $6 million, meant that it had to reduce staff and
researchers' access to its storerooms. And in 1989 it suffered an
embarrassing blow when it was disclosed that the FBI was
investigating the disappearance of some 120 valuable pieces from
the collection, valued at about $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Museums have a tendency to keep such embarrassments quiet. Not
only did this one make headlines in Los Angeles, but the museum's
former director, Patrick Houlihan, was convicted in 1993 on charges
that he had stolen some of the missing items.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an occasion of great sadness because the director was
highly respected,'' said W. Richard West Jr., the director of the
Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of the American Indian.
``That museum was underappreciated and underutilized. It was less
about the collection than the location.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the museum's efforts to restore its tarnished luster
were hampered by the relatively obscure location. The museum has
been housed since 1914 in a handsome Mission Revival structure in
Mount Washington constructed by the museum's founder, Charles
Fletcher Lummis. That site all but guaranteed modest attendance, in
the view of the trustees, and they considered either moving to a
more accessible neighborhood or merging with another museum.
</P>
<P>
   (The story, ironically, is similar to the fate of the old Museum
of the American Indian, Heye Foundation, in Manhattan. It, too, was
housed in a somewhat out-of-the-way location in upper Manhattan,
and it suffered from neglect. It eventually transferred its vast
collection to the Smithsonian, and much of it has moved to the old
Customs House, now refurbished, at a busy site in lower Manhattan.)
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1990s the Southwest Museum's trustees had decided, in
the face of harsh opposition to a move from local residents, to
stay put, but they also hired a new director who made it clear that
he would not sit still.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them that I would not settle for the status quo,'' said
Duane H. King, now the executive director. ``They decided to stay
at the present location, but at the same time there was a
realization we had to reach a much broader audience, so we started
to consider a second location. Instead of expecting the public to
find us we have to go to the public now.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fortuitously, the county museum provided what may turn out to be
the ideal solution. Several years ago it began to refurbish an
adjacent structure, the old May Company department store, an
abandoned modernist gem on Wilshire Boulevard, built in 1939.
Opened this fall, the new space is called LACMA West, and the
county museum's president, Andrea Rich, said that the aim was, in
part, to turn it into a sort of ``village green,'' bringing in
collections from elsewhere in this vast county.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great museum but it was suffering,'' Ms. Rich said of
the Southwest Museum. ``We knew they needed something dramatic
location-wise, and what they were offering was complementary to our
collection. We gain because a lot of people love this material.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Southwest Museum took a lease on about 8,000 square feet
and installed, for a start, its new show, ``Common Threads: Pueblo
and Navajo Textiles in the Southwest Museum.'' An exhibition of
artifacts from the Blackfoot Indians is scheduled in the spring.
About 2,000 people a month have been visiting the new show already,
which is about the same number that have been visiting the main
museum. Museum officials said they expected the number of visitors
to the textile show to at least double after the opening of the van
Gogh exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   In a symbolic gesture, the FBI returned at the end of last year
26 of the items that had been taken illegally from the museum's
storerooms during the 1980s, bringing a greater sense of closure to
that episode, King said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not certain how things will work out yet, but there's
certainly more hope,'' said King.

BUILDING THE 8TH WONDER OF THE WORLD WITHOUT SAFETY NETS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Cal., Nev., other southwestern states)   (Production notes at end) 
(DW) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Many Americans, on the way to or from exploring the
technical wonder of Las Vegas slot machines, take a break at Hoover
Dam. It may not offer quite the charge of the slots, but Monday
night's ``American Experience'' leaves no doubt that the dam was
quite a gamble for its time and produced big winnings for its major
players and for America's Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s, in an effort to control the Colorado River,
typically described as ``raging,'' the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation
undertook to bring water and power to arid country. For farmers, a
government official says: ``The river was an enemy. It was too
thick to drink and too thin to plow.''
</P>
<P>
   Pictures of surging waters and forbidding country and accounts
of the feats of engineering and organization that went into
dominating them bring back the ambition and drama of the
accomplishment. But attention is given to the human story, too, of
thousands of young men, desperate for some sort of job in the
Depression, who had nothing to lose except possibly their health
and lives. The killing heat, the rudimentary living conditions, the
unending pressures for speed that did not allow for safety
precautions took their toll. The ``high scalers'' swinging 800 feet
up with their jackhammers and charges of dynamite look like circus
performers without nets.
</P>
<P>
   In these sensitive times, viewers may notice that the workers
shown were all white; that changed with the election of Franklin D.
Roosevelt and the advent of Harold Ickes as his Secretary of the
Interior, but even then segregation prevailed, notably in what some
welcomed as the ideal community built for workers and their
families in Boulder City.
</P>
<P>
   ``They built them rabbit hutches and called them houses,'' says
a critic. Another describes this forced effort at social planning
as a combination model town and police state, but for most of its
residents it was better than anything they had ever known.
</P>
<P>
   The hour gives only passing attention to a strike, quickly
crushed by management, over the dangerous working conditions, and
there is barely a reference to the environmental concerns that
would come later. Here the emphasis is on the success of what some
called ``the eighth wonder of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The workers, under a hard-driving boss, Frank Crowe, driven in
turn by a consortium of contractors looking toward big profits,
beat the deadlines and changed lives in a vast area of the United
States that included the little town of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Some things remained the same. You can see workers in their rare
off times, getting rid of their paychecks in Las Vegas.

`MOONDRUNK': A `PIERROT' LIGHTED BY MORE THAN THE MOON 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Any creative presentation of people and places has to
decide what to put in and what to leave out. ``Moondrunk'' at the
New Victory Theater on Friday night subscribed to the ``more''
theory rather than the ``less.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Schoenberg's ``Pierrot Lunaire,'' the evening's
centerpiece, is not without encouragement for the art-by-addition
camp. The first performances in 1912 were sung/spoken by an
actress, and Albert Giraud's 21 poems, cruel and bizarre to begin
with, take on an even seamier graphic nature in German translation.
We are ready to picture Pierrot in his clown's suit and also the
object of his affection, the moon _ at the New Victory a suspended,
lit-up and balloonlike globe.
</P>
<P>
   The question was whether ``Moondrunk'' follows a natural path to
its conclusions or whether it jumps to them. All possible senses
are appealed to. Schoenberg's small ensemble sits to one side of
the stage and plays the exquisite instrumental part. Lucy Shelton,
with period headress and pasty face, delivers Schoenberg's
extraordinary mongrelization of speech and song either reclining on
her seedy chaise or posing and perambulating across the stage.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more: John Kelly and his associates Barbara Allen
and Jon Kinzel dancing their way from one song to the next. All of
these estimable performers were arguing that the more information
available to an audience the greater the sensuous experience.
Detail enriches. Two arts are better than one, and three an
unexpected blessing.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, another kind of art: the art of omission, the
use of the small, incomplete gesture surrounded by little vacuums.
It is the imagination of the onlooker that rushes to fill them.
This is how three lines on a sketch pad can make us see a torso or
a chair; or how a line of a solo Bach sonata creates instantly
recognizable harmony even though no harmony is being played. We are
told a lot about Raskolnikov, but what Raskolnikov looks like will
differ according to each reader's inner vision.
</P>
<P>
   As to ``Moondrunk,'' the elements are splendid, but there may be
too many of them. Rarely have I heard five musicians play
Schoenberg with such refinement. Ms. Shelton was a model of eery
self-possession, far removed from her near-frantic performance of
``Pierrot'' two years ago at the Aldeburgh Festival. Couching Ms.
Shelton's singing in dark and shifting lighting (by Scott Pask) and
investing her delivery with long dramatic pauses work well. They
center our attention on the music rather than diverting it.
</P>
<P>
   But the dancing is too much. Kelly is an attention-getting
presence; but when he is at his best, Ms. Shelton and her musicians
are reduced to accompanists. When, on the other hand, we stick with
the music, we forget the dancers are on the stage. Sensory overload
is at work, an embarrassment of riches that the mind (at least this
one) has a hard time coping with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moondrunk'' is part of a valorous attempt by Lincoln Center's
``Great Performers'' series to give classical concerts a new look
in different venues. One is thankful even while disagreeing with
some of the results. Mahler's ``Kindertotenlieder'' and an evening
of Bach cantatas, both for the eye and ear, are coming soon. They
are worth your attention.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The first half of Friday evening was devoted to finding out how
``Pierrot Lunaire'' got to be the way it is. There was Johann
Strauss' ``Kaiser-Walzer'' in Schoenberg's acid arrangement for
sextet and also Goethe's ``Erlkonig'' as read (by way of
recordings) by the 1920s actor Alexander Moissi. Sarah Rothenberg
played (beautifully) two of Brahms' richest and most ecstatic late
piano pieces, some boyhood Schoenberg and two items from his Op. 11
Klavierstucke.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, I am sure, was to prepare the listener for the
inspired lunacy to come, and in one way, ``Pierrot Lunaire'' does
have a past, being a little like traditional Viennese society with
the veneer of politeness scraped away. Yet this is one of those
works that more or less happened, like ``Le Sacre du Printemps'' or
the Beethoven Grosse Fuge. Its salient elements come from nowhere
and proceed no further. It sets no precedent; it is itself.
</P>
<P>
   The choreographed elements, often touching in ``Pierrot,'' did
less well before intermission. The three dancing janitors during
the Strauss begged for chuckles that were in no way deserved. The
silhouetted progress of the ``Erlkonig'' with horse, riders and
toothy monster was intentional naivete made to look embarrassingly
unintentional. The apparition of Pierrot pointing to the moon at
the end of Ms. Rothenberg's piano pieces was, on the other hand, to
the point: an affecting preview of the evening's coming attraction.
</P>
<P>
   The other musicians on Friday were Carol Wincenc, flutist; David
Krakauer, clarinetist; Guillermo Figueroa and Andrew Grams,
violinists; Toby Appel, violist, and Rafael Figueroa, cellist.

AN AMATEUR MUSICIAN'S EXPERT THEORY ON COUGHING IN AUDIENCES 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)   By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN    
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The spate of coughing and hacking that caused the
conductor Kurt Masur to stalk offstage during a New York
Philharmonic concert last month was ascribed to the usual culprits:
inattentive audiences, rampant viruses and dull performances. But
the medical problem, which is widespread, may be more serious than
the absence of manners or cough drops.
</P>
<P>
   These convulsive paroxysms may have less to do with the failures
of the players onstage than with the lack of players offstage.
Coughing would diminish if audiences had more amateur musicians in
their midst.
</P>
<P>
   What does the absence of amateurs have to do with coughing? Some
hints can be taken from Wayne Booth, the literary scholar and
emeritus professor of English at the University of Chicago. For
more than 40 years he has been practicing the cello, creating
unusual counterpoint to his work as a teacher of rhetoric, irony
and fictional narrative. In fact Professor Booth has written a book
on the glories of amateurism, ``For the Love of It,'' to be
published this spring by his university.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, whose title plays on the Latin origins of the word
amateur, he makes effusive claims for the powers of playing chamber
music with friends, describing the infectious affection for the
music that spreads among them. He tells of grown men weeping at
Haydn and sober scholars sobbing with Beethoven. He writes about
``spiritual communion'' and about climbing a mountain that ``has no
top.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he speaks of what every amateur musician and not a
few professionals also know well: the sense of overwhelming
humility before something that is always beyond one's reach.
</P>
<P>
   The amateur path is pockmarked with the fear of failure, the
fear, as Booth puts it, of ``bare ruined choirs, where cellists'
boo-boos rang.'' Fellow amateurs may scorn one's weaknesses; others
might fail to measure up to one's own ``scale of tolerability.''
But despite it all the amateur's love grows. Such affection, if
more widely spread, might even provide a kind of musical
expectorant, a temporary cure for the common cold among concert
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   It might have some effect on the professionals as well. Booth
described the passions of the amateur on Friday at the conference
of Chamber Music America, the national society of professionals.
For many of those in attendance, he must have seemed a voice from
their past, bearing tales of an idyllic world almost eclipsed by
their struggles with marketing, grants and cranky critics. Booth
reminded earnest professionals of their amatory origins, suggesting
that the amateur spirit has much to offer professional life.
</P>
<P>
   I joined Booth in public conversation at that conference
session. I also recalled the thrills of amateur aspiration: a
Brahms piano quartet in which the massiveness of the chordal
pianism helped turn my body into the central axis of a breathing
organism, the almost painful strain of making the piano lines sing
simply in the midst of the swaying elegance of Schubert's ``Trout''
Quintet. I also recalled fears of not measuring up, of needing to
scramble to practice in the face of conflicting demands and of
wishing to find companions as tolerant of my weaknesses as I swore
I would be of theirs. Like much of Booth's audience, I ended up
leaving all this behind to turn professional. Except that I became
a professional listener, not a player. A critic, not a performer.
</P>
<P>
   But after 20 years of professional listening, I find the amateur
spirit even more important than it once was. It serves as a crucial
corrective to the cataloguing, collecting and comparing that mark
the professional listener. It has become a touchstone.
</P>
<P>
   How so? Amateur playing leads to what might be called amateur
listening. It means that nothing can be taken for granted. The
music can't be passively heard because it can't be passively
played. It is not ready made. It comes to be. The listener, in the
midst of hearing, actually helps it come to be, feeling it grow _
or fail to grow _ as if from the inside.
</P>
<P>
   The critic might take note of where gestures were stilted, where
the technical struggle became audible, where a sequence pointed
with all its might to a conclusion that was never reached. But the
professional is beholden to the amateur within, who is actively
involved, imagining alternatives, living in the midst of the sound
and sometimes even joining the performer as a co-creator.
</P>
<P>
   Amateur listening provides an almost Stanislavskian method for
musical enactment, except it is done silently, quieting one's body
so the mind and ears merge into those of the players. Even a bad
performance can inspire the amateur listener. The greatest
musicians make it easier. They are welcoming, enveloping,
demanding, sometimes wielding an almost erotic energy, turning a
vast public into avid amateurs. Lovers all.
</P>
<P>
   I like to imagine that in the days before recordings, radio and
MP3 downloads, when music heard was music played, when symphonies
were first learned in piano reductions, and kitschy pop songs were
sung around the keyboard in the parlor, this kind of amateur
listening to live music as it was being played was far more
prevalent. Many of those who thrilled to Liszt or Gottschalk
listened as amateur players who had trained their ears and bodies
by learning elementary versions of these virtuoso cataracts of
sound.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a world of ready-made performances, we have provided our
own cataracts: the seasonal cough. In many cases it is a sure sign
that amateur listening is not taking place. After all, an amateur
listener is almost as active as the players, who are nearly cough
immune. But a passive listener is not making music, just awaiting
it.
</P>
<P>
   So the listener, perhaps justly disappointed in a middling
performance, perhaps even justifiably bored, becomes ungrounded,
drifting in a sea of sound. The cough is a rebellious cataclysm, a
percussive breaking of physical complacency. It is nonmusical. It
stakes a claim, demanding the attention the music is not getting.
The cough is the voice of the listener's body left out in the cold.
Applause, the only other audience contribution to concert sound, is
the cough's affirmative counterpart. It, too, is eruptive,
cataclysmic and nonmusical, but instead of ripping the fabric, it
hails its completion.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine: What if amateur playing thrived and created audiences
of amateur listeners. What a different musical world might evolve!
Applause would seem superfluous. Coughs would become anachronisms.
We would all be amateurs, struggling in our listening and playing
to reach a distant ideal. Musical pain would disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. ``We amateurish amateurs do often inflict pain on
others,'' Booth cautions. ``We just don't do it on purpose.''

`WHAT WE DID LAST NIGHT': RICK SCHRODER AS A BAD-BOY TOWNIE 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rick Schroder is hot. Just a couple of months ago
critics and viewers alike were having a good laugh over the
prospect of his joining the cast of ABC's gritty police drama
``NYPD Blue.'' How was a baby-faced blond former child actor going
to fill the shoes of Jimmy Smits, who brilliantly had replaced
David Caruso, who had been pretty brilliant himself?
</P>
<P>
   But when Schroder turned up in his first episodes, older and
wiser than viewers remembered him and a little worse for wear,
those critics and viewers took it all back, and this week the young
star is on the cover of TV Guide, smiling just above the words
``He's great!''
</P>
<P>
   Monday night he's the star of an ABC movie, ``What We Did That
Night.'' Well, every career move can't be a winner.
</P>
<P>
   The first sign that this is going to be an obvious, predictable
(until the very end) film is the stick-figure characters. There's
Henry ( Schroder), the bad-boy townie who doesn't really belong
among his fraternity brother pals. He turns up eight years later as
a jailbird, smoking cigarettes, so you know he's no good.
</P>
<P>
   There's Doc (Jayce Bartok), the geek whose reaction to tragedy
is nausea. He grows up to be a respectable dentist. There's Ollie
(Jack Noseworthy), the loyal guy trying to be faithful to his
fiancee, who is away in Paris studying the cello. He grows up to be
a respectable lawyer. There's Charlie (Michael Easton), the
charmer, who grows up to be a nightclub owner and wears silk suits.
In the flashbacks he looks like Keanu Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   In college one of the four boys accidentally shoots a girl to
death on the night they were planning to make her part of a
gruesome fraternity prank. The four friends consider calling 911
but panic and bury the body in an out-of-the-way site called
Devil's Glen.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later real estate developers are about to break
ground in Devil's Glen. Henry gathers the other three young men by
making threatening telephone calls, and they head for the scene of
the crime to do whatever it takes not to be caught. The plot is
practically a genre to itself.
</P>
<P>
   The next sign that this movie may not be a masterpiece is the
dialogue, which never gets much more original than ``Now, if
anybody asks, we stick to the story'' and ``I can't stop thinking
about that night.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a lot of clumsy exposition. Instead of a scene in
which the boys devise the fraternity prank, Eric Harlacher's script
presents a scene in which they go over the details again. Instead
of having the pretty girl they pick up tell them about her
amazingly virtuous family, one of the boys later repeats what she
told him to the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``What We Did That Night'' has some redeeming features. Tara
Reid, as the girl who is the victim, does an amusing turn at the
beach party as a flirtatious but mean drunk. Some real suspense
builds in the final scenes. At the end there's a wonderful plot
twist, but it's dulled by having the characters overexplain it and
by a ludicrous death scene. When the character breathes his last,
his final words are, honest to God, ``Olly olly oxen free.''

 By FELICIA R. LEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Life seldom offers epiphanies. Yet Steven Kasher, the
curator of the civil rights photography exhibition opening Monday
at the 92d Street Y here, can recall the slaying of three civil
rights workers in Mississippi as a turning point in his life.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Goodman, one of the three young men whose bodies were
found under an earthen dam in the summer of 1964, was a cousin of
the best friend of Kasher, who was then 10. The Goodmans and the
Kashers were close: two Jewish families in Manhattan, sharing
Thanksgiving dinners and idealism about America. What Kasher later
learned about the Goodman murder by white racists became the fruit
of a life that includes a book about the civil rights movement and
eight other exhibitions of images from that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a child, it was totally, totally vague to me,'' Kasher said
of the civil rights movement. ``I generally had a sense that there
was heroism and courageous things going on. All of a sudden, there
was this news that Michael's cousin Andrew was killed in
Mississippi. There was such terrible sadness.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I became very aware of anti-Semitism and racism and
intolerance and that we can't let this happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   After attending art school in Florence, he found work as an
artist, a writer and a photographer. At the Black Star agency
Kasher became a special projects coordinator and began documenting
the movement. His exhibitions have been shown in cities from London
to Los Angeles, and he now has a TriBeCa gallery bearing his name.
</P>
<P>
   The debut of the show at the 92d Street Y coincides with the
holiday commemorating the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Called
``America and the Civil Rights Movement, 1954-1968,'' the
exhibition, which runs through March 19 at the Weill Art Gallery at
the Y, offers more than 50 images. Some are familiar, like those of
King marching or students with a Gandhi-like calm being harassed at
segregated lunch counters. Others are anonymous black faces:
dignified, enraged, defiant.
</P>
<P>
   The photographs are accompanied by text and information-laden
captions. Kasher says he believes that words as well as pictures
are necessary for the many people who still do not know why a civil
rights movement was needed.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures tell the story of a time when most blacks, by law,
went to separate schools, could not drink from the same water
fountains as whites and were denied the vote. They show how men
were killed because they stood up for those rights, and how women
and children had dogs and fire hoses turned on them. They also show
how the most disenfranchised Americans _ Southern blacks _
conceptualized and led a movement that changed the law of the land
and deeply entrenched customs.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gilson, the director of the Y's School of the Arts and
the show's organizer, asserted that the civil rights movement owed
much of its success to the widespread publicity generated by
photographs. Those pictures embodied the inherent contradiction in
American life, he said, and captured the truths to which most
Americans had been oblivious.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, participants in the movement regularly staged
events for the news media and cultivated journalists, Gilson said.
They produced their own writers and photographers and were aware of
their legacy. The period from 1954, when the U.S. Supreme Court
outlawed ``separate but equal'' schools, to 1968, when King was
slain in Memphis and the movement began to splinter, was a high
point for photojournalism, Gilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Television largely has supplanted the role that photo magazines
like Life once played. But as the reaction to the videotaped
beating of Rodney King shows, he said, America remains a nation so
splintered by race and class that imagery can be used to stunning
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Gilson said his research for the exhibition had included reading
several histories of the movement, including Kasher's book, ``The
Civil Rights Movement: A Photographic History, 1954-1968''
(Abbeville Press, 1996).
</P>
<P>
   Many of the photographs come from the book with its bounty of
classic scenes, but Gilson said he deliberately had wanted to
include those less well known. He is aware that the show, part of
the Y's ``Project America,'' a multidisciplinary examination of
American culture, will introduce a new generation to what the civil
rights movement was about.
</P>
<P>
   ``This movement was the first widespread resistance and the
first to get widespread publicity,'' Gilson said. ``Previously,
there was a kind of invisibility of African-Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasher, in an interview in the apartment he shares with his wife
and daughter in the TriBeCa neighborhood, said: ``People have a
vague idea that Martin Luther King did something. But they have no
idea of the movement. That's why it's very positive to get it out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasher said he wanted the photographs to advance a broad view of
the movement that incorporates many aspects of what happened, from
the role of the church to white involvement to the violent
resistance to civil rights. One photograph, for example, shows a
speaker at a memorial service for Andrew Goodman, James Chaney and
Michael Schwerner _ the three young men murdered in Mississippi _
that takes place amid the ruins of a church torched by the Ku Klux
Klan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about my daughter,'' Kasher said. ``What do I want
to teach her? What do I want to pass along? I felt this was as much
my heritage as the Holocaust. It was part of my life and my times
and my youth. This happened in America, and this movement
represents the crucial lesson about America in the post-war era.''
</P>
<P>
   It is significant that the exhibition takes place at an
institution founded by Jews in 1874 as the 92d Street Young Men's
and Young Women's Hebrew Association. Jews like Goodman, a
20-year-old student who had gone south to help register black
voters, played a key role as civil rights foot soldiers and
fund-raisers, many of them mindful of their own historical role as
despised outcasts. As a child, Kasher's mother and her family came
to New York from England, where they had gone to flee Nazi Germany
in the late 1930's.
</P>
<P>
   In a show of which he was the curator in 1991, ``The Art of
Hitler,'' Kasher showed a photograph of his mother and her sister
in 1938, shyly holding hands on a Frankfurt street as a panoply of
Nazi flags flap in the background.
</P>
<P>
   ``A photograph is such a paradox,'' Kasher said. ``It's a frozen
moment from a river that never stops. There is still complete
belief that a photograph is a reflection of reality, something that
really happened. It's like a mirror. But it has a message because
there's a consciousness behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Through his years of assembling civil rights exhibitions, Kasher
met and befriended many of the movement photographers. Among them
were Ernest Withers, a 76-year-old black photographer who lives in
Memphis and whose work is showcased in the Y exhibition. Withers'
photographs include a famous one of the Memphis sanitation workers
on strike with the simple sign ``I Am a Man.'' The 1968 sanitation
campaign took King to the city where he was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   Withers, whose great-great-grandfather was lynched in
Mississippi after running away to join the Union Army, recalled
striving for professional objectivity as he photographed the
organized resistance to that kind of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a job because I'm the father of seven boys and one
girl, but it carried some pride to it, it carried some hope,''
Withers said in a telephone interview from Memphis. ``The young
people have been amazed to see those segregated bus signs, so those
shows that Steve does are important. It gives you a feeling that
your living has not been in vain.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Moore, a 67-year-old white photographer who grew up in
Alabama and is also part of the show, said the movement had changed
his life. Moore made some of the first photographs of King. His
images of police dogs mauling protesters are some of the most
familiar in the genre.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Birmingham when I saw the dogs I don't think anything
appalled me more _ and I've been to Vietnam,'' said Moore, who now
lives in western Massachusetts. ``I photographed it, and the world
rushed in. I realized the power of even one image.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What changed was my awareness,'' he added. ``I wanted to show
how awful, how vulgar, how terrible this whole thing was.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the people who have seen his exhibitions, Kasher said
whites and blacks differed somewhat in their reactions. Many blacks
viewing the shows have some personal connection to the events of
that time, Kasher said. Many of the whites are surprised by the
depth of the hatred.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people see these photographs and they have a lot of
shame and embarrassment that this went on in America,'' he said.

CHALLENGING PRICELINE.COM 
ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL 
CATCHING CUTLERY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky., Calif.)   (mk) 
 By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; A Washington patent lawyer is challenging a fundamental patent
issued last summer to Priceline.com Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Thomas Woolston, contends that he filed for a patent
about 16 months before Priceline applied for its patent in
September 1996 covering an online auction system that allows
consumers to bid for items like airline tickets over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Woolston's patent, which was issued in December, in part covers
a computerized marketplace that enables ``the purchaser to
speculate on the price of collectibles in an electronic market for
used goods while assuring the safe and trusted physical possession
of a good.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Woolston, a baseball fan, first thought of his invention
as a way to buy and sell baseball cards over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Although that is very different from the business that Priceline
conducts _ it advertises widely, with the actor William Shatner
concluding ``I told you Priceline was going to be big, really big''
_ Woolston contends that his patent covers the buyer-driven auction
model of doing business on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   His start-up venture, Mercexchange, is at this point little more
than a company name and a board in search of venture capital.
``We're defining our markets right now,'' Woolston said.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline.com operates a system under which consumers go to an
Internet site and name the price they are willing to pay for
airline tickets, hotel rooms and other items. Priceline then tries
to find an airline or other company willing to accept that price.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Walker, vice chairman and founder of Priceline, dismissed
Woolston's challenge. ``When you have a landmark patent, you have
to expect, as we did, that all kinds of people are going to come
out of the woodwork to claim that the Patent Office made a mistake
and that they really invented it first,'' he said. ``Our patent is
no exception.''
</P>
<P>
   Woolston said he discussed working with Priceline.com to develop
the auction technology but that the talks failed because the
company ``expressed no serious interest in cooperation.'' Woolston
has requested that the Patent Office conduct a proceeding known as
an interference. It could be months before the agency decides
whether to initiate such a review, which could then take several
years.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, such disputes over issued patents must be fought out
in the courts. But for technical reasons, Woolston is able to
challenge the Priceline patent through the Patent Office _ a far
less costly way to challenge a patent.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said it was ``not inconceivable'' that the Patent Office
would grant the interference, but expressed confidence that
Priceline.com's patent would survive such scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline was assigned patent 5,794,207. Woolston received
patent 5,845,265.
</P>
<P>
   TRUTH IN LABELING, WITH A VIEW TO SAFETY
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sadlo, a substitute high school teacher in Louisville,
Ky., received a patent last week for what he contends is a way to
encourage the practice of safe sex.
</P>
<P>
   Sadlo's idea? Sell condoms that fit to size.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you walk by the condom rack at the drugstore, you'll see
that there are just two sizes _ regular and medium,'' Sadlo said.
</P>
<P>
   Class A condoms are 7.1 inches in length, according to Sadlo,
while Class B condoms are 6.3 inches. ``But medical research of the
male anatomy shows that the length of an erect penis ranges from
about 3.5 inches to 13 inches,'' he said. ``Clearly, one size
cannot fit all.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, Sadlo said, 15 percent of men are unable to use the
latex condoms on the market because their circumference is too
small for the condoms to stay put.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people that the condoms just aren't going
to fit,'' he said. ``For lots of men it's too long, so there's an
unrolled portion at the base which can have a tourniquet effect and
restrict neurological and vascular functioning. And if it's not
long enough, it's going to have a tendency to pull off or break.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadlo has patented a system of selling condoms that vary in
length and width. Men could pick up a measuring strip at the
drugstore and then take their measurement at home in privacy, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   When they returned to the store, they would consult a coded
chart for the appropriate size. The chart would be similar to, but
a bit more complicated than, the weight-and-height charts that
women consult when they buy pantyhose at a store. But Sadlo said
the size of the condom would not be evident on the package.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be coded, so you would pick out, say, a J-M,'' Sadlo
said. ``The actual condom package would not indicate any length on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadlo said he hoped to license his invention. ``It can be a real
funny subject,'' he said. ``But it can help save a lot of lives
because it will be a lot more reliable and comfortable so a lot
more people will be willing to wear them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadlo received patent 5,857,466.
</P>
<P>
   A TRAP DOOR OF SORTS FOR DISCARDED CUTLERY
</P>
<P>
   It can cost a cafeteria thousands of dollars a year to replace
flatware that has accidentally been thrown away. Richard Edwards
has come up with a solution: a trash can with an electronic metal
detector.
</P>
<P>
   The can described in his patent features a chute at the top. If
garbage passing through the chute contains a fork or a knife or a
spoon, an alarm sounds and a spring-loaded door closes the base of
the chute. Once the metal has been retrieved, the chute opens
again.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, of Long Beach, Calif., received patent 5,797,497.
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

CHAMBER MUSIC AMERICA BENEFIT: CELEBRATING BENITA VALENTE   
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like many other singers, the soprano Benita Valente
has worked with equal dedication in opera and song. But Ms. Valente
also has distinguished herself as a chamber music artist in
repertory ranging from Baroque cantatas to contemporary works.
</P>
<P>
   So she was a fitting choice for the Richard J. Bogomolny
National Service Award, given annually by the national association
Chamber Music America. Her achievement was marked by a gala concert
at the Juilliard Theater on Thursday night, also a benefit for
Classical Action, which raises funds for AIDS services.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Valente's involvement with chamber music was made clear at
the start, when the Juilliard String Quartet joined her for two
extended sections of ``The Rewaking,'' to texts of William Carlos
Williams, composed by John Harbison in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Though it was not organized as such, the concert also seemed a
fitting celebration of Ms. Valente as a model of sensible vocal
practices. At a time when so many promising young singers blow out
their voices through overly forceful singing of inappropriate
repertory, Ms. Valente, at 64, sounds remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   Early on she sized up her voice correctly: a lyric soprano with
a bright, clear, yet warm sound. With her faultless technique and
intelligence, she became an important recitalist, a notable singer
of Mozart and Handel opera, with forays into roles like Verdi's
Violetta. But no one ever talked her into Tosca or such, which is
why she is still singing.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously there has been some diminishing of her voice. But in
Harbison's highly charged work she sounded radiant. The music
captures the stormy weather of the poetic imagery in tormented
vocal lines, but it renders the calm after the storm in melodic
arcs of high, soft, sustained beauty, and Ms. Valente handled it
all impressively.
</P>
<P>
   Several colleagues were there to honor her. The mezzo-soprano
Joan Morris and her husband, the composer and pianist William
Bolcom, who has written several works for Ms. Valente, performed
four turn-of-the-century popular songs with elegance and wit. The
mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne sang duets with Ms. Valente, her friend
of 47 years (they met as students in California), by Schumann and
Eric Thiman, sensitively accompanied by the pianist Ken Noda.
</P>
<P>
   Finally there was a performance of Brahms'
``Liebeslieder-Walzer,'' Op. 52, for vocal quartet and piano duo,
with twice the number of singers required, all taking turns. They
included Susan Narucki, Emily Golden, Marietta Simpson, Richard
Clement, Jon Humphrey, William Stone, Christopheren Nomura.
Stephanie Brown and Cynthia Raim were the musicianly pianists. When
her turn came, Ms. Valente sang beautifully. But she seemed even
happier when she was just listening to others perform in her honor
music she has loved all her life. &QL;

 &HT;    Lewis urges U.S. to `choose between community and chaos'
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the impeachment trial of the president continues
to roil the nation's Capitol, Georgia Democratic Rep. John Lewis
urged Sunday for ``a calming of the waters.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before a packed audience at the Washington National
Cathedral, Lewis said the nation is ``tired'' of being ripped apart
by the partisan fight over whether President Clinton should be
removed from office for the way he concealed his affair with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must choose between community and chaos,'' said Lewis,
invoking the words of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. on the eve of
a national holiday honoring the deeds of the former civil rights
leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a nation troubled by scandal and the politics of
personal destruction,'' said Lewis, who worked with King to promote
the civil rights of African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as a nation are not at peace with ourselves,'' said Lewis,
his voice thundering throughout the gothic-style cathedral. ``Our
national community is sick and her heart is very heavy. Her soul is
aching and her spirit is low.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, the chief democratic whip in the House, has
unsuccessfully sought a peaceful conclusion to the allegations that
the president lied under oath and obstructed justice.
</P>
<P>
   It was Lewis' hope that King's message of forgiveness would
bring some sense to the scandal engulfing Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, Lewis said, is to take King's words and apply
them to the hate and divisiveness that has permeated Congress, as
well as society.
</P>
<P>
   ``The struggle is being waged in every nation, among every
people, by peaceful means, by propaganda, diplomacy, financial
pressures, bluffs, strikes, ballots, bullets and even by votes in
Congress where a battle is being waged over the shortcomings of our
president,'' Lewis said. ``We have seen men and women sacrifice
truth, deny truth, hide truth for a false and negative peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis told a story from his childhood about how he and his young
cousins held hands during a fierce storm. The storm rocked his
aunt's house, making them terrified that it might blow away. So
Lewis and his cousins went together from the corner of the ``shot
gun'' house to another in an effort to hold it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends, the storms may come,'' said Lewis. ``The wind may
blow. The thunder may roll. The lightning may flash. And the rain
may beat down on this old house we call America. But we must never,
ever leave the house of faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Several people in the audience wiped their eyes. A hush fell
over the cathedral which took 83 years and several presidential
administrations to build.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took me back to an era of the 60's when there seemed to be
a heart beat type of hope,'' said Rosetta Robinson, a minister from
the Washington area sitting in the audience. ``It does make you
wonder where will there be justice (with Clinton) and whose justice
will it be?''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Reynolds, an usher at the cathedral, said he hoped that
Lewis' message would impact Congress. In all of his 42 years living
in Washington, he said he has never seen a Congress as divided as
the one deciding Clinton's fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hypocrisy of both sides, it is, well, just appalling,''
said Reynolds. ``I hope they hear him, I hope they listen to him.''

 `UNION JACK,' `LES GENTILHOMMES': GUERIN AND LA FOSSE TAKE THE HIGH
GROUND  
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; NEW YORK _ &UR;  &LR; The New York City Ballet has promised to present
100 ballets in this, its 50th-anniversary, season, an effort that
has obviously recharged the company's dancing. On Thursday night,
``Union Jack,'' George Balanchine's witty tribute to British
tradition, received its most spirited performance in years, and
``Les Gentilhommes,'' Peter Martins' all-male ballet of 1987,
returned with its good manners intact. If there was rain and slush
outside the New York State Theater, there was sunshine within.
</P>
<P>
   There was also the astonishing power of Wendy Whelan's eloquent
performance with a poetic Damian Woetzel in a repeat of Jerome
Robbins' ``Opus 19/The Dreamer.'' One could see the same
transformation of an imperfect work by a magnificent performance
when Isabelle Guerin of the Paris Opera Ballet and Robert La Fosse
brought hilarious detail to the slight music-hall duet of ``Union
Jack.''
</P>
<P>
   The very young cast of ``Les Gentilhommes,'' by contrast, needed
more rehearsal. This is one of Martins' most interesting works, a
subtle tribute to the refinement of classical dancing. The 1987
subtitle, now omitted, was ``Skoal, Stanley,'' a Danish toast to
Stanley Williams, the Danish teacher who was mentor to Martins and
many other dancers in the company.
</P>
<P>
   The choreography for nine men underscores the purity that
Williams emphasized in ballet technique. At the same time, the
ballet is part of a cycle of earlier works that Martins
choreographed to Baroque music. Here, too, courtly bearing and
court dances are implied. The music is by Handel: Concerto Grosso
(Op. 6, No. 9), and the Largo from Concerto Grosso (Op. 6, No. 2).
</P>
<P>
   The fleeting images of fencing and curtsies in the ballet are
nonetheless abstract. Structurally, the piece is built around a
soloist, now danced well, but not well enough to stand out in
relief, by Benjamin Millepied. His steps and arm gestures are
initially echoed by the eight other men until Martins sets a series
of trios in motion.
</P>
<P>
   There was a coltish freshness to the youngest dancers in their
quick changes of direction. But to say all had the right pointed
feet and noble line is a grosso exaggeration. Nonetheless, Adam
Hendrickson, exciting in his taut, muscular style, is a talented
newcomer to watch. Richard Moredock conducted.
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra, under Maurice Kaplow's baton, was more than fine
in Hershy Kay's ingenious orchestral arrangement of military
marches, ballads and even ``Rule, Britannia'' for ``Union Jack.''
More than any other ballet, it theatricalizes folk material and
abstracts it. The seven regiments of dancers in kilts were alive
with color in the opening tattoo, and the hornpipes in the ``Royal
Navy'' section brimmed with humor. There was also electrifying
virtuosity from Woetzel, Jock Soto and Albert Evans, complemented
by the sexiness of Helene Alexopoulos leading the pinup girls to
the ``Colonel Bogey'' march.
</P>
<P>
   ``Union Jack'' is spectacle of the highest order, and rarely has
its intimate music hall duet stood up to the dazzling ensemble
sections. But Ms. Guerin, in a debut, was delicious and recalled
France's own music hall tradition. She showed plenty of warmth and
leg. When she was supposed to be shocked by her own out-of-control
pelvis, she was not. La Fosse met her on the same high ground,
channeling every gesture and expression into a nuanced portrait of
a trouper whose polish smooths over every mock mishap: a
performance not to be missed.

`THE HAUNTED WOOD': SECRET FILES FROM THE SOVIET PERSPECTIVE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: RUSSIA and other former Soviet countries)   By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Haunted Wood,'' as its subtitle spells out, is a history
of Soviet espionage in the United States during Stalin's
dictatorship. More exactly, the book covers the period from around
1933, when the Roosevelt Administration first gave diplomatic
recognition to the Soviet Union, to about 1953, when Julius and
Ethel Rosenberg's execution marked the end of the most active
period of Soviet spying in America.
</P>
<P>
   Based on previously secret KGB files, the narrative takes the
Soviet perspective, breaking the period down into the New Deal
years, when Stalin's agents in the United States developed contacts
in the Roosevelt Administration; the time of World War II, when
military secrets, especially those pertaining to the atom bomb,
became the focus of espionage, and the beginning of the Cold War
era, when events conspired against the Soviet operation (the
defections of Elizabeth Bentley and Whittaker Chambers, the
exposure of Klaus Fuchs and the Rosenberg ring and the rising
clamor of American anti-Communism) brought spying activities
largely to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the stories are familiar: Bentley, Fuchs, the
Rosenbergs, Michael Straight, Alger Hiss and Chambers. Others are
obscure: Laurence Duggan, a ``Communist romantic'' who spied from
the State Department in the 1930s, grew troubled over Stalin's
purge trials and ended up committing suicide; Boris Morros, a
``Hollywood hustler'' who talked the Russians into setting him up
in a music-publishing business and then double-crossed them by
becoming an FBI informer, and the story of how during World War II
the American Office of Strategic Services and its Soviet
counterpart, then the NKGB, ``concluded an agreement to exchange
information and establish close liaison,'' an agreement that, not
surprisingly, they found difficult to carry out.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the material is intermittently absorbing: J. Edgar
Hoover's battle with Gen. William J. (Wild Bill) Donovan, the head
of OSS, over exchanging OSS and NKGB official representatives
(Hoover argued, correctly, that Soviet intelligence's main purpose
was spying); the Soviet Union's obsession with Trotsky's potential
influence on American operatives, even after the ``Old Man'' had
been murdered in 1940; or the lengths to which agents would go to
identify one another when meeting: at Fuchs' first meeting with his
New York contact in 1944, he was to stand holding a green book and
a tennis ball, look for someone wearing gloves and holding a third
glove, and respond to a request for directions to Chinatown by
saying, ``I think Chinatown is closed at 5 p.m.'' It eventually
occurred to Moscow that this ritual ``could easily draw everyone's
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Haunted Wood'' will appeal most of all to readers
thoroughly familiar with the previous record of Soviet espionage.
(The authors have provided an extensive bibliography.) Such readers
will appreciate the nuances resulting from the dovetailing of the
respective stories and the many fascinating insights into the
psychology of Soviet agents. Readers less familiar with the record
will find much of the material fragmentary, convoluted, badly
shaped, dryly written and, all in all, an exercise to make the eyes
glaze over.
</P>
<P>
   But what all the foregoing leaves out is that the value of the
book depends as much on its framework as it does on its contents,
and the mounting of the frame of ``The Haunted Wood'' is by and
large unsatisfactory. We know the title comes from a line in
Auden's poem ``September 1, 1939'': ``Lest we should see where we
are,/ Lost in a haunted wood, . . .'' We know that Weinstein is the
author of ``Perjury: The Hiss-Chambers Case,'' which concluded that
Hiss was a spy, and that Vassiliev is a former KGB agent now
working as a journalist. We know that Vassiliev did the archival
research and translating of the raw documents, while Weinstein
wrote the final English-language manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the sources? The authors say in their
introduction that the book is based on ``substantial and exclusive
access to Stalin-era operational files of the KGB and its
predecessor agencies,'' on ``a great deal of additional and
important unreviewed KGB material'' that ``reached us informally
from other, non-KGB sources during our research'' and on 40 of the
2,900 Venona cables (``translated intercepts sent by Soviet agents
in the United States to Moscow about their intelligence efforts
during World War II'') that were released in 1995-6.
</P>
<P>
   But what exactly does this mean? It is self-evident from the
book's text that the sources exclude the files of the GRU (the
Soviet military intelligence), for which Hiss is supposed to have
been an agent, and that the KGB archives represent only a fraction
of the secret records of the Stalin era. So how extensive and
authoritative is the documentation? The authors offer no overview
or perspective on their sources. As for Venona, no background or
explanation of the program is offered until late in the book, and
even then we are not told how authoritative these cables are.
</P>
<P>
   One symptom of the book's somewhat limited perspective is the
extensive recapitulation of the Hiss-Chambers case. This turns out
to be based not on KGB files but on Weinstein's earlier study,
``Perjury,'' on Sam Tanenhaus' biography of Chambers and on Venona
and other Soviet cables referring to an agent called Ales whom the
authors assure us is actually Hiss although they don't summarize
the reasoning that led analysts to this conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that you mistrust ``The Haunted Wood.'' Its tone is
dispassionate and nonargumentative. It doesn't seem to be grinding
any particular ideological axe, but simply to be laying out a
documentary record for the reader's edification.
</P>
<P>
   The authors freely admit that their book is not ``a definitive
history'' but only a glimpse into the Soviet archival record.
Still, the lack of perspective on the sources remains a continuous
nag. It makes an already unfocused story seem lacking in urgency
and very nearly fuzzy. Had the authors offered an introductory
overview of the place of their documentation in the larger picture,
the authority of their text would have seemed a good deal more
compelling.

TO CHIEF OF AIRTOUCH, A DEAL SEIZES A `BELL OPPORTUNITY'
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ala.)   (See also VODAFONE-AIRTOUCH-TALKS) 
(DW) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sam Ginn's gamble has paid off, hugely.
</P>
<P>
   With the acquisition of Airtouch Communications Inc. by Vodafone
Group PLC, Ginn, the chairman and chief executive of Airtouch, will
walk away with hundreds of millions of dollars from stock and
options that he owns.
</P>
<P>
   The $60 billion being paid for Airtouch and Ginn's personal
windfall represent a vindication of the big decisions that have
defined his career. In 1992, as chief executive of Pacific Telesis
Group, then the regional Bell company of California, Ginn decided
to spin off the company's cellular phone operations into a separate
company, Airtouch. When the spinoff occurred in 1994, Ginn
surprised many people by vacating his wood-paneled corner office at
giant Pacific Telesis to run the smaller Airtouch.
</P>
<P>
   But last week's windfall also calls to mind the controversy that
surrounded the Airtouch spinout.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, led by consumer groups in California, contended that
Ginn and other top managers at Pacific Telesis, far from gambling,
were walking off with the fastest-growing and most glamorous part
of the California phone company, enriching themselves in the
process. Pacific Telesis, they said, was left a weaker company,
resulting in higher telephone rates for consumers and the company's
acquisition two years later by SBC Communications.
</P>
<P>
   What especially irks some consumer advocates now is that Ginn
argued at the time that the wireless business needed to be divorced
from the regulated phone company, and he vowed that Airtouch would
never return to the haven of a regional Bell. Yet until Vodafone
came along, Ginn had been negotiating to sell Airtouch to Bell
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think it strange that Airtouch wants to be freed from
the onerous position of being run by Pacific Telesis only to go
under Bell Atlantic,'' Regina Costa, telecommunications research
director for The Utility Reform Network, a San Francisco consumer
group, said a few days ago. She called the 1994 spinoff ``highway
robbery _ and Ginn orchestrated it.''
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed, Ginn said, and regulations have loosened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Ma Bell lives at Bell Atlantic,'' he said in a
telephone interview on Saturday. Now, he said, the need is for the
size and financial resources to take advantage of ``an Alexander
Graham Bell opportunity'' in wireless telephony.
</P>
<P>
   A Bell Atlantic merger would have created a nationwide giant,
but the merger with Vodafone, the largest wireless provider in
Europe, creates a global one, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wireless platform is going to win over time,'' Ginn said,
predicting that 50 percent of households in developed nations will
have wireless phones in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   But just as he took a smaller job when he left Pacific Telesis
for Airtouch, Ginn will again see his job shrink so that his
wireless company can grow. Chris Gent, the head of Vodafone, will
be chief executive of Vodafone Airtouch. Ginn, who is 61, will be
chairman but will not have day-to-day responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   He can afford a leisurely retirement. According to last April's
proxy, he owns 1.55 million Airtouch shares, worth $150 million at
the $97-a-share price of Vodafone's offer. Ginn also had 1.75
million unexercisable options, which would be worth another $170
million and would become immediately exercisable upon the takeover.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made out extremely well, but our employees have made out
extremely well also,'' said Ginn.
</P>
<P>
   All 12,500 Airtouch employees were given or bought stock, and
their total gains from stock and options came to more than $2
billion, he said. Shareholders have also done well, with Airtouch
shares having more than tripled from their initial price of $23,
even before the run-up spurred by the acquisition talks.
</P>
<P>
   His many defenders say that Ginn is being rewarded for seeing
the potential of wireless phones at a time others did not and for
building Airtouch into the world's largest multinational wireless
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``He bet his career on it, he bet his business on it, and he was
right,'' said George F. Schmitt, a former Airtouch executive who is
now president of Omnipoint Communications, a wireless service
provider.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a tire-shop manager from Alabama, Ginn got into
telecommunications by accident. In his freshman year at Auburn
University, he went to sign up with the Reserve Officers Training
Corps and got in the shortest line. It turned out to be for the
Signal Corps.
</P>
<P>
   With a degree in industrial management, he joined the AT&AMP;T
Corporation as a management trainee in 1960. After a detour at
Stanford Business School, he rose to become a vice president in
AT&AMP;T's long-distance business.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, Ginn was dispatched to Pacific Telephone, where he
would develop one of the nation's first cellular-phone systems, in
time for the 1984 Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Quigley, who worked under Ginn and eventually succeeded
him as chief executive of Pacific Telesis, remembered sitting in
the stands at the Olympics with Ginn, showing two Japanese
executives a $3,000 Motorola cellular phone, which they used to
call Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said, `This is going to revolutionize the world,'''
Quigley, now a venture capitalist, recalled. ``We knew it was going
to be big.''
</P>
<P>
   When Pacific Telephone split from AT&AMP;T in the 1984 divestiture,
Ginn became the head of the unregulated businesses of the newly
named Pacific Telesis, including cellular phones. He showed an
entrepreneurial flair rare in the Bell system and gave his managers
profit-and-loss responsibilities. Some ventures flopped, but Ginn
did well enough to become chief executive of Pacific Telesis in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   He expanded the cellular telephone operations aggressively, not
only in the United States but overseas. In its biggest coup,
Pacific Telesis, in partnership with Mannessmann A.G., won a
license to provide cellular service in Germany in 1989, at a time
when auctions were not held for licenses. ``It was an absolutely
incredible moneymaker right away and we didn't pay a nickel for a
license,'' said Quigley.
</P>
<P>
   But the investment needed to build wireless networks was
diluting Pacific Telesis' earnings and hurting its stock price. So
in 1992, Ginn proposed spinning off the cellular operations.
Consumer groups complained that Airtouch would inherit, free of
charge, valuable cellular licenses in California that had been
granted to Pacific Telesis because it was the regulated phone
monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Telesis also absorbed the debt incurred by the cellular
operations, allowing Airtouch to start free of debt. Consumer
groups called for ratepayers to be reimbursed $1 billion, but the
state utility commission ordered a reimbursement of only $41
million.
</P>
<P>
   Ginn said Saturday that the cellular operations were paid for by
Pacific Telesis shareholders, not ratepayers. As for breaking up
Pacific Telesis, he said, ``If I could have solved it another way,
I would have.''

   Elsewhere, the problem has been a mystery to solve.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to customer complaints, Thornton, Musso and Bellemin,
a Louisiana consulting firm to several water utilities, in 1997 had
to use a microscope that takes the fingerprint of chemical elements
before discovering that the chips which came from the
disintegrating dip tubes were polypropylene.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many consumers with the problem initially assume it is a
problem with water quality and the fault of the water utility. Dan
Smith, director of distribution engineering for Johnson County
Water District No. 1, said the district began to get calls in late
1997 and had received 87 inquiries since then.

   Eventually, working with the American Water Works Association,
the district traced the problem to the dip tubes. In a month or two
the district plans to distribute a bill insert alerting customers
to the water-heater problem.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Peugeot, the owner of the Roger the Plumber business in
Johnson County, said he had repaired about 200 of the tanks that
had defective dip tubes. He first saw the problem in late 1996 and,
like the water district, was initially stumped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know exactly what it was,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some consumers have gotten repairs to fix shower valves and
dishwashers clogged by plastic chips. The dip tube was not
replaced, meaning that the valves and dishwashers had to be fixed
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been the weirdest thing in my career that has come
along,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The issue also has produced its share of drama in the
water-heater industry.
</P>
<P>
   State Industries, a water-heater manufacturer, sent a letter to
plumbing contractors in June 1998 stating that it was the only
company that had not sold any of the defective water heaters.
</P>
<P>
   The letter said millions of water heaters were likely to fail
because of the defective tubes. Perfection promptly sued State for
libel, saying there was no way it could show that millions of water
heaters would fail.
</P>
<P>
   A settlement was reached, with State paying Perfection's legal
fees. Evie Sommers, corporate counsel for State, said she could not
discuss the issue, because of the settlement's terms. State also
retracted its position that it had sold none of the defective water
heaters. It turns out it had bought some of the defective
Perfection tubes.
</P>
<P>
   Sommers said: ``All we can do is respond to people who call up
with the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   By this time the water-heater companies had in place their
approach to fix the problem. Plumbers would detect and fix the
defective dip tubes when on service calls. The companies would pay
for repairs ``within reason,'' said one company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the event an owner requests service and it is found dip
tube dissolution is the cause of a shortage of hot water, please
follow the attached procedures when servicing the unit,'' said a
letter that water-heater manufacturer A.O. Smith sent the plumbing
trade in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Herb Foster, director of consumer affairs for manufacturer
Bradford White, said that dealing first with a plumber ensured a
proper diagnosis. Lukewarm water, for example, could also be caused
by other problems such as a faulty thermostat or sediment at the
bottom of the tank.
</P>
<P>
   That is not good enough for those who think there ought to be a
recall, or at least notification that a potential defect exists.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for some there has been a happy ending. McCollister, the
Leawood man whose faucets were clogged, was told by one plumber
that the problem was calcium deposits.
</P>
<P>
   A second company was aware of the defective dip tubes. Rheem,
the manufacturer of his water heater, approved the repairs that
were completed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for all those people who don't know what is going
on,'' he said.

FLAW THAT AFFECTS MANY WATER HEATERS HAS NOT BEEN WIDELY
PUBLICIZED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEAWOOD, Kan. _ The white chips clogging the kitchen and
bathroom faucets were a sign something was not right in George
McCollister's household.
</P>
<P>
   The Leawood resident assumed the problem was with the water.
Perhaps some calcium deposits. But recently he learned from a
plumber that the chips were from a defective plastic tube in his
water heater.
</P>
<P>
   Now McCollister wonders why he had not heard of the problem,
which also has caused thousands of other people in the country to
wonder why their faucets, dishwashers and showers were clogged, and
why their water heaters struggled to heat water.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be a recall,'' McCollister said.
</P>
<P>
   People who know that the water-heater defect is causing their
plumbing problems usually can get them fixed for free, or at least
recover some of the cost. There has not been a recall, however, or
even any direct notice to water-heater buyers. That leaves an
unknown number of people with the problem _ and possibly hundreds
of dollars in repair bills.
</P>
<P>
   A manufacturing mistake caused the problem. The chemical
additives that stabilize the plastic tubes were applied improperly,
beginning in 1993, and the problem was not definitely remedied
until 1996. It is not known whether just a few batches of the tubes
were defective, or entire production runs.
</P>
<P>
   The tube manufacturer says the problem is small. Only about
11,000 claims have been filed for repairs or replacements so far.
About 8 million home water heaters are bought each year.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every company in the home water-heater business from 1993
to 1996 is thought to have sold some defective ones. At least a few
hundred have been fixed in the Kansas City area. And complaints
spring up whenever word of the problem circulates.
</P>
<P>
   ``From all reports this is nationwide, and it needs to be
addressed,'' said Michael J. McGuire, a former top executive with
the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. He has been
helping the American Water Works Association examine the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, everyone agrees, is with the plastic pipe called a
dip tube, which a water-heater company can buy for 50 to 85 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The tube is a pipe, 50 inches long in the most-common sized
water heaters, that delivers cold water to the bottom of an
electric or gas water heater's tank, where the burner is. Because
the cold water is delivered to the bottom, it does not dilute the
temperature of the hot water that has risen to the top of the tank.
</P>
<P>
   When the tube decays, so does a water heater's efficiency.
Eventually bits of the plastic tube can get into pipes and cause
other problems.
</P>
<P>
   The problem surfaced in May 1995 when 28 tubes failed
prematurely and were returned to the manufacturer, the Perfection
Corp. of Madison, Ohio. The tubes have a five-year warranty.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which provides more than 90 percent of the dip
tubes used in water heaters for the home, traced the problem to
1993, when the process for putting the additives into the plastic
was changed.
</P>
<P>
   Without the right chemical makeup, the polypropylene tubes can
break up and dissolve in two to three years, the company says. When
the problem was discovered, however, there was no way to tell how
many of the tubes made in the four years were defective, said Frank
Volgstadt, the company's vice president of research, codes and
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no way to estimate it,'' he said. But with the
manufacturing problem corrected in 1996, Perfection thinks the
worst is over.
</P>
<P>
   Both Perfection and others in the water-heater industry said the
problem was being addressed with Perfection paying for the
water-heating and plumbing repairs after they were approved by the
water-heater manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to walk away from our customers,'' said
Vincent Debo, corporate counsel for Rheem Manufacturing Co., a
water-heater manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Others are not so sure that the full extent of the problem has
emerged. The companies did not notify customers directly or
publicize the fact outside plumbers and the water-heater industry.
A search of the Lexis-Nexis database found no articles on the
subject in large-circulation newspapers or magazines for the
general public.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, critics say, the problem has been kept out of
public view and the number of complaints low.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've kept it hidden,'' said Joe Gagnon, who has a weekend
talk show about appliances on radio station WJR in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Gagnon found out he had a water heater with a defective dip
tube. In late December he asked that his listeners and readers of a
column he writes for a small suburban Detroit newspaper send him
their stories of dip-tube problems. About 250 responded in two
weeks, with many saying they had already paid for the repairs, not
knowing about the defect.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Hutchins, the president of a water-quality consulting firm
in Michigan, sent a report to Opflow, a publication of the American
Water Works Association, in December about his work in tracking
down the dip-tube problem in a Clinton, Mich., apartment building.
Since the article was published, he has received 100 calls from
water utilities, plumbing inspectors and consumers from throughout
the country who say they have seen similar problems. &QL;

INSTEAD OF FINDING FAME, `FIGHTING FRED' HAS BEEN ALL BUT
FORGOTTEN

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IOLA, Kan. _ When fire destroyed five businesses on the west
side of the courthouse square here in 1990, it left a 130-foot void
and spawned a nickname _ ``The Ugly Gap.''
</P>
<P>
   Worse yet, residents feared that someone would put up slapdash
buildings, ones that would mar the square's pleasurable
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   But Iola is a progressive little city in Allen County, thank
you, and eventually a tourist center was suggested.
</P>
<P>
   That sounded like a winner. The area has had its share of famous
folk _ baseball Hall-of-Famer Walter ``Big Train'' Johnson from
Humboldt; 1968 Miss America Debra Barnes, reared in Moran; and the
movies' Buster Keaton, born in Piqua as his show-business parents
were passing through.
</P>
<P>
   Still, said lawyer Clyde Toland, when it came to ``famous,''
there was really only one name _ albeit one all but unknown to most
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   That name was Frederick Funston, born in Ohio but raised from
the age of 3 in a little white farmhouse north of here on what's
now U.S. 169.
</P>
<P>
   Funston was a farm boy and a voracious reader of adventure
stories who failed to get into West Point because of poor grades
and truly bantam size _ 5 feet 4 inches tall and 120 pounds; a
never-graduated botany major at the University of Kansas; and a
teacher at the Stony Lonesome grade school near here. Then his life
got interesting:
</P>
<P>
   He explored Death Valley in the 1880s. He did the same in
Alaska, making a solitary, 1,500-mile trip down the Yukon River by
canoe. He was a filibuster (mercenary) in Cuba, rising from
lieutenant to lieutenant colonel and fighting in 22 engagements
alongside insurgents. He commanded the 20th Kansas Volunteer
Regiment in the Spanish-American War. He won the Medal of Honor
almost a century ago (April 27, 1899) for bravery under fire in the
Philippine Insurrection.
</P>
<P>
   And more: He was a national hero as captor of Filipino rebel
Emilio Aguinaldo. By age 35 he was a brigadier general in the U.S.
Army. San Franciscans hailed him as their ``savior'' for his
effective use of troops and organization of relief efforts in and
after the 1906 earthquake and fire.
</P>
<P>
   By 1914, having survived an assassination attempt by a
disgruntled soldier, ``Fighting Fred'' was the highest-ranking
officer in the Army with promotion to major general. In 1916
Funston was the commander during the Mexican-American border
troubles and effectively wrote the book on the large-scale
deployment of troops, one that would be copied in World War I.
</P>
<P>
   In photographs taken in Funston's career, especially group
shots, he is easy to spot. He was the really short guy, the
``Little General'' to his devoted troops, and yet a man who loved
to make jokes about his diminutive stature. In short, he lacked a
Napoleonic complex.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in February 1917, two months before America entered World
War I, Funston, age 52, died of a heart attack while listening to
after-dinner music in a San Antonio hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Funston was the first person ever to lie in state at the famed
Alamo, which was draped in black; the train carrying his body
westward passed lonely crossings where people gathered in knots to
wave their farewells; his funeral at San Francisco's City Hall drew
thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Although he always called Iola home, he is buried at the
Presidio, the former military base in San Francisco. His wife was a
Californian.
</P>
<P>
   President Woodrow Wilson and Secretary of War Newton Baker wrote
later that had Funston lived, he, not Gens. John Pershing or
Leonard Wood, would have led American forces overseas in World War
I.
</P>
<P>
   In that war, Camp Funston, a recruit training center, was
established inside Fort Riley. Today it is remembered for, among
other things, being the locus from which the great influenza
pandemic of 1918-1919 originated and spread.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s there were occasional newspaper and magazine
articles recalling Funston. There was even a short-lived comic
strip dealing with his heroics in the Philippines. A street here
and one in Wichita were named after him. In World War II the
transport ship Frederick Funston was launched, did its duty and was
scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   But no definitive biography of Funston has ever been written.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years Fred Funston was just forgotten,'' said Toland,
the lawyer, who has collected reams of documents on the old
soldier.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lived at the right time _ Death Valley, Alaska, Cuba, the
Philippines.... What he did was to die at the wrong time,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   To Toland, Funston was part of a disappearing age, one in which
individuals could still make a positive difference _ Stanley in
Africa, Shackleton in the Antarctic, Edison in Menlo Park, Ford in
Dearborn, the Wrights in Dayton, Carry Nation in various saloons.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas remembered its adopted son for a long time. In 1955 the
State Historical Society bought the Funston home place, hired a
caretaker and opened the house to the public, advertising it as the
Boyhood Home of Frederick Funston.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the society could never get adequate funding from the
Legislature,'' said Toland, a former president of the Allen County
Historical Society. ``They cut back on the hours, and fewer people
would stop. Fewer stopping meant low attendance, so how could you
justify more hours being open, more money from Topeka? It was a
vicious circle.''
</P>
<P>
   Many who passed by asked, ``Fred who?'' Some tourists, said
Toland, mostly old soldiers who served at Camp Funston, would drive
into Iola and berate those at the Chamber of Commerce who had
nothing to do with the site that, over the years, took on a
shabbier and shabbier appearance.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s a new foundation was put under the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the only thing that prevented it from falling
in on itself,'' said Toland.
</P>
<P>
   The house was saved by Iola's tourism idea. Through fund drives,
cajoling, pleas, occasional arm twisting and plain civic pride,
Toland said, more than $200,000 in local money was raised. The lots
on the square left empty by the fire were donated or bought; the
State Historical Society deeded the house to the Allen County
Historical Society, and a house mover hauled the structure to the
square. Then came a complete renovation.
</P>
<P>
   Since opening last year, more than 5,000 people have visited the
house with its period furnishings, toured the adjoining museum and
noted the six flags flapping outside that were key to Funston's
life _ Cuba, Alaska, Ohio, Texas, California and the Philippines.
They fly alongside Old Glory and the Kansas state flag.
</P>
<P>
   Toland said the Funston house was a perfect adjunct to the
square. Surprisingly, he said, several of the tourists have been
San Franciscans well-acquainted with the name Funston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funston is big out there,'' he said. ``Just go to the Museum
of the City of San Francisco and ask. Why, there's even a Funston
Boulevard near the Presidio. They know his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, better than a lot of us right here.''

MURDER TRIAL OF ALIS BEN JOHNS BEGINS IN WAYNESVILLE, MO. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW SCHOFIELD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WAYNESVILLE, Mo. _ Alis Ben Johns wasn't running much Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The former fugitive, who had dodged dozens of searchers for
months, arrived in Pulaski County Circuit Court here heavily
shackled. He is on trial for the first of three murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   The surrounding hollows shrouded by thick mist and hilltops
covered by even thicker forest, seen through the courthouse
windows, made Pulaski County look like a perfect place to get lost
in the wild, to sneak away from civilization and escape to nature.
</P>
<P>
   Johns had tried that.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities contend that Johns pumped seven .22-caliber bullets
into Tommy Stewart on Oct. 1, 1996. Between that Oct. 1 and April
7, 1997, when a Missouri Water Patrol officer dropped Johns with a
single shot, he became a backwoods nightmare in central Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   For almost six months Johns evaded more than 400 law enforcement
officers searching for him on foot, on horseback and in
helicopters. He fled from house to house, mostly vacant summer
homes, in the rugged woods around the Lake of the Ozarks, taking
food and camping gear. He lived outdoors for days, maybe weeks at a
time. And his woodsman's skills managed to confuse even the
bloodhounds sent out to trail him.
</P>
<P>
   In that time, authorities say, he also killed Leonard Voyle of
Camden County and Wilma Bragg, in faraway Newton County. The trial
that began Saturday deals only with the Stewart slaying.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Johns' fame had spread to the point that last Monday,
when officials started choosing the jury in this trial, they first
moved the process hundreds of miles north to Kirksville. Even then
they had to question 588 potential jurors before finding 16 persons
_ 12 for the jury and four alternates _ suitable for the task.
</P>
<P>
   Moments before the trial was to begin Saturday, Johns stumbled
into the courtroom. He looked haggard; his legs were skinny, and
his face was gaunt, though partly hidden by facial hair.
</P>
<P>
   Despite suggestions from the judge that he find a nice outfit
and cover his shackles in front of jurors, Johns wore a baggy,
gray-and-black striped shirt and orange jail pants. The pants were
bunched about his legs by restraints _ similar to leg braces _
designed to stop him from moving with any speed or agility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to get him to put the pants over the restraints,''
one courtroom guard said. ``But he refused. He said he just doesn't
care what people think.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the trial began, Johns entered the courtroom
ahead of the jurors and the alternates, glared at television and
press photographers, made an obscene gesture and said: ``Put that
on your TV.''
</P>
<P>
   After taking a seat at the defense table, he made the gesture
again when a television camera zoomed in for a close-up of his
face.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Ahsens, an assistant Missouri attorney general, started the
trial by outlining the evidence against Johns.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was found late Oct. 1, 1996, face down on county Route
KK, with blood pooling about his head and red stains spreading
across his white T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities discovered later that the .22-caliber cartridge
cases found 21 feet from the body matched cartridge casings found
at Johns' cabin, though they never would find the weapons that
fired them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll hear from a couple who drove up on the scene that
night, saw the victim's pickup truck, saw the victim lying in the
road and were told by the defendant as they pulled up, `Go on, he's
just drunk,' '' Ahsens said.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the years since, Johns has confessed to law officers,
Ahsens added. Both times he claimed to have killed Stewart only
after Stewart had warned that he would kill Johns.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the evidence will show that there were no guns, no knives,
no clubs, no weapons found where all this was done,'' Ahsens said.
``And the evidence will be very clear that Tommy Stewart was an
unarmed man and will be more than sufficient to prove that Alis
Johns is guilty of murder in the first degree.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Chris Slusher conceded that the evidence would
show Johns shot and killed Stewart. He noted, however, that the
circumstances were such that the shooting was not only in
self-defense, but perhaps necessary.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of the shooting, Johns had been drinking at a
gathering with Stewart's ex-girlfriend, Slusher said. After leaving
in her car, they found themselves being chased at high speeds on
the twisting, sometimes unpaved roads of Pulaski County.
</P>
<P>
   The chase ended, Slusher explained, when Stewart zoomed in front
of the pair on Route KK and skidded his pickup to an angled halt,
creating a roadblock.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart then leaped toward their car, broke through his
girlfriend's window and proceeded to beat her. Johns tried to
intervene but was tossed aside and threatened. At some point in
this struggle the girlfriend handed a gun to Johns, who then shot
Stewart seven times, Slusher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Johns had nothing to do with their violent relationship,''
he said. ``He was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time, a
time when the actions that followed had to take place.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial is expected to last through the week.

<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time on television when Lorena Bobbitt, Joey
Buttafuoco and Amy Fisher and the boy accusing Michael Jackson of
sexual molestation were the special and overheated province of
early-evening tabloid news shows.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at the very moment when tabloid topics have become big news
in the most respected newspaper and television news programs, when
a tale of sex and betrayal is even being played out on the floor of
the U.S. Senate, the generation of shows that spawned the term
``tabloid television'' is dying. From a heyday when there were a
half-dozen, only three remain, ``Hard Copy,'' ``Inside Edition''
and ``Extra'' _ and all have lost a fifth or more of their viewers
in the past year alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard Copy'' has even gone soft, focusing on first-person
stories, often about celebrities, and local stories about ordinary
folks.
</P>
<P>
   Television's cyclical nature is one reason _ a successful show
spawns many imitators, fragmenting the audience and eventually
diluting interest in that genre. Lurid talk shows, for example,
numbered 21 at their peak and are now down to a handful. But also,
tabloid news magazines have withered because certain kinds of
tabloid-style stories have migrated to the traditional news
organizations, which have so much more time to fill. There are
three all-news cable channels, and the broadcast networks produce
12 hours each week of news magazine programs (soon to be 14, with a
fourth night of ``20/20'').
</P>
<P>
   To put the competition in perspective, Diane Dimond, a former
reporter for ``Hard Copy,'' ``Extra,'' and ``A Current Affair,''
and now co-anchor of ``Upfront Tonight'' on the business-news
channel CNBC, recalled a story she pursued for ``Hard Copy'' in
late 1996. A single mother in Massachusetts had had triplets, gone
back to work to support them, and hired a nanny who somehow managed
to assume the woman's legal identity.
</P>
<P>
   A great tabloid story, Ms. Dimond thought, and it had been seen
only in the local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drove to her house and went and knocked on the door,'' Ms.
Dimond recalled ``and she said, `Oh! Diane Dimond! I watch you all
the time! But I'm really sorry _ I just promised my story to Diane
Sawyer.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever her own populist appeal, Ms. Dimond knew, it could not
compete with the fame, glamour and prime-time exposure associated
with Ms. Sawyer, co-anchor of ``Prime Time Live'' on ABC (now part
of ``20/20'').
</P>
<P>
   Maury Povich, the original host of ``A Current Affair,'' which
began in 1986, said the genre is evaporating because it is no
longer distinctive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be vilified by the traditionalists for this, but the
network prime-time news magazines have co-opted the tabloid
genre,'' said Povich, now host of his own talk show, ``Maury.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason for our success in the mid-'80s and early '90s was
we did stories that the traditional news divisions passed up,'' he
said. ``They never did stories like the Robert Chambers Central
Park murder story, or chasing down Mary Beth Whitehead, the
surrogate mom. These are stories that were staples in The New York
Daily News or New York Post, but they'd never put them on a
national broadcast.''
</P>
<P>
   They do now, he and several tabloid magazine veterans say. But
some mainstream television magazine executives say that _ aside
from the greater number of hours to fill _ nothing much has
changed.
</P>
<P>
   When ``60 Minutes'' and ``20/20''' began, the mix always
included stories of human drama and true crime, said Victor
Neufeld, the executive producer of ``20/20,'' who has overseen the
expansion from one show a week to four in the past year.
``Prime-time news magazines have always done these stories when
they have significance and they have a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference, '' he added, ``is that while syndicated
tabloid shows were doing stories in two days, we would take two
months, with significantly more time and effort invested in telling
a story to give it depth, impact and meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   Significantly more money is invested, too. A typical segment for
``Dateline'' or ``20/20'' can cost $500,000 to produce. ``A Current
Affair'' used to spend $70,000 or $75,000 an episode.
</P>
<P>
   Neal Shapiro, the executive producer of ``Dateline'' on NBC,
acknowledges that network programs do some of the same stories
tabloid show, or do.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they do half an hour, so they do three- or four-minute
stories, and often don't talk to the principal characters,'' he
said. ``We have an hour. We do longer stories. You meet the
characters, hear their words, and hear the larger story, the
context.''
</P>
<P>
   Even granting that to be true, tabloid producers say the
networks are digging deeper for the kind of stories only tabloids
used to pursue.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we go after stories, more often than ever before we find
our main competitor is either `Dateline' or `20/20,''' said Marc
Rosenweig, the senior vice president for programming and production
at King World Productions Inc., which syndicates ``Inside
Edition,'' whose anchor is Deborah Norville.
</P>
<P>
   But back when Peter Brennan, John Tomlin and Bob Young started
``A Current Affair'' for the Fox stations in 1986, only ``60
Minutes'' and ``20/20'' did magazine-style news programs in prime
time, and only CNN offered 24 hours of news. There was plenty of
room for offbeat stories.
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by the head of Fox's parent company, the News Corp.
chief Rupert Murdoch, who owned tabloid newspapers in Australia,
Britain and New York, the three producers tried to establish an
afternoon-newspaper approach to news, offering different angles and
more human-interest stories. As with tabloid newspapers, this
sometimes meant sensationalism and sleaze _ wet T-shirt contests,
lurid crimes like Mrs. Bobbitt's cutting off her husband's penis,
or grotesqueries like obese people who could not get out of bed.
</P>
<P>
   But it sometimes meant solid investigative reporting or dogged
pursuit of people trying to dodge exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inside Edition,'' in fact, won a prestigious George Polk Award
in 1994 for an undercover investigation of the exploitation of poor
people by some insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we were the only show in America to get a live interview
with Charles Keating, early in the Lincoln Savings debacle,'' Young
said of ``Inside Edition,'' which he and Tomlin started in 1988.
(Bill O'Reilly, who did that interview, is now an anchor on the Fox
News Channel.)
</P>
<P>
   Both ``A Current Affair'' and ``Inside Edition'' got excellent
ratings in the prime-time access time period, as the hour before 8
p.m. is known. So did ``Hard Copy,'' which began in 1989, until
recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``When our ratings went through the roof, they took notice,''
Povich said, referring to ABC, CBS and NBC. ``I think the O.J.
Simpson case never would have been such a huge story if tabloid
news magazines hadn't been there before and alerted audiences to
the power of these stories.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Frank Kelly, co-president of Time Warner Inc.'s Paramount
Domestic Television unit and the executive in charge of the
10-year-old ``Hard Copy,'' agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a seismic change with the O.J. story,'' he said.
``That's when all media came to the king of tabloid stories. That's
when it really changed. People asked, `How could you do O.J. for
four or five straight months?' Yet when they stopped, people went
away and sought out shows that were still doing O.J. stories. There
was this insatiable appetite, and the networks said, `This is
amazing, but people want this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But if one of the keys to tabloid success was alerting people to
stories they had never dreamed possible _ shocking people, in other
words _ then the increase in television channels, and in news
programs, and the wider latitude for reporting intimate details of
scandal, may have helped reduce the element of shock.
</P>
<P>
   And Kelly pointed out that tabloid magazine shows have new
competition from reruns of popular sitcoms like ``Seinfeld'' and
``Friends,'' since the recent relaxation of certain federal rules
that now allows stations owned by networks to buy network reruns.
Many are scheduled in that prime-time access hour of 7 to 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The same pressure of competition from mainstream news outlets
has affected supermarket tabloid newspapers like The National
Enquirer, Globe and The Star. All have seen circulation fall.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the face of this trend, The National Enquirer is
producing a television show, set to debut next fall. Marc Berman,
an analyst with Seltel Inc. who advises stations on what programs
to buy, said it would probably be more a gossip show than a tabloid
news magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tabloid reality show is not the hot ticket any more,''
Berman said. ``It used to be people said, `Omigod, did you see
``Hard Copy'' last night?' But not any more.''
</P>
<P>
   The replacement? Court shows. The tremendous daytime success of
``Judge Judy'' spawned three imitators this season. Next season
there will be six, including one called ``Divorce Court.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Court is the hot ticket now,'' Berman said.

   TALES FROM THE TABLOIDS
</P>
<P>
   Lurid features about murders and the underbelly of American life
were once almost the sole province of tabloid television news
magazines. But, with more competition for such fare from mainstream
news programs and more all-news networks, tabloid television is
weaving in more soft features and celebrity profiles. Here is a
sampling from ``Inside Edition'' and ``Hard Copy'' from last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inside Edition,'' Jan. 13
</P>
<P>
   Lead segment: An interview with the female fan who broke into
Brad Pitt's house. Other segments included Gunther, a dog who
reportedly inherited $65 million and is shopping for real estate in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard Copy,'' Jan. 13
</P>
<P>
   Lead: A modern-day Noah stockpiles food in preparation for the
so-called millennium bug that some fear may disrupt the world's
computers. Other features included the ``Sinister Minister,'' a
Tennessee minister and his wife who have been accused of abusing
and raping their adopted daughters, and a behind-the-scenes look at
the making of the new Latin version of the hit 1970s show
``Charlie's Angels,'' which will run on the Telemundo network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inside Edition,'' Jan. 14
</P>
<P>
   Lead: Michael Jordan's retirement is a gift to the two Mrs.
Jordans _ his wife and his mother. Also, the remains of a young
woman thought to be a 13-year-old girl are found; celebrities,
including Mariah Carey had appealed for her safe return. Also: a
segment dealing with claims that Gunther is a fraud, and that he
did not inherit millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard Copy,'' Jan. 14
</P>
<P>
   Lead: A young surgeon is slain by an unknown gunman and the
police suspect a love triangle. Other pieces included a profile of
Michelle Thomas, a young soap opera star who died of cancer.

SOME MIDSTREAM HITS FOR THE NETWORKS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Maybe network television can still produce
hits after all. In five days, three networks started new series and
all of them scored ratings that would qualify them as significant
hits, by far the biggest new hits of what has been a woebegone
television season, if they hold up.
</P>
<P>
   What the shows _ ``Providence'' on NBC, ``The PJ's'' on Fox and
``60 Minutes II'' on CBS _ had in common was that they were not
introduced in the midst of the land-rush onslaught of new series
that marks every fall television season, but were singled out by
their networks for special handling during what is known as
television's midseason.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of each show was given the kind of devotion that
movie studios give to big-budget films: heavy promotion aimed at
maximum exposure. Almost no one in the country could have escaped
the fact that these shows were coming on for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The entire television industry noticed, to the point that
numerous executives at both the networks and the studios that
produce television series said in interviews here that the system
of starting new series in the fall was fatally flawed. They said
that they foresaw an emphasis on holding shows for the midseason,
both to avoid the fall congestion and to gain the lavish promotion
attention that these three shows received.
</P>
<P>
   The midseason record for creating hits in recent years does
compare very favorably with that of the fall. In the last two
years, ``King of the Hill'' on Fox, ``The Practice'' on ABC and
``Dawson's Creek'' and ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' on WB have all
come on at midseason. The list of hits in the fall is much shorter.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors make January an especially good time to draw
attention to some new shows, one being the weather, which this year
had been especially cold and snowy in the East and Midwest, keeping
more people at home and thus forcing up viewing levels. Another
advantage for the networks that have football (two, in this case)
is the huge audiences that tune in to playoff games in January,
creating an extra-large pool of viewers to see promotions of new
series.
</P>
<P>
   But the executives said the most important development this
season was the focus that these networks brought to these three
shows: no other shows were being pitched to divert attention. In
addition, many of the promotions were adorned with special touches
like movie-style music and even, in the case of ``The PJ's,''
animated creatures walking across the screen during the games.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Braun, the president of Walt Disney's Buena Vista
Television, said he was a ``huge fan of midseason,'' citing the
handicaps created by the traditional system of program development.
Under this system, all the writing and acting talent is locked into
a short window of pilot creation, aimed at dishing up a batch of
new shows for the spring announcements of network schedules.
</P>
<P>
   These spring announcements serve as the kickoff to the network
advertising sales round known as the ``up front,'' when advertisers
commit several billion dollars a year to the network shows.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Grushow, the president of 20th Century Fox Television,
which produces shows for several networks, said, ``I think what
we're prisoners to is the network sales departments who all feel
that come May and June we've got to go into New York and we've got
to show the advertising community our wares and make sure their
up-front dollars are spoken for.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney owns ABC; Fox is a unit of the News Corporation and
General Electric owns NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the swing of shows from the fall to the midseason has
to be limited. If too many shows switched, it could create a glut
in January that would make it impossible to give the shows the
favorite-son promotion treatment that the three new entries
received.
</P>
<P>
   But the executives emphasized that the timing was less important
than the special treatment. ``Maybe what the networks need to do is
pick one show a month and just go all out, pushing it everywhere
they can for the entire month,'' Braun said. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   IGLOOLIK, Northwest Territories _ The time when the sun
disappears and day becomes night is known as ``the great darkness''
by the people who have lived on this island of ice high in the
Canadian arctic for over 4,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Stars shine at midday, and though violet bands brighten the
immense sky for brief periods around what would be high noon in
Toronto, 1,950 miles south, the sun does not appear at all for
seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The day the sun finally emerges from the horizon like the
nostrils of a bearded seal poking out of the ocean ice was once the
most important day of the year for Igloolik's Eskimos, who now
prefer to be known as Inuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first person who saw the sun would rush back to the sod
houses or igloos to tell everyone,'' Rosie Iqalliyuq, a 96-year-old
elder, said through a translator. A great igloo would be built.
Soapstone lamps that had provided the only illumination during the
long night would be ceremoniously extinguished, she remembered, and
relit from a single wick.
</P>
<P>
   Then the outsiders came from the south with their crosses and
their schools and their strange notions about chopping up the day
into small pieces called minutes, and the celebrations stopped.
Eventually, with electric lights, alarm clocks and calendars, ``the
great darkness'' meant almost nothing.
</P>
<P>
   It was just one more loss in the cultural collision between
north and south that over the last century has stripped the people
of the Arctic of much of their tradition and culture.
</P>
<P>
   But a few years ago people here began systematic interviews with
elders like Mrs. Iqalliyuq (pronounced EE-kwal-ee-juk). Their vivid
memories suddenly made all that had been lost as clear as moon
shadows on new snow. A few leaders set their jaws and decided to
reverse the current.
</P>
<P>
   So on Saturday night, with the temperature outside low enough to
turn a man's breath to crystals of ice, about 400 people gathered
to watch three elders light traditional soapstone lamps filled with
lumps of pink seal blubber. Then, in a moment taken from the old
times, children who had seen the new sun came in to blow out the
flames. There was complete darkness for a minute. When the elderly
women relit the wicks, faces carved by the cold briefly glowed with
the light that represented new life.
</P>
<P>
   It is only natural the sun ceremony would be revived in
Igloolik. Throughout the arctic, Igloolik is famous both for its
fermented walrus meat and for the way the people of this stark and
spirited land survive.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that the 1,200 people in this hamlet roughly 1,200
miles from the North Pole have perfectly preserved their
traditional way of life. Snowmobiles buzz through the streets of
packed snow, and even though the temperature routinely hits 32
degrees below zero Fahrenheit, it is possible to buy a head of
lettuce at either of the two stores in town.
</P>
<P>
   But the appreciation of the ancient ways of life lies closer to
the surface here than in many other places in Canada's remote
north, in part because of the community's isolation and in part
because of the influence of a number of strong leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last 30 years we were busy learning other things,''
said Leah Otak, a resourceful woman who spans the two cultures by
working with both the Eskimo elders' society and the Nunavut
Research Institute, a federal program based in Igloolik. Under the
guidance of John MacDonald, a social anthropologist and star gazer,
the institute has transcribed interviews with more than 400 elders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very much into other things _ silly games, dances _ to
the point where young people didn't know about their culture,''
Mrs. Otak said. ``It's only in the last few years that we really
tried to show our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the seventh year since the sun ceremony was rekindled,
and it is an especially important year because on April 1, 770,000
square miles of ice and snow in the eastern portion of Canada's
arctic will become a separate territory named Nunavut that will be
governed by more than 25,000 Inuit who live here.
</P>
<P>
   While reviving ceremonies like this fosters a growing confidence
among the people at a crucial time, there is no pretense that
Igloolik or Nunavut can go back to the way things used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not real, what they do today,'' Mrs. Iqalliyuq said. She
sat cross-legged on her bed, with an Arctic trout thawing out on a
nearby hamper and The Simpsons on the television screen. But she
believes the sun ceremony ``will make people remember what it used
to mean.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This year's ceremony was to have been held inside a large igloo,
a splendid dome of lake ice like the kind Mrs. Iqalliyuq remembers.
Several men worked hard to complete it in time for Saturday's event
but when they got to the top they ran out of ice blocks, which had
been cut in the fall, before the ice got too thick.
</P>
<P>
   So the ceremony was held inside the school gym _ not on Jan. 14,
the day the sun actually reappeared, but on Saturday night, which
was more-convenient. Three women who had clearly lived through many
``great darknesses'' expertly placed cotton and moss wicks on the
edge of three soapstone platters brimming with seal blubber.
</P>
<P>
   Then they were lit, not with a piece of flint, as in the old
days, but with a plastic cigarette lighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tug of war going on between traditional culture and
southern culture,'' said George Qulaut, the Assistant Deputy
Minister of the new Department of Culture, Language, Elders and
Youth in Nunavut.
</P>
<P>
   Qulaut believes the Eskimos can win that tug of war if they are
able to learn more about their culture, while also adopting modern
advantages. He said the large wooden dog sleds that many hunters
use are crystal clear examples of how the two cultures can
comfortably accommodate each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``One hundred percent of the sled is southern material now, but
one hundred percent of the technology and knowledge that goes into
it comes from the ancestors,'' Qulaut said. ``Combining them
together makes the perfect sled.''
</P>
<P>
   It should be no surprise that two distinct worlds can learn from
each other _ especially not in a land where a familiar
constellation like the Big Dipper shines brightly in the midday sky
and people call it the great caribou.
</P>
<P>
   Change is occurring rapidly. Women in Igloolik carry their
babies in the traditional way in the hoods of their parkas, but
they also bring along disposable diapers. Men wear caribou breeches
while they zip around on snowmobiles.
</P>
<P>
   And while hunters drink seal blood to warm themselves on the ice
floes, they also like orange soda to cool themselves inside the
overheated gymnasium where they gathered to welcome back the sun,
chant over a ceremonial drum dance, and hoot and holler during the
big night's grand finale: a traditional Western-style square dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done both the drum dance and the square dance,'' said
Samueli Ammaq, a caribou hunter whose fancy dancing is sharp enough
to throw off sparks. ``And I like them both.''

   TAPACHULA, Mexico _ About every two days, a cargo train loaded
with fuel and other supplies arrives in this city near Mexico's
border with Guatemala. It departs back north after sundown, empty
but for the human cargo clinging to its sides.
</P>
<P>
   Since a hurricane struck Central America in the fall, leaving
thousands dead and millions homeless, officials say there has been
an alarming increase in the number of immigrants making this
harrowing journey, heading to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Central American immigrants have been jumping this creaking old
night train for more than a decade, embarking on a 15-hour ride
fraught with danger. Hundreds are ambushed and beaten by thieves.
Others suffocate after crawling inside the sealed box cars or are
mutilated when exhaustion causes them to lose their grip and fall
beneath the train.
</P>
<P>
   This latest group, driven by the loss of lives and livelihoods,
is more desperate and more determined to reach the United States,
say immigration officials and social workers who have talked with
them. Among those waiting for the train here earlier this month
were three men from the western Honduras province of Olancho.
Haggard and hungry, they said that their entire village of 500
people had been destroyed by the hurricane, which wreaked an
estimated $4 billion damage. They had left home two weeks earlier,
taking buses for pennies across Guatemala, and already they had
been robbed _ each had brought about $30 for food. One showed a
deep gash on his shoulder left by the thief's machete.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has to be the most sad experience a person could live,
leaving your children,'' said one, Jose Juarez, a farmer and father
of five. ``There are no words to describe that kind of pain. But I
must make this sacrifice for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials worry that the increased number of immigrants
crossing the border of southern Mexico could indicate the beginning
of a prolonged and large-scale migration of Central Americans
through Mexico to the United States. Such a migration threatens to
place even greater burdens on border control systems in Mexico and
the United States and would put untold numbers of immigrants at
risk of being robbed, raped, murdered and even enslaved by
immigrant smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Central Americans detained and expelled at the
southern border has doubled in the last several weeks, Alejandro
Carrillo Castro of Mexico's National Immigration Institute said in
an interview in Mexico City. Institute officers caught 5,800
immigrants _ the overwhelming majority from Honduras, the country
most affected by the hurricane _ last month, compared with about
2,900 in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Border Patrol officials in Laredo, Del Rio and McAllen _
all Texas towns that are easily accessible from Tapachula _ report
significant increases in the numbers of Central Americans detained
in December.
</P>
<P>
   In Laredo, for example, officials report that some 583
immigrants known as ``other than Mexicans'' were detained last
month, compared with 123 in December 1997. And in Del Rio,
officials said the number of immigrants detained who were coming
from places other than Mexico rose to 221 last month, compared with
45 in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   While the overall numbers are still low, U.S. officials said,
they are troubled by the trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are watching it very closely, and we want to do everything
we can to avert a mass migration,'' said Doris Meissner,
commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service,
referring to Washington's support of numerous reconstruction
efforts across Central America aimed at restoring infrastructure
and creating jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Carrillo said strategies to prevent mass migrations from Central
America would be discussed at a Jan. 26 meeting in San Salvador of
the Grupo Puebla, a gathering of leading immigration officials from
the United States, Mexico, Canada and every Central American
nation.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, law enforcement officers charged with protecting
immigrants' rights reported that they provided services to some
3,000 Central American immigrants last month, 10 times the number
in December of 1997. And at the Casa del Migrante, a shelter for
immigrants in Tecun Uman, a Guatemalan town adjoining the Mexican
border, social workers said they served close to 900 newly arrived
immigrants, compared with 200 in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other groups of immigrants, the people making the journey
across Mexico's southern border have had no time to plan their
trips, save money or contact relatives who might receive them. Most
travel only with the clothes they are wearing, a little money for
food, and wads of paper, about the size of gum wrappers, with phone
numbers of relatives whom they have not seen or talked to in years.
</P>
<P>
   Another unusual feature of this desperate group is that it
includes middle-aged men, like Jose Elias Perez, 47, who typically
put off notions of abandoning their countries in pursuit of new
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am past the years where I want adventures,'' said Perez,
while a friend rubbed salve on his swollen ankle. ``I am doing this
because I have no options. In Honduras I had no way to make money.
I had no house. I had no transportation. And I had no food for my
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the United States,'' he said, ``if they pay me three
dollars an hour, it will be fine with me.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So far, Mexican officials say they have no plans to seal off
their southern border with more immigration agents. Now, 150 agents
are posted along Mexico's 650-mile border with Guatemala and
Belize.
</P>
<P>
   Most are posted here, the most common gateway for immigrants
coming from Central America because the Suchiate River that forms a
natural border between Guatemala and Mexico is low and calm; there
are shelters that provide free food and lodging to immigrants, and
there are accessible forms of mass transportation heading due
north.
</P>
<P>
   The border area near this city is so well known as a transit
stop for illegal immigrants _ as well as a den for smugglers and
others who prey upon the desperate _ that people refer to it as
``Little Tijuana.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent morning, the sun had only been up for a few moments
and already some 200 haggard and hungry immigrants had emerged from
their sleeping places, beneath bridges and in the municipal
cemetery, to gather along the railroad tracks that pass through
town.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was Julio Cesar Rodriguez, 28, a banana farmer and
father of two from El Progreso, who said the fields where he worked
were ruined. Perez, a taxi driver and father of two from Comayagua,
said his entire neighborhood and the car he used to make his living
were swept away in the flood. And Nery Sierra Ramos, 33, broke into
tears as he talked about losing his three children, ages 10, 5, and
1.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the men around him, Sierra said they were his family
now. He called them ``hermanos del camino,'' Spanish for ``road
brothers.'' And even though their journey had been tough _ they had
also been robbed of their money _ they refused to turn back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are suffering here, but at least we have hope that there
might be a future for us in the United States,'' said Sierra, a
thin man who wore a jeans jacket that looked too small. ``In
Honduras, we have no hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he thought more Hondurans would follow, he said,
``If they could, all of Honduras would come.''
</P>
<P>
   Another important factor contributing to the increase in the
numbers of immigrants from Honduras, officials and immigrants said,
was that many Central Americans mistakenly believe that the United
States had offered refuge to all victims of Hurricane Mitch. The
confusion apparently arose immediately after the storm, when the
U.S. government delayed deportations of undocumented Central
Americans for humanitarian reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Clinton administration announced that it would
extend the amnesty for Hondurans and Nicaraguans who were in the
United States before Dec. 30 by granting them an 18-month temporary
protected status.
</P>
<P>
   People in Central America believed they had been given a green
light to immigrate. Most of the immigrants interviewed over three
days at different places along Mexico's southern border confirmed
the confusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We read it in our newspapers,'' said Carlos Cabrera, 21.
``They said that Hondurans who are victims of Mitch will be allowed
to come and work in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are good people who just want to work,'' he said. ``Tell
your president to let us in.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meissner said that a major thrust of the American
government's work with Central American governments was aimed at
spreading the word that people who immigrate to the United States
would not be given refuge.
</P>
<P>
   Lesbia Gabriel Maldonado, a social worker at the Casa del
Migrante, the immigrant shelter in Tecun Uman, said she had done
several interviews on Honduran radio in an effort to warn people
that they would not be given amnesty in the United States. She said
dozens of immigrants who had gone to her shelter carried ``letters
of recommendation'' from their town mayors or their parish priests,
verifying that their homes have been destroyed and that they
urgently needed refuge.
</P>
<P>
   When she tells them those letters are useless, she said, the
immigrants feel deceived, but not deterred.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they are already here, and so they are going to go
on,'' she said. ``They have nothing at home. They have no reason to
go back.''
</P>
<P>
   Hugo Ayala Morales, chief of a law enforcement agency that
strives to protect immigrants from attacks, said: ``These people
seem more determined than other groups of immigrants I have seen.
They are more desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those determined to get to the United States was Carlos
Danilo Rojas Gomez, 35, a military sergeant from Tegucigalpa, the
Honduras capital. In what seemed like just a few seconds, he said,
he watched the Choluteca River swell and consume his entire house.
Two of his sisters drowned.
</P>
<P>
   He asked his superior officers to help him and his family find a
place to live. But, he said, they turned him away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I served my country for 16 years and when I went to them for
help they told me I was homeless just like everyone else,'' he
said. ``In that moment, I learned that we are nothing in our
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Rojas said he began his journey out of Honduras on Dec. 28 and
made it to Tapachula before immigration agents arrested him on a
bus heading north. Mexican officials sent him back to Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   His skin was sunburned and his eyes were so bloodshot they
matched the pink T-shirt he was wearing. He was worried about his
wife, who was eight months pregnant when he left, he said. After
several collect phone calls to Honduras, Rojas still had not been
able to reach her.
</P>
<P>
   He was also worried about money. He said the $300 he had brought
with him was stolen by two men who held him up. But he refused to
go home. In Honduras, he said, he earned less than $150 a month,
hardly enough to rebuild his house and provide for his family.
International aid flowing into Honduras, he said, is going only to
help the rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is easier for me to die of hunger trying to get to the
United States,'' Rojas said, ``than to watch my wife and child
suffer hunger.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, he said, he would start out again for Houston,
where he hoped to get help from a friend of a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they catch me 1,000 times,'' he said, ``I will try again
1,000 times until I succeed.''

CRUSADING FANS CELEBRATE RETURN OF UPN ACTION SERIES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ANN HODGES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Never underestimate the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   It has the power to do the next-to-impossible: save a TV show
from a network's fiery furnace.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet saved ``The Sentinel.'' If that makes you say ``Say
what?'' just take an online hike to www.egroups.com and let Kaytee
and her chat pals at Texastribe fill you in. They're the top fans
of a UPN series that most viewers have probably never seen.
</P>
<P>
   The Texastribe flew to California to meet with UPN and the
Television Critics Association. Other ``Sentinel'' fans _ more than
250 of them _ came from all across the country, Canada, Germany,
Italy and the Bahamas. They came on their own to fill up a
Ritz-Carlton Huntington ballroom with a rally to celebrate ``The
Senintel's'' reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   After teetering on the brink last spring, ``The Sentinel''
returns Monday, when UPN will rerun the original pilot to give
those unfamiliar with ``The Sentinel's'' action-packed adventures a
chance to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   And take it from one who saw the rally, the fans' devotion is
above and beyond. It would take a cold heart to deprive this
fervent crowd of its favorite TV show.
</P>
<P>
   UPN's heart melted.
</P>
<P>
   The show is explosive action and intrigue, centered on Det. Jim
Ellison (Richard Burgi), a policeman with remarkably sensitive
senses. Once a captain in the Army's Special Forces, he survived 18
months in a hostile Peruvian jungle, which left some lasting
mystical touches. Ellison's secret is known only to Blair Sandburg
(Garett Maggart), the young anthropology student who's studying
Ellison's gifts, and his superior, Capt. Simon Banks (Bruce A.
Young).
</P>
<P>
   The fans were mostly women, with a sprinkling of males. From the
looks on those faces as they cheered their hero Burgi, this was
their moment of triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw some previews of the show on `Star Trek: Voyager,'''
said Texastribe's Kaytee (she uses her e-mail moniker on these
occasions. ``I liked the mystical aspects of it and the
relationship, the real chemistry, between the three characters _
all the things I saw on it that are not on any shows now.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, Kaytee found a lot of other fans who felt the
same way. They were all on different e-mail lists, so she invited
Texas fans to get together on their own, Texastribe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got together and really bonded,'' she said. ``We've become
friends. About 20 of us have met five times now for rallies. Ten
are here today.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston's Carol Shorn was here, too. She flew in for the rally
because she loves the way the character of Blair Sandburg is
presented. He's a nice normal guy. So many times TV makes
scientists look foolish or nerdy, said Shorn, who's a scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Shorn, a sci-fi fan, heard other fans talking about ``The
Sentinel.'' When one of them sent her a tape, she was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan's Ann Walton flew in, too. Like Lorrie Roussin of Austin,
Texas, and Carmen Medina of San Antonio, Texas, she finds a
spirtual quality in the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the mail tells us they love the mythology, the back
story of the jungle and the cats. And they love the friendship
between Ellison and Sandburg,'' creator and executive producer
Danny Bilson said. ``We've tried to do more about those things in
the next eight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We never canceled `The Sentinel.' We just put (it) into
back-up,'' said Tom Nunan, president of UPN Entertainment. ``It
performed well for us, but we weren't sure whether it would be a
building block for next fall.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks moving it from Wednesday to Monday will bring ``an
interesting male skew, especially with Monday Night Football off
the air.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 25, UPN will rerun last season's finale, which was a
cliffhanger. New episodes begin on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sentinel'' had just finished shooting the second half of
its cliffhanger last May when UPN sent the message now etched in
the memory of Bilson: ``The words were, `You are not on the
schedule.'''
</P>
<P>
   Those were the last words he expected. The ratings were
``relatively good for UPN,'' and the show had been running for 57
episodes. ``Our studio is partners in the network, the show's been
sold to syndication, and we felt there's no way we're going to get
canceled. It just didn't make financial sense,'' Bilson recalled.
``We were completely shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when the news hit the fans _ like a ton of bricks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to believe they brought us back,'' said Bilson. ``That
feels really good ... a huge fan element that is very loud and has
put a lot of pressure on everybody. I contact some of them
sometimes on e-mail. If they brought us back, that's the best
scenario for what could have happened, so I like to think that is
what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   How did they do it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they tortured the network,'' Bilson said. ``I heard
stories like they were jamming the phone lines and sending them so
much mail that ultimately they started turning the mail back, there
was so much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty extraordinary,'' creator and executive producer
Paul DeMeo added. ``In my office alone, we had a notebook with
literally thousands of e-mails.''
</P>
<P>
   There were 1,500 in the first 48 hours after word of the
cancellation got out. That's an avalanche to UPN, which has had its
problems rallying fans to anything this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Internet is a tool that's become incredibly
important,'' DeMeo said. ``It certainly revolutionizes this sort of
fan-based support for any show. And on our show in particular, it
really did make a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, to be sure, the question of whether all this
celebrating is premature. UPN has ordered only eight more episodes,
and there are no assurances ``The Sentinel'' will survive beyond
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very, very grateful we're sitting here today from where we
were in early June. And if it's only eight, I'm just happy that we
have another shot to get on the air and let the people come and
watch it,'' Bilson said.
</P>
<P>
   As the star, Burgi has been thinking a lot about how to thank
the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping the network would get behind it, and put out a
`Sentinel' doll that was a life-size figure people could take home,
and it would know your feelings and would hug you a lot,'' he
quipped.
</P>
<P>
   But seriously, folks, though he confesses to being ``computer
illiterate,'' Burgi wants to establish his own Web site, the better
to interact with fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some conventions and spent some time with them,''
Burgi said. ``I feel so grateful the way they've responded, all I
can do is speak from my heart and give them my gratitude.''
</P>
<P>
   He did that, down the hall in the ballroom, and they all went
home happy, with autographs and pictures.

TOILING NOT SO SECRETLY IN SWITZERLAND, A WINDOWS EMULATOR GAINS ON
MICROSOFT 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Switzerland, Canada, Wash.)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In painting the perils that could topple his mighty Microsoft
empire, William H. Gates likes to invoke the theoretical young
programmer toiling in obscurity somewhere, at work on the software
project that could overtake the industry-dominating Windows
software operating system.
</P>
<P>
   As effective a rhetorical device as Gates may find this when
confronting antitrust enforcers, he may not have considered the
possibility that the obscure toiler already exists in the person of
a 28-year-old Swiss programmer, Alexandre Julliard. For the last
four years Julliard has been coordinating a little-noticed
international project that is intended to let PC users run their
normally Windows-dependent programs on Linux _ a free operating
system, whose devotees would very much like to overthrow
Microsoft's hegemony.
</P>
<P>
   The project is known as Wine, which is short for Windows
emulator.
</P>
<P>
   In the computer industry, emulation refers to the ability of one
type of software to imitate software of a different technical
standard so completely that the difference is virtually invisible
to the user. If Julliard's Wine mission succeeds, it will be
possible for users of personal computers to operate all their
favorite Windows applications _ whether Microsoft's own popular
Word or Excel programs or thousands of others _ without need of the
underlying Microsoft Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the project cannot be considered a success. Most Windows
programs run only partly _ if at all _ with Wine, and using it
still requires a computer geek's special skills. But some 20,000
different users visit the Wine site on the World Wide Web
(www.winehq.com) every week. New versions of Wine are being issued
via the site every couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A data base at the winehq.com site keeps track of nearly 1,000
popular Wine-converted Windows programs and users' ratings of them.
The ratings use a scale in which 5 denotes perfect Windows
compatibility and 0 indicates the program will not even run. Wine
versions of Microsoft's Word and Excel currently carry low average
ratings of 1.4 and 1.6. But some games are earning high marks, like
Blizzard's Starcraft, which has a current rating of 4.6.
</P>
<P>
   Each incremental Wine improvement offers evidence of the growing
strength of the so-called open source software movement, a
quasi-spiritual commitment by engineers within the software
industry whose deity is the Linux operating system. In the open
source approach to software development, the original programmer's
instructions are freely shared and subsequent program development
frequently takes place on a volunteer basis. Proponents of the
movement, which is gaining a wide following around the world, argue
that open source is the path to higher quality, more reliable
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The motives are not necessarily nonprofit. Since last month, for
example, the Corel Corp., the big Toronto-based maker of programs
like Word Perfect and Corel Draw, has had more than a half-dozen
programmers devoted to the Wine project in hopes of speeding the
translation of the company's products to Linux.
</P>
<P>
   A Corel executive says the company is rapidly expanding this
effort and that other software companies are considering joining
the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're stepping up to contribute in a big way,'' said Derek
Burney, Corel's executive vice president for engineering. ``The
software is good, and when people realize that, it could turn into
an avalanche.''
</P>
<P>
   Julliard, who coordinates the Wine project as a volunteer effort
on nights and weekends from his home in Lausanne, Switzerland, says
such mounting support is encouraging. ``I think we have the means
to compete against Microsoft,'' he said. Like many people in the
open source community, he says he is motivated in part by his
dislike of Microsoft's business tactics and its control of the
computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like most free software developers, I don't like them at
all,'' Julliard said of Microsoft. ``And I think their way of doing
business is hurting the whole computer industry.''
</P>
<P>
   If Wine were to succeed, it would be conceivable for PC users to
remain entirely independent of Microsoft's Windows operating
system. And that could make Linux, which until now has had its
biggest impact in the market for corporate server computers, a
direct head-to-head competitor with the heart of Gates' business.
</P>
<P>
   Julliard acknowledges that he and his informal Wine group of
some 150 programmers around the world are still far from achieving
their goal of creating what they envision as a level playing field
in the software world. And yet their effort could help expand the
emergent Linux movement beyond the current core of adherents, most
of whom are computer professionals responsible for corporate and
institutional networks.
</P>
<P>
   Unleashing the computer industry from Microsoft could bring a
new era of innovation in software and hardware alike, the Wine
backers say.
</P>
<P>
   At least those are the selling points being made in an effort to
attract corporate sponsors anxious for an alternative to
Microsoft's desktop dominance. To keep Wine going, Hal Bennett, an
independent Silicon Valley marketing executive, in December started
a grass-roots fund-raising effort he calls Bacchus.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has no publicly disclosed commitments so far,
Bennett is trying to persuade a number of corporations to make
significant financial commitments to the Wine project to speed its
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett says his fund-raising argument is compelling, in light
of current corporate computing costs. ``Large corporations are
paying a huge amount of money to Microsoft,'' he said, ``and that
would go to zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Wine backers in Silicon Valley hope Wine will
improve enough that computer makers will want to offer it and the
Linux operating system on new machines as an alternative to
Windows. Such commercial support from the hardware industry would
seem to be a necessary prerequisite if business computer users are
to rely on free software.
</P>
<P>
   ``At what point will Wine become stable enough for a computer
manufacturer to have the ability to say to a customer, `I'll ship
you this machine with either Windows or Linux?''' asked John Shoch,
a venture capitalist at the Asset Management Corporation in Palo
Alto, Calif. ``That would have the effect of clamping on
Microsoft's air supply and putting margin pressure on them for the
first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft does not appear ready to strap on the oxygen masks
just yet. Emulation software like Wine has ``many potential
Achilles' heels,'' said Ed Muth, a group product manager for
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers clearly make a big tradeoff when they use
emulation,'' Muth said. ``It is not as robust and reliable as
native implementations.'' He also predicted that the Wine group
would have trouble finishing its work.
</P>
<P>
   ``With emulation the last 10 percent of the compatibility takes
95 percent of the work,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Muth maintains, the Wine effort is a backhanded
compliment to Microsoft's Windows. ``The hype around Wine
demonstrates the applications that are of the most interest are
Windows applications,'' he said, ``and the most stable and reliable
environment to run Windows applications is Windows.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly emulation as a strategy in the software industry has
had only limited success in the past, in part because programs
usually run significantly more slowly when they are emulated. Even
when successful emulation can be achieved, keeping the software up
to date can be a daunting task.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, for example, the computer work station maker
Sun Microsystems Inc. developed an emulator known as WABI that was
designed to let the Windows programs available at the time run on
Sun's non-PC hardware. Although WABI was a technical success, it
ended up having little commercial value, in part because it was
impossible to keep up with the continuously evolving Windows
operating system standard.
</P>
<P>
   But Wine's supporters say that the program is not an emulation
program in the traditional sense of the word, because the software
is not converting Windows instructions to make them compatible with
the Intel microprocessors that are the brains of Windows PCs.
Instead, Wine restricts itself to mimicking Windows' applications
program interfaces _ small program modules within Windows that
provide the instructions to other programs for specific tasks like
saving a file on disk or drawing an image on the computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general there are no fundamental technical reasons why
performance should be a problem for Wine,'' said Douglas Ridgway, a
physicist in Canada who maintains the winehq.com Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, the Wine fund-raiser, insists that the technology will
win adherents because of a wide perception that Microsoft's
domination of the software industry is stifling innovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked at Xerox PARC in 1976 as a researcher,'' he said
alluding to Xerox's seminal Palo Alto Research Center. ``And now
it's 23 years later, and we have the same quality of computing.
That says that whatever forces have been in play in the computer
industry haven't been innovative.''

CLINTON SPEECH TO FOCUS ON EDUCATION, THE ELDERLY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., Ill., Texas, Ark., Pa.)  (See also IMPEACH-RDP, IMPEACH-LEGAL, IMPEACH-OVERSEAS,
IMPEACH-CASE) 
(mk) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will propose in his State of the
Union message on Tuesday the most aggressive nationwide effort ever
to bring greater accountability to state and local school systems,
potentially affecting the allocation of billions of dollars in
federal education aid, White House officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to devote the bulk of his speech to the challenges
of educating the largest school-age population in American history
and insuring the welfare of aging citizens, officials said in
interviews over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The president had no plans to address his impeachment trial in
the Senate or the actions which occasioned it, aides said, even
though he will be speaking to the nation on the same day that his
lawyers open his defense against charges of perjury and obstruction
of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers said Clinton is painfully aware of the awkward timing
of the speech, but chose to press ahead to demonstrate to the
American people that he is determined to carry out the business of
the nation even as Congress weighs the ultimate constitutional
sanction against him.
</P>
<P>
   The speech takes on a greater significance than usual because
Clinton will not, as in years past, be simply laying out a policy
wish list for the coming year. He will be making a plea to the
American people, and to history, to judge him on the nation's
progress and his performance in office rather than on his evident
personal failings.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will devote roughly a quarter of the address to foreign
policy and military matters, aides said. He will propose a major
initiative to help local governments prepare for a biological
weapons attack, providing federal money for early detection systems
and to begin stockpiling vaccines to combat biological warfare
agents, a senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   He will also propose an expanded effort to safeguard nuclear
weapons in Russia and other former Soviet states, going well beyond
existing programs to find new jobs for Russian weapons scientists
and to help convert Russian military complexes to civilian uses,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But the bulk of the speech will address domestic issues, chief
among them education, Social Security and other programs for the
elderly. Aides said Clinton would likely spell out broad principles
for strengthening Social Security but would not yet propose a
specific plan to address the looming deficits in the retirement
program.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leaders of the Senate and House, Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill., wrote to Clinton Sunday demanding to see a detailed Social
Security plan ``as soon as possible,'' and telling him that the
House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee
would hold a joint session on March 1 to receive his proposal.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said, however, that Clinton was not yet
ready to advance a Social Security solution that goes far beyond
repeating last year's pledge to reserve the federal budget surplus
until a means is found to shore up the retirement system.
</P>
<P>
   But on education, Clinton is prepared to propose major revisions
to the way the $20 billion in federal education spending is
apportioned, rewarding school districts that adhere to guidelines
on training teachers, enforcing classroom discipline, ending
promotion of unqualified students and reporting school performance
to parents. School districts that do not meet these standards risk
losing some or all of their federal assistance, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's plan marks a sea change in national education
policy, for the first time holding states and school districts
accountable for progress and rewarding them for results,'' said
Bruce Reed, the president's chief domestic policy adviser,
paraphrasing a passage from the State of the Union speech. ``The
national government invests over $20 billion a year in public
schools. President Clinton believes we must change the way we
invest that money, to support what works and stop supporting what
doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   There is relatively little new money in the budget Clinton will
propose for the coming fiscal year to support these programs. He
will ask Congress for $400 million in new aid to school districts
that end social promotion, the practice of promoting students from
grade to grade regardless of their educational achievement. The
money would be used for after-school and summer programs to assist
these students, as well as to provide a safe environment for
students whose parents are not home during after-school hours.
</P>
<P>
   The new budget proposal also contains $200 million in aid for
school systems that identify failing schools and take aggressive
steps to reform them, from firing poor teachers and administrators
to closing underperforming schools.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also plans to renew his call for $4 billion in federal
spending over five years to build schools and classrooms to relieve
overcrowding and reduce class size in early grades, aides said. He
will also ask for more than $1 billion to help pay for the hiring
of 100,000 new teachers, a program approved last October in the
final negotiations over the current budget.
</P>
<P>
   But the chief incentive in the president's education proposal is
the withholding of existing money from schools that fail to meet
federal standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, we're insisting that states and school
districts take steps, such as providing qualified teachers, ending
social promotion and turning around failing schools,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think schools will do these things,'' he added. ``But if
they don't, their money will be at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Clinton's proposals have a familiar ring, having been
offered as federal legislation or enacted at the local level over
the last several years. Chicago, for example, has extensive
after-school programs for lagging students, and Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas, a Republican, has pushed many of the same measures
through the Legislature in his state. Clinton and Hillary Rodham
Clinton advocated several of the ideas in the mid-1980s as part of
an effort to improve education in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   The most controversial piece of Clinton's plan is a requirement
that all new teachers be tested for competence and certified to
teach the subjects to which they are assigned. In many rural and
inner-city districts, less than half of the math and science
teachers have certificates to teach those subjects, the Education
Department says.
</P>
<P>
   Teacher unions have balked at subjecting teachers to
standardized testing, arguing that such examinations do not
adequately measure a teacher's competence.
</P>
<P>
   In a concession to the unions, the president's proposal does not
require testing for existing teachers, only for new teachers
entering the profession.
</P>
<P>
   David Hornbeck, superintendent of schools in Philadelphia,
applauded Clinton's proposals. Hornbeck said his 215,000-student
district has adopted many of the same policies in the last few
years, but welcomed the federal emphasis on programs that appear to
be bringing results.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appreciate the funds that come along with it,'' Hornbeck
said in an interview Sunday, ``but I think one of the biggest
contributions is to give publicity to these things, to use the
bully pulpit and say this is important.''
</P>
<P>
   The foreign policy passages of the speech will highlight
administration progress toward bringing peace to troubled parts of
the world, from Northern Ireland to the Middle East to the Balkans,
a senior administration aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will urge the Senate to quickly ratify the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty, an agreement signed by 151 nations but not yet
ratified by the United States, the official said. Clinton will make
the case that the United States will lack the moral authority to
press India and Pakistan to restrain from testing nuclear weapons
until the Senate approves the test-ban treaty, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The president will propose spending $4.2 billion over the next
five years for converting Russia's defense industries and
safeguarding its nuclear stockpile, a 70 percent increase over
current spending levels. The official would not divulge the amount
of new money to be devoted to combatting biological weapons,
although the figure will be released as part of Clinton's budget
submission to Congress on Feb. 1, he said.

   MLKPOLL _ ATLANTA _ More than two of every three Americans
believe that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was killed as a result
of a conspiracy, according to a poll commissioned by The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution. Southerners and non-Southerners are in
virtual agreement: About 45 percent of poll respondents say James
Earl Ray conspired with others and about 24 percent say others
besides Ray were responsible for the murder. About 12 percent say
Ray acted alone when King was killed in Memphis on April 4, 1968.

among young parents who cannot control their anger. And if the

   TX-TOBACCO _ AUSTIN, Texas _ The great Texas tobacco case was

their first $200 million paycheck. Squabbling and fighting and
hair-pulling over the attorneys' fees all was supposed to have

Dress up a 340-pound bearded mechanic in silk sheets, put Arafat

from their super-reflective antenna-panels, bedazzling and
bedeviling astronomers by turns. The unexpected side effect of the
satellites _ brilliant solar reflections of light as they pass
overhead _ has caused concern among astronomers, some of whom see

A WARNING TO THE WIRED WORLD
</HEADLINE>
   (dw) 
 By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the early days of the Internet's commercial ascendancy, back
in 1996, Jeffrey P. Bezos, founder and chairman of the Internet's
retail whale, Amazon.com, made a simple observation that should
have signaled problems ahead for technology companies that assumed
that the information age would be business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear a lot of people talking about business models, but I
don't hear much about customer value,'' Bezos said.
</P>
<P>
   If value was going to be the key, a lot of business models were
going to have to change _ most notably the telecommunications
industry's, on which the Internet was being built. But instead of
clanging like a gong in the heads of telecommunications executives,
the cautionary logic of those words apparently continues to fall on
deaf ears.
</P>
<P>
   Few industries have gorged themselves on digital commerce with
greater appetite than the telecommunications companies. But the
result has been a wired world that to many customers seems like a
cross between the best-known works of Edvard Munch and Jean-Paul
Sartre: we scream, but there is no exit.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone services provide a sharp and unfortunate contrast to
online retailers like Bezos, who realized early on that keeping
customers is a lot easier than losing them to substandard service
and continually enticing new ones into the fold.
</P>
<P>
   It is a rare consumer today who has only one horror story to
tell. Some engage in regular battle with cellular telephone
duopolies and their arcane and incomprehensible pricing structures,
which sometimes even charge for calls that their own networks are
incapable of delivering.
</P>
<P>
   Others are continually confronted with pager services with
sporadic delivery that charge by the alpha-numeric character and
employ operators who apparently have no schooling in even the
basics of abbreviation.
</P>
<P>
   Still others are engaged in conflicts _ which now involve the
Federal Communications Commission _ over so-called casual customer
rates for long-distance calls, socking consumers with the
functional equivalent of $28 for a $1 gallon of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the telephone is the most common bridge to
cyberspace, and as Internet and other online service providers
reach a broader and less sophisticated market, the Internet
revolution is in danger of becoming a latter-day Boston Tea Party
as customer complaints mount about responsiveness and overcharging.
</P>
<P>
   Customer satisfaction rates for companies that were once blue
chips in the telephone industry are sinking, said Nick Donatiello,
president of the consumer research firm Odyssey LP.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T's image, for example, has rebounded somewhat, but it had
been declining steadily for the past few years,'' Donatiello said.
The phone giant was rated ``very good'' by 63 percent of U.S.
households in 1994 but dropped sharply, to 37 percent, in 1997 in
Odyssey's surveys before rebounding to 55 percent last year.
``Still, it's not nearly what it was,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Why are these companies, so central to the continued growth of
the digital universe, so apparently intractable about providing
value to customers?
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem,'' Donatiello said, is that ``virtually everyone
in the telecom industry has had the luxury of treating their
customers like garbage for a very long time, first because they had
a monopoly _ and some still do _ while others have geographic
oligopolies.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he says, they are in a position not to care very
much whether customers are satisfied with the quality or value of
the services they sign up for.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most profound differences between online retail and
the business of providing telecommunications, for example, is that
customers find it a simple task to compare the prices of a book
from several vendors.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, telecommunications providers _ cellular and
long-distance, especially _ seem to take pride in making it almost
impossible to do so, with complex rates that vary by day of week,
time of day and sometimes, it seems, the phases of the moon.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to comparison shop is one reason consumers are
moving to support the trend toward flat-rate services, Donatiello
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans don't like to have the meter running on anything
that has to do with entertainment, information or communication,''
he said. ``That's why we saw such a huge uptick in the adoption
curve of online services when America Online went to its flat-rate
model,'' now $21.95 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The single-price model may also account for the popularity of
AT&AMP;T's Digital One plan, which offers customers in certain cities a
flat rate of $90 a month for 600 minutes of cellular calls to or
from anywhere in the United States. The popularity of that plan, in
turn, is setting off a frenzy among other wireless providers to
offer their own flat-rate plans.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer attitudes suggest that may not be enough.
Increasingly, people want to simplify the enormous complexity of
their wired lives by buying all their telecommunications_ local
phone service, long distance, cellular, cable television and
Internet connections _ from a single provider.
</P>
<P>
   Though AT&AMP;T again says it is leading the charge with its
purchase of the cable television giant Tele-Communications Inc.,
Donatiello says consumers apparently do not hold out much hope that
even moves this bold will make their lives easier to understand or
manage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that consumers don't think any kind of
company would do a good job'' providing a full range of services,
he said. ``Their No. 1 choice was a long-distance company, and only
37 percent of U.S. households said they would do a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Local phone companies got a 36 percent confidence rating as
potential one-stop providers, while cable television companies
scored only 21 percent, and Internet service providers a paltry 17
percent.
</P>
<P>
   So in the end, consumer attitudes signal trouble ahead for
acquisitive telecommunications companies like AT&AMP;T, despite the
benefits it promises from its TCI merger and deals with high-speed
Internet services like At Home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worse than the blind leading the deaf,'' Donatiello said.
``The bad has married the ugly, and somehow they expect the
children to be the good. Lip service alone won't get you there _
the first thing they still have to prove is that they're worthy of
their customers' business.''

 NBC PROMISES LESS EMPHASIS ON SEX 
`HOME IMPROVEMENT' A HOUSE DIVIDED 
MAGAZINE DISPLEASES HOFFMAN 
SUIT AGAINST DISCREDITED WRITER IS SETTLED 
GRUMBLING AT THE DAILY NEWS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ NBC, the network that pioneered the sex
comedy at 8 p.m., is promising ``less emphasis on sex.''
</P>
<P>
   That was part of the agenda presented at a television industry
conference here by Scott Sassa, the new president of NBC
Entertainment, who cited a vision for the network's coming programs
that included more traditional family shows and fewer shows about
the dating habits of single New Yorkers working in the media.
</P>
<P>
   But do Sassa's comments signal a revolutionary new direction for
the network, which achieved a defining moment of sorts in an
episode of ``Friends'' that depicted two of the characters in a
sexual clinch in a museum where they were interrupted by a troop of
children?
</P>
<P>
   Several NBC executives said Sassa's position reflects a need to
adjust NBC's program philosophy, not revolutionize it.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the network is developing several new comedies that are
similar in tone to many of the urban youth-oriented shows the
network already has on the air, said one longtime senior NBC
executive. ``We'll just have some different kinds of shows in the
mix,'' the executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Sassa himself said it was the sameness of so many of the shows,
more than any personal objection to the content, that inspired his
comments. ``Let's be clear: I said less sex,'' Sassa said. ``For
the most part when sex is used in a smart way it works out OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Have advertisers had an impact? There have been talks among some
top television advertisers like Johnson &AMP; Johnson and Procter &AMP;
Gamble about committing some special money to family programs, but
an NBC executive said this was always intended to be in addition to
the money already being spent by those advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if money is going to be committed, networks will pay
attention, and Sassa did say that NBC needs to add some traditional
family shows with a mother, father and children. It has only one,
``Mad About You,'' which is in its last season. And that show has
been as much about sex as any on the network; this season, for
example, in one episode, a character took a Viagra pill and spent
the rest of the episode uncontrollably aroused.

   No More `Improvement,' 2 Stars Insist
</P>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Last winter Jerry Seinfeld told the world he
was leaving his NBC hit comedy, ``Seinfeld.'' That kicked off the
retrospectives.
</P>
<P>
   This winter Tim Allen is telling the world he is leaving his ABC
hit comedy, ``Home Improvement.'' That has kicked off the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Allen could hardly have been more definitive about his
intentions in a news conference here. ``It's our show and this is
when we want to call it quits,'' Allen said. Allen's co-star,
Patricia Richardson, was only slightly less definite when asked if
anything might induce her to return. ``Nothing I can imagine at
this point,'' she said. ``There'd have to be a lot more creative
thinking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In one attempt at creativity, the figure of $2 million an
episode for Allen and $1 million an episode for Ms. Richardson has
been been floated. That would add up to $44 million and $22 million
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The stars' comments about wrapping up the show this season came
just one day after ABC executives said there were still
``discussions'' going on about whether the show would return next
season.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference here, ABC executives danced carefully away
from any clear indication of just how badly the network wants the
show back. But in private they acknowledged that the show is a
crucial part of plans for next season because ABC is stockpiling
promising comedies but lacks a show that could replace ``Home
Improvement'' at 8 p.m. on Tuesdays. The chairman of ABC
Entertainment, Stu Bloomberg, described the issue as ``very
delicate.'' It certainly is complicated, despite the fact _ or
perhaps because of the fact _ that the show is owned by Walt Disney
Co., which also owns ABC.
</P>
<P>
   The production company that makes ``Home Improvement,'' Wind
Dancer, has sued Disney, contending that Disney unfairly renewed
the contract for the show with ABC two years ago without seeking a
competing bid from another network.
</P>
<P>
   Any open suggestion by ABC that it needs the show desperately
and is willing to pay an enormous price for it could have an effect
on the suit, which turns on whether the show's profit participants
received fair market value two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all of that, negotiations to continue the series are
going on, one executive involved in the discussions said.

   Actor Sues Magazine on Drag Fashion Spread
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The actor Dustin Hoffman was in federal court last
week pressing a lawsuit against Los Angeles magazine. The problem:
the magazine's use of his face in a fashion spread.
</P>
<P>
   In the March 1997 issue, the magazine, a subsidiary of Capital
Cities ABC, used an image of Hoffman's face from his role in
``Tootsie,'' the 1982 movie in which his character disguised
himself as a woman to get an acting job. The image was superimposed
on a model wearing a smashing gown and smart high heels.
</P>
<P>
   A caption for the shot, which was included in a roundup of what
the stars might have worn if their big films had been made in 1997,
said: ``Dustin Hoffman isn't a drag in a butter-colored silk gown
by Richard Tyler and Ralph Lauren heels.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit centers on an area of law called right of publicity,
which is supposed to give celebrities the right to control the
manner and circumstances under which their name and image are used
for commercial purposes. That right was infringed here in a very
serious and intentional manner, said Hoffman's lawyer, Charles
Shephard. Lawyers for the magazine, who declined comment, have
asserted a First Amendment right to use Hoffman's image in the
shoot.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the magazine would not comment on the case. Neither
would Hoffman. But during his testimony last week, he expressed
some apparent displeasure at having his image used as a fashion
model. Hoffman testified, ``If I were to do a commercial, I hardly
think it would be selling clothes, male or female.''

   Group Settles Suit Against Writer
</P>
<P>
   A drug prevention group has settled and dismissed its $10
million libel lawsuit against the writer Stephen Glass over
fabricated articles he wrote about the organization for the New
Republic and Rolling Stone magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, which will include the payment of an undisclosed
sum and a written letter of apology, came after Glass sat down with
lawyers for DARE, an acronym for Drug Abuse Resistance Education,
and told them what he knew of the fact-checking and editing
processes the two magazines applied to his pieces.
</P>
<P>
   A DARE lawyer, Louis Skip Miller, said the discussions with
Glass might lead to subsequent legal action against Rolling Stone
but not The New Republic, based on distinctions between the two
magazines' actions following the disclosures of fakery. The New
Republic refuted the story, but Rolling Stone essentially stood by
it, Miller said. He declined to disclose specifics of the exchange,
but said, ``Glass, we think, has been forthright and truthful with
us, and now we are evaluating further legal action.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Love, the Rolling Stone managing editor who has been
handling the fallout from the Glass piece, could not be reached for
comment.

   NEW YORK _ Perhaps it is because newsrooms are famously
resistant to change, but the transformation last week of page 2 at
The Daily News _ the tabloid newspaper equivalent of riverfront
property _ into a potpourri column about what's happening around
town has left the newsroom in not the best of moods.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few days before the change, page 2 displayed news of the
opening of the impeachment trial and of fourth-graders'
preparations for the standardized reading test. But last week, the
second page of the proudly gritty newspaper listed restaurants
where one could splurge on caviar and an esoteric exhibit of X-rays
as art at the Julie Saul Gallery in SoHo. It also listed a New York
Rangers game, the meeting of a reading group in Levittown, N.Y.,
and told readers where they could join in a last group cheer for
the New York Jets before they flew off to play the Denver Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Written by Sharon King, the onetime ``Insatiable Shopper'' for
Forbes magazine who first made her name as a Boston-based consumer
affairs reporter and television personality, the listings column is
the brainchild of Harold Evans, the editorial director of The News,
according to several editors reached last week, none of whom would
speak on the record. Evans, who did not respond to telephone calls
seeking comment, had pioneered a daily listings column at The
Sunday Times in London about two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. King moved to New York several years ago when she married
James Hoge Jr., former publisher of The Daily News. The two have
since divorced. Ms. King, who was out of town Friday, could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Adrienne Rhodes, a spokeswoman for the newspaper and the only
Daily News employee who would speak on the record about the new
section, said: ``It's a collaborative effort that was developed to
provide a service to readers. It has been tested in focus groups
and there has been pretty favorable response with people phoning in
and saying that they like it.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``This section is part of a bigger process of
products that will be introduced over the next several months. It
was favorably received in the focus groups and has been favorably
received by several people.''
</P>
<P>
   But the newsroom continued to mourn the loss of its riverfront
real estate. ``It's poorly organized, it's undigestible, and it
takes a huge bite out of the news hole,'' said one editor, who
insisted on anonymity but who echoed the sentiment of others.

<P>
   The telephone call that Vodafone's chief executive, Chris Gent,
got on New Year's Day was the kind no executive wants on vacation.
His chief financial officer had tracked him down in his Sydney
hotel room to tell him that Bell Atlantic, the largest local
telephone concern in the United States, was close to buying
Airtouch Communications Inc. in a $45 billion stock swap.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's troubling,'' Gent said he told his colleague over the
phone. Vodafone Group PLC is Britain's largest wireless
communications company, and Gent had wanted to buy Airtouch
himself. Late last year, in fact, Gent had been in discussions with
Sam Ginn, the chairman of Airtouch, which is the largest wireless
carrier in the United States and has prime European operations.
Seeing his chance slipping away, Gent heeded the urgings of his
closest advisers and wrote a one-page letter reiterating his
interest in Airtouch. He faxed it to Ginn the next day.
</P>
<P>
   So began two weeks of all-night strategy sessions and telephone
calls between sleep-deprived executives in four time zones as
Vodafone tried to woo Airtouch from the embrace of Bell Atlantic.
In the end, Vodafone prevailed, and on Friday it announced a $60
billion Vodafone-Airtouch pact that would create the world's
largest wireless communications company and a powerhouse that could
become a serious rival to telecommunications titans like AT&AMP;T and
British Telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Bell Atlantic was clearly going to make an offer
was the catalyst,'' Gent said on Saturday, recounting the events in
a telephone interview from London.
</P>
<P>
   For outsiders, the outcome recalled another recent international
telecommunications bidding coup: Worldcom's daring snatching of the
Wall Street darling MCI from the arms of staid British
Telecommunications in 1997. And for Airtouch, as for MCI in that
earlier deal, in the end the choice came down to the sought-after
company's vision of its own future.
</P>
<P>
   For the Airtouch board, that picture did not fully form until
directors met Friday in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going into the board meeting, the decision was not made,''
Ginn said in an interview Saturday. ``The board evaluated it on
price, and they tried to understand the strategic rationale of both
offers.''
</P>
<P>
   The call was so close that one Bell Atlantic spokesman said his
company even had a victory news release drafted in case Airtouch
went with the Bell Atlantic bid.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's outcome was one that hardly seemed likely after Gent
and Ginn held tentative merger discussions last fall. Those talks
quickly faltered because the chief executives could not agree on
various fundamental issues, people close to the negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   But the talks had the effect of prompting Bell Atlantic to step
up its own tentative discussions with Airtouch in the last month,
and soon they were heading toward what looked to be a conclusive
deal. ``We moved quickly to present Sam an option,'' Ivan
Seidenberg, chairman and chief executive of Bell Atlantic, said in
an interview Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   After that New Year's Day call, Gent said, he knew it would take
some convincing to prove to Ginn that his interest was real. So
bankers from Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., which advised Vodafone, spent
the first weekend of the new year talking to representatives from
Airtouch's counsel, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. The two sides
devoted two days to sorting out, among other things, how much
Vodafone might be willing to pay.
</P>
<P>
   One person close to the talks said Vodafone knew that it had to
be aggressive on price and that it had to lobby Airtouch's other
top executives, too, and not just Ginn. By the end of the weekend,
Vodafone came up with a two-page preliminary proposal offering to
begin discussions to buy Airtouch for about $55 billion in cash and
stock. The offer was faxed on Jan. 3 to Ginn, who had cut short his
vacation in Hawaii to return to San Francisco and monitor the
events.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Airtouch's discussions with Bell Atlantic had hit a
snag. There were still several unresolved issues, Seidenberg said,
and the two companies were reluctant to formalize a pact until the
problems were resolved. One hitch was that the companies would need
regulatory approval to use an accounting method that would enable
them to avoid hefty charges. Until there was at least a preliminary
ruling from the Securities and Exchange Commission, there was
little Bell Atlantic could do but wait and see how serious
Vodafone's offer was.
</P>
<P>
   That holdup gave Vodafone much needed time. On Tuesday, Jan. 5,
Vodafone publicly disclosed its interest in Airtouch. That day,
Gent dispatched a team including Vodafone's finance director,
Kenneth Hydon, from London to New York to begin exploratory talks
with Airtouch executives. Critics of Vodafone had warned that the
company's share price, which had been rising for months, was
unsustainably lofty and that Ginn would prefer a more stable
currency, like Bell Atlantic stock. ``We were trying to show them
that the synergies underpinned the stock's value,'' Gent said.
</P>
<P>
   The mood was relaxed at a private dining room at the Four
Seasons in midtown Manhattan that Wednesday night as Hydon met at
dinner with Airtouch's chief financial officer, Mohan Gyani, and
their negotiating teams. The conversation was cordial but hardly
substantive _ Vodafone's team was tired from the long flight _ and
after a few hours of amiable chatter, the two parties agreed to
spend the next day trying to figure out just how compatible the
companies might really be, people close to the discussions said.
</P>
<P>
   Ginn declined to comment on the timing or substance of any talks
he or his advisers had, citing various lawsuits by shareholders
filed after word of the negotiations became public. But people
close to the companies say that by this point, Airtouch negotiators
were keeping their cell phones on day and night or wearing pagers
so they could be kept aware of progress in both sets of talks.
</P>
<P>
   To complicate things further, other companies, including MCI
Worldcom, were calling to express interest in Airtouch, too. ``They
were in battle mode,'' one person, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said of the Airtouch teams.

SENATORS BATTLE OVER ISSUE OF WITNESSES IN IMPEACHMENT TRIAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans and Democrats drew new battle lines
Sunday over whether witnesses should be called in the impeachment
trial of President Clinton, with some senators threatening to
subpoena independent counsel Kenneth Starr and informant Linda
Tripp to question their motives in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Warning that efforts to turn the Senate floor into a full-blown
courtroom would lead to ``a spectacle'' that could ``go on and
on,'' Democrats said they are prepared to question Starr about why
and how his investigation grew from the Whitwater land development
deal to an inquiry on the president's private sexual behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to have witnesses,'' said Sen. John Kerry,
D-Mass, on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press,'' ``I'd be very interested in
... having a whole host of people _ Linda Tripp, Kenneth Starr _
all of whom might shed enormous light as to how it is we got
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., speaking on CBS-TV's ``Face the
Nation,'' said he would focus his questions on ``prosecutorial
abuse'' if Starr is called.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, although admitting that the House prosecution
team had put on a fairly impressive case against the president,
said there was more than enough evidence and witness testimony in
the record now for senators to decide whether Clinton should be
removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is accused of perjury and obstruction of justice
stemming from conduct in Starr's investigation of his extramarital
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there needs to be witnesses. This is the most
thoroughly investigated, widely reported scandals in history,''
said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the 13-member House prosecution team continued to press
its case for why they ought to be allowed to question witnesses in
the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you could obtain a conviction or I could clearly
ask for a conviction until we have testimony,'' said Rep. Asa
Hutchinson, R-Ark., on ABC-TV's ``This Week'' program.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on NBC, both Senate Judicary Committee Chairman Orrin
Hatch of Utah and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, indicated
that they were open to having witnesses if Clinton's White House
lawyers offer conflicting information or fail to rebuff the charges
made by the House prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do need to wait until all the presentations have been
made,'' Hutchison said. But she reminded her colleagues that in the
end witnesses might be necessary to ensure that the Senate gives
``both sides a fair chance'' to make their case before the trial
ends.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's team of seven lawyers will begin its defense arguments
Tuesday afternoon and will continue Wednesday and Thursday. The
team, headed by White House counsel Charles Ruff, met Sunday to go
over its case.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, meanwhile, spent the day preparing for his State of the
Union address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will make the case that the allegations are not supported
by the facts or by the law, and they do not warrant nullifying the
results of a national election and removing the president from
office,'' White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Clinton defense team wraps up its case, the senators
will be give a day or two to ask questions of both the prosecution
and defense teams. The questions will be submitted in writing
through Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who is presiding over the
Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   When the question and answer phase has been completed, the
Senate will then begin making decisions on whether to allow
witnesses. Several House prosecutors said Sunday that they would
like to at least hear from Lewinsky, Clinton's private secretary
Betty Currie and his friend Vernon Jordan. Republicans contend that
Currie and Jordan conspired with the president to help him hide his
affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   It will take a majority vote by the senators to approve each
witness that testifies. But before senators get around to voting on
each witness, Democrats plan to offer a motion to dismiss the case.
If it passes, the trial will end and there will not be a Senate
vote on whether to convict Clinton and remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   If the motion fails, however, the trial would probably continue
to a final vote for conviction or acquittal. If a final vote does
occur, it will take at least two-thirds, or 67 senators, voting in
favor of conviction for Clinton to become the first president ever
ousted from office for impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who is expected to offer the
first motion for dismissal, said Sunday that if it fails and the
Republicans succeed in summoning witnesses, the trial would likely
continue well into the spring or early summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go that route,'' he said on ``Meet the Press,'' ``we
may be talking May or June before we finish this trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., said the prosecutors' demands that
they be allowed to call witnesses demonstrated how weak their case
against Clinton is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the House has not made its case. I think that the
(perjury and obstruction) charges lack proportionality,'' Wellstone
said on ``Meet the Press.'' ``I think people in the country know
that the president's not been entirely honest ... But I think
people are also saying ... are these grounds for removing a
president from office, for overturning an election? I think the
answer is a resounding, `No.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, however, did say they would be willing to support
a motion to censure the president for his actions.
</P>
<P>
   That idea was floated again by former Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, D-Maine, who has been advising Clinton during the
impeachment process. He agreed that Clinton's conduct had been
``seriously wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He deserves to be held accountable, but not removed from
office,'' Mitchell said, calling censure the ``appropriate
punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The House case is based on the principle that the underlying
circumstances don't matter ... But that's not true in life and it's
not true in the law, and it's not true in the law of perjury
itself,'' Mitchell added.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion, though, that Clinton get off with a public
reprimand from the Senate, was more than some Republicans could
bear.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, for example, said on ``This Week'' that
censure, at least politically, would be an easy way out of the
impeachment dilemma for GOP lawmakers. He said he favors pushing
through to the end of the trial and having a vote on conviction,
even if it fails.
</P>
<P>
   ``Censure is to cover politicians,'' he said, adding: ``I don't
need any cover.''

 UNDATED: Airtouch teams . 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reporters, too, were hungry for any scrap of news, sometimes
with unexpected consequences. A week and a half ago, some news
outlets were reporting that MCI Worldcom was planning to bid more
than $55 billion for Airtouch in an all-stock offer that could be
announced within a few days. People close to MCI said that although
the company had talked to Airtouch, an offer was not planned.
Nevertheless, after those reports, Worldcom saw its stock drop 11.5
percent in two days before it released a statement saying it would
not pursue a bid for Airtouch.
</P>
<P>
   By the middle of last week, Bell Atlantic had received an
affirmative response from the SEC on the accounting matter. With
that, executives began weighing whether to raise the $45 billion
offer, people close to those discussions said.
</P>
<P>
   Seidenberg, who talked to Ginn almost every day, would not
comment on what the higher price would have been, except to say
there was a range as well as other considerations. People close to
the talks said Bell Atlantic might have been willing to increase
the amount of stock Airtouch shareholders would get _ to 1.6 shares
of Bell Atlantic stock for every Airtouch share owned, up from the
original 1.4 ratio that was initially reported, thus raising the
overall value of the bid.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, Gent held his first telephone conversation with
Ginn since sending the fax 10 days earlier. ``I had to elicit from
Sam how he felt about all this,'' Gent said.
</P>
<P>
   The two discussed a variety of concerns, including whether the
new company would give each party an equal number of seats on its
board and how they planned to retain key executives and employees.
They also discussed what breakup fees would be paid to Vodafone if
another bidder intervened after a deal was announced; they settled
on $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the two talked by phone again. Gent, eager to wrap
things up, was prepared to increase his offer. ``But Sam said,
`Let's sleep on this and talk in the morning,''' Gent recalled.
</P>
<P>
   So at 7:30 a.m., California time, on Friday, Gent phoned Ginn
with the revised offer: Airtouch shareholders would still get half
a Vodafone American depository receipt for each Airtouch share, but
Vodafone would increase the cash portion of the offer from about
about $6 to $9 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Ginn murmured acknowledgment, Gent said, but did not say which
proposal Airtouch was likely to accept at the board's meeting later
that day.
</P>
<P>
   At 2 o'clock that afternoon, California time, it was Ginn's turn
to call Gent and tell him: ``We have a deal.'' The board had
accepted the offer, in which Airtouch stockholders would get $97 in
cash and stock for each of their shares, based on Friday's stock
prices. Gent would remain as chief executive in the combined
company, to be named Vodafone Airtouch P.L.C., and Ginn would
become nonexecutive chairman of the board.
</P>
<P>
   In London, where it was 10 p.m., Gent was relieved but not
wholly surprised. ``I sensed that this is the way it would go,'' he
said later.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic, receiving a consolation call a short time later,
released a statement that its discussions with Airtouch had ended.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview on Saturday, Ginn declined to discuss the
board's deliberations in detail. ``We had fiduciary issues to deal
with,'' he said, ``and I think we did a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic's chief, for his part, reflected on the last two
weeks' events. ``The way we see this is this was more of a missed
opportunity,'' Seidenberg said. ``In the short term, the board
thought Vodafone was the better choice. In the longer term, it is
our job to prove that we would have been the best proposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginn, meanwhile, suggested that the relationship with Bell
Atlantic was far from over. He said that Airtouch still had gaps in
its geographic coverage of the United States and that Seidenberg's
company might still play a role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe there is a way to sit down with Bell Atlantic and solve
on a partnership basis what we couldn't solve on a merger basis,''
Ginn said wearily. ``I will be working on that next week.''

SPORTS COLUMN: TYSON'S RUST MAKES BOTHA CARELESS
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After often resembling an awkward amateur for nearly five
rounds, Mike Tyson upheld one of boxing's oldest truths on Saturday
night in Las Vegas, Nev.: One knockout punch is worth a thousand
punches that miss.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not a thousand, but Tyson missed with at least two
or three dozen wild left hooks and right hands _ many more than
even this now 32-year-old heavyweight was expected to miss in the
rusty resumption of his compelling career.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Francois Botha, the self-proclaimed ``White Buffalo''
from South Africa who now lives in Newport Beach, Calif., dropped
his red gloves and stood in the middle of the ring, as if daring
Tyson to hit him. And then Tyson did. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw the punch,'' Botha would say later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know I threw it,'' Tyson said.
</P>
<P>
   It's like that sometimes in boxing, as Tyson's latest trainer,
Tommy Brooks, explained in analyzing the short right hand that,
instead of missing, landed flush on Botha's jaw, mouth and nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you try for a knockout punch, you never get it,'' Brooks
said. ``If you start boxing, throwing your jab, that's when it
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Botha bounced on his rump, somehow wobbled to his feet but then
flopped backward into the ropes that saved him from falling into
the ringside seats. By then the referee, Richard Steele, had waved
his arms, signaling that Tyson had won at 2 minutes 59 seconds of
the fifth round.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing that Botha was helpless, Tyson hurried across the ring
and wrapped his arms around him to prevent him from sliding through
the ropes anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a brother,'' Tyson said later of his sudden
sportsmanship. ``It's not that serious. It's just a boxing match.
There are some people I would like to let go through those ropes,
but they aren't fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the first round, however, Tyson had not resembled
a good samaritan. In a clinch at the bell and after a few punches
after the bell, he and Botha locked arms. Steele tried to break
them. So did their cornermen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike grabbed my arm, he was trying to break my arm, to twist
my arm,'' Botha would say calmly.
</P>
<P>
   Told later that Botha accused him of trying to break Botha's
arm, Tyson said, ``He's correct.''
</P>
<P>
   For a few tense moments, it appeared that perhaps Tyson's temper
had snapped, as it had on June 28, 1997 in the same MGM Grand
Garden ring when he bit both of Evander Holyfield's ears. His
disqualification prompted the Nevada commission to revoke his
license. He finally was re-licensed here three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very concerned,'' Marc Ratner, the commission's
executive director, said of the scrum after the bell. ``I told
Steele, `This is your fight. Take control. Take points away.' He
went to each corner and told them, `We don't want a DQ here.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the next round, Steele ordered the judges to deduct a point
from Tyson for holding, but Tyson was so rusty and Botha so
unafraid that the three judges would have Botha in command through
four rounds _ 40-35 on the cards of both Dave Moretti and Dalby
Shirley, 39-36 on that of Billy Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started fooling around too much,'' Botha acknowledged. ``I
really thought this was going to be easy. I got careless. I got a
little too cocky and I paid for it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tyson said: ``It was only a matter of time. I was telling my
trainer, `I'm working on him, I'm slowing him down.'''
</P>
<P>
   Still, if Botha hadn't slowed himself down and left himself open
for that big punch that he never saw, Tyson might not have been
able to outpoint him over the 10 rounds of this nontitle bout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't prove anything, I'm just trying to do well,'' Tyson
acknowledged. ``I feel great to do what I love to do, but I've got
to improve. I've got a long way to go.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's new manager, Shelly Finkel, mentioned late April as the
time frame for Tyson's next bout against contenders Vaughn Bean,
Axel Schulz or Lou Savarese.
</P>
<P>
   No matter who it is, Tyson's next opponent isn't likely to fear
the Tyson mystique that once turned good boxers, such as Michael
Spinks and Frank Bruno, into ice sculptures, frozen with fear.
Holyfield twice showed that if you're not afraid of Tyson, if you
hit him back, you can beat the bully out of him.
</P>
<P>
   And on Saturday night Francois Botha wasn't afraid of Tyson
either. He just got too cocky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was telling Mike, `I'm going to hit you with a phantom
punch,''' Botha said. ``But he hit me with a phantom punch first. I
knew he had the punch. I just got careless.''
</P>
<P>
   And Mike Tyson got a little lucky, salvaging a one-punch
knockout when he might have lost a demeaning decision. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   As general manager of Powell's Books, Miriam Sontz helps oversee
a successful retailer with seven stores in and around Portland,
Ore., and a growing international online book-selling business.
</P>
<P>
   But for several months, Ms. Sontz has had a worrisome
distraction: whether Powell's site (www.powellsbooks.com), by
including ``The Mammoth Book of Erotica'' and other sexually candid
books for sale on the World Wide Web, could run afoul of a new
Federal law intended to protect children from online smut.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Ms. Sontz is applauding her employer, which along
with the American Civil Liberties Union and 15 other groups and
businesses has filed a lawsuit to overturn the Child Online
Protection Act. President Clinton signed the act into law as part
of the huge budget bill in October, but the child-protection
measure was almost immediately challenged on constitutional grounds
and has never gone into effect. Hearings on the matter are
scheduled to begin Wednesday in Federal District Court in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a nutshell,'' Ms. Sontz said, ``this law aggressively
attacks one of the more financially profitable aspects of my
business _ and aggressively attacks my First Amendment rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Lowell Reed Jr., who issued a temporary restraining order
against the act last fall, will preside over an expected three days
of hearings this week to decide whether the court should issue a
preliminary injunction that would continue delaying the law's
taking effect, pending further courtroom proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The law, with penalties of up to six months in prison and
$50,000 in fines, makes it a crime for the operator of a commercial
Web site to knowingly make available to those under 17 certain
sexually explicit material considered harmful to minors. It is a
successor to an earlier attempt to limit children's access to
online pornography, the Communications Decency Act. The United
States Supreme Court struck down that law in 1997, saying that it
was so vague and broad that it violated the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the new law say it has one aim: to shield children
from smut.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bill is narrowly written,'' said Peggy Peterson, an aide
to Rep. Michael Oxley, the Ohio Republican who sponsored the
legislation in the House. ``It applies only to commercial sites and
material that is harmful to minors _ explicit raw pornography.''
</P>
<P>
   The law's supporters are particularly incensed by teaser
photographs _ free and readily accessible sexually explicit images
that are used to advertise offerings that adult customers,
generally using a credit card, can pay to obtain from sexually
oriented sites.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Department of Justice, which is defending the
law, would not comment on the case. But in court filings, they have
argued that the statute is so much narrower than the Communications
Decency Act that it passes constitutional muster. For one thing,
they say, the old law applied to all online material , including
e-mail. The new law is aimed only at commercial Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the government's lawyers argue that the ``harmful
to minors'' standard of the new law _ which requires, among other
things, that the speech be prurient and lack scientific, literary,
artistic or political merit for young people _ is more precise than
the ``indecent'' standard of the earlier law.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers also note that the law would not outlaw
sexually explicit material altogether but require that it be put
behind a kind of electronic gate, like an online credit card
verification system, on the presumption that only adults would have
access to it. They say the law is analogous to retail laws in many
states that require that pornographic magazines be bound in
brown-paper wrappers or displayed out of the sight and the reach of
minors.
</P>
<P>
   But Christopher Hansen, a lawyer for the American Civil
Liberties Union and one of the lead lawyers for the group
challenging the law, contends that a virtual brown-paper wrapper
would undercut not just free speech on line but Internet commerce
of various sorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law will seriously stifle the creativity and new business
models that are starting to thrive on the Net,'' Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
   He argued that credit card verification systems were expensive
and often technically unworkable. And perhaps most important to a
Web business, he said, such systems are an annoyance to customers,
who might be inclined to turn elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen's clients include a range of Web businesses concerned
that they may find themselves posting material that they consider
legitimate but that the law's advocates might nevertheless deem out
of bounds. Among them are Condomania, the online version of the
condom retailer; Artnet.com, which for a fee from artists and
galleries, displays artwork, including nudes, and the Internet
Content Coalition, a group of 23 publishers with online ventures,
including Time Inc., MSNBC and The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen said that even though the law granted an exception for
work of political, scientific or other merit, Web publishers might
still have a hard time deciding what is legally suitable for
children. He cited the example of the Starr Report, with its
graphic descriptions of sex in the White House. Publication of that
report, he said, might have posed problems for online news outlets
had the new child-protection law been in effect.
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Flores, senior counsel to the National Law Center for
Children and Families, which has submitted a friend-of-the-court
brief in support of the law, contends that the Child Online
Protection Act is written carefully enough that it would zero in
only on Web enterprises clearly engaged in the smut trade. And he
said he was convinced that the law would not apply to any of the
plaintiffs in the case. ``None of them are out to produce material
designed to appeal to the prurient interest of children _ or adults
for that matter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But such arguments do little to ease the mind of Ms. Sontz. She
wonders what enforcers of the law would make of such Powell's books
as ``Bisexual Option,'' ``Outspoken Role Models in the Gay and
Lesbian Community'' and one whose title contains a common
four-letter vulgarity. ``The key here is that I don't know what's
offensive or harmful to minors,'' she said. ``That leaves me in
purgatory.''

AGREEMENT REACHED ON HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL FOR BERLIN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ After a bitter debate over how to commemorate the
Holocaust in the new German capital, Berlin, agreement has been
reached on a memorial that will include a vast field of stone
pillars, a 65-foot-high wall of books and a research center for
scholars.
</P>
<P>
   The accord already has been approved by Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder but is still subject to parliamentary review. It blends
longstanding proposals by the New York architect Peter Eisenman
with additions intended to satisfy the new government of Social
Democrats and Greens, whose initial declarations last year opposed
a vast memorial and caused an uproar.
</P>
<P>
   Over more than a decade, the proposed monument next to the
Brandenburg Gate, in central Berlin, has become a focus for
competing visions of how best to invite reflection on Hitler's
annihilation of European Jews. The fierce exchanges have, above
all, reflected Germany's search for a way to balance memory with a
growing desire to look forward.
</P>
<P>
   With the government and Parliament set to move to Berlin later
this year, the vacant 4.9 acre site and the lack of a plan to fill
it had become an embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told everyone involved a few weeks ago that they could
generate a lot more heat if they liked, but they could certainly
generate no more light,'' said Michael Blumenthal, a former U.S.
treasury secretary who is the head of the new Jewish Museum in
Berlin, a distinct project. ``It was time to decide this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a breakthrough mediated by Blumenthal and hammered out
between Eisenman and Germany's top cultural official, Michael
Naumann, the essence of the huge field of stone pillars _ to which
the government had objected _ is to be preserved.
</P>
<P>
   The number of pillars is to be reduced from about 2,800 to
somewhere between 1,800 and 2,100, and a building to be called
``The House of Remembrance'' _ consisting of an atrium and three
sandstone blocks _ is to be added.
</P>
<P>
   This building _ an archive, information center and exhibition
space _ is to be flanked by a thick, 100-yard-long wall that will
house a million books between an exterior made of patterned black
steel and a glass interior side.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Wall of Books.'' containing works that scholars will be
able to consult, is intended to symbolize the concern of the
Schroeder government that the memorial not be merely
backward-looking and symbolic but also educational and useful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am absolutely positive that this new project will now be
built,'' said Naumann. ``All statements pro and con have been taken
care of. This is a superb synthesis. It is not a compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   From the building, four glass-roofed tunnels are to lead out
into the field of pillars.
</P>
<P>
   ``My memorial has won _ it is intact, with the adjunct of a
Holocaust archive,'' Eisenman, who is in Berlin for the
presentation of the new plan, said Saturday. ``Beside it, you have
what a amounts to a nonbuilding, a proscenium for the monument.''
The project is due to be unveiled formally on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Naumann appeared elated that an agreement had been reached. His
initial remarks last year about the monument _ including a
comparison of its monumentalism to the work of Hitler's architect,
Albert Speer _ provoked bitter opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Naumann had a first meeting with Eisenman that did
not appear to go well.
</P>
<P>
   Naumann came out with what seemed to be various half-baked ideas
for a genocide-watch center, a museum and a research center.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, after further talks between Naumann, Eisenman and
Blumenthal in New York on Dec. 30, the project seems to have been
well-prepared and to have broad backing.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said agreement also had been reached that the
memorial would be administered by the Jewish museum, insuring that
there is no duplication _ an important breakthrough because it had
been unclear how the memorial and museum would relate to each
other.
</P>
<P>
   The government is particularly eager to settle the matter of the
memorial because a debate over memory of the Holocaust has been
raging in recent months between a prominent writer, Martin Walser,
and members of the small German Jewish community. Walser said last
year that Auschwitz had become a ``moral cudgel'' and a ``tool of
intimidation'' for Germans.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, the debate and the dithering over the memorial
became intertwined. But a breakthrough appears to have been made.
``This time,'' said Eisenman, ``It may even happen''.

 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You want Internet companies? We'll give you Internet companies.
That's the message Wall Street is sending investors in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Class of '99 introduces a new crop of Internet-related
companies with initial public offerings that will surely test
investors' hunger for anything that hints at the World Wide Web.
The first of these, Marketwatch.com, came roaring onto the market
last Friday. And at least 15 more Internet initial offerings are
expected within the next few weeks and months.
</P>
<P>
   But after a frenzied run on Internet stocks, a run that has sent
the shares of dozens of as yet unprofitable ventures to dizzying
heights this winter, Wall Street analysts are warning that
investors could suffer huge losses by eagerly chasing these hot and
volatile issues.
</P>
<P>
   Speculators bent on riding Internet stocks higher may be
distorting the true value of these startup companies, some analysts
say. They also warn that, with the huge number of offerings coming
to market this year, investors' willingness to go after anything
with a ``dot com'' moniker may make it difficult to distinguish
companies with solid prospects from companies simply trying to cash
in on the market's exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what's called a herd mentality _ everyone's going in
the same direction not knowing what they're going after,'' said
David Menlow, the president of the IPO Financial Network, a company
in Millburn, N.J., that rates public offerings. ``How do you stop
to determine what a quality company is when Internet companies are
trading on vapors?''
</P>
<P>
   The first signs of a frenzy this year came Friday with the first
day of trading in shares of Marketwatch.com, a financial news Web
site partly owned by the CBS Corp. Wall Street underwriters had
priced the initial offering at $17 a share. But the stock soared as
high as $130 a share in early trading before closing at $97.50, up
$80.50, or 474 percent, for the day.
</P>
<P>
   That price run-up was not too different from the pattern that
emerged last year, when Internet stocks like Broadcast.com,
Theglobe.com and Ebay rocked Wall Street with some of the fastest
opening-day sprints in history. Theglobe.com, for instance, soared
a record 606 percent in its first day of trading. The Internet
enthusiasm has been further fueled by the recent surge of
Amazon.com and other electronic commerce stocks.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Wall Street analysts say that underwriters have
been besieged by Internet-related companies seeking to go public.
``There's a pipeline chock full of deals,'' said Henry Blodget, an
Internet industry analyst at CIBC Oppenheimer. ``The market is
willing to fund anything right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those in the pipeline: Ivillage, a Web site that caters
primarily to women 25 to 49 years old; Healtheon, a
business-to-business health care information company founded by
James Clark, who is one of Netscape's founders, and Priceline.com,
an Internet auction site that enables consumers to bid for airline
tickets, automobiles and hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   While many leading Internet companies are preparing public
offerings _ including Barnesandnobles.com, the online operation of
the bookseller Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc. _ some investment bankers say
that the quality of many prospective offerings is dropping.
``There's a lot of low-quality merchandise in the pipeline, and a
lot of companies with just `dot com' on the back of their names,''
said Scott Ryles, head of the technology investment banking group
at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also high-quality ventures coming public, he said,
including a growing number of companies involved in
business-to-business activity on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Investors should be forewarned that a majority of the offerings
still come from money-losing ventures. Almost every offering
prospectus reads as if the underwriters hit a computer key that was
programmed to spit out the words, ``The company expects to incur
losses for the foreseeable future.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

</P>
<P>
   Priceline.com, for instance, has had cumulative losses of $41
million; Ivillage has lost $65 million in three and a half years;
and Healtheon has had losses of $73 million since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Startup losses, however, have not prevented Internet companies
from winning over investors. The Class of '98 demonstrated that
Internet companies are hot, regardless of their profitability.
Initial public offerings of Internet companies gained an average of
119 percent last year, according to Richard Peterson, a spokesman
for the Securities Data Corp. in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   A great deal of the activity came late in the year when a cool
market for initial public offerings quickly heated up after media
reports on the soaring popularity of the Internet and the rush of
retail business done over the Internet during the holidays.
``There's just huge mass media attention focused on the Internet,''
said Bill Burnham, an Internet industry analyst at Credit Suisse
First Boston. ``It's like a magnifying glass focusing the sun on
one little spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Day traders, who often trade in and out of stocks to ride price
trends and buying momentum, saw the rising demand for Internet
shares and pushed the volume of Internet trades to record levels.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts warn that the speculative frenzy has driven Internet
stock prices to irrational levels. As a result, they say, many
investors have lost considerable sums chasing volatile Internet
stock offerings, whose prices have occasionally fluctuated wildly
on their first day of trading, as Marketwatch.com did on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trading in some of those Internet stocks that go public is
totally irrational,'' said John L. Steffens, vice chairman of
Merrill Lynch. ``Some of the companies going public have been in
business two years and they're valued 10 times higher at the end of
the public offering; it doesn't make sense. Some of these issues
will have to come home to roost.''
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes that the Internet offers promising business
possibilities or that many of these companies may eventually turn
out to be profitable enterprises. But everyone from Wall Street
investment bankers who take companies public to everyday investors
gleeful about big stock market profits is questioning the soaring
values of these young companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't fictional growth or tulips; these companies are
growing,'' Blodget, of CIBC Oppenheimer, said. ``But these
valuations are problematic. I don't think there's a sector in
history that's been valued at these heights. It's totally
frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, analysts and traders say, is that there are
so few Internet stocks available to eager investors, and so much
demand for those that are available that trading imbalances abound.
</P>
<P>
   One measure of the supply-demand imbalance is the huge amount of
daily trading volume in comparison with the total number of shares
available. Nearly 10 million shares of Marketwatch.com changed
hands Friday, for example, even though only 2.75 million were
issued. Dozens of other Internet companies have been similarly
traded.
</P>
<P>
   With a large new crop of Internet companies preparing to go
public, though, analysts say that the supply-demand imbalance may
ease, and that could lead to softening stock prices as money chases
many more issues. Analysts say investors may also alter their
habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors are going to become more selective,'' said Lawton
Fitt, an investment banker at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. ``There used to
be a lot of personal computer companies and now there are only a
handful.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are also concerned about a surge in the number of
company insiders who sold their shares in the fourth quarter of
1998, which some see as a sign that insiders believe the stocks are
near a peak. ``We continue to marvel at a veritable explosion of
insider selling at the Internet-related or E-trade companies,''
said Bob Gabele, the president of CDA Investnet, a company that
tracks insider selling.

   BERLIN _ There he stood Sunday, on the back page of the
Munich-based Sueddeutsche Zeitung, the American president dressed
only in heart-adorned boxer shorts, clutching a glass of champagne
in his right hand and Monica Lewinsky in his left hand.
</P>
<P>
   The image, a photograph of a set of stamps just issued by the
self-styled Georgian state of Abkhazia, was given more prominent
play than the article inside on President Clinton's impeachment
trial in the Senate and appeared to sum up the amusement and
bemusement of most Europeans before what they see as America's
prolonged self-laceration.
</P>
<P>
   But beside the bewilderment and the familiar Gallic smirk at
what is portrayed in Paris as ``American puritanism,'' a new and
graver sentiment appears to have emerged with the start of
Clinton's trial. It is that the world's most powerful nation is
politically adrift, its capital marooned from its citizens, its
leader oddly cocooned.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the prosperity now enjoyed by many Americans, the
complacency such wealth can engender, and the relative lack of
interest in the trial, the French daily Le Monde wrote in an
editorial: ``When citizens feel themselves so little concerned by
public affairs, it is never a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, a correspondent for the daily La Repubblica reported
similar concerns for America's equilibrium in a piece from
Washington. Such European worries have mounted sharply since
Clinton's decision to bomb Iraq last month, an unpopular move here
that has been widely portrayed as futile, capricious and driven by
domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to collective respect for the state, they have
played too closely with fire, gone too far in destroying what was
left of trust between voters and public officials,'' La
Repubblica's dispatch said. ``The senators of the new American Rome
seem to have understood. They appear to have understood that since
yesterday, in the court of the Senate, it is not just William
Jefferson Clinton on trial, but America itself.''
</P>
<P>
   That America is increasingly judged harshly or with bewilderment
by many Europeans for whom the trial is the culmination of a
process that has made the United States seem more foreign to them.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans have heard many time that this trial is about truth
and lies and that such matters may qualify as ``high crimes and
misdemeanors.'' But what many Europeans seem to see or sense is the
tawdry intertwining of a presidential sexual dalliance, the
relentlessness of a right-wing prosecutor, and furiously partisan
politics.
</P>
<P>
   For the Sueddeutsche Zeitung, in an article entitled ``One
Hundred for Justice,'' the trial amounts to the ``last chance to
save any American dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, a daily newspaper, Slovo, the successor to the
official Communist Party organ Pravda, also said America's image
had suffered. It declared that Clinton's problems undermined the
image of ``citadel of law, high morals and morality that America
pushed on the world for decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain takes that morality more seriously than most European
countries, and its papers have been more inclined to judge Clinton
severely. The Republican rhetoric about the trial being in essence
about ``the rule of law'' and the place of ``honor'' in society has
found a deeper resonance in London than in Paris or Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   The right-wing Daily Telegraph used the prosecution's words _
``His lies were not few or isolated, but pervades his whole
testimony'' _ as its banner headline in a dispatch from Washington,
and an editorial noted that, ``The longer the trial goes on, the
greater risk that Mr. Clinton's famous luck will break.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the center-left Sunday paper, The Observer, gave
considerable space to an opinion piece by Henry Porter, an
editorial writer, calling for Clinton's resignation. ``It's not
about sex any more but about his lying, and no sane person alive
doubts that he lied or that he tried to influence witnesses,''
Porter wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But many continental Europeans greeted the trial with a yawn.
People feel they have already heard the story. The Lewinsky case
has been reported for many months, with successive sexual
revelations splashed on front pages. Most papers relegated the
start of the trial to inside pages.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that only if a conviction became more likely _ an
outcome that many European commentators feel may be more influenced
by a Wall Street tumble souring the American mood than by any
revelation in the Senate _ would the trial receive more prominent
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the longer the trial goes on, the more European
concerns about the state of the American polity seem likely to
deepen. In its editorial, Le Monde suggested that the U.S.
Constitution may have been perverted by the partisan politics of
the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans, the paper said, rightly saw the trial as ``the
engagement for partisan ends of a process of impeachment that
should remain exceptional, reserved only for the gravest crimes, as
the Constitution says.''
</P>
<P>
   This sentiment, it added, was likely to lead to further mistrust
of the political class. The headline on the editorial was
``Washington Guilty.''

 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINSK, Belarus _ It was a suspiciously finicky pack of burglars
who broke into the sardine-can offices of the little newspaper
Naviny one night in November.
</P>
<P>
   The thieves ignored television sets, computer monitors and
thousands of dollars in other business equipment. Instead, they
unscrewed the casings of four desktop computers and, after a few
minutes' work, departed with their innards _ memory banks holding
all the newspaper's photographs, archives and reference material.
</P>
<P>
   ``They only left the body,'' Igor Germenchuk, Naviny's editor in
chief, said not long ago, holding up one of the beige casings. ``We
accumulated information for eight years, and we lost everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Who ``they'' are is officially a mystery, but there is little
doubt as to the prime suspects. Naviny's editors have borne the
enmity of the Belarus president, Alexsander G. Lukashenko, since
they criticized his government a year ago in the newspaper Svaboda
and the police promptly shut the paper down.
</P>
<P>
   Lukashenko has not had to padlock another newspaper since. From
beatings to financial pressure to more subtle bumps in the night,
his government has deployed an ingenious array of methods to muffle
free-speaking journalists.
</P>
<P>
   The result is an independent press which, as the government
likes to boast, can say anything _ but which, as journalists
themselves agree, seldom speaks above a whisper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the social and political publications have a
self-censorship situation,'' said Nikolai Inin, chairman of the
board of Belapan, which provides nonpartisan coverage of events to
local and foreign clients. ``Editors realize that if they print
materials that don't follow the state line, they may lose their
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Those news outlets that refuse to toe that line often discover
that newsstands refuse to sell more than a handful of their
publications, that officials no longer speak to them, or that
printers are suddenly too busy to handle their work.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the variations are endless. Belapan, a rigorously
nonpartisan outfit, found that the state cut all its telephone
lines for ``routine maintenance'' at the height of 1996 elections,
which were widely regarded as rigged and which handed dictatorial
powers to Lukashenko.
</P>
<P>
   By statistical yardsticks, the Belarus press seems reasonably
robust. Only 285 of the country's 1,000 print publications are
officially state-controlled, and independent broadcasters
ostensibly compete for an audience with state-owned television and
radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say, however, that the numbers mask the real story. Of
the 716 independent publications, only 30 regularly critique the
government's actions; the rest are penny-savers, comics and other
apolitical journals. Only one of those 30 appears more than once a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Independent broadcasters uniformly avoid critical coverage of
the government for fear of losing their licenses. Russian broadcast
journalists whose coverage upset the government have been jailed.
</P>
<P>
   Watchdog groups like the International Helsinki Federation for
Human Rights and Human Rights Watch say the Belarus government has
systematically suppressed press freedoms that the nation's
Constitution supposedly guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch charged in a recent report that the
government has sought since 1994 to control the independent press
with the clear aim of driving such outlets out of business, for
instance by issuing orders to close independent radio and
television stations.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring the Committee to Protect Journalists, a New
York-based group, named Lukashenko one of the world's leading
opponents of press freedom. It later presented an award to a
Russian television journalist, Pavel Sheremet, who was jailed after
reporting on smuggling along the Belarus-Lithuania border.
</P>
<P>
   For journalists of lesser stature or smaller audience, a web of
government restrictions, fiscal penalties and a timely warning or
two may suffice. Independent publications are hard put to compete
with their state-owned rivals. Distributing independent journals
through official channels _ many news kiosks are government-owned _
can cost half again as much as is charged a state publication, and
the number of copies sold is often sharply limited.
</P>
<P>
   Obtaining information is no easier. A memorandum leaked last
year detailed a government-wide ban on providing information to
independent journalists. Last month, a new directive required all
news media to obtain a license before publishing any government
legal information.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the penalties are more severe. In June 1997, the
offices of Zdravy Smysl, a Minsk newspaper covering human-rights
issues, were ransacked and several computers and fax machines
destroyed. That fall, the government found the paper guilty of
breaking distribution rules, fined it $1,650 and ordered its press
run reduced from 23,000 to 10,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, the State Committee on the Press handed the editors
an official warning, charging the paper with printing false
information. The error consisted of identifying the government's
ban on contacts with the independent press as a decree, rather than
a directive. A second warning, the committee said, could lead to
the newspaper's closure.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those who still work for the nongovernmental press, it's
no longer just a profession; it's more,'' said an official of the
Belarusian Association of Journalists who asked not to be
identified. ``They're working out of their principles. Because any
moment, they could be closed.''
</P>
<P>
   That aptly describes Irina Khalip, editor of the weekly Imya, or
Name, an opposition journal whose hallmark is a weekly collage that
often features Lukashenko, usually in insulting situations.
</P>
<P>
   Imya has received two official warnings from the state press
committee. In 1997, Ms. Khalip and her father were among 40
pass-carrying journalists covering a protest march in Minsk when
the police surrounded and beat them. Ms. Khalip's father suffered a
concussion, cuts and a kidney injury. Later, he lost his job at a
state film studio.

YELTSIN HOSPITALIZED WITH BLEEDING STOMACH ULCER
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Barely three weeks after doctors declared him fully
recovered from pneumonia and exhaustion, President Boris Yeltsin
was found to have an acute bleeding stomach ulcer and sent to a
Moscow hospital Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The ulcer was Yeltsin's third serious illness in three months,
and it follows a year in which health problems sent him to the
hospital twice and kept him away from his Kremlin office for
months.
</P>
<P>
   His spokesman, Dimitri Yakushkin, declined to estimate how long
the president would remain in treatment. Experts said Yeltsin would
probably be bedridden for at least a week and possibly several
weeks. Surgery is possible if the ulcer cannot be otherwise healed.
</P>
<P>
   The latest ailment appeared to make barely a ripple among Moscow
politicians and government officials, who have become accustomed to
running the country without its top leader in regular command.
</P>
<P>
   During his illnesses last fall, Yeltsin handed control of most
day-to-day issues to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov. The president
has not transferred any powers to Primakov or issued any other
special orders related to his latest hospitalization, Yakushkin
said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Yeltsin was in stable condition and even cheerful,
though disappointed by his quick return to the sickbed.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist legislator who heads the national security
committee in Russia's lower house of Parliament, Viktor Ilyukhin,
said in a radio interview that Yeltsin was clearly a seriously ill
man. He said the new hospitalization would strengthen demands for
Yeltsin's resignation and a new election, though there now seems to
be no political consensus for such a move.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov told the Itar-Tass news service Sunday that Yeltsin's
illness had created ``no extraordinary situation.'' Despite his
recent return to work, questions about Yeltsin's health popped up
once again last week, when the president canceled a series of
Kremlin meetings without explanation and remained at one of his
country homes.
</P>
<P>
   Yakushkin denied those rumors last Thursday, suggesting that
Yeltsin was simply continuing the long Russian New Year's holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, he said then, was energetic and in normal health.
Sunday Yakushkin said that he had seen the president on Saturday,
when he held meetings late into the evening at his country home,
and that Yeltsin felt fine at the time. The president first began
to feel ill this morning and was diagnosed with an ulcer after a
gastroenterological examination, Yakushkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's recent illnesses have forced him to cancel or cut back
a series of foreign visits, including a meeting in Vienna with the
head of the European Community and a state visit to Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Yeltsin could be forced to cancel a trip to Paris on
Jan. 28 for talks with President Jacques Chirac. The day before
that trip, he was to meet in Moscow with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright. Whether that meeting will occur as scheduled is
unclear.

AILING LEADER OF AZERBAIJAN IS FLOWN TO TURKEY
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ One of the key figures in the
multi-billion-dollar Caspian energy boom, President Heydar A.
Aliyev of Azerbaijan, fell ill and was flown Sunday to a hospital
in Turkey for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Health Ministry in Azerbaijan said Aliyev,
75, was suffering from bronchitis and a viral infection.
</P>
<P>
   Reuters quoted an unidentified aide to Aliyev as saying he had
``a problem with his heart.'' That was disputed, however, by Mayor
Rafael Alakhverdeyev of Baku, the capital. He said Aliyev had ``a
bad cold'' and would remain in Turkey ``not more than one week.''
</P>
<P>
   Aliyev arrived in Ankara aboard a private jet sent to Baku by
President Suleyman Demirel of Turkey, a close ally. Demirel met him
at the Ankara airport and joined the convoy that took him to a
military hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a bout of influenza going around in Azerbaijan, and
I caught it and became pretty ill on the sixth day,'' Aliyev said
at the hospital, looking pale but standing unaided. ``My son called
my dear friend Suleyman Demirel, and he sent two teams of doctors,
but thanks to God, by the time they came I was not in a serious
condition any more.'' A statement issued by the Turkish foreign
ministry said that although his condition was not serious, ``it was
decided that to be sure, he should be given more tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Since rising to power in 1993, Aliyev has ruled Azerbaijan
virtually alone, making even the smallest decisions himself. His
departure or extended absence from the Azerbaijani political scene
could have profound consequences for the region.
</P>
<P>
   Azerbaijan is the center of an oil and gas bonanza that has
brought tens of billions of dollars in foreign investment to the
Caspian region and made it the object of intense competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aliyev is the one who has created the fertile environment for
investment here, so should something happen to him, everyone is
going to hope that what he laid down will continue,'' Igor
Effimoff, president of Pennzoil Caspian Corp., said in a telephone
interview from Baku. ``People are likely to be very nervous until
things become clear.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In addition to his role in encouraging foreign investment,
Aliyev has shrewdly balanced pressures by outside powers. He has
favored the United States and the West, much to the displeasure of
some powerful figures in Russia, who would like to bring Azerbaijan
back under Moscow's control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aliyev's replacement with a leader more amenable to Russian
interests would alter the strategic situation in the region almost
overnight,'' two specialists on Caspian affairs, Michael P.
Croissant and Cynthia M. Croissant, wrote in a recent study.
``Aliyev's departure would thus cast serious doubt on Azerbaijan's
prospects for remaining an independent state.''
</P>
<P>
   Azerbaijanis re-elected Aliyev to a second five-year term in
October. Foreign observers declared the election unfair because
opposition figures were denied free access to the news media, and,
in at least one case, assaulted by police when they sought to hold
a rally in Baku. Few, however, doubted that Aliyev would have won
even if the election had been completely free.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Baku said Sunday the president of the rubber-stamp
Parliament, Murtuz Aleskerov, would run the country while Aliyev
was away.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, it is unclear who might emerge if Aliyev is unable
to return to Baku soon. One opposition journalist, Shahin Abbasov,
predicted in an interview several months ago that the post-Aliyev
period would be characterized by ``a breakdown in national unity as
competing economic groups fight for power and access to the oil
wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   Aliyev spent three months in a Moscow clinic in 1987, when he
was a member of the Soviet politburo. He said later that doctors
told him he had suffered a heart attack, but that he did not
believe them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's extremely important, there's no doubt about that,'' Brian
Chipman, a Baku-based investment analyst, said in a telephone
interview. ``Before he came to power, you really had chaos and
disorder in Azerbaijan. The big issue is whether the prosperity and
peace that he's brought in his tenure has taken root to the extent
that no matter what happens to him, normal life will carry on here.
Everyone will be waiting and keeping their fingers crossed.''

   NEW YORK _ The time? About 10 years from now. The place? A busy
city newsroom. The circumstances? A breaking story, perhaps a
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter grabs a note pad, a tape recorder and something else:
a mobile journalist work station that includes equipment that will
plug the user into the Internet, allow transfer of information from
editors and tap into a data base of information about the
reporter's surroundings. It includes eyeglasses with built-in
liquid-crystal displays, a small high-speed wireless modem and a
global positioning satellite hookup that can pinpoint location to
within an inch.
</P>
<P>
   It's a vision of the future that a group at Columbia University
_ John Pavlik, director of the Journalism School's Center for New
Media, Steven Feiner, a professor of computer sciences, and some of
their students _ is working to make into a reality. A prototype of
the work station, about the size of a large backpack, is being
developed with about $120,000 a year in grants from the Office of
Naval Research and the National Tele-Immersion Initiative, an
organization that promotes the use of computer networking
technology.
</P>
<P>
   The system works interactively. In the future, a miniature
camera may make it possible to beam images from remote spots to a
home base, like a newsroom or a television studio.
</P>
<P>
   Pavlik said the work station, if eventually shrunk to an easily
portable size, could become an important information-gathering
tool, giving ``better access through wireless technologies to a
wide spectrum of information, including the Internet, but also to
remotely located experts and editors.'' It could provide immediate
context for reporting, he added, leading to greater accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   The project was not originally developed as a reporter's tool.
Feiner was researching what is called mobile augmented reality when
he and Pavlik realized its journalistic possibilities. Feiner said
he hoped to make the work station no larger than a hand-held radio
and reduce the cost to about $150, so that it would appeal to
ordinary consumers. He said travelers could use it as an aid in
exploring cities, ``something akin to a Michelin guide.''
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Naval Research has less pedestrian uses in mind:
it wants the work station to provide information to soldiers on a
battlefield. Dr. Larry Rosenblum, a researcher at the Naval
Research Laboratories, said, ``We want to give a marine a natural
interface without having him have to stop and punch into a
computer.''

   LOS ANGELES _ As the year 2000 approaches, this space highlights
important dates in Los Angeles sports history over the last
century:
</P>
<P>
   __ Jan. 19, 1998: Chick Hearn broadcasts his 3,000th straight
game for the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   __ Jan. 19, 1974: UCLA's winning streak _ the longest in college
basketball history _ is snapped at 88 games when Notre Dame comes
back from an 11-point deficit with less than four minutes to play
and edges the Bruins 71-70.
</P>
<P>
   __ Jan. 20, 1980: Los Angeles' only appearance in a Super Bowl _
and the first time a team had a so-called home-field advantage.
</P>
<P>
   In Super Bowl XIV before 103,985 at the Rose Bowl, the Rams
scrambled to take a 13-10 halftime lead. They managed a 19-17 lead
going into the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But game MVP Terry Bradshaw's 73-yard pass TD to John Stallworth
finally broke them. After a Franco Harris 1-yard TD run (set up by
a Bradshaw-to-Stallworth 45-yard pass), Pittsburgh had a 31-19
victory and its fourth Super Bowl title.
</P>
<P>
   Former USC star Lynn Swann also had a 47-yard TD catch from
Bradshaw that gave the Steelers a 17-13 lead just minutes into the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a trivia question: Who threw the Rams' only touchdown
pass in the game? It was Lawrence McCutcheon, on a halfback option,
for 24 yards to Ron Smith. Vince Ferragamo, who stepped in at
midseason for the injured Pat Haden, completed 15 of 25 for 212
yards but was picked off three times.

DELAWARE JURY FINDS LAWYER GUILTY OF MURDERING LOVER
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Del. _ Thomas J. Capano, a lawyer and a member of
Delaware's political elite, was convicted Sunday of first-degree
murder in the death of a woman who had tried to break off their
romance.
</P>
<P>
   Capano, who denied killing the woman, Anne Marie Fahey, but
admitted in his trial that he had dumped her body in the Atlantic
Ocean, could face life in prison or the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The events in the case had transfixed Delaware for more than two
years and the announcement of the verdict, 934 days after Ms.
Fahey's disappearance _ her family had counted off each day _ took
on the tone of a civic event.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, William Swain Lee of Superior Court, had warned the
spectators in the courtroom against any outbursts, but a bailiff
slipped a note with the verdict through a crack in the locked door
to another official, and there were cheers in the hallway when it
was read to the several hundred people would could not get in.
</P>
<P>
   Capano showed no reaction as the foreman of the jury, which had
to believe the crime was premeditated to convict on the sole charge
of first-degree murder, said, ``guilty as charged.''
</P>
<P>
   Capano's mother, Marguerite, wept, and so did Kathleen
Fahey-Hosey, the victim's sister.
</P>
<P>
   There were cheers outside the New Castle County Courthouse when
all the participants except those connected to Capano walked
outside. There was even a loud cheer for Lee. The Wilmington
newspaper, The News Journal, printed an ``extra,'' a six-page
Sunday afternoon edition of 5,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence will be imposed by Lee, but the jurors, who
deliberated three days after a three-month trial, will return to
court on Wednesday to recommend, but not mandate, the penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The judge told the jurors that the penalty phase would not
require a unanimous decision, as the guilty verdict did, but rather
a majority opinion as to whether the killing was aggravated or had
mitigating circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fahey, 30, had worked as the scheduling secretary to Gov.
Thomas J. Carper. Capano, 49, the eldest son of one of the state's
wealthiest real-estate families, had been the chief counsel to the
former governor, Michael N. Castle.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fahey disappeared on the night of June 27, 1996. Earlier
that evening, she had had dinner with Capano, who was married and
has since been divorced. Prosecutors did not have a body or a
weapon, and relied on circumstantial evidence to build a case that
Capano killed her when she tried to end their two-year affair.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, prosecutors introduced passages from Ms.
Fahey's diary. In the final entry, she described Capano as ``a
controlling, manipulative, insecure, jealous maniac.''
</P>
<P>
   After denying for 28 months that he knew anything about Ms.
Fahey's disappearance, Capano admitted in October that he had
disposed of her body by stuffing it into an ice chest and then
dumping it at sea but continued to deny that he had killed her.
</P>
<P>
   The real killer, he said when he took the stand last month, was
Deborah MacIntyre, with whom he had had an affair for 18 years, he
said, and who was jealous of Ms. Fahey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Debbie shot Anne Marie, and it was absolutely positively _ I'm
certain _ accidental,'' Capano said, telling of Ms. MacIntyre's
brandishing a pistol and of an accidental discharge as he struggled
to disarm her.
</P>
<P>
   He said that it was to protect himself and Ms. MacIntyre that he
did not call the police, decided instead to dispose of Ms. Fahey's
body.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. MacIntyre, who testified that she had bought a gun at
Capano's request and given it to him a month before Ms. Fahey's
disappearance, was one of those who conducted press conferences on
the courthouse steps Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very confident that the justice system would do the
right thing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked her reaction when Capano had shifted the blame for
the shooting to her, Ms. MacIntyre answered, ``It didn't surprise
me.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Capano's brothers, Gerard Capano, told jurors that on the
morning of June 28, the two of them drove to Stone Harbor, N.J.,
lugged the ice chest onto his 25-foot fishing boat and sailed 60
miles out to sea, to a spot known for sharks, and emptied the
contents.
</P>
<P>
   The cooler was soon recovered by a fisherman and ultimately
traced to Capano.
</P>
<P>
   Another of Capano's brothers, Louis, testified that Capano had
discarded a sofa and a rug that might have been stained with blood.
</P>
<P>
   Both brothers are expected to plead guilty to minor charges in
connection to the slaying. In exchange for their cooperation, they
have been promised they will not receive jail sentences.
</P>
<P>
   One of Capano's lawyers, Joseph S. Oteri of Boston, said in a
news conference: ``The jury was a serious jury. They've spoken.
We're not happy, but that's the process. We'll go on to the
appellate process.''
</P>
<P>
   Oteri looked out on to the dozens of television and newspaper
photographers and dozens more reporters with microphones and
notebooks drawn to the courthouse on a day in which downtown
Wilmington would otherwise have been deserted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a feeding frenzy,'' he said of the coverage of the
case. ``This is O.J. Jr., but with the opposite verdict.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 people were able to crowd into Lee's courtroom. One
was Edward Lafferty, a telephone repairer for Bell Atlantic in
Wilmington, who said, ``We've been here since quarter to 6 this
morning. I was third in line.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he was so intent on seeing the verdict handed up,
Lafferty said: ``We've been following the trial very extensively
and we're here to see that justice is done. I've been here three
times before. So far as I'm concerned, the man is guilty. I have no
question about that at all.''
</P>
<P>
   David C. Weiss, a lawyer for the victim's family, told a
cheering audience outside the courthouse: ``We're real pleased and
satisfied. It is not a time for celebration, of course. Nothing can
bring Anne Marie back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how privileged you may be,'' Weiss added, ``justice
applies to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss lamented that the killing and trial had ``disturbed'' what
Ms. Fahey actually was because it emphasized her weaknesses, not
the loving role she played in her family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anne Marie was more than Tom Capano's mistress,'' Weiss
declared.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fahey's family did not participate in the consecutive
statements on the courthouse steps. Instead, a sister and four
brothers held a subdued news conference in the cafeteria of the
Chase Manhattan Center nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The repeated applause at the courthouse, said one brother, Brian
Fahey, was ``surreal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a surprise,'' he said. ``It's odd, but I understand
their reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Another brother, Robert, said that the family had no opinion of
whether Capano should be sentenced to death or to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, life in prison can be a cruel punishment,'' he
said. ``It doesn't matter. It's up to the jury and the judge to
decide.''
</P>
<P>
   The family was to gather Sunday night, he said, but not to
celebrate the conviction. ``If we celebrate anything, it will be
Anne Marie's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fahey-Hosey said that in the trial, Capano's ``true
personality became very clear. He was manipulative.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the verdict, she said: ``I am relieved. I'm numb. We learned
that Anne Marie was shot, but we don't know what happened to her.
It's very sad. It's a hollow victory. We all miss Anne Marie, and
she's not coming home.''

ECEVIT , LIFELONG LEFTIST, TAKES OFFICE AS PRIME MINISTER OF
TURKEY 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ After easily winning a confidence vote in
Parliament, Bulent Ecevit took office as prime minister Sunday and
pledged ``to take Turkey smoothly to elections on April 18.''
</P>
<P>
   It still is considered possible, however, that powerful military
commanders will press Parliament to postpone the elections. Public
opinion surveys suggest that the Islamic-oriented Virtue Party
remains the country's strongest, and the commanders want to prevent
it from gaining more power.
</P>
<P>
   The military, which opposes any increase in the role of religion
in public life, orchestrated a campaign that led to the collapse of
the last Islamic-led government in 1997. Commanders have made clear
that they will oppose Virtue's participation in the next government
even if it emerges from the election as the country's strongest
party, as it did in the 1995 election.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the military issued two statements underlining its
opposition to Islamic political power. One, contained in a text
prepared for cadets, asserted that ``a new war of national
liberation must be launched with determination against Islamic
activism that threatens the Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   The other statement, a 14-page position paper distributed to the
press, said: ``Our democracy will be strengthened if political
formations that will destroy democracy by abolishing secularism are
banned. No democracy should be obliged to allow a political
formation that uses democratic means to destroy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong criticism of the military can be punished by fines and
prison terms here, but Tansu Ciller, a conservative political
leader who is bidding for Islamic votes, said it was not necessary
for commanders ``to be issuing statements every two days.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Ciller and her bitter rival on the center-right, outgoing
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz, whose government fell Nov. 25 in a
corruption scandal, lent their support to Ecevit Sunday. With votes
from their supporters, he won the confidence vote 306 to 188.
</P>
<P>
   Both Mrs. Ciller and Yilmaz hoped to win political advantage
from helping Ecevit become prime minister, although he is a
lifelong leftist.
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit, 73, is also one of the patriarchs of Turkish politics.
He won his first election to Parliament in 1957 and headed three
governments in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   One of Ecevit's immediate challenges will be to find enough hard
currency to make large foreign debt repayments due in the first
quarter of this year. He must also confront eroding public
confidence in the banking system, which was spurred this month when
the government took over a mid-sized bank that was apparently on
the brink of collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit, under whose leadership Turkey sent troops to Cyprus in
1974, is likely to maintain tough Turkish stands toward Cyprus and
the continuing Kurdish insurgency in southeastern provinces.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurdish insurgency may be entering a new phase with the
changing circumstances of its leader, Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan fled his longtime hideout in Syria last year and was
living in Italy until Saturday, when he departed for an unknown
destination. Italian leaders had threatened to bring him to trial
for crimes connected to the war he has directed for 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has become clear that the head of the bloody terrorist
organization will not be able to find shelter anywhere,'' Ecevit
said after taking office today. ``We are trying to confirm where he
is.''

VIRGINIANS INDIGNANT AT GIULIANI'S TRASH TALK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (mk) 
 By BLAINE HARDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. _ Virginians are struggling to decide what odors
wafting out of New York City smell more foul _ mushrooming mounds
of garbage or uppity pronouncements from Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Nostrils flared across the Old Dominion last week at news of a
possible tripling of deliveries of New York City garbage. Up to 2.2
million tons a year, Virginians learned, could be heading up the
James River, bound for landfills in a state that already is
embarrassed to place second (behind Pennsylvania) as America's top
garbage destination.
</P>
<P>
   Noxious as the news was _ Gov. James Gilmore III called it
``highly unacceptable'' and spoke of his ``duty'' to ban garbage
barges on state rivers _its perceived toxicity was quickly exceeded
by the mayor's statement about why non-New Yorkers have garbage
obligations.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for the top-drawer culture that visitors soak up in
New York, the mayor argued, they should be willing to bury some
trash back home. A ``reciprocal relationship,'' he called it.
</P>
<P>
   In this state where people take pride in their manners, the
mayor's reasoning has incited widespread outbreaks of incivility.
Long-simmering suspicions about Yankees _ their arrogance, their
pushy politicians and the unspeakable nature of their garbage _ are
suddenly boiling over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now let me see if I got it right,'' said state Sen. William
Bolling, a Republican and longtime critic of out-of-state trash.
``I come up to New York and I spend my hard-earned money and
somehow in exchange for that privilege, I am supposed to take your
trash? This represents a certain arrogant attitude that is not
consistent with the way we do business in Virginia. I can't think
of a single issue that has made my blood boil more than this.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Sunday at the governor's mansion, Gilmore, a
Republican, said he was ``offended'' by the Republican mayor's
reasoning on garbage, which he described as ``really an outrageous
statement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To come out and basically try to further the discussion by
saying we had a moral obligation because some Virginians from time
to time visit New York is not proper,'' said Gilmore.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he was concerned that the image of Virginia,
which he described as ``one of the top technology states in the
country,'' with more than 1,000 high-tech companies, including
America Online, was being unfairly maligned by the trash issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very much on the rise and we don't want anyone to get
the impression that Virginia is only good as a garbage
repository,'' Gilmore said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's office has dismissed such comments, which resounded
here in the state capital during last week's opening of the General
Assembly, as mere carping from ``pandering politicians trying to
achieve their own agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Not just politicians are peeved. Business leaders with
multimillion-dollar investments in garbage importation speak
bitterly of the public-relations disaster they say the mayor has
created.
</P>
<P>
   ``After this past week, when people here say Yankee trash, they
think it's redundant,'' said Charles Carter III, an 11th-generation
Virginian whose family owns Port Tobacco at Weanack, a
state-of-the-art facility for containerized garbage on the James
River.
</P>
<P>
   Carter finds it hard to believe that Giuliani is entertaining
thoughts of running for national elective office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giuliani couldn't have said anything that could have harmed
his own cause more. He is definitely not presidential material,''
Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   If Virginia's governor and the Legislature follow through on
last week's threats to ban garbage barges on the river _ and there
are constitutional reasons why such a state ban might not hold up
in court _ Carter stands to lose lots of money. He says his family
does not have the resources to take the state on in a long court
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's advice to the mayor: ``We'll take the trash, but keep
your mouth shut.''

Virginia is Waste Management Inc. of Houston. It has invested $15
million in Port Tobacco and had planned to begin barge shipments
there in April. Asked if the mayor had helped Waste Management in
its delicate negotiations with the governor and the Legislature, a
company spokeswoman, Christine Meket, who has been dispatched to
Richmond for damage control, said, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, environmental groups, investigative reporters and a
few lawmakers in Virginia have tried to raise public awareness of
what they see as the ecological and road-safety risks of the
state's rapidly increasing importation of garbage. The business has
boomed here in the last decade, creating giant landfills located
mostly in land-rich, cash-poor African-American communities in
central Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   New York City, driven by the legal deadline to close its
landfill at Fresh Kills on Staten Island by Dec. 31, 2001, has
become Virginia's fastest-growing source of garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Garbage-truck accidents, complaints about putrid odors and state
records documenting the arrival of untreated syringes and vials of
human blood have all raised public awareness here about trash
rolling into this state from New York. A poll released last week by
Virginia Commonwealth University's Center for Public Policy found
that 87 percent of Virginians want to cap trash shipments into the
state.
</P>
<P>
   But Matthew Higgins, a spokesman for Giuliani, said Sunday that
at least some Virginians welcomed New York's trash. ``Simply put,
this is a business that creates jobs and generates economic
activity,'' he said. ``New York City has already been contacted by
a number of communities in Virginia that want this trade.'' He
would not say which communities wanted the city's garbage. But he
said the city had no choice but to find alternatives to Fresh
Kills.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But judging by comments this weekend from shoppers at a mall
outside Richmond, Giuliani has been uniquely effective in
crystallizing attitudes toward big-city garbage in the minds of
average Virginians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had not been thinking about it until Giuliani made his
remarks,'' said Kitty Jones, 55, a school secretary from Henrico
County who was having lunch on Saturday outside the Chick-Fil-A
booth in the food court at Virginia Center Commons mall.
</P>
<P>
   Since reading about the mayor in the papers and watching him on
television in the past week, Ms. Jones said she had found herself
wondering why Giuliani would say such a thing and what kind of town
would support such a man.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think of New York, you think of arrogance,'' Ms.
Jones said, adding that it was probably unfair to judge a whole
city on the basis of its mayor's behavior. ``I'm sure they are all
not like that, are they?''
</P>
<P>
   In the Virginia Legislature this year _ an election year here _
garbage is emerging as the hot-button issue. On one side, there are
quality-of-life complaints, especially from lawmakers in affluent
northern Virginia, where highways in the Washington suburbs are
inundated with out-of-state garbage trucks.
</P>
<P>
   On the other, there is the deepening dependence of central
Virginia counties on revenue from landfills. In Charles City County
south of Richmond, $32 million in revenue from a landfill that
takes New York City garbage has allowed county supervisors to build
a new school system and an industrial park and to cut property
taxes by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the legislative mix, according to state records, is an
increasing flow of campaign money from waste industry companies.
</P>
<P>
   Given the volatility of the garbage issue, state legislators on
both sides of the aisle here said they were stunned by both the
content and the timing of Giuliani's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor should realize that this is a hot political topic
and the general approach should not be to fan the flames,'' said
Delegate Kenneth Plum, chairman of the state Democratic Party.
``But this is effectively what he has done.''
</P>
<P>
   Down in Charles City County, whose 934-acre landfill is operated
by Waste Management Inc., school leaders and county planners
reacted more in sadness than in anger to the mayor's theory of
interstate garbage-culture reciprocation.
</P>
<P>
   They said the county, which has a population of about 7,000
people, many of whom are among the poorest residents of Virginia,
simply cannot afford a huge, politics-driven reduction in the
amount of garbage coming into the landfill. It is ready to begin
receiving New York garbage from the new port on the James River _
if the barges are not banned by the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``The landfill is the biggest boon to Charles City County in
modern times,'' said Bill Britton, the county planning director.
``Every tax since 1988 has either stayed the same or has been
lowered. At the same time, we have been able to build a whole
school system _ not just one school _ but a $21 million school
system.''
</P>
<P>
   The county's school board chairman, Charles Giles, agreed
wholeheartedly with Giuliani's statements last week that any
attempt by Virginia to ban barge shipments of garbage would be
overturned by federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want anyone to interfere with interstate commerce,''
Giles said. ``It is a constitutional right.''
</P>
<P>
   Both he and Britton declined to comment on the mayor's
invocation of a garbage obligation in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, managing director of the family-owned port on the James
River, had no such reticence.
</P>
<P>
   He said that before last week's comments by the mayor, he had
heard sketchy reports of a similar public-relations debacle in New
Jersey. In December, the mayor surprised and infuriated Gov.
Christie Whitman with a plan to ship trash to transfer stations in
her state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had thought that brouhaha must have been exaggerated,''
Carter said. ``But it sounds like the mayor has apparently got a
big enough mouth that he not only can get his feet in it, but
several other people's feet in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter then allowed himself to ask what he described as a
sarcastic question: ``Is the mayor always such a wonderful and wise
person in all his comments?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When Richard Avanzino leads a tour of the
headquarters of the San Francisco Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, he cannot help sounding terribly pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no shelter like this in the world,'' he said the other
day as he ushered guests through the society's Maddie's Pet
Adoption Center. He was not really bragging. Under his direction,
the San Francisco SPCA has become the envy of humane societies
across the country, a place where tourists go and one out of three
city households donates time or money.
</P>
<P>
   In this $7 million shelter, abandoned dogs live in airy,
glass-walled ``apartments'' with doggy futons, televisions and
throw rugs. Cats have elaborate jungle gyms to play in, potted
grasses to munch on and fish videos to watch on their televisions.
The rooms are so spacious that the SPCA offered to shelter some of
the city's many homeless people in them, though most people decided
it was not a great idea.
</P>
<P>
   But the society's biggest accomplishment, Avanzino said, is
pushing San Francisco to become the first no-kill city in the
United States _ one where no adoptable animals are put to death.
</P>
<P>
   Avanzino is now taking this philosophy on the road. Known as a
brash pioneer among animal protectors, Avanzino is launching his
biggest, most ambitious project: He wants to make every shelter in
the country no-kill within 10 years, and he has $200 million from
the owners of PeopleSoft, a $5.5 billion Silicon Valley software
company, to help reach his goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that killing is not an acceptable management tool
for us to use as stewards of our nation's animals,'' he said.
``Given that, we're going to do everything we can to provide a
creative resource to help shelters develop their goals of finding
homes for every adoptable animal.''
</P>
<P>
   About 700 of the country's 5,000 shelters call themselves
``no-kill.'' Still, in a country where nearly 5 million dogs and
cats are euthanized each year in overcrowded shelters, and the
human society mantra to spay and neuter seems lost on the wider
public, the notion of a ``no-kill nation'' sounds rather
far-fetched, even with $200 million in seed money. Avanzino insists
it can be achieved shelter by shelter, city by city. The San
Francisco SPCA last year saved 4,897 dogs and cats, finding 82 so
diseased or ill-tempered that they had to be put to death.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years ago, Avanzino said, when Dave Duffield started
PeopleSoft to create software for human resource applications,
people laughed at that, too. ``All revolutionary ideas,'' Avanzino
said, ``are rejected at first.''
</P>
<P>
   Duffield and his wife, Cheryl, who have a personal worth of $1.9
billion, had already given the San Francisco SPCA $1.5 million _ $1
million to help build Maddie's, named for their late miniature
schnauzer _ when they lured Avanzino away from the presidency of
his beloved SPCA after 22 years with their $200 million offer to
use in heading the Duffield Family Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there's more to come,'' said Duffield, who calls the money
a pledge they made to Maddie, who died of cancer in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife couldn't have children,'' he said, ``and at a tough
time in our lives, we got Maddie, and she was a tremendous friend
to us. We told ourselves that if we ever had money, we would return
some back to her kind.''
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the plan for a no-kill nation is simple: Animal
shelters receive hefty grants that increase each year as they start
achieving a five-year goal of finding homes for every adoptable
animal, regardless of age, appearance or physical disability.
Within five years, when its goal is met, the shelter is rewarded
with $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will help them continue to launch creative ways to adopt
out animals,'' Avanzino said. ``And when other shelters see what
the first is doing, they'll want to try it. Success brings more
success.''
</P>
<P>
   The concept of a no-kill nation has critics. Some animal welfare
organizations question how ending euthanasia is possible when the
number of unwanted animals far exceeds the number of people willing
to adopt them. They also say that labeling a shelter no-kill could
make the public think ill of struggling shelters that do kill
animals to make room for others that might suffer and die slowly on
the streets as strays.
</P>
<P>
   Ingrid Newkirk, president of People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals, lauds the goal of a no-kill nation, but doubts it can be
attained. ``The people who are coming to fund the no-kill shelters
obviously have high hopes and big hearts _ and deep pockets,'' Ms.
Newkirk said. ``But every day, I pray that some of that money will
go to the unpopular roots of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   That, she said, includes the failure of pet owners to spay and
neuter their animals. In fact, a component of the no-kill nation,
Avanzino said, would be reducing animal birth rates, as well as
helping people keep their pets and increasing adoptions. But Ms.
Newkirk said she was still skeptical that no-kill could be achieved
on a wide scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're doing in San Francisco is all absolutely
praiseworthy,'' she said. ``But I do think that we cannot condemn
the shelters that do euthanize, when there are animals who would be
suffering on the streets if shelters couldn't bring them in because
they had no room. I don't think there will ever be world peace, and
I don't think we'll ever have a no-kill nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Avanzino deflects all criticism with a wry smile. ``It's not
only doable,'' he said, ``it's not even hard.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bolstering his confident claims is the success of the San
Francisco SPCA. When Avanzino, who has a doctorate in pharmacology
and a law degree, joined the organization in 1975, it was operating
at a deficit. Its annual budget is now nearly $12 million, making
it one of the richest shelters in the country. He raised membership
to 87,000 from 3,500, increased annual donations to $4.5 million
from $47,000 and increased the SPCA's volunteer roster from zero to
2,287 _ and counting.
</P>
<P>
   The society has also started one program after another _ some
now common in shelters throughout the country _ to help its
abandoned animals find and keep homes. They include three-month
training programs that pair dogs with deaf people, a mobile
adoption program, doggy day care for working people, an animal
behavior program, an elaborate program that helps older people
adopt older animals and pays for routine veterinary care, and a
program that lobbies landlords to allow tenants to own pets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who say how can you spend $200 million on
animals when there is all this human suffering,'' Avanzino said.
``But animal philanthropy represents a very small amount of the
work that is being done in this country for those who need it.
We're doing it as a life-saving measure.''
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate his point, he stopped at an ``apartment'' at
Maddie's to visit Ashton, a graying 7-year-old Australian shepherd
mix who has been in the shelter since early November, longer than
any other animal. At another shelter, the dog might have been
killed by now. Instead, the society is spending hundreds of dollars
on Ashton _ teaching him new tricks, giving him expert medical care
and lots of loving attention, all in the hopes that the dog will
become more adoptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why shouldn't Ashton get a chance?'' Avanzino asked. ``We know
someone wonderful out there will bring Ashton home.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Several inches of windswept snow will fall from central
Wisconsin to southwestern Ontario as a potent low pressure system
draws colder to the south along its western flank. Meanwhile, rain
showers will accompany a frontal system as it moves east from the
eastern part of the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley Monday morning.
During the afternoon and Monday night, colder air will sweep in
from the northern Ohio Valley to the western slopes of the
Appalachians. Scattered snow showers and flurries will occur as the
colder air arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Rain will be locally heavy from the Middle Atlantic coast to
central New England as gusty winds from the southeast bring
moisture from over the Atlantic Ocean. As the rain spreads north,
it may begin as a period of freezing rain in some of the valleys of
central and northern New England. A few rumbles of thunder are
possible as a cold front arrives over the Middle Atlantic states
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and showers will precede a front as it moves toward the
Southeast coast. In the wake of the front, drier breezes from the
northwest will foster ample sunshine from the southern Plains to
the lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, frequent showers will dampen the Pacific Northwest
coast where stiff onshore breezes prevail. Locally heavy snow will
fall above 4,000 feet in the Cascades and Bitterroot Mountains.
Farther south, a frontal system will bring showery rain from
central California to northern Nevada and Utah. Intermittent snow
will occur along west-facing slopes in the central and northern
Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Ice Jams
</P>
<P>
   After frequent Arctic chill this month, the current thaw
combined with expected rain is raising concern about ice jam floods
on creeks and streams around Pittsburgh. While widespread flooding
is not expected Monday, the situation offers a glimpse of what
sometimes occurs in early spring when seasonal downpours and
melting snow lead to ice jams on major rivers that can pose a
serious threat of flooding. Chunks of ice can choke waterways
pushing water backward beyond the river banks. Also, sudden
releases from ice jams that abruptly dislodge can send flood waters
rushing downstream.

TINY STATE GETS BIG ROLE ON SMALL SCREEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's mid-January, but Rhode Island is hotter than a Tabasco
sandwich. The buzz began last season with an occasional mention on
``Ally McBeal'' and ``Dawson's Creek,'' both of which are set in
Massachusetts. Then came ``Providence,'' a new drama on NBC, and
next is ``Family Guy,'' one of three new animated comedies with
midseason launches on Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Though it could be Anyburg, U.S.A., the setting of ``Family
Guy'' is the Ocean State because creator Seth MacFarlane went to
college at the Rhode Island School of Design. When ``Family Guy''
joins the Fox lineup in March, viewers will be treated to
MacFarlane's impression of the Providence skyline, along with
references to Pawtucket's minor league baseball team and
Providence's colorful mayor, Vincent ``Buddy'' Cianci, who has a
junior high school named for him in the series.
</P>
<P>
   If early indications are anything, viewers also may see a
prime-time cartoon show with enough wit and irreverence to match
the best of ``The Simpsons.'' At first blush, ``Family Guy''
resembles a ``Simpsons'' photocopy _ it's about a somewhat
unconventional family of five living in the 'burbs _ but
MacFarlane's humor is gentler and more rooted in middle-class
reality. Never mind that the youngest child, an infant named
Stewie, is constantly plotting his mother's demise.
</P>
<P>
   MacFarlane, all of 25, says his mom is OK with that and all the
other subversive humor in ``Family Guy.'' ``Really,'' MacFarlane
insisted, ``she laughs at the most potentially offensive stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Family Guy'' will get a special preview Jan. 31 after the
Super Bowl.
</P>

   __ If MacFarlane is the next Matt Groening, you might think

ONE PUNCH, AND TYSON'S COMEBACK SURVIVES
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With one electrifying shot, Mike Tyson jolted his career as a
heavyweight boxer back to life at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Nev.,
on Saturday night. Now comes the hard part: Keeping it going.
</P>
<P>
   After a 19-month exile imposed by the Nevada State Athletic
Commission for biting Evander Holyfield's ears, Tyson showed
considerable ring rust. Tyson was roughed up and taunted by
Francois Botha, until he landed a crushing right hand that ended
the fight at 2 minutes 59 seconds of the fifth round.
</P>
<P>
   One punch. Knockout.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson (46-3) caught Botha (39-2) with a short, snapping counter
right hand that landed flush on Botha's chin. Botha crumpled, went
down on his rear end, tried to get up, but lurched face forward on
the canvas. He made it to his feet at the count of seven, but
stumbled into the second rope. Referee Richard Steele quit counting
and declared the fight over as Tyson went over to help Botha.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't prove anything,'' Tyson said after the fight. ``I'm
just trying. I have a long way to go. We're working on it.''
</P>
<P>
   His veil of invincibility and intimidation is gone. Botha even
taunted Tyson in the fourth round, drawing laughter from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   If Tyson is to become a world champion again, he will have to go
through boxers who are more skilled than Botha. Tyson at least
proved that he still has a big right-handed punch. And it's a good
thing because he was behind on all the judges scorecards before he
landed the knockout punch.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's handlers were happy he was able to keep his cool, and
accused Botha of trying to Tyson to snap as he did on June 28,
1997, when he bit Holyfield's ears, was disqualified and
subsequently had his boxing license revoked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those first couple of rounds, Botha was doing everything he
could to get him crazed,'' said Shelly Finkel, Tyson's manager.
``But Mike went back to the corner and composed himself. He did a
good job of keeping his cool.''
</P>
<P>
   The first round was punctuated by an ugly scene. After the bell,
Tyson and Botha were locked up in a corner and Steele could not
part them. Tyson had Botha's left arm clamped under his right arm
and was twisting it. Both fighters exchanged punches as both
corners, MGM Grand security and Las Vegas police flooded into the
ring. Tyson was dragged back to his corner by his new trainer,
Tommy Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks had warned Tyson that Botha's manager, Sterling McPherson
and his trainer Panama Lewis, who is banned from boxing because he
removed the stuffing from the gloves of one of his fighters in a
1983 bout, might encourage Botha to try to provoke Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   But Botha said dirty tactics by Tyson prompted the first round
altercation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike grabbed my arm, he was trying to break my arm, to twist
my arm,'' Botha said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about that Tyson said, ``He's correct.''
</P>
<P>
   As the ring was being cleared, Marc Ratner, the executive
director of the Nevada State Athletic Commission, entered the ring
to talk to Steele. If Steele had disqualified Tyson and stopped the
fight, Tyson's career could have been finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him just to take control, take a deep breath,'' Ratner
said. ``I think Richard did take control and I think he did a good
job under some trying circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele deducted a point from Tyson in the second round for
holding Botha's arm and hitting on the break. Not only was Steele
back in control of the fight, Botha was gaining control over Tyson
and building confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's timing was off. He missed with a lot of wild looping
shots. He was loading up on every punch and catching a lot of shots
to the face from Botha. But Tyson was walking through most of the
punches.
</P>
<P>
   Botha even resorted to taunting Tyson in the fourth round, but
Tyson did not lose his confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I would knock him out,'' Tyson said. ``It was just a
matter of time.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a crushing defeat for Botha. A former International
Boxing Federation heavyweight champion, Botha was noted for his
durability and his ability to take a punch. But he couldn't take
Tyson's best shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just walked into that punch,'' Botha said. ``Mike is a great
hitter. I just got careless. I was trying to psyche him out. We
really said some bad things to each other. I feel I was in control
of things until I walked into that punch. It was a punch I didn't
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson said that he will go back to training in two weeks for
another bout in April.
</P>
<P>
   He also has a court date in Maryland on Feb. 5 to be sentenced
on a plea of no contest to two charges of misdemeanor assault that
resulted from his involvement in an incident following a traffic
accident in Gaithersburg, Md., on Aug. 31. Two men alleged that
Tyson struck them following a chain reaction car crash, in which
Tyson's wife, Monica Turner, was hit from behind and pushed into
another car.
</P>
<P>
   There is an outside chance that Tyson's probation on a 1992 rape
conviction could be revoked and he could wind up back in prison in
Indiana, but that seems unlikely at this point.
</P>
<P>
   Finkel said his preference for Tyson's next opponent is Axel
Schulz, another tough brawler who has more boxing skills than
Botha, but lacks the firepower to level Tyson. Botha defeated
Schulz in a 12-round decision in 1996 for the IBF title, but was
stripped when he tested positive for steroids after the bout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll fight anybody,'' Tyson said. ``If the price is right,
I'll fight a lion.'' &QL;

JONSSON, ISLANDERS' ALL-STAR, WORRIES ABOUT INJURED KNEE
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Kenny Jonsson limped out of the National Car Rental Arena
late Saturday night in Sunrise, Fla., his right knee supported by a
brace, the Islanders defenseman felt a wide range of negative
emotions.
</P>
<P>
   He was worried, confused, frustrated. And even considered
himself a little snakebit.
</P>
<P>
   Jonsson twisted his knee as he fell near the Florida Panthers'
goal only 5 minutes 20 seconds into the Islanders' 1-0 loss. He was
helped off the ice, never to return.
</P>
<P>
   Now the question arises: how serious is his injury?
</P>
<P>
   An early examination classified it as a sprain of the medial
collateral ligament, the seriousness of which is to be determined
by the Islanders' director of medical services, Dr. Elliott
Pellman.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was, Pellman was in Denver Sunday. He also is a
medical liaison with the Jets, who played the Broncos for the
American Football Conference championship.
</P>
<P>
   So Jonsson will have to wait until Monday to learn if he will be
able to play again this season, much less next weekend in the
National Hockey League All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still planning on playing,'' he said of the All-Star Game.
``But everything will be settled by Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he felt he would be missing a chance to get more
recognition if he can't play in the All-Star Game, Jonsson said:
``I think I got the recognition already, when I was picked for the
team. I don't know if it's going to change a lot with my
recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   The twisted knee is only the latest injury to befall the
23-year-old Jonsson this season. He has missed eight games because
of two concussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough break,'' he said. ``I mean, I was starting to
feel good after the concussions I've had.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he was trying hard to think positive. ``The good news I
guess is that I can walk on the knee,'' Jonsson said.
</P>
<P>
   It was more difficult to find any silver lining in what is
happening to the Islanders. Saturday's loss extended their streak
without a victory to 10 games (0-9-1), completed an 0-5 trip and
left them with a 13-28-3 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really know what to do,'' Jonsson said. ``It seems
like we try and try and try, but we don't get any breaks. We just
have to keep working hard and look to ourselves, what we can do for
the team.''
</P>
<P>
   His thoughts were complicated by the throbbing in his right
knee. Sunday _ and Pellman's return from Denver _ seemed a long
time coming as he left the arena Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have other doctors,'' Jonsson said. ``But for something
like this, it's best that I wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he turned and hobbled alone toward the team bus. &QL;

FALCONS' ANDERSEN WINS THE BATTLE OF THE PLACE-KICKERS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Gary Anderson and Morten Andersen had their fates,
the fates of the Minnesota Vikings and the Atlanta Falcons and an
invitation to the Super Bowl decided on the same piece of
artificial turf at the Metrodome Sunday. Thirty-eight yards from
the western goal post is where a field-goal kicker named Anderson
floundered and a field-goal kicker named Andersen flourished.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Vikings' Gary Anderson gagged on a 38-yard attempt
with just over two minutes remaining in the fourth quarter _ his
first miss on a field-goal or extra-point try this season _ the
Falcons stayed within 7 points and managed to tie the score less
than a minute later. Because the Falcons' Morten Anderson made a
38-yard attempt from the same spot in overtime, Atlanta shocked
Minnesota, 30-27, in the National Football Conference championship
game.
</P>
<P>
   Two kickers with almost the same last name. Two kickers kicking
from the same spot on the field. Two thirtysomething kickers who
have each been in the league for 17 years and are among the most
precise in the National Football League. Two kickers, two very
different results and two very different directions for their
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's part of destiny, I guess,'' Morten Andersen said.
``That's part of it being meant to be like that. I feel bad for
Gary, but I'm so happy for this football team. He had a great
season, so he ought to be proud. We're certainly proud of the way
we came back today and kept fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Anderson may be proud of a season in which he was 39 for 39
on field-goal tries and 64 for 64 on extra-point attempts before
Sunday's kick narrowly sailed to the left, but he was sullen after
the loss. Anderson was crammed into the corner of the muggy locker
room, and quarterback Randall Cunningham gently reached over and
moved the kicker aside to get to his locker. Then Cunningham patted
Anderson's stomach, like a father consoling a son.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no words to describe how bitterly disappointing that
is, with the season we've had,'' Anderson said. ``We had a lot of
chances out there today, and we didn't get it done. This team had
very high expectations, and that's what makes it 10 times more
disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Morten Andersen said he did not even realize he had made the
field goal from the same place where Gary Anderson had botched the
chance to give the Vikings a comfortable 10-point cushion. He
shrugged, smiled and said, ``That's just destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Anderson had been so automatic that some fans were probably
using their cellular telephones to confirm reservations to Miami
for the Super Bowl as he trotted onto the field. But something went
awry in the dream season Anderson was having within Minnesota's
dream season. Somehow, the perfect kicker missed, and he could not
explain why. Anderson said the snap was perfect, the placement of
the ball was solid and he thought he had produced 3 points with his
right leg.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was hit after the attempt and tumbled to the turf, but
he did not blame the contact for the miss. Some fans cheered before
realizing Anderson's kick was no good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it goes to show you that no one is perfect,''
Cunningham said.
</P>
<P>
   Not even Gary Anderson, anymore. The 39-year-old native of South
Africa patiently and professionally answered waves of questions
about the missed field goal. It is a miss that might be remembered
more than anything else Anderson has done in his career, a notion
that he did not dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's part of field-goal kicking,'' Anderson said. ``You have
to be a man about it. When you're a field-goal kicker, that's part
of the job. To line up and fire those field goals. Unfortunately,
that one didn't go through. Most of them have. That's what made it
so, so bitterly disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   When Morten Andersen had the chance to give the Falcons a
stunning victory in overtime, it felt like another practice to him.
Coach Dan Reeves tested the 38-year-old from Denmark throughout the
season by asking him to imagine there were five seconds left in a
game and he had to kick a 40-yard field goal for Atlanta to win. If
Andersen drilled it, his teammates did not have to run sprints. If
he missed, they did. That is pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We practice tense situations all the time,'' Reeves said.
``When you tie the conditioning to a kick, that's almost as much
pressure as in a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Andersen, the lefty kicker who holds seven league records, said:
``I just had to stay automatic and hit the ball. It's something we
have rehearsed so many times before. Once I'm ready, we let the
skills take over. We just react.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Anderson and Andersen reacted differently after the
winning field goal. Andersen sprinted to the Falcon bench and was
buried under his teammates. Anderson watched the celebration
unfold, tried to find his counterpart to congratulate him and then
gave up because he could not see through the maze of delirious
Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've still got one game to go, but I'm so elated,'' Morten
Andersen said. ``I'm the happiest guy in here right now.''
</P>
<P>
   A few hundred yards away, a kicker named Anderson was the
saddest.

AS PARTIES BICKER OVER CASE, DEMOCRATS WARN ABOUT WITNESSES
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the White House set to open President
Clinton's defense before the Senate on Tuesday, Republicans and
Democrats sparred Sunday over the strength of the prosecution's
case, and Democrats stepped up their warnings that calling
witnesses would lead to a prolonged impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat who speaks
regularly with Clinton, warned that if the Senate called witnesses
sought by House prosecutors it would also have to approve witnesses
sought by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Front and center is going to be Kenneth Starr,'' Torricelli
said on CBS's ``Face the Nation,'' ``and we will go through
prosecutorial abuse, how he came by the information, who he talked
to, and we are going to put the system of justice on trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The competing assessments of the impeachment case, after three
days of opening arguments by the House prosecutors, came on a day
when senators demonstrated precisely how they differed from a jury.
Instead of being forbidden to discuss the case, 19 lawmakers,
nearly a fifth of the Senate, blanketed the Sunday talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   In a demonstration of the uncertainties surrounding the
impeachment process, several lawmakers even raised the possibility
Sunday that the Senate had the leeway to convict Clinton on
articles of impeachment but not remove him from office, even though
the Constitution says that the president ``shall be removed from
office on impeachment for and conviction of treason, bribery or
other high crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the lawmakers raising that possibility, Rep. Lindsey
Graham, R-S.C., one of the House managers, said on ``Face the
Nation'' that there was ``historical precedent'' dating to before
1936 that the Senate could take separate votes on conviction and
then on removal from office. ``That's, I think, a constitutional
option,'' the South Carolina Republican said.
</P>
<P>
   Graham did not elaborate further. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,
called the idea ``an interesting possibility,'' and Torricelli said
the Senate could find that perjury had been commited by the
president but not remove him.
</P>
<P>
   A memorandum from the Senate Office of Legal Counsel sent to
senators in December by Trent Lott, the majority leader, and Tom
Daschle, the minority leader, says, ``Removal from office follows
automatically from conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   In a footnote, the memorandum noted that in the impeachment
cases of three judges dating from before 1936 there were two
separate votes. But legal scholars say that since the impeachment
trial of Judge Halsted Ritter in 1936, the separate vote on removal
was abandoned by the Senate in recognition that the Constitution
requires removal from office upon conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans said Sunday that the 13 House prosecutors in
their three days of opening arguments had made a strong case that
the President should be removed from office. They said the
president's own lawyers, who open the president's defense Tuesday,
have to rebut the evidence, not just argue that the charges do not
rise to the constitutional level for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can just sweep away the House's case,'' said
Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' ``I think a
lot of people were very impressed with the case that they made.
It's a prima facie case; in other words, it's a case that would go
to the jury. The judge could not keep it from the jury.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the White House had a ``heavy burden'' ahead of it in
rebutting the House presentation. Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said,
``Frankly, I think if the president does not put on a defense,
House prosecutors have proved a case, both on perjury and
obstruction of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   But none of the Democrats who appeared on television showed any
sign that they were leaning toward Clinton's conviction. ``We've
sat for three days and haven't heard anything new,'' Sen. Byron
Dorgan, D-N.D., said on ``Fox News Sunday.'' ``I don't think we'll
hear anything new when the White House makes a presentation.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the trial procedures agreed to by the two parties, the
Senate will take two votes in late January after opening arguments
on whether to dismiss the case and whether to depose witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   A few Republicans set the stage for blaming the White House if
the Senate takes a majority vote to hear from witnesses. Sen. Jon
Kyl, R-Ariz., said the question of whether to call witnesses
depends ``on the degree the White House challenges the facts.'' He
added, ``If they say you can draw a conclusion that supports the
president, I think the House managers will have a stronger argument
for the proposition they need witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats had their own mantra of the day: that opening the door
to witnesses would lead to a prolonged proceeding. Sen. Christopher
Dodd, D-Conn., said that if witnesses were called ``you're going to
have the White House demand all exculpatory evidence from the House
managers, you're going to have discovery and depositions.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the trial could go on to May or June.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said that if witnesses were allowed he
would be interested in questioning not only Starr but ``Linda
Tripp, maybe having a whole host of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans quickly pointed out that depositions would require a
majority vote in the Senate and that another majority vote would be
needed if any witness was to testify on the Senate floor. ``We are
not going to let this spin out of control,'' McConnell said. Kyl
said ``I can't imagine more than a couple or three witnesses at
most and perhaps a week in time.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators also debated whether the Senate should have a different
standard for removing a president from office than it used in
removing Federal judges. In 1989 the Senate removed Judge Walter
Nixon Jr. of Mississippi for lying before a grand jury. Judge Alcee
Hastings of Florida was also removed from office that year for
lying in a bribery trial in which he was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry, who voted to convict both judges, said that the standards
were different for removing a president and judge because
presidents are elected for a four-year term and judges serve for
life on good behavior.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the case involving Nixon concerned whether he had
tried to intervene in a drug investigation. ``Now'' he asked, ``how
can you have a judge who's lying with respect to a drug
investigation which it is the purpose of the courts to
investigate?''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ To all appearances, the loan agreement Gloria Knight
signed in 1995 was a classic transaction between savvy mortgage
salesmen and an unsophisticated borrower in a poor Brooklyn
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Knight, a 55-year-old retired teacher, said she was
persuaded by the salesmen who knocked on her door to put her house
up as collateral for an $88,000 loan at 13 percent interest, even
though she had no income and no way to make the $973 monthly
payments.
</P>
<P>
   But when she defaulted on her loan, leading to eviction notices
last year, it turned out that she was in the grip of something far
larger than Delta Funding, a relatively obscure Long Island
mortgage company that solicits business among low-income
homeowners. Delta's partner in trying to take Ms. Knight's home is
Bankers Trust Co., America's eighth-largest bank.
</P>
<P>
   High-interest lending in poor neighborhoods has long produced
high profits for lenders and, often, equally high burdens for
homeowners. But the entry of big banks like Bankers Trust has
changed the equation. Over the last several years, Delta has
converted hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of its mortgages
into securities much like bonds, which it sells to investors
through Bankers Trust.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Bankers Trust has provided Delta with hundreds of
millions of dollars from the investors, allowing it to make more
and more loans and become a major player in high-interest lending
in New York and in 21 other states.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a problem: a high percentage of the homeowners
cannot afford the mortgages they are getting through Delta. Many
say they were deceived into getting the loans and now risk losing
their homes, as Delta and Bankers Trust seek to reclaim the money
for their investors.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Knight, who has since been found to be delusional by a
psychiatrist for the city's Protective Services for Adults, cannot
even afford electricity. She keeps warm with a kerosene heater and
cooks over a makeshift grill in her backyard. But despite being
poor, she had something that made her attractive to lenders like
Delta: her rowhouse in East New York, which was fully paid for and
which served as security. Legal Services lawyers say she will now
almost certainly lose it.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's business has recently produced civil lawsuits in three
states and has drawn the attention of low-income housing advocates
and social-services agencies, who say the company has generated
more complaints of abusive lending than any other high-interest
lender in New York City. They contend Delta has taken advantage of
scores of homeowners and violated federal and state laws.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Chief Judge Charles P. Sifton of the Federal Court
for the Eastern District of New York stopped the foreclosure sales
of homes of three people who defaulted on Delta loans, because, he
wrote, the mortgages ``on their face'' violated federal law.
</P>
<P>
   The homeowners have sued Delta and Bankers Trust, claiming they
violated, among other laws, a federal prohibition on making loans
based solely on equity in a house and not on a homeowner's ability
to repay a loan. The suit seeks to represent tens of thousands of
other Delta borrowers whom lawyers say are caught in similar
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Bankers Trust, which is being acquired by the
German banking giant Deutsche Bank, declined repeated requests for
interviews. On Friday, William McBride, a bank spokesman, said:
``Bankers Trust's sole responsibility in these situations is to
safegaurd the interests of investors. We have no other connection
to these actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc E. Miller, Delta's general counsel and a son of its
founder, vigorously denied that the company engages in deceptive
lending, saying it made no sense financially for the company to
make loans it knew would fail. ``There is sometimes this myth
that's spread around that lenders do make money'' from foreclosed
properties, Miller said. ``And it is a myth.''
</P>
<P>
   While refusing to comment on cases that are in litigation, he
added that ``if a loan simply doesn't make sense for a borrower, we
won't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But city real estate records show high foreclosure rates on
Delta mortgages in some neighborhoods. In Brooklyn, where the
company is most active in the city, a search of records found that
48 of 363 loans made by Delta in 1995 _ or about 13 percent _ have
ended up in default, and Delta has begun foreclosure actions. For
1996 loans, the records show, the figure is 99 of 923 _ or about 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In its annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission
last year, Delta reported that 4.65 percent of all its loans were
in foreclosure, calculated by the dollar amount of the loans.
</P>
<P>
   According to Inside B&AMP;C Lending, an industry newsletter that
reports statistics from several large lenders, about 2.65 percent
of the amount of high-risk loans nationwide were in foreclosure as
of September 1998, the most recent date for which information was
available. An additional 1.9 percent were 90 days delinquent and in
danger of foreclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's critics contend that the company has devastated the
lives of many working-class homeowners, most of them elderly.
``These folks not only lose their homes, but lose every dime of
equity they have built up over the years, and in most cases this is
all they have to show for years of hard work,'' said Josh Zinner, a
lawyer with the Foreclosure Prevention Project for Seniors, a
branch of South Brooklyn Legal Services set up last year to pursue
claims of abusive lending.

</P>
<P>
   Anna Dawson, a 67-year-old Brooklyn widow who is fighting Delta
and Bankers Trust in state court for her home, may get help from
prosecutors. The Brooklyn district attorney's office is
investigating an independent broker who, she contends, falsified
her mortgage application without her knowledge to make it appear
she could afford a $99,000 mortgage with monthly payments of $1,017
</P>
<P>
   In reality, her only income was roughly $700 a month in
survivor's benefits from her late husband. But her application
included a letter saying she was an office manager at United
Equities in Brooklyn and a lease that made it appear she rented out
a floor of her home. The company does not exist at the address on
the letter, and Ms. Dawson said she has not worked in more than two
decades. She has no renter. In addition, the signature on the lease
does not appear to be hers.
</P>
<P>
   Her loan became part of $340 million worth of 1997 Delta
mortgages put into a trust managed by Bankers Trust and sold to
investors.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit filed in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, her
lawyers contend that the mortgage broker and a home-improvement
contractor came to her house uninvited several times, persistently
pushing her to get a loan for repairs to her house.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, she was unable to make her payments, and Delta and
Bankers Trust have begun to foreclose against her. Meanwhile, like
many other Delta borrowers who claim to have been deceived, she
said she was left with almost no proceeds of her loan _ after
paying Delta's fees, settling a previous low-interest loan and
paying the same home-improvement contractor, who she said did
little work.
</P>
<P>
   High-interest lending became a big business in low-income
neighborhoods nationwide after 1986, when a change in the federal
tax code gave a tax break to homeowners who took out second
mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   But complaints about abuses began almost immediately.
Unscrupulous finance companies often singled out homeowners, many
of them elderly, who had substantial equity in their homes; in case
of default, lenders could recoup the loan by taking possession of
the home.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, New York City's Department of Consumer Affairs reported
that finance companies, usually working with crooked home
improvement contractors, had ``fleeced thousands of lower-income
and minority New York City homeowners'' out of equity in their
homes by tricking them into loans for repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Many finance companies resold their mortgages to big banks. But
Delta _ founded in 1982 in by Sidney A. Miller, a former planner
for insurance companies _ was one of the first to see a vast
untapped resource beyond the banks: the investment market. By
converting loans into securities and selling them to investors,
finance companies could generate a faster profit and have access to
much more capital, and make many more loans.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, the market in asset-backed securities like
those issued by Delta has grown from $9 billion to more than $140
billion, as investors pursued the rapidly expanding trade in
high-risk auto loans, credit cards and home-equity loans.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the high-risk home-loan industry alone reached more
than $120 billion in loans issued nationwide in 1997, according to
industry estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Delta began selling its loans as securities in 1991, giving
investors the right to share in mortgage interest payments, and
Bankers Trust's California branch soon began to manage the trusts
that held these securities. Delta's business zoomed. In 1994, it
made about $100 million in loans. By last year, according to its
federal securities filings, its loans increased to more than $1
billion. It grew from about 150 employees to more than 1,000. In
1996, the company went public, on the New York Stock Exchange, and
in 1997 it reported profits of more than $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   William J. Brennan, a lawyer for the Atlanta Legal Aid Society
who specializes in lending abuse cases and is familiar with
lawsuits against Delta, criticizes Bankers Trust as Delta's
``enablers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bankers Trust would never make these kinds of loans
themselves,'' he said, ``but they put themselves in the position of
enhancing the power of Delta Funding to engage in abusive lending.
And they do it because there's lots of money to be made.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the view of Marc Miller, whose family runs Delta, based
in Woodbury, N.Y., ``there are many people who want and need a loan
and can't get one. From that standpoint we fill a very legitimate
niche in the consumer finance field.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gertrude Menzel, an elderly Queens woman who had lived in her
two-story rowhouse in Ridgewood since she was a teen-ager, took out
an $81,000 Delta mortgage in the summer of 1994, when she was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, Bankers Trust and Delta say Ms. Menzel owes
more than $123,000 in principal and interest, and they are trying
to take her house.
</P>
<P>
   There is no dispute that Ms. Menzel signed the loan papers. But
little else is clear, including her motivation, since her first
mortgage was paid off and she appeared to have no debts. Her lawyer
said that she was talked into the loan by an acquaintance who had
previously taken financial advantage of her and ended up taking the
proceeds of her loan for himself.
</P>
<P>
   But questions remain about whether she was competent when she
closed the mortgage in Delta's offices. Workers at a Queens center
for the elderly, who saw her almost daily, said they noticed memory
lapses and confused behavior well before the summer of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   By Thanksgiving, six months after she got the mortgage, she
``was wearing house slippers out into the cold and was not taking
care of herself,'' said Thomas Crossman, who ran the Ridgewood
Older Adult Center at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, according to court papers, two psychiatrists hired by
the center found symptoms of dementia and memory loss, indicating
Alzheimer's disease. One reported that she ``does not have any
knowledge of her assets or income.''
</P>
<P>
   By May 1995, Ms. Menzel was ruled legally incompetent in State
Supreme Court, and she later defaulted on the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   But Bankers Trust argued in court papers that her mortgage was
valid because Ms. Menzel had not been ruled incompetent before the
closing. Partly for that reason, a State Supreme Court judge, Edwin
Kassoff, declined to let Ms. Menzel out of the mortgage. Bankers
Trust and Delta continue to fight her in court.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's critics say that the company commonly works with a
network of aggressive, often unscrupulous mortgage brokers and
home-improvement contractors who canvass poor neighborhoods,
looking for elderly homeowners willing to put up their homes as
collateral for loans to help with bills or home repairs.
</P>
<P>
   A search of court records and Delta loan documents found that at
least two people who have referred loans to Delta _ John Gizze, the
owner of a mortgage consulting firm in Hempstead, N.Y., and Gary
Feldman, a Queens home improvement contractor _ have pleaded guilty
to conspiracy to commit bank fraud in Federal court in cases
unrelated to Delta.
</P>
<P>
   Both men admitted in court that they had falsified papers to
exaggerate the income of borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   Gizze's lawyer, Allen Drezin, said Gizze has subsequently had
``some dealings with Delta Funding,'' but they ``have been up to
the standards of the industry.'' Feldman is now a defendant in a
federal civil suit filed by Mary Lewis, a Queens woman who claims
he and Delta deceived her when she took out a home equity mortgage
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Feldman said he has closed few loans
with Delta, and denied engaging in any deceptive lending practices.
</P>
<P>
   Delta officials said they were unaware of the criminal pasts of
either man, but they added that they do not routinely perform
criminal background checks on brokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dealing with thousands of different brokers,'' said Marc
Miller, the general counsel, ``it would, frankly, be impossible for
us to stay on top of every broker at every instant.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is now the target of at least four Federal civil
suits, three of which seek to represent classes of thousands of
homeowners whom lawyers allege were deceived or mistreated by
Delta.
</P>
<P>
   The suit filed late last year in federal District Court in
Brooklyn accuses Delta of consistently lending to people based on
the equity of their homes and not on their ability to pay, a
practice the plaintiffs' lawyers say has led to scores of
foreclosures.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also accuses Delta of breaking federal law by charging
exorbitant extra interest once a loan goes into default. (A review
of Delta loan papers for several borrowers found that the interest
commonly jumps to 24 percent after default. In New York, interest
rates over 25 percent are prohibited by criminal usury laws.)
</P>
<P>
   Delta and Bankers Trust, represented by a single law firm in the
case, have not yet responded to the allegations in court.
</P>
<P>
   In Mississippi and Georgia, two federal civil suits allege that
Delta is one of many high-interest mortgage lenders paying fees to
mortgage brokers. The suits allege that these fees are, in reality,
a kickback to brokers for steering borrowers to the lenders, even
though it may not be in the borrowers' best interest.
</P>
<P>
   Delta officials deny the accusations. But in a similar federal
class-action case in New York, Delta recently settled with the
plaintiffs in a confidential agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, the company's general counsel, said in a written
statement that all such suits contain ``accusations, rather than
fact'' and have been filed ``solely for the purpose of delaying or
preventing Delta Financial from protecting its rights.'' But Delta
has not always been successful in challenging borrowers' claims of
abuse. In October 1991, Theresa Leonardi's husband of more than 50
years had just died. In November she went into the hospital with
thyroid and heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after she was released from the hospital, she was
taken to Delta's offices, then in Great Neck, N.Y., by a
stockbroker who later pleaded guilty to mail fraud against her in
connection with the loan and served time in federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Leonardi took out a $95,000 mortgage on her home in
Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, but she said later in a lawsuit against
Delta that she had no idea what kind of papers she was signing.
</P>
<P>
   The papers described her as a 68-year-old self-employed investor
making $7,000 a month. In fact, she was almost 73 and was living
mostly on Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   In giving the loan to Mrs. Leonardi, according to court
documents, Delta waived its written policy stating that income tax
returns should be used to verify the income of loan applicants.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, her lawyers say, all her mortgage proceeds went
directly to the stockbroker, and Mrs. Leonardi never made a single
loan payment. By December 1992, the bank began a foreclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Felsenfeld, a former Citicorp vice president who was an
expert witness for Mrs. Leonardi, said in a deposition that the
case showed ``clear and convincing evidence of Delta's
participation in the fraud perpetrated on Mrs. Leonardi.''
</P>
<P>
   Delta denied the accusations and pointed out that Mrs. Leonardi
had chosen the unscrupulous stockbroker herself. ``It is a sad
commentary on our society,'' a Delta vice president, Marie Klasa,
wrote in a letter in February 1995, ``that people must seek to
blame others for their own errors in judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the trial approached last summer, Delta agreed to pay
Mrs. Leonardi $200,000 _ more than twice the amount of her mortgage
_ in a confidential settlement in which Delta admitted no
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said the company settled because it believed it would be
less costly than pursuing an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The actual facts,'' he said, ``are that Delta made a loan that
made sense at the time to a woman who knew what she was doing at
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Leonardi remembered it differently. ``At no time did any of
these people explain to me that I was signing papers for a mortgage
on my home,'' she stated in court documents. ``They merely pointed
to the lines, and I signed or initialed as directed. At the time I
was so weak that I couldn't walk without assistance and could not
read any of the papers that I was asked to sign.''

ONE OF A KIND, OR TWO OF A KIND? STAMP FANATICS WANT TO KNOW
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Del.; Sweden, Guyana, Germany, France, U.K.)   (dw) 
 By BARTH HEALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the world's rarest stamps, issued by British Guiana in
1856 and last sold two decades ago for almost 1 million dollars,
may be only half as rare as was thought. A second copy has turned
up and has passed initial tests for authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   The original stamp, a one-cent issue crudely printed with black
ink on lilac-colored paper, is one of the icons of the hobby,
largely because of the tradition that it was found by a Scottish
schoolboy in 1873 and sold to a local dealer for six shillings
(about $1.60 in those days). It is now owned by a murderer.
</P>
<P>
   The second copy, whose existence is being reported in the next
issue of Stamp Collector, a fortnightly newspaper, reportedly
turned up in Romania in the mid-1980s, when it was bought by an
unidentified dealer from Bremen, Germany. The German dealer said
the seller, a dancer, had inherited the stamp in a collection from
her grandfather, who was a servant to a Russian nobleman.
</P>
<P>
   Initial microscopic tests have been conducted by David Feldman,
a prominent Swiss auctioneer of rare stamps and coins, and show
that the paper and ink are appropriate to a stamp issued in 1856.
Further tests could take a year, Feldman added.
</P>
<P>
   Feldman was the auctioneer for what is currently the most
valuable stamp ever sold, the Swedish Tre Skilling Yellow, an 1855
stamp that was printed in yellow rather than its normal green. He
sold that stamp in November 1996 for $2.3 million (including his
commission), after verifying that the yellow color was not due
merely to the fading of a stamp that had originally been green.
</P>
<P>
   A small number of the British Guiana stamps were produced by a
local newspaper printer when supplies of the original one-cent
issue, which had been produced on high-quality paper in London, ran
out.
</P>
<P>
   According to the stamp's lore, it was found by a 12-year-old
Scottish lad named Vernon Vaughan in 1873. It was still attached to
a piece of paper, so the boy soaked it off, and the poor quality of
the stamp's paper became more evident.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon sold the scruffy stamp to N.R. McKinnon because the boy
wanted to buy better-looking stamps for his collection. (What may
be the second known copy is also scruffy.)
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years its rarity came to be recognized, and it
passed through the hands of several prominent stamp collectors:
Count Phillippe von Ferrari of Paris, Arthur Hind of Utica, N.Y.
(who paid $35,250, a record stamp price, in the 1930s), and
Frederick T. Small of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1970 Small sold the stamp to a syndicate for $280,000.
</P>
<P>
   The syndicate sold the stamp in 1980 for $935,000 to a buyer who
was anonymous at the time but whom Stamp Collector and others have
identified as John E. du Pont. Du Pont was convicted in February
1997 of shooting and killing an Olympic wrestler whom he had
sponsored. He was sent to a hospital for the criminally insane.

CSUN SURVIVES MONTANA SCARE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MISSOULA, Mont. _ Cal State Northridge led Montana by 18 points
at the half, by 17 with a little more than 11 minutes left. But if
you haven't figured it out by now, nothing is simple for CSUN.
Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   It came down to the Matadors making six straight free throws in
the final 32 seconds as they survived against the Grizzles 92-88
Sunday at Sentinel High School.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors will take it. Any way they get it. Because they
needed to win to keep their season from evaporating.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt this was a must-win for us, no doubt about it,'' said
CSUN coach Bobby Braswell, who battled the flu bug during the
weekend. ``We (pressed) because we felt we had to light a fire with
our guys. We've been too complacent at the beginning of games.''
</P>
<P>
   It ended a losing streak at three games for the Matadors (10-8,
2-4 Big Sky) that had the mental weight of three months. It's not a
cure-all, but it sure does go a long way in soothing a bunch of
burned-out CSUN psyches.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors were supposed to storm through the league. Instead,
it took a 57-point, press-filled first half and harrowing final few
minutes for them not to fall 1{ games behind the Grizzlies (8-8,
1-4) for the sixth spot in the Big Sky Conference. In the process
the Matadors found a few things that had been AWOL since the
conference season began.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of relying on pressure defense to rally from a large
deficit, the Matadors used the press to build a big lead. CSUN also
re-established its inside game, pounding the ball into the low
post.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure in the first 10 minutes we weren't
shell-shocked,'' Montana coach Don Holst said. ``But the guy that
killed us was Jeff Parris. He's about my size and we couldn't hold
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Parris, all 6-foot-5 of him, scored a career-high 19 points on
7-of-9 shooting before fouling out with 3:22 to play. Any time the
Grizzlies were poised to pull within a possession, it seemed Parris
scored from close range.
</P>
<P>
   And with Parris on the bench in the closing minutes, it was
Brian Heinle (13 points) who moved into the middle. He scored on
low-post moves to give C8d% five-point leads on two occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last few games we were getting away from putting the
ball in the low post and we were shooting a lot of outside shots,
and missing a lot of those shots'' Parris said. ``We were trying to
slow it down and get it down in the post, and that opens the
outside shots. When we settle down and move the ball around and get
it inside the post, we get better shots.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also the steady play of newly appointed point guard
Greg Minor. He scored a team-high 20 points and made four
3-pointers, but his value was in settling down CSUN's offense.
</P>
<P>
   When Montana went on a 12-3 run to pull within 80-77, it was
Minor who calmly ran the Matadors' half-court offense so they would
get quality shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``In high school I used to play the point my whole career and
they moved me to (shooting) guard because I can shoot, but I'd
rather play the point,'' Minor said. ``We knew we had to at least
get one because we knew we couldn't go home 1-5.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's lawyers are preparing a defense
to the Senate on Tuesday that broadly attacks the prosecution case
presented by the House managers on the facts, on the law, on the
Constitution and even on history.
</P>
<P>
   According to several White House advisers, the heart of the
president's defense will remain that the charges against him fall
far short of the high constitutional standard for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This impeachment is a direct affront to that constitutional
standard,'' George Mitchell, the former Senate majority leader,
said Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the president are likely to use aspects of the House
prosecution case to defend him and to show that his accusers have
misread both the facts and the law. ``We will point out the
significant holes in the presentation of the House managers,'' said
Jim Kennedy, a White House spokesman, ``as well as their misleading
and overreaching characterizations of the evidence and testimony in
the record.''
</P>
<P>
   In presenting their case, the House managers also employed this
tactic, by anticipating, incorporating and debunking Clinton's
defense before it had been heard by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The evidentiary case presented by the House managers outlined an
unlawful scheme orchestrated by the president to get Monica
Lewinsky to file a false affidavit in the sexual misconduct lawsuit
brought by Paula Jones, and to conceal their relationship from the
Jones lawyers by hiding gifts the president had given to Ms.
Lewinsky. The House prosecutors claimed that Clinton helped find a
job for Ms. Lewinsky in order to silence her, and tried to
influence the testimony of other witnesses. Then, they charged, the
president went before a federal grand jury and lied about these
activities, including the nature and details of his relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's legal team is well aware that it faces new and
significant hurdles as the impeachment trial turns to the defense.
Senators have already sat through three days of uninterrupted
evidence and argument imploring them to go the ultimate step in the
impeachment process and remove the president from office. And even
some Democratic senators conceded that the House managers had
presented their case clearly and effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any fair-minded person would have to say they made a powerful
presentation,'' Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., said Saturday after the
House's final arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Democrats in Congress and White House advisers remain
confident that the House managers still face extremely stiff odds
in persuading the required two-thirds of the Senate to convict the
president. But the prosecution's coherent presentation of the
evidence and law on perjury and obstruction of justice, the central
charges contained in the two articles of impeachment passed by the
House, made it far more likely that a simple majority of senators
would favor hearing from witnesses, an issue to be decided after
the White House makes its case.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, senators will hear more about events with which they
have become all too familiar: the president's deposition in the
Jones trial, his testimony before the grand jury and his
interaction with White House aides and friends, including his
secretary, Betty Currie, and Washington lawyer Vernon Jordan Jr.
This time, however, they will hear about these subjects from a
different vantage point.
</P>
<P>
   Where the House managers placed the president at the heart of a
conspiracy to lie and obstruct justice, his lawyers will, if their
trial brief is an accurate road map, show him in a very different
light. After trying to conceal an embarrassing and illicit affair,
they will say, the president admitted to the grand jury that he had
had an ``inappropriate, intimate'' relationship with Ms. Lewinsky
and did nothing unlawful in his earlier efforts to hide their
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The White House legal team, relying heavily on the president's
grand jury testimony as well as the testimony of Ms. Lewinsky and
Ms. Currie, will most likely challenge every assumption and many of
the facts on which the House case was premised. In several
instances, the lawyers will argue that the House's recitation of
evidence was purposely misleading.
</P>
<P>
   For example, instead of encouraging Ms. Lewinsky to lie in the
Jones case, the president said in his grand jury testimony that he
believed Ms. Lewinsky could execute a truthful affidavit, since
they had never had sexual intercourse. Ms. Currie testified that it
was Ms. Lewinsky who initiated the retrieval of gifts, while the
House managers claimed that Clinton had instructed Ms. Currie to
get the gifts back from Ms. Lewinsky. Finally, the president's
lawyers will stress that he helped Ms. Lewinsky in her job search
before she became embroiled in the Jones case, undercutting the
House managers' allegations that the job help was a quid pro quo
for her silence in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's defenders were particularly rankled by the
presentation of two Republican managers, Rep. James Sensenbrenner
Jr. of Wisconsin and Rep. Bill McCollum of Florida. Sensenbrenner
mischaracterized earlier testimony from the White House counsel,
Charles Ruff, and misstated facts from the Jones case, claiming
that Ms. Jones was denied merit pay raises.
</P>
<P>
   McCollum focused heavily on the president's statements in the
Jones case, even though the House rejected an impeachment article
charging him with perjury in the civil case. McCollum also insisted
that the president committed perjury before the grand jury by
saying he did not lie in the Jones case. The president's lawyers
have repeatedly stressed that he was not asked to reaffirm all of
his testimony in the Jones case when he went before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Broadly, the president's case is likely to follow the same
outline as the House case. It is expected to deal separately with
the evidence and law on perjury and obstruction of justice but move
more quickly to a core argument that the allegations against the
president, even if they are proven, do not rise to the
constitutional standard of impeachment.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The House managers outlined four separate areas of perjury,
which they illustrated with video clips from the president's
deposition in the Jones case and his testimony before the grand
jury.
</P>
<P>
   In presenting the perjury case to the Senate, Rep. Steve Chabot,
R-Ohio, said it was ``undeniably clear'' that the president had
fulfilled a crucial element of perjury, the intent to testify
falsely. He cited as evidence Clinton's statements and those of
Ruff, that the deposition testimony was designed to mislead Ms.
Jones' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he cited Clinton's conversations after the
deposition with Ms. Currie, a kind of question-and-answer session
in which the president suggested to her a version of his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. ``This is not the conduct of
someone who believed he had testified truthfully,'' Chabot said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's statements to the grand jury were material,
another important legal measure of perjury, Chabot said, ``because
the grand jury was investigating whether the president had
obstructed justice and committed perjury in the civil deposition,''
in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   The White House will argue that the president's testimony before
the grand jury was truthful and differed only in trivial ways from
Ms. Lewinsky's account.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Cannon, R-Utah, outlined for the Senate seven
instances in which he said Clinton obstructed justice. With
easy-to-follow charts, Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., showed a
suggestive sequence of events that he used to support the managers'
case that the president was at the center of a scheme to hide his
affair with Ms. Lewinsky from the Jones lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Central to the obstruction case presented by the House managers
were gifts the president gave to Ms. Lewinsky. They cited Ms.
Lewinsky's testimony that Ms. Currie called her and then came to
her apartment to retrieve them. They also insisted that Ms. Currie
would have done so only at the president's suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers will emphasize that the testimony of Ms.
Lewinsky and Ms. Currie is at odds with the House case and that he
gave Ms. Lewinsky additional gifts on Dec. 28, the day the House
managers assert he plotted with her to conceal the first batch of
gifts. That means, the president's lawyers argued in their brief,
that ``on the very day the president and Ms. Lewinsky were
conspiring to hide the gifts he had already given her, the
president added to the pile. No stretch of logic will support such
an outlandish theory.''
</P>
<P>
   The managers argued that the president's job search for Ms.
Lewinsky was moribund until the president and Jordan learned she
had been subpoenaed in the Jones case. The president's lawyers,
Jordan and Ms. Lewinsky have all said there was no job quid pro
quo.
</P>
<P>
   Another pillar of the House obstruction case was the allegation
that the president engaged in witness-tampering when he asked Ms.
Currie to come to the White House the day after the Jones
deposition and he asked her a series of questions about his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. The managers have essentially
accused Clinton of coaching Ms. Currie, feeding her answers that
were helpful to him and ``corruptly influencing'' her future
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers ridiculed Clinton's testimony that he was
merely trying to refresh his memory with the colloquy, but the
White House will continue to emphasize that Ms. Currie testified
she did not feel influenced in any way. At the time, she was not a
witness in any legal proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Where the two cases diverge most is on whether any of these
charges are impeachable. This is the least legal and most political
of the issues and is being argued against a backdrop in which most
people believe Clinton may have lied but do not believe his actions
warrant removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers, led by the Judiciary Committee chairman,
Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., wrapped up their opening with arguments
that the president's actions amounted to the high crimes and
misdemeanors outlined in the Constitution and required his removal
from office.
</P>
<P>
   Given the murky area of what precisely qualifies as a high
crime, the managers have invoked recent and ancient history and
analogies that are homespun and academic.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's a high crime?'' Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., asked before
the Senate on Saturday. ``How about if an important person hurts
somebody of low means? It's not very scholarly, but I think it's
the truth. I think that's what they meant by high crimes. Doesn't
even have to be a crime. It's just when you start using your office
and you're acting in a way that hurts people, you've committed a
high crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The essence of the White House case will be that none of the
actions alleged by the House are serious enough to warrant removal
of an elected president from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will make the case that the allegations are not supported
by the facts or by the law and that they do not warrant nullifying
the results of a national election and removing the president from
office,'' said Kennedy, the White House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers have asserted in their brief that ``our
system of government does not permit Congress to unseat the
president merely because it disagrees with his behavior or his
policies.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why, they argued, the framers of the Constitution listed
the specific crimes of treason, bribery and other high crimes and
misdemeanors that would allow or require removal from office. House
managers, meanwhile, cited the same history, emphasizing that
perjury was deemed on the same level of seriousness as bribery.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has said that the only acts that would warrant
removal are those that ``are profoundly serious and malevolent'' to
the Constitution. Only offenses against the system of government
qualify, they assert, and the president's offenses, even if proven,
do not rise to that level.
</P>
<P>
   The White House lawyers have argued that the failure of the
House Judiciary Committee in 1974 to include an article on tax
fraud against President Richard Nixon demonstrated that impeachment
should be reserved for official and not personal actions that cause
harm to the country. The House managers have responded that the tax
fraud count was not included only because it was not sufficiently
proven.
</P>
<P>
   The managers asserted that the president's conduct was not
private or personal but affected the workings of the judicial
system. They repeatedly cited the impeachment and removal from
office of Judge Walter L. Nixon Jr. in 1989 for having tried to fix
a case in state court involving the son of a business partner.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers have argued in their filings that the standard
for impeaching a president should be higher than that for a judge
because the president uniquely embodies the head of the executive
branch and can be voted out of office, while an individual judge
has lifetime tenure and does not hold the equivalent role.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Confronted with escalating violence in Kosovo and
an increasing sense that it is almost impossible to halt the
bloodshed, divided NATO ambassadors meeting in Brussels Sunday
night called on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to respect a
ceasefire, but backed off reviving NATO plans from last fall to
bomb Serbian targets in Kosovo and Serbia itself.
</P>
<P>
   The massacre of 45 ethnic Albanian civilians by Serb forces
under the control of Milosevic on Friday refocused Western
attention on Kosovo, but also served to underline the lack of
appetite for the measures needed to halt all-out conflict, Western
diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before NATO ambassadors convened their unusual Sunday
night meeting, fighting broke out in the very village where the
massacre occurred on Friday, forcing Western monitors and mourners
to flee before they could even bury the slain.
</P>
<P>
   NATO condemned the massacre and described it as a ``flagrant
violation of international humanitarian law.'' An alliance
statement stressed that Milosevic must allow investigators from the
International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia to visit
the site, a move that the Yugoslav leader has consistently refused,
and called him ``personally responsible for the behavior of his
security forces.''
</P>
<P>
   A Clinton administration official said the presence of NATO
troops in Kosovo was probably the only way to keep the Serbian
security forces and ethnic Albanian rebels apart, but that this was
an unlikely prospect. There was little interest within the
administration to insist on a NATO presence in Kosovo, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some European NATO allies have also made resolve on Kosovo more
difficult because of growing opinion before the massacre,
particularly in France, that the ethnic Albanian guerrillas were
more to blame for recent outbreaks of violence than the Serbian
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian police and the guerrillas fought in the village of Racak
Sunday where dozens of mutilated bodies, some with gouged eyes and
one decapitated, were found by Western diplomats Saturday morning.
Mortar and machine gun fire erupted from police positions on a hill
above the village and a dozen Serbian armored vehicles were seen by
Western monitors entering the village.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest fear following the massacre is the likelihood of the
Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for the independence of
the Serbian province, seeking retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   This in turn could provoke Milosevic to order a crackdown of
much larger proportions than seen so far, a NATO diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic has seen he can push it very, very far,'' the
diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   The options facing NATO Sunday ranged from the most rigorous _
the reactivation of an order authorizing the use of force _ to
issuing a stern statement of the kind that resulted.
</P>
<P>
   James Steinberg, deputy director of the National Security
Council, said that the administration was satisfied with the NATO
statement and the dispatch of the two top NATO military officials
to see Milosevic in Belgrade. ``We got everything we wanted,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The statement reiterated that the order authorizing the use of
force by NATO's supreme allied commander, Gen. Wesley K. Clark,
still stands from last fall when NATO announced it would strike
Serb targets but then pulled back. Javier Solana, NATO's
secretary-general, has, in fact, been repeating this for the last
several weeks as the Kosovo violence has increased.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Carrying out the order either now or in the near future would
require another vote of the 16 NATO ambassadors, diplomatssaid.
</P>
<P>
   Given the different opinions within NATO as to who is most to
blame for the growing violence of the past three weeks, any
consideration of air strikes was unlikely Sunday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official said Washington remained firm in the
view that Milosevic's forces were mostly responsible for the
conflict in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   There was ``unhappiness'' at the provocative acts taken in the
past few weeks by ``extremists'' in the Kosovo Liberation Army,
including the hostage-taking of Yugsolav Army soldiers as hostages
and the shooting of Serbian policemen, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have not lost perspective of who is at the root cause
of this,'' the official said, referring to Milosevic and his
slash-and-burn offensive last summer and fall that created 250,000
Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The administration, which has traditionally dispatched its
special envoy, Richard C. Holbrooke, to meet with Milosevic in
times of real tensionin the Balkans, publicly slammed Milosevic for
the first time last month as a man who was part of the ``problem''
and not part of the ``solution'' in the region.
</P>
<P>
   NATO decided Sunday night to send Clark and German Gen. Klaus
Naumann, head of the alliance's military committee, to see
Milosevic in Belgrade, probably on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's harsh critique of Milosevic would not deter
Washington from dealing with him, the administration official said.
``Milosevic is the president of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
and the security services follow his directions. If you want to get
things done you have to interact with him. There is not much
choice,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, meanwhile, unleashed a propaganda campaign on Serbian
television, breaking into programs every hour with messages
deriding the West.
</P>
<P>
   A statement by the Serbian president, Milan Milutinovic, a close
ally of Milosevic, was read, accusing the chief Western diplomat in
Kosovo, William Walker, of being ``a liar'' and a ``protector of
terrorists,'' the Serbian way of referring to the ethnic Albanian
rebels. Serbian television also played up support for the Serb
cause from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   A shaken Walker, who served as U.S. ambassador in El Salvador in
the 1980s, said after seeing the Albanian bodies on Saturday that
he had never seen such deliberate carnage and called it a ``crime
very much against humanity.'' He unequivocally blamed the Serb
forces.
</P>
<P>
   The high-decibel denials by the Milosevic regime that its forces
had done anything wrong was particularly disturbing, a U.S.
official said, because it was among several signals that Milosevic
intended to forge ahead with squashing the guerilla insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic believes they're going to do what they want no
matter what anyone says,'' the official said. ``They say that
Kosovo is part of Serbia and they're going to vanquish the Albanian
terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief prosecutor of the international war crimes tribunal in
the Hague, Louise Arbour, reiterated Sunday her intention of going
to Kosovo to investigate the massacre. In the past, she has been
denied all requests for a visa to Kosovo, and Milosevic does not
recognize the authority of the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said they understood Ms. Arbour planned to fly to
Skopje, the capital of Macedonia, on Monday, without a visa and
then drive the short distance to the Kosovo border. There, armed
with NATO's paper demands that she be allowed to investigate the
massacre and be given the names of those who participated in the
killing, she would face Serbian immigration officials who would
have to decide whether to let her in or not.

UCLA-STANFORD WAS LESSON IN BASKETBRAWL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It began as an important Pac-10 clash between
Stanford and UCLA. But early in the evening, a Big East game broke
out.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford beat UCLA 72-59 Saturday in a game that featured all
the notorious ingredients of Big East brawlball. There was enough
clawing, grabbing and holding to last a Pac-10 season. The Bruins
committed 35 fouls, lost five players to disqualifications, and
Stanford shot 49 free throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably the roughest game I've ever played in my
life,'' Cardinal guard David Moseley said. ``That includes
streetball, where you call your own fouls.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA guard Baron Davis, who played Pop Warner football, was
assessed one technical foul and had two verbal exchanges _ one with
the Stanford coaching staff, another with Cardinal guard Art Lee
after what Davis called a ``frustration foul'' in the final
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Why the rough stuff? Coach Steve Lavin's limitless energy and
Davis' natural aggressiveness has dramatically altered UCLA's
psychology this season. The Bruins play harder and tougher than
they have in recent years, and they have the size and depth to
execute the approach. It's working: Opponents are shooting 40
percent from the field, and Stanford committed a season-high 25
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put that energy with that athletic ability, watch
out,'' Cardinal coach Mike Montgomery said.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Bruins must learn to play tough defense without fouling.
Instead of grabbing and holding, they must use their feet and their
heads and sound fundamentals. They have solid depth, with a 10-man
rotation, but no team can survive five disqualifications against
elite competition _ especially on the road. If UCLA plays like that
in Maples Pavilion next month, Stanford might shoot 70 free throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was brutal,'' Montgomery said. ``I've never seen anything
like it. You couldn't dribble.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as in the Big East.
</P>
<P>
   __ Fronting up front: One noticeable difference in UCLA's
defense in recent weeks is the manner it defends opposing big men.
Like Duke, Kansas and other teams that specialize in pressure
defense, the Bruins are using a strategy called fronting the post.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works: Instead of playing on the opponent's
backside and allowing uncontested entry passes into the low post,
UCLA's big men are playing in front of their opponents (ie: on the
ball side).
</P>
<P>
   The technique cuts off entry passes and leaves offenses with one
option: to make a difficult lob pass over the defense and into open
space under the basket. If the defense rotates properly, someone is
waiting for the offensive player when he catches the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin has employed the fronting strategy because freshmen Jerome
Moiso and Dan Gadzuric are steadily improving their footwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's supposed to cut down (the opponent's) comfort zone,''
Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins do not execute with Duke's precision, obviously, but
the change has disrupted opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to apply as much pressure as possible and make teams
play one-on-one,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Swoosh or stripes: Yes, UCLA is a Reebok school. But several
Bruins have Nikes on their feet. Davis and Earl Watson are wearing
Nikes because, they say, the Reebok models hurt their feet.
</P>
<P>
   According to the players, Reebok has been slow to respond to
their requests because the school's contract expires June 30. At
that point, UCLA becomes an Adidas client _ a $19 million client.
</P>
<P>
   __ Tough ticket: Stanford alumnus and Orange County native Tiger
Woods attended the game, but finding tickets was not easy.
</P>
<P>
   Woods called Fox, but the network couldn't help.
</P>
<P>
   He called Stanford, but the alma mater claimed to have no
tickets available. (So much for that $10 million endowment.)
</P>
<P>
   He tried UCLA several times. Sorry.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Woods' management team secured two tickets from an
unknown source, according to a UCLA official, and he sat behind the
Cardinal bench.

EXPERTS GIVE GOOD GRADES TO HOUSE MANAGERS' PRESENTATIONS

<TEXT>
<P>
   After three days of impeachment arguments from the House
managers, constitutional and impeachment experts said the
presentations last week gave the strongest legal arguments yet
against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews over the weekend, the experts _ professors at
law schools around the country _ generally agreed that if the
Republican managers had made legal headway in their case against
the president, it was in subtly shifting the emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Republicans want the question to be is: Did the
president do what is alleged in the articles of impeachment?'' said
Cass Sunstein, a professor of constitutional law at the University
of Chicago Law School. ``If that is the question, they're in better
shape than if the question is: Should the president be removed from
office? I think in the last few days the ball was moved a little
bit in the direction of what the Republicans want the question to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   The legal specialists also said the managers' arguments could be
neutralized when Clinton's lawyers made their case, and noted that
the Senate's decision is likely to be as much political as legal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, nothing was new here, but it was packaged
better,'' said Susan Low Bloch, a professor of constitutional law
at Georgetown University Law Center in Washington. She added, ``It
was rhetorically polished. But I suppose after the president has
had his three days, we'll be back to where we were before.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the experts generally agreed that the managers'
statements were more effective than previous arguments in favor of
impeachment, several said the presentations were far from the
dramatic break the Republicans might need to change the momentum in
the impeachment battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good opening statement in a trial is when you say, `My God!
These people deserve to win,''' said Eric Freedman, a law professor
and expert on impeachment at Hofstra University School of Law.
``That certainly didn't happen here.''
</P>
<P>
   The law professors said the legal quality of the managers'
statements varied widely. But several of them said some of the
managers' statements grappled more seriously with the fundamental
constitutional questions in the case than any prior presentations.
</P>
<P>
   Akhil Reed Amar, a professor of constitutional law at Yale Law
School, said that in arguing that Paula Jones' civil rights might
have been violated by the president, the House managers made the
case that Clinton's acts were ``an assault on the idea of
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a much better job this time of saying it's an assault
on the idea of justice,'' Amar said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunstein said the managers also demonstrated that perjury was an
offense taken very seriously by the nation's courts. Throughout the
debate over Clinton's actions, Sunstein said, some of the
president's supporters have made it appear that, even if Clinton
had committed perjury, that was a mere technical offense.
</P>
<P>
   Sunstein said it has not been established that Clinton did
commit perjury. But he said the managers demonstrated that the
question of whether Clinton lied under oath was an important one,
not just for the impeachment debate but for the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they showed,'' he said, ``is that perjury is an extremely
serious offense and if the president perjured himself _ and if
people think that's OK _ then there's a real problem for the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Ackerman, a Yale authority on impeachment law who
presented testimony before the House Judiciary Committee against
impeaching Clinton, also praised some of the House presentations.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman said the presentations had not changed his view of the
case against Clinton. But he singled out the statement of Rep.
Charles Canady, R-Fla., as one of the first that, as he put it,
``raised the level of constitutional argument.''
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman and other legal scholars have argued that
constitutional law and history make it clear that a president
should be removed from office only for misdeeds concerning the
functioning of government. The Constitution's declaration that a
president can be impeached for ``high crimes and misdemeanors,''
they have said, refers to such presidential actions as abuse of
official power, not lies to cover-up a sexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman said Sunday that Canady presented an argument to depart
from that legal tradition. In his statement, Canady argued that the
Senate's power to remove a president should not be narrowly
defined. Instead, Canady said, the removal power ``should be
understood as a positive grant of authority to the Senate to
preserve, protect and strengthen our constitutional system against
the misconduct of federal officials when the misconduct would
subvert, undermine or weaken the institutions of our government.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate adopted that position in Clinton's case, Ackerman
said, that would represent an important change in the understanding
of the law of impeachment. He said he strongly disagreed with
Canady's argument, but added, ``After many, many hours of
repetitive rehearsal of the arguments, we had a guy standing up
there trying to speak to a fundamental issue. I say: Good job,
Charles Canady.''
</P>
<P>
   Several experts said the most important presentation by the
House managers was their analysis of impeachment cases involving
federal judges. Because there has been only one prior Senate trial
of a president _ Andrew Johnson _ the cases involving judges are
being carefully parsed by both sides. One case involved Walter
Nixon Jr., a federal judge who was impeached for lying about
whether he had used his influence to have a prosecutor dismiss drug
charges that had been filed against the son of a friend of the
judge.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the experts said the Constitution suggests that
judges and presidents are not subject to the same rules in
impeachment proceedings, but, even if they were, Bloch of
Georgetown said, the cases of Nixon and other impeached judges
would not necessarily dictate a conclusion that Clinton should be
removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   In several of the cases mentioned by the House managers, some of
the experts noted, the judges had already been convicted of federal
felonies but were still on the government payroll when their
impeachment cases came to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   That, Bloch and other experts said, was a distinction from the
case of Clinton. There is still debate about whether Clinton would,
if charged, be convicted of perjury or obstruction of justice under
the technical requirements of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Bloch, who said she did not favor removing Clinton, acknowledged
that the judicial cases raised a legal issue the president's
lawyers will have to counter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been judges impeached and convicted for things that
looked sort of personal,'' Bloch said. ``That has a ring to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts went even further, describing the judicial cases as
among the most persuasive legal arguments yet in the impeachment
battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are precedents,'' said Roger Cramton, a professor at
Cornell University Law School who is an expert on impeachment law.
``Clearly, Congress has, and could, consider perjury _ for any
reason _ as an impeachable offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Cramton, who was a member of a federal commission studying
judicial impeachment law, said he thought the case for removing
Clinton was strong.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the House managers changed minds or not, some of the
professors said, several of the managers presented provocative
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tried to connect the dots and offer a coherent
narrative,'' said Amar of Yale, ``and frankly, I thought they did a
much better job than we had seen before.''

DENVER HURDLES THE JETS AND RUSHES BACK TO THE SUPER BOWL
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ For more than half of Sunday's American Football
Conference championship game, the Jets could see all the way to
Miami and the Super Bowl, the game that they had helped turn into
one of the biggest spectacles in sports 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But in a 10-minute splurge after halftime, the Denver Broncos,
the defending Super Bowl champions, rallied for 20 points and
defeated the Jets by 23-10 to earn the trip to Super Bowl XXXIII on
Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The victory by the high-powered Broncos was not a surprise, but
their Super Bowl opponent is: the Atlanta Falcons, who shocked the
heavily favored Minnesota Vikings for the National Conference
championship, winning by 30-27 in overtime in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons _ led by a coach, Dan Reeves, who had heart bypass
surgery a month ago _ will play in the Super Bowl for the first
time in their 33-year history, and will again be underdogs, this
time to the Broncos, Reeves' former team.
</P>
<P>
   On the best of days it would have been difficult for the Jets to
halt a Denver team that had won 18 straight games at Mile High
Stadium, and which knew that this could have been 38-year-old
quarterback John Elway's last home game. But the Jets, who led by
10-0 early in the second half, could not overcome their mistakes:
six turnovers, including four lost fumbles, and a botched kickoff
that set up a Denver field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Terrell Davis once again led the Broncos, rushing
for 167 yards and a touchdown. For the Jets, Curtis Martin gained
just 14 yards on 13 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Elway, who won his fifth AFC championship in his 16th season and
is expected to announce his retirement after the Super Bowl, was
not at his best, completing 13 of 34 passes for 173 yards. But his
11-yard touchdown pass to Howard Griffith in the third quarter
started the Denver comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, how sweet, and how near it had seemed for more than half
the game for the Jets, who had become symbols of football failure
following their Super Bowl moment 30 years ago. This was their
first appearance in a championship game since 1982, when they lost
to Miami 14-0.
</P>
<P>
   All the surprising good things they had accomplished this
season, in winning the American East Division title, seemed to be
gaining even more momentum. They had the lead despite losing the
ball a few times.
</P>
<P>
   But even as they came apart near the end, with Vinny Testaverde
intercepted for the only time in the game after starting it with 13
straight completions, it was apparent that the franchise had gone
into a new era. It just wasn't going to Miami just yet.
</P>
<P>
   The sole score in the first half was John Hall's 32-yard field
goal as time expired, and it was positioned, in a mistake-filled
half, by a Broncos penalty on a punt. That put the Jets in good
field position after they had misfired repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   The game's opening drive _ which took place in a foot-stomping
atmosphere which threatened to shake the looming Rockies, and also
with wind gusts that hit 32 mph and sent flags snapping to
attention _ ended with a failed 42-yard field-goal attempt by Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets had other chances on offense and failed, while their
defense held the Broncos, the American Conference's most powerful
offense, to small gains.
</P>
<P>
   On one Jets drive, Martin fumbled and lost the ball. It was the
second straight playoff game in which he had done so, after a
regular season in which he lost the ball once in 369 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Another drive stopped when Keith Byars lost the ball after
catching Testaverde's 13th straight completion.
</P>
<P>
   The game plan of the Jets defensive coach, Bill Belichick,
seemed to have anticipated much of the Broncos' offense. Elway did
not have a completion in his first three drives. The Jets took away
the middle, double-teamed dangerous tight end Shannon Sharpe and
did not seem concerned about Elway throwing the ball deep.
</P>
<P>
   The defense also batted down three Elway passes in the opening
half, while Chad Cascadden sacked him once. Davis amassed 75 yards
on 14 carries in the half, but Elway, remarkably, completed only 4
of 14 passes for 33 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde, though, connected on 17 of 26 attempts for 217
yards. He connected with Wayne Chrebet 5 times for 86 yards.
Martin, the focus, naturally, of the Broncos' front seven, was held
to 11 yards on 8 rushing attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, early in the second half, the Broncos heard their first
boos _ for all anyone knows, their first of the season here _ when
they went three-and-out and Tom Rouen launched a 29-yard punt.
</P>
<P>
   Two drives later, a Jets rookie tight end named Blake Spence,
who had not even put on a uniform for 10 straight games, loomed out
of obscurity to block a punt that Fred Baxter recovered to put the
Jets only 1 yard out. One play later, Martin found the end zone,
and the Jets led, 10-0.
</P>
<P>
   But just as suddenly, Elway and the Broncos discovered their
quick-strike heritage. It took 93 seconds, included a 47-yard
strike from Elway to Ed McCaffrey _ who earlier had dropped two
passes _ and ended with an 11-yard touchdown toss to Howard
Griffith.
</P>
<P>
   And then the Jets' turnovers finally cost them points. Elam's
kickoff, held by the wind, bounced in front of the returner, David
Meggett. The Jets' James Farrior tried to snare it, but fumbled it
away to Keith Traylor on the Jets' 32.
</P>
<P>
   That led to a 44-yard field goal by Elam to tie the score at
10-10. Soon, again helped by good field position, Elam cut through
the dangerous winds for a 48-yard field and a 13-10 lead, Denver's
first of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly inexorable turnaround continued later in the third
quarter when Davis, who came in averaging 145 yards a post-season
game in his career, churned out a 31-yard touchdown run. It
extended the lead to 20-10 with 18 seconds left in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets soon were in a hole again. Alex Van Dyke, a seldom-used
wide receiver, fumbled after catching a pass, the fourth time in
the game the Jets lost the ball.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Win or lose, the Jets' appearance here was nothing short of
remarkable. The last time the Jets played in Denver they opened the
1996 season believing there was a new era with Neil O'Donnell at
quarterback. By season's end the Jets were 1-15, the opening-game
loss, by 41-6, a perfect precursor of how badly things would go.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells joined the team for the following season, and after
that the Jets charted a different course. Their East Division title
was their first such crown in 30 years. Their playoff run included
their first post-season victory since 1986, and first playoff game
since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells on Sunday became the first coach in the NFL to take a
third club to a conference championship game; he also is the only
coach in Jets history to have a winning record in his first season,
let alone his second. The Jets' 21-11 record the last two regular
seasons is sixth-best in the league over that span. It is also
better than any other team in the American Conference East.
</P>
<P>
   The team that Parcells has shaped _ there was a bit of whipping
into shape, too _ may have absorbed the cornerstone of his
philosophy: Until you understand what it is that causes you to
lose, you will never understand how to win. In other words, avoid
dumb plays, fumbles, mental errors. The Jets did none of those
things on Sunday.

 &HT;    Out from the realm of improbability, Falcon's win `so
unbelievable'
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Thirty-three years in the football business, and
finally Taylor Smith got to stand on a podium and be handed a
trophy. Thirty-three years of working various jobs in the family
shop, from locker-room attendant to team president, and here was
the payoff, so dearly deferred.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we hadn't thought this day would come, we wouldn't have
been it,'' Smith said, speaking for his long-suffering father, dead
15 months now. ``But sometimes you wondered.''
</P>
<P>
   Their audience had stopped wondering. Their audience simply knew
that everything this franchise tried would blow up like a trick
cigar. How could such an unassuming organization come to be so
cursed? What football gods had the callow Falcons affronted?
</P>
<P>
   And then, from beyond the blue, there came an enchanted season
when all curses became blessings, when every single wrong turned
absolutely right. ``It's destiny,'' said Chuck Smith, the defensive
end. ``It's got to be.''
</P>
<P>
   A kicker who hasn't missed anything all year fluffs the
clincher. An offense that can't be stopped manages seven points on
its last 10 possessions. A coach steers his team through an
excruciating championship game 34 days after having his chest cut
open. The Atlanta Falcons go to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``So unbelievable,'' Dan Reeves said. He sat in a Metrdome
cubbyhole, pulling off his socks but mostly staring at the floor.
``It makes you so humble and so proud in one swift motion.'' He
looked up. ``I don't have the words. I'm not very good with
words.''
</P>
<P>
   For everything this NFC title game was _ frustrating,
fulfilling, draining, uplifting _ there was about the improbable
victors a mood that transcended exultation. After seeing Randy Moss
burn and fizzle, after watching Gary Anderson miss his kick and
Morten Andersen make his, the Falcons seemed to grasp that this
championship wasn't just for the team that won it but for all those
Falcon assemblages that hadn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought much about getting to the Super Bowl,'' said
Chuck Smith, who forced the Randall Cunningham fumble that changed
this game. ``Deion (Sanders) and Andre (Rison) _ they had to go
elsewhere to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But now one precedent has been broken, another set: It is
possible to be a Falcons player and reach the Super Bowl. It is
possible for wearers of this uniform to do surpassing things. Chris
Chandler turned into Johnny Unitas. Ronnie Harris, cut by Seattle
in November, caught a vital pass. Eugene Robinson, who can't run,
broke up a throw to Moss, who assuredly can. Said defensive tackle
Shane Dronett, released by Detroit two summers ago: ''Unbelievable,
isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   It is, and it isn't. Fortune favors the prepared, but this much
good fortune on the heels of so much bad? ``All the things I've
been taught, from the seventh grade on,'' Reeves said. ``About how
you keep working. About doing the fundamental things. About a bunch
of guys coming together and sacrificing for one another...''
</P>
<P>
   He stopped. Every bromide had just been made real. The Atlanta
Falcons were NFC champions. Said Dan Reeves, describing the
indescribable. ``It just blows you away.''

 &HT;    Chandler, Falcons tough birds
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Let me savor the moment. Can it be real, or am I
giddy in the head? It must be true, for they're dancing in
Peachtree Street back home, they tell me. I trust Atlanta isn't
burning again.
</P>
<P>
   Let me try to run it through my mind one more time: The Falcons
are going to the Super Bowl. That's the Atlanta Falcons,
understand. Thirty-third year in the National Football League, 33rd
Super Bowl. There seems to be the fine hand of destiny here.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons of Ernie Wheelwright. Of Junior Miller. Of Randy
Johnson, first quarterback. Gary Barnes, who scored the first
touchdown. Of Tom Pridemore. Of Greg Brezina. Of Dave Hampton. Just
think of them, all those guys who passed through those grungy
uniforms and left some of the best days of their lives behind, with
no glory. And Hecker, Van Brocklin, Campbell, Glanville and Jones,
all those coaches who couldn't get it done before. Through all
those dismal years, when the Falcons became the national bird of
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   For years, they had company. The Braves were just as futile.
They ran through managers like an embezzler runs through money.
They changed owners. But nothing changed until Ted Turner turned
baseball over to baseball people. Now the Braves are a symbol of
nouveau prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Falcons wallowed behind. Leeman Bennett had them
within a few minutes of a championship game one time, but they were
steamrolled by Dallas. The Cowboys scored 20 points in the last
quarter, on the Falcons' own ground. Same score then as this score
that shall be hallowed forever: 30-27. The last time there was an
overtime in one of these championships, Denver topped Cleveland.
Dan Reeves was the winning coach. Same score: 30-27.
</P>
<P>
   This was not supposed to happen. They didn't have to beat
Minnesota to be adored. Look at all the joy they had brought to
their people. Winning 14 games of 16 and bringing the missing
persons back to their seats in the Georgia Dome. Just ``being
here,'' as they say, was enough to feed the flock. Here was a coach
with a heart on rehab. Here's a quarterback who's the target of
every defense. Get Chris Chandler out of the game, the Falcons are
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there is the noise for which the Metrodome is notorious.
They were testing the sound system before the game, ``Referee mike
check, one, two, three ...'' It rattled your earbones. Vikings
players shamelessly stand on the field waving their arms like
cheerleaders when the other team has the ball. They should wear
skirts and join the dancing girls.
</P>
<P>
   Well, ``noise'' turned out to be seriously over-valued. The
price took a big drop in the Metrodome on Sunday. Once Chandler
tied the game on his goal-line pass to Terance Mathis, the voices
lost some of their peal. And as the Falcons were making the drive
to the winning field goal, thousands of noise-makers were leaving
their pews, looking neither right nor left, jaws set like the
condemned walking the last mile. It's fun to see the suffering in
another precinct when it has been part of your autumn life since
Lyndon Johnson was president.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Falcons and Vikings tried to give the game away. What
gave you a hint that this might be a better than common day for the
Falcons was the first possession. They drove the ball from kickoff
to end zone in a tedious set of 15 plays. The Vikings came back
like a rocket, like all the football scientists had said they
would. In two minutes, 48 seconds they were on the board, as
foreseen, on a pass from Randall Cunningham to Randy Moss.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Morten Andersen kicked the winning field goal, all
that was lost in the warp of time. Moss was never a real factor
thereafter. Gary Anderson missed his first field goal this season.
I never knew there could be so much difference between an ``o'' and
an ``e'' in an Anderson's name.
</P>
<P>
   If there is to be one hero raised above all others in this, let
it be Chandler, who came to us like an orphan left on a doorstep.
``Journeyman'' was stamped all over him, moved about like a gypsy
quarterback, never in one place for long. He has survived injury
and critique, and attempts to take his head off. Twice he limped
off and twice he came back and never did he give an inch of ground.
</P>
<P>
   He is one tough sonofagun, which pretty much represents what
these Falcons are.

 &HT;    Chandler's part in `all or nothing' play a big score
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ More than a decade ago, Dan Reeves watched in
disbelief as Denver quarterback John Elway drove the Broncos 98
yards for a game-tying touchdown in the final seconds, forcing
overtime in the 1987 AFC Championship Game at Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Reeves watched his latest pupil, Atlanta quarterback
Chris Chandler, lead the Falcons 71 yards in only 1:18 to tie
Minnesota 27-27 with 49 seconds remaining, forcing overtime in the
NFC Championship Game in the Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   And, like the Broncos, the Falcons reached the Super Bowl with a
game-winning field goal in overtime in the 30-27 upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Chris after we went down there and tied the score, that
it ranked right up there with any of the big-time quarterbacks,''
Reeves said. ``He's done it with the pressure on him. When we
signed him, I talked to him and told him we're going to stick our
neck out to sign him because I thought he could win a Super Bowl
for us. Now he's one game away from doing that, and I think he's
good enough to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler threw for 340 yards and three touchdowns on 27-of-43
passing against the Vikings, who stacked the line of scrimmage with
as many as eight players to stop tailback Jamal Anderson, who
rushed for only 67 yards on 23 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler, in his second season with the Falcons after a
journey-man career that included stops with five other teams, was a
steadying force for Atlanta in its final drive of regulation,
completing four of six attempts for 56 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler's biggest completion in the series was a 29-yarder to
Ronnie Harris on a corner route. Chandler's 16-yard touchdown to
Terance Mathis five plays later came after a tipped pass was nearly
intercepted by safety Robert Griffith in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a do-or-die thing,'' Chandler said. ``It was all or
nothing. In a way, it makes it easier because you know you have to
score a touchdown. You don't have to worry about it being third or
fourth down, you've just got to make the plays. You get so wrapped
up in the game that you don't actually think about what is
happening.''

   Chandler's play in overtime was even bigger. He opened Atlanta's
second series of the extra session by completing two long passes to
tight end O.J. Santiago to move to the Minnesota 48. On
second-and-6 at the Vikings' 44, he hit Mathis with a seven-yard
pass. On first down, Chandler gained seven yards on a keeper. After
three runs by Anderson, Morten Andersen nailed the game-winning
38-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``All week, we'd been hearing about how they were going to stop
our running game and beat us,'' Chandler said. ``I think Terance
and Tony (Martin) and O.J. took it personally. I know I did. We've
been making big plays with our passing game all year. I think to
overlook our passing game is a mistake.''

 &HT;    A drive toward victory
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The opposing quarterback is sacked and fumbles
just before halftime, your team scores a touchdown on the next play
and suddenly the game's not a blowout, anymore. A safety just
missed an interception, the heretofore perfect placekicker suddenly
becomes imperfect, and there you are. Still hanging around.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all we had to do was hang around,'' Falcons tackle Bob
Whitfield said with a sweaty smile Sunday. ``You know the saying:
If you let a dog hang around long enough, sooner or later he's
gonna bite you in the butt.''
</P>
<P>
   A miracle season appeared over for the Falcons with just over
two minutes remaining in their NFC championship game against
Minnesota. The Vikings led 27-20 and Gary Anderson, who had made 37
straight field goals this season, was lined up for a clinching
38-yarder.
</P>
<P>
   What followed was the biggest sign of fate the Falcons franchise
has ever experienced: Anderson missed, giving Atlanta one final
chance to tie the game and send it into overtime. ``When he missed
that, our sideline erupted as if we had just won the game,''
quarterback Chris Chandler said. ``That excitement just carried
over into the huddle on the next drive.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver had a ``Drive.'' San Francisco had a ``Drive.'' Now the
Falcons can embrace their own moment.
</P>
<P>
   They began a possession at their own 29-yard line with 2:09
remaining. Eight plays and 1:18 later, the game was tied after
Chandler threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to Terance Mathis. From
beginning to end was a string of improbabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a magical thing _ fate, destiny, all that stuff,''
Chandler said.
</P>
<P>
   It started quietly, Chandler hitting fullback Brian Kozlowski
for a two-yard gain, leading into the two-minute warning. On second
down, Chandler, from a shotgun formation, connected with Mathis for
9 yards down the right sideline. Before the catch, Mathis was still
thinking about a touchdown pass he dropped earlier in the fourth
quarter that would've cut Minnesota's lead to 27-24.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have an opportunity to make plays, you have to take
advantage of it,'' he said. ``I let the guys down.''
</P>
<P>
   On first down from the Falcons' 40, it was Ronnie Harris's turn.
Harris, who was signed in mid-season after being released by
Seattle, found himself the centerpiece of the next play, finding a
seam in the Vikings' zone defense on a corner rout and making a
catch just in front of Vikings strong safety Robert Griffith for a
29-yard gain to the Vikings' 31 with 1:48 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping we'd call that play _ it worked great in
practice,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler tried to go back to Harris on the next play but it was
near disaster. The pass was tipped, blooped over the receiver and
Griffth dove and just missed an interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see that,'' said center Robbie Tobeck, ``your heart
drops into your stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   Second and 10 from the Minnesota 31. Chandler drops back, sees
his receivers covered and scrambles 9 yards. He's belted by Vikings
linebacker Dwayne Rudd and comes up limping. ``No big deal,'' he
says later.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's only 1:27 remaining but the Metrodome is getting
quiet. On the third and one from the 22, Chandler hands the ball to
Jamal Anderson, who starts over left tackle, then bounces outside
and runs 6 yards for the first down. ``I felt like I could break
that thing and take it to the house,'' Anderson recalled.
</P>
<P>
   No problem. The Falcons were at the Vikings' 16 with 1:15 left.
On first down, the Falcons ran a play called, ``78-wing-8-Y6.''
Translation: Mathis was to line up wide right and run a post route.
No Viking followed Mathis, but Chandler's pass was tipped by
cornerback Corey Fuller, and Griffith again had a potential
interception bounce off his finger tips.
</P>
<P>
   On second down with 57 seconds left, the Falcons came back with
the same play. This time Chandler was pressured. But as he
scrambled, Mathis crossed over the middle into an opening. Chandler
drilled a pass that Mathis caught as he dropped to his knees for
the tying TD with 49 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to make the play,'' Mathis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tend to compare a lot of things to golf,'' Chandler said.
``A lot of times when the other guy has a two-foot putt and you
have to make a miracle shot from the rough, you make the shot.
You're not thinking about first downs and all that stuff. You're
just thinking, 'We have to score a touchdown.' ``

 &HT;    Dome thunders, gives way to sudden silence
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ They'd surrounded themselves with giant stereo
speakers during practices, lodged mild complaints with the NFL, and
generally made enough noise about noise it almost could have been a
separate section in the playbook.
</P>
<P>
   But when all was loudly said and done Sunday, the Atlanta
Falcons had found the best way imaginable around the Minnesota
Vikings' supposed earsplitting home-field advantage: They beat
them. And the loyal band of Atlanta fans who'd followed them here
to the so-called ``Thunderdome'' finally got to have the last word.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a half hour had passed since veteran kicker Morten
Andersen's 38-yard field goal iced a thrilling overtime victory for
the Falcons and still some 50 fans couldn't bring themselves to
leave the field-level seats they'd clambered down to almost as soon
as the ball sailed through the uprights. Chanting ``Super Bowl!
Super Bowl!'', brandishing signs reading ``Miami Bound,'' and in
one case, waving a giant Falcons flag, they stared almost
unbelievingly at the field where only a few local TV reporters
solemnly filed reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``After everything that was said about the noise, I don't think
(quarterback Chris) Chandler was affected one bit,'' said Jimmie
Ann Davis, as her husband and two adult children found themselves
exchanging high-fives with whooping strangers clad in the suddenly
hip Falcons red-and-black. ``And if he was, he somehow pulled it
off anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few hours earlier, it never would have seemed possible.
Then, it was nearly impossible to pick out the Atlanta fans, so
overwhelming was the presence of Vikings fans both inside and
outside the Metrodome. Their hair or beards dyed purple, their
horned helmets accessorized with long yarn braids or fake swords,
they wore their Vikings player jerseys with nearly as much
confidence as the sense that their famed loudness would somehow
carry the day.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? The previous week, the vanquished Arizona Cardinals
had claimed it was too loud inside the Dome for them to possibly
audible plays _ let alone win a playoff game. Meanwhile, the local
media had spent the past few days pooh-poohing Falcons coach Dan
Reeves' complaints about the Dome's supposedly dangerous noise
level, and then _ oops! _ sort of confirming the problem. One
newspaper, the St. Paul Pioneer-Press, reported that noise levels
reached 128.4 decibels during last Sunday's playoff game against
the Arizona Cardinals, equivalent to the sound of a jet on takeoff
and some 43 decibels above where OSHA regulations begin to take
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, longtime Vikings fans said it was all just so much,
um, talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a dome; Atlanta's got a dome,'' said Rick Lewis, who
was one of four ``Mossheads'' here from Moose Lake, Minn., some 100
miles to the north.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing horned helmets covered with remarkably fresh-looking
2-week-old grass _ one of their party, a mortician, confessed it
was the stuff used on top of graves _ they were paying homage to
Vikings phenomenal rookie receiver Randy Moss. ``The Falcons ought
to be able to take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe they should just have ``taken it'' like Lewis' cohort
Ray Arnold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earplugs,'' Arnold confided, lifting his helmet to reveal
serious looking stoppers stuffed into both ears. ``I may be a
`Mosshead,' but I'm not an idiot.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, he'd been here before. For two hours before the game
began, music and announcements blared out of the Dome at
unbelievably high levels, exhorting fans to ``SHOW YOUR PURPLE
PRIDE!'' Once the game began, Minnesota fans, players and stadium
staff all conspired to raise the noise level whenever the opposing
team was trying to do anything but hide in the showers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even hear the music anymore,'' said onetime Marietta
resident Stephen Anderson, a diehard Minnesota fan who was sitting
about halfway up the stadium in front of the press box. ``I took
two aspirin before I came here. I should have brought along the
bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, maybe the Falcons fans were just tougher. You manage
to grab a $125 ticket and enough warm clothes to withstand a
game-time temperature of 32 degrees, said Atlantan Traci Cameron,
and the prospect of hearing nothing but ringing for the next few
days was no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   When it was done, tens of thousands of Vikings fans headed for
their cars and dreams of what nearly was. Said one, Plymouth,
Minn., resident Jim Miller, softly:
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard it so quiet here.

 &HT;    Mortensen kicks it off
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Morten Andersen played on teams so bad with the
New Orleans Saints in the 1980s, that he was widely considered the
teams' best player. It was a distinction, however, that spoke more
to Andersen's skill than the Aints' ineptness. And although mired
in the Bayou abyss, Andersen still managed to establish himself as
the premier kicker in the game, one who performed in the clutch
with icy perfection.
</P>
<P>
   So, considering Anderson's background, it should come as no
surprise that when the time came for the 17-year NFL veteran to
boot the Falcons into the Super Bowl _ and to erase the memories of
the bad old days _ he approached it with business-as-usual calm.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just another kick,'' Andersen said.
</P>
<P>
   He was talking about the way he approached it, not its
magnitude. Someone had the audacity to ask Andersen if it was the
most important field goal he'd ever kicked. ''Come on,'' he said.
''For the Super Bowl? You've got to be kidding. It's been 17 years
for me. After so long, you kind of think that you might not ever
get that chance. But one of the attributes of a kicker is to be
patient. I've been patient.''
</P>
<P>
   He was patiently watching and pacing as quarterback Chris
Chandler directed the Falcons from their 9 yard line in overtime.
When Chandler hit O.J. Santiago for a 26-yard gain, Atlanta was in
Minnesota territory _ and close to Andersen territory. Finally, on
third down, coach Dan Reeves sent in the field goal unit.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings burned a timeout in an attempt to freeze Andersen.
But how can you freeze ice? All it did was give Andersen more time
to visualize the celebration that was to come.
</P>
<P>
   He and punter/holder Dan Stryzinski went through their usual
pre-kick routine, which means they did not say much.
</P>
<P>
   ''Another day at the office,'' Stryzinski said. ''I knew he
would get it done. He's the best clutch kicker in the game. And I'm
not lying.''
</P>
<P>
   Andersen not only made the 38-yarder to win the game; he drilled
it. ''Right down the pike,'' he said. It touched off a celebration
on the Metrodome field that was sustained and unrestrained.
</P>
<P>
   ''What a great team effort,'' Andersen said. ''This was a game
and a kick that gives me some closure. Big time.''
</P>
<P>
   At 38, Andersen said he does not know if he'll play an 18th
season. Like the basketball player from Chicago who retired last
week, Andersen has conquered his sport. Individually, he's been
consistently reliable over the years, with bad teams, not so bad
and now with a Super Bowl team.
</P>
<P>
   His kick Sunday gave him 26 game-winners, which is phenomenal
considering how awful most of the teams he played with were. Unlike
Jordan, however, Andersen does not have a championship ring. But,
thanks to his left foot, he has a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's all you can ask,'' he said. ''It's an honor to play in
the Super Bowl. I know _ after 17 years _ how hard it is to get
there. It's unbelievable to finally get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, he got into the position of hero on Gary Anderson's
only missed field goal of the season, with 2:07 left in regulation.
Chandler deftly took the Falcons down the field for the game-tying
and overtime-forcing TD.
</P>
<P>
   Not much later, Andersen got his turn. ''One kick doesn't define
you,'' said Andersen, who also had field goals of 27 and 24 yards.
''The ramifications on that last kick are huge. The unit did its
job. All I had to do was do my job, let my skill take over. ... And
now, after all this time, I'm going to the Super Bowl.''

 &HT;    Elder Falcons `never stopped fighting for it'
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ He's been with the Falcons the longest, which
means he's suffered the most, which means Jessie Tuggle will enjoy
the trip to Miami the best. But even in the euphoric aftermath of
the Falcons' overtime victory, something was missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to hug and kiss my wife and my kids,'' Tuggle
said. ``I can't wait to do that. They've been with me through all
the years. They've kept me going. I want to enjoy this with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The 12 years of service Tuggle has put in with the Falcons were
worth experiencing the joy of Sunday. Going into this season, the
teams Tuggle played admirably with had a cumulative record of _
hold your nose _ 64-111. Seldom was there any hope for anything
like this season: 14-2 regular season, playoff victory over nemesis
San Francisco at home, NFC Championship Game victory on the road
over record-setting Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   So, excuse Tuggle as he relishes the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud,'' he said. ``This is a long time coming. I've been
around here a long time, but I never stopped wishing for this,
never stopped fighting for it. And now that it's here, it's hard to
put into words.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Falcons arrived here Friday, Tuggle talked boldly about
the Falcons' chances. Sunday, he was not through.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came here to win,'' he said. ``We weren't going to quit.
We've faced adversity all year long, but we always overcame it.
Now, we're going to Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Tuggle offered the first prognostication of what promises
to be many from pundits and fans alike. ``And we're not finished
yet,'' he said. ``We're going to win this thing, too. We're not
going to Miami just to show up.''
</P>
<P>
   Tight end O.J. Santiago, who made two significant catches in the
game-winning drive, said he's been to Miami once in his life. ``But
not like this,'' he said. ``I'm only in my second year, and I feel
great about it. So you know how Jessie must feel. Hey, I know what
it's like to struggle. I played on a college team (at Kent State)
that won five games in four years. I know what it's like to think
every year you're rebuilding, that you're going to turn it around.
And it doesn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I know this moment is very special to Jesse. Twelve years
he's been here with a team that was struggling. Now he's going to
the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They said all week that we couldn't play with Minnesota,''
said Tuggle, who had a team-high 11 tackles. ``We're a team with no
superstars. But we showed the nation what we're about.''
</P>
<P>
   What they are about is the very elements that Tuggle possesses:
grit, perseverance and will.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not all about raw talent,'' said defensive tackle Chuck
Smith, who's suffered with the Falcons for seven years. ``I've been
in a lot of battles with this team over the years. I look into
every guys' eyes before the game. I could see we were ready. We
kept fighting. Now, we're proud of ourselves.''

 &HT;    Vikings loss `is going to hurt for a while'
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ It was not the losing. It was the method. The
toast of the NFC, the most multifaceted offense in the game today,
collapsed upon itself like a fourth-grader that forgot his lines in
the school play.
</P>
<P>
   ''This,'' nose tackle Jason Fisk said, ''is going to hurt for a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota Vikings lost a game they had been dominating
Sunday, fiddled away a 10-point lead in the last 13:41. Randy Moss,
the NFL's Next Great Thing, caught only once pass the whole second
half. Randall Cunningham, one of the season's great stories,
completed just four of his final 11 passes and played the overtime
as in a fog.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than even attempt to score in the last 49 seconds of
regulation, owing two time outs and needing some 50 yards to give
the game's most consistent kicker a chance to win, the Vikings gave
it up. Cunningham kneeled down with the third down snap to let time
run out. Incredible.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thing I'm disappointed in is the lead we had,'' Moss said.
''Our explosive offense didn't let it happen. As a whole, I'm
feeling kind of low.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings locker room was a morgue afterward. Running back
Robert Smith walked as in total body cramp, due to knee and thigh
bruises. Linebackers Dixon Edwards, Ed McDaniel and Bobby Houston
were all knocked out of the game. Minnesota scored just seven
points in the final 37:44 of play. It had committed the offsides
penalties _ four offsides, one enroachment _ that opponents at the
Metrodome usually make.
</P>
<P>
   They might have had everything going for them, but the Minnesota
Vikings eventually had nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not easy,'' cornerback Jimmy Hitchcock said. ''It's not
easy for anybody. We knew we were going to win the whole thing. We
felt we were the best team.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a solid season,'' coach Dennis Green said. ''It wasn't
the great season we really wanted. I think all of our guys are
feeling the way they should feel.''
</P>
<P>
   What had been a season of celebration for Cunningham ended with
him having to explain away an awkward conclusion. He completed nine
of his first 10 passes and by early in the fourth quarter was
25-for-37 for 266 yards with a pair of touchdowns. Then the Vikings
fell silent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we tightened up,'' Cunningham said. ''I think we
didn't make the plays that we needed to make at the end,
offensively and defensively. You can't really look at one play and
say that of we had done this. ... It's a game of inches and a game
of timing and at the end, we just didn't have what we needed to get
the ball in the end zone. They did at the end and they won the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Atlanta played a perfect game,'' tight end Andrew Glover said.
''They came in with a game plan and they stuck to it. I think we
got a little excited in the end when we couldn't make it happen.''

 &HT;    Botha fight exposes a rusty `Iron Mike'
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ In the best-case scenario for Mike Tyson,
consecutive losses to Evander Holyfield and a dramatic career slide
in this decade have taught him that giving his ring techniques an
overhaul is mandatory if he hopes to get back into the title
picture.
</P>
<P>
   There's only one problem. Francois Botha is exhibit ``A'' that
those same losses to Holyfield taught everybody else something,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Botha, a light-punching, soft-bellied heavyweight, mimicked the
heavyweight champion in his fight against Tyson Saturday night at
the MGM Grand. He didn't crumble at the thought of Tyson's vicious
right hand. He jabbed and moved away every time Tyson telegraphed a
punch. He tied him up whenever Tyson got close, showing no concern
for Tyson's inside skills, then beat him to the punch on the break.
Botha beat Tyson to the punch?
</P>
<P>
   ``I really expected more from him,'' the South African said.
</P>
<P>
   All Tyson proved in his latest comeback fight was he still has
the ability to be a one-punch wonder when a mediocre opponent gets
careless. Trailing by a wide margin on points, Tyson dropped Botha
with a right hand with 11 seconds remaining in the fifth round.
When Botha didn't make it up before referee Richard Steele's
10-count, Tyson had his first victory in two years and four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to improve _ I've got a long way to go,'' said Tyson,
who through four rounds won only one round combined on the cards of
the three judges. ``I wanted to shine tonight, but it takes time.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's last visit to the MGM was not pleasant. He was
disqualified for biting Holyfield's ears in their title rematch
June 28, 1997, and had his license revoked. The bout ended with
Tyson going bonkers in the ring and a near melee breaking out
between the two camps.
</P>
<P>
   The Botha bout picked up where that one left off. Botha used his
jab with surprising effectiveness in the first round. But as the
round ended and the two were in a clinch, Tyson attempted to twist
Botha's arm (''I told the ref, 'He's trying to break my arm.''')
and Botha responded by throwing an overhand right after the bell.
Tyson fired back, and when Steele was unable to separate the two,
camp members from both corners and security personnel leaped into
the ring in an attempt to restore order. There was a delay of
several minutes before the fight continued.
</P>
<P>
   Steele apparently began to focus on Tyson, because he deducted a
point from him early in the second round for the repeat holding
foul. That infuriated Tyson. For the next two rounds, he seemed
puzzled how to penetrate the defenses of the lightly regarded Botha
and was loading up for one shot, rather than throwing combinations
as trainer Tommy was loading up for one shot, rather than throwing
combinations and as trainer Tommy Brooks had promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a work in progress,'' Brooks said. ``It's going to take
time. He wasn't following the game plan. I was disappointed. All he
was trying to do was land one good shot. That's not how he's going
to get any better.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Tyson, overconfidence creeped in with Botha. He
taunted Tyson, dropping his gloves, even smiling at him and saying,
``Is that all you have?'' That was a mistake. Tyson began pressing
the attack and caught Botha coming in with a short right on the
chin. Botha dropped. It was several minutes before the cobwebs
cleared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just walked into a punch _ a punch you don't see,'' Botha
said. ``I was controlling it real easy and keeping away from Mike's
power. I started fooling around too much, probably. I got
careless.''
</P>
<P>
   His trainer, Panama Lewis, concurred: ``He dropped his hands.
But I can't take anything away from him. He was sticking to the
game plan until he got too cocky.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson seemed to take his performance well, and his handlers were
in full spin control after the fight. Promoter Dan Goosen said, ``I
don't think Mike fought poorly _ I think Botha just fought great.''
Shelly Finkel, Tyson's manager, actually praised his fighter for
``keeping his composure'' _ odd, considering Tyson was yelling at
Steele and it took security officials to calm him down after the
first round.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson was candid about a couple of things. Told of Botha's
charge that Tyson was trying to break his arm, the former champion
said, ``He's correct. He got rough with me, I got rough right
back.'' Asked if he felt he proved anything with his performance,
he said, ``No, I'm just constantly trying to do well. We're working
on it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Tyson, at 32, has time to work on things, it's only because
of the sad state of the heavyweight division. But when a Francois
Botha gives him this many problems, so can others. His next fight
is tentatively scheduled for April 24, possibly against Axel
Schulz. Schulz will watch tapes of the Botha fight _ just as Botha
watched Holyfield's.
</P>
<P>
   Botha said, ``I would like to have a rematch. But I know there's
probably other people who want a chance against Mike.''

 &HT;    Fan dancing goes public
 &HT;    By Larry Hartstein
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``We shocked the world! We shocked the world!'' Jerome
Francis shouted, doing the Dirty Bird along with everyone else in
his friend's living room.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey White skipped through Barnacle's Restaurant in Norcross
yelling, ``We're going to Miami! We're going to Miami!'' Then he
broke into a slow flap and sang: ``I believe I can fly. I believe I
can touch the sky ...''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Head wept tears of joy at Y-Knot Sports Bar in Peachtree
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable,'' said the 14-year season-ticket holder.
</P>
<P>
   When Morten Andersen's overtime field goal sailed through the
uprights Sunday, it propelled the Falcons to the Super Bowl for the
first time. It also set off a wild celebration that had metro
Atlanta partying well into the night, and sent fans scrambling to
make travel arrangements for Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Fans spilled out of sports bars and danced on Peachtree Street,
closing some blocks to traffic. Drivers honked their horns. People
grinned and laughed and high-fived. What else do you do when the
unthinkable happens?
</P>
<P>
   ``When they won it, I said, `That down there just froze,'''
Kroger employee Brian Hix said, pointing down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, at least it's getting cold,'' added Daniel Finney, a
co-worker at the Snellville grocery store where customers and
employees alike watched the end of the game on a television near
the deli.
</P>
<P>
   Travel agents immediately began taking calls from fans wanting
to fly to Miami for the Jan. 31 Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phones have been ringing off the hook,'' said Don Furlong,
division manager at AAA Norcross World Travel. ``It started about
five minutes after the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Most commercial airlines are sold out to Miami already, says
Furlong. Super Bowl packages are not for the budget-conscious: A
four-night air travel deal including end-zone tickets goes for
$3,999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last Sunday we offered a charter to Minneapolis for the
championship game, it was sold out by Tuesday morning,'' said
Furlong.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Bross of Peachtree City already has booked airline tickets
and a hotel room. She's a season ticket holder who has entered the
lottery for a chance to buy Super Bowl tickets. If the lottery
doesn't come through, she'll go to Miami anyway and scrounge for
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's phenomenal,'' she said. ``I've been following the Falcons
for 20 years and I can't believe we're going to the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Some fans gave up before the Falcons made their remarkable
comeback. When the Vikings went up 20-7 in the second quarter, a
few started talking about next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not over, it's not over,'' urged Adolphus Victrum, 55, a
former beer vendor at Falcons' games. ``I'm a diehard fan. They can
come back. They've just got to stop giving the ball away.''
</P>
<P>
   And as the tide turned Atlanta's way late in the game, fans all
over the metro area grew more confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will, they will,'' Dottie Haskins chanted softly as she
watched in The Pub, a nonalcoholic lounge at the Renaissance on
Peachtree. ``You've got to remember we weren't the favorite, but
with heart and soul we can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Falcons overcame the Vikings in overtime, emotion
overcame Don Lancaster, 33.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cried. I mean you can't beat that,'' said Lancaster, who
watched at Jocks n' Jills at the Omni. ``When you take into
consideration how many people it takes to make something like that
work and then a team like Atlanta that just hasn't had any support,
and then it took somebody like Dan (Reeves) to bring it together.
You've got to thank him for that.''
</P>
<P>
   One fan who could have attended the NFC Championship game but
chose not to was Rebecca Smith, the daughter of team president
Taylor Smith. She stayed home to celebrate her 14th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was exciting to watch it on TV, but I was kind of mad I
wasn't with my dad,'' Rebecca said. ``I was cheering, I was so
excited, I was real tense, I couldn't watch. I had my doubts, but I
knew something good would come out of it.''

 &HT;    Kicking criticism, doubt out of the dome: The Falcons are going
to the Super Bowl
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The falcons are going to the Super Bowl. Such a
simple sentence. Such an unfathomable concept.
</P>
<P>
   You could write it a year ago, a month ago, a week ago and still
risk ridicule. To have spoken it before a grand jury might have
been an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   There it is now, in plain fact, made real by a game that will be
the shining point of reference in Atlanta sports. In fact, I think
Sid Bream's little jog around the basepaths just got some real
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Let us break down that eight-word declaration into its two major
components, shall we class?
</P>
<P>
   ''The Falcons.'' A football tragedy. Wretches, the way that
Dickens used to make them. A collective noun usually modified by a
sigh and a mumbled ''same ol'. . .''
</P>
<P>
   No more. Sunday's overtime subduing of Minnesota for the NFC
championship put all that was previously known about this franchise
through a wood-chipper. It is time to redefine. The accumulated
sins of 33 seasons were forgiven because, well, the Falcons are
going to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ''It means a dream come true,'' said Taylor Smith, head of the
family so often treated as failure's fertilizer. ''This is
something we've always wanted to do for our people our fans. For
me, that's just overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   ''So long. So much criticism,'' said linebacker Jessie Tuggle.
''No one imagined that we could play at this high a level or beat a
team like we just beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's game was dangerous hike over a high, narrow, twisting
plot. Past editions of Falcons would have been thrown off by the
first switchback. This one endured, counting on the fact that the
16-1 Vikings had never faced a real trial this season.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, the Vikings were the ones who stared into the
bright possibilities and blinked. Their kicker hadn't missed in a
year-and-a-half, yet pushed the 38-yard, fourth-quarter kick that
would have finished the Falcons. When Morten Andersen had the
chance to win it from the same distance, he was pure. ''I didn't
have the perfect season, but I had the perfect Sunday,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When these Falcons needed a touchdown drive with just over two
minutes left in regulation, quarterback Chris Chandler delivered.
He was 3-for-3 on the drive to the winning overtime field goal.
''That ranks right up there with any of the big-time
quarterbacks,'' Dan Reeves told his man.
</P>
<P>
   When these Falcons needed someone to keep the phenom Randy Moss
in check, there was 35-year-old safety Eugene Robinson swatting
away the bomb in overtime. The kid caught but one pass for four
yards in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as Andersen aligned himself for the winning kick, an
old-fashioned tent revival broke out on the Falcons bench. Instead
of watching the kick, most of those not directly involved huddled
in prayer. These Falcons call on all powers. ''I know there are
Christians on both sides, that God will favor both of us,'' said
cornerback Ray Buchanan. ''We wanted Him to favor us just a little
bit more, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the second part of the simple, yet astounding sentence:
''Super Bowl,'' the place promised to every player who buys into
football's ethic of work and faith. The place that seemed
unreachable, almost fictional, to those of Falcons persuasion.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it gives everybody in this league hope,'' said Reeves,
underestimating the wonder of the Falcons going to the Super Bowl.

 &HT;    Falcons suddenly super
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS, SEVERAL SIDEBARS
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Amid the bedlam of the Atlanta Falcons locker
room, William White was yelling, ''We shocked the world, we shocked
the world!'' and Eugene Robinson was yelling, ''They can't believe
it, they can't believe it!''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons safeties were right.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are going to Super Bowl XXXIII. As participants.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible no words will ever sufficiently describe what
happened Sunday afternoon, when the Falcons came from behind to
beat the Minnesota Vikings 30-27 in overtime at the Metrodome, not
only because it was so amazing, but because so much happened in one
game.
</P>
<P>
   As the Falcons danced and hollered as they gathered on stage to
receive the NFC Championship trophy, running back Jamal Anderson
was pointing to people, saying, ``I told you all.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, though, could have predicted that a Falcons team that
was 1-7 in the middle of last season _ having won just four of it's
previous 24 games _ would turn around and win 22 of it's next 26.
</P>
<P>
   Morten Andersen's 38-yard field goal with 3:08 left in the extra
period was the game-winner. The native of Denmark has won an
NFL-record 26 games with kicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was automatic, man,'' he said. ``Right down the middle,
baby. It's all destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is.
</P>
<P>
   Now this improbable season moves on to the Super Bowl in Miami,
where in two weeks the Falcons face the Denver Broncos, who
defeated the New York Jets 23-10 Sunday in the AFC Championship
Game.
</P>
<P>
   After Andersen's kick, Falcons president Taylor Smith and other
team officials yelled in the press box, and bedlam reigned on the
field, as Falcons players and coaches went running in every
direction.
</P>
<P>
   At the trophy presentation, coach Dan Reeves, who five weeks ago
today underwent quadruple heart bypass surgery, tried to do the
``Dirty Bird'' dance, something he said at midseason he would do if
the Falcons made it to their first ever Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can stand today, my heart's going to be in great shape,''
Reeves said. ``It can't get much tougher than that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the locker room, backup quarterback Steve DeBerg was
videotaping everything. Wide receiver Terance Mathis _ whose
16-yard touchdown catch with 49 seconds left sent the game to
overtime _ smoked a big cigar.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is as beautiful as it gets,'' Mathis said.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody played better, or harder than quarterback Chris Chandler,
who completed 27 of 43 passes for 340 yards and three touchdowns.
He got sacked three times, but in general had time most of the day.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder he was going around kissing his linemen on the cheek
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just kept giving me time to throw,'' Chandler said. ``It
was hard today, unbelievably loud, but we didn't have a single
false start penalty. That's how focused we were.''
</P>
<P>
   As big as Andersen's kick was, there were many other moments
nearly as important as the Falcons (16-2) rallied from deficits of
20-7 in the second quarter, and 27-17 in the fourth quarter to win
for the 11th straight time.
</P>
<P>
   What was biggest?
</P>
<P>
   Was it the 38-yard field goal missed by Minnesota's Gary
Anderson that gave Atlanta the ball back with just 2:07 left in the
game? Anderson this season became the only kicker in NFL history to
go all season without a missed field goal, hitting on all 37 of his
attempts before that fateful attempt sailed barely left, leaving
Atlanta within 27-20.
</P>
<P>
   Or was it the lightning quick, eight-play, 71-yard drive that
ended with a game-tying pass from Chandler to Mathis, who was
barely in the end zone?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was it a defense that gave up just seven points in the
final 44:37 to a team that set an NFL record this season by scoring
556 points.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is for certain, few in the crowd of 64,060 in the
Metrodome, or back in Atlanta were sitting down when the Falcons
took their second possession of the overtime.
</P>
<P>
   On the first play, Chandler hit tight end O.J. Santiago, whose
fumble in the first half helped the Vikings (16-2) score 10 points
off Atlanta turnovers. That 15-yard play was the first of 10 on the
70-yard drive, and Santiago wasn't finished.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, he caught a 26-yard pass, moving the ball to
the Minnesota 48.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bad feeling when I fumbled,'' he said, ``but I
couldn't let it take me out of the game. I went out to make plays.
I just joined the party. Everybody else was making plays, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson didn't have his usual stellar game, rushing 23 times
for a modest 67 yards, his 9-yard run behind left guard Gene
Williams moments later took the ball to the Minnesota 22.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson gained 1 yard on the next two carries, and Reeves opted
to kick the field goal on third-and-9 from the 21.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, who took three Denver teams to Super Bowls in the 1980s,
losing all three, went to five Super Bowls as a player and coach
with the Cowboys in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, this one already is more rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible when you think about it, coming from 1-7
halfway through our first year,'' he said. ``All my life, every
football coach I ever played for preached the same things that we
try to, and when you have a football team that believes in those
things and executes them. ... I couldn't be prouder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing tougher than (Sunday's game) is going to be
dancing in downtown Atlanta, the dirty bird. That ain't going to be
a pretty sight.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, it will be.

`KOYAANISQATSI': A RENEWED EMOTION FOR A MINIMALIST FILM 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When ``Koyaanisqatsi'' had its first showings in 1983
the term post-Minimalism had not yet been coined. But this
ecological meditation by the filmmaker Godfrey Reggio and the
composer Philip Glass proclaimed the limitations of Minimalism as a
description for a movement in the arts that stripped away certain
traditional elements of structure and focused on others.
</P>
<P>
   There was, after all, a degree to which contributions by Reggio
and Glass' to the project fit that original definition: the film
has neither dialogue nor voice-overs, just Reggio's images and a
score rich in the repetitive figuration that had become emblematic
of Minimalist music.
</P>
<P>
   But Reggio's vistas are varied and complex. Hopi rock paintings
are contrasted with nuclear blasts and rocket launches; the
unharnessed forces of wind and water with the mechanistic densities
of modern urban life. Within these images, though, contradictions
abound. Unblemished nature is shown to be beautiful, yet the rock
formations and vast desertscapes also register as harsh and
lethally inhospitable.
</P>
<P>
   Modernity is mostly shown unflatteringly through glimpses of
rusted metal, ruined buildings and machinery spewing pollution; yet
Reggio's aerial film of highways, sped up so that the traffic melts
into shimmering streams of red and white light, is spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   These pictures are framed and manipulated in a painterly way and
they convey far more information _ and provocation to thought _
than dialogue could have done. Glass' score, despite its
repetitions and motoric rhythms, abandons the abstraction of early
Minimalism in favor of an undeniable emotional current that
reinforces and interacts with the visual imagery. It is not just
that the music colors our perception of the images; it works the
other way around as well.
</P>
<P>
   For a revival of the film at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on
Saturday, the soundtrack was replaced by a live performance of the
score by the Philip Glass Ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   Stretches of the score use soft timbres, slow tempos and
minor-key chord progressions that sound melancholy on their own,
but suggest other things _ from grandeur to horrid fascination _
depending what Reggio has on the screen. The more frenetic, brashly
aggressive sections of the score are perfect accompaniments for
Reggio's high-speed images of traffic patterns and electronic
arcade games.
</P>
<P>
   There are reasons to prefer the film in its pure form, with its
original soundtrack, not least because the recorded sound _ a
combination of electronic and orchestral instruments and the
Western Wind vocal ensemble _ has a flexibility and breadth of
timbres that cannot be equaled by Glass' ensemble of keyboards,
winds and voices.
</P>
<P>
   What the live performance had, though, is a visceral impact that
the film score, even when played loud, does not equal. Perhaps
because of differences in instrumentation, there were some
appealing harmonic touches in the live version that are less
apparent in the original.
</P>
<P>
   Glass was among the keyboardists in his group, but as always, he
left the conducting to Michael Riesman, who kept the rhythms of the
score and the film closely matched.

SINN FEIN LEADER PREDICTS SUCCESS OF PEACE TALKS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN _ Martin McGuinness, the chief negotiator for the
political wing of the Irish Republican Army, said Sunday that the
growing crisis in the Northern Ireland peace effort would be
resolved by the end of March, the target date for the British
government to return home-rule powers to the northern British
province of Ulster.
</P>
<P>
   The Northern Ireland Assembly, a mix of officials of the
Protestant majority and the Roman Catholic minority, is to begin
debate on Monday over the agreement reached by their leaders last
month on the new political structures for the province. The leaders
have set Feb. 15 as a deadline for approval. That would give the
British and Irish governments time to change their laws to permit
the transfer of power by the middle of March.
</P>
<P>
   The Protestant deputy leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, John
Taylor, said the effort to approve the home-rule agreement had no
better than a 50-50 chance of succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   But McGuinness, the chief negotiator for and No. 2 official of
Sinn Fein, the IRA political wing, said the impasse would be ended
by mid-March. By then, he said, his party would have ministers
taking part in the return of powers that Britain has exercised
directly from London since 1974. Since then, Northern Irish
officials have controlled only garbage removal and burial of the
dead.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on BBC radio, McGuinness did not, however, offer
a specific solution to the problem of IRA disarmament. That issue
has impeded the implementation of the Belfast agreement, approved
last spring and aimed at giving the province's Catholic minority
more power, and the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic more
influence, in northern affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The crux of the issue is that Sinn Fein insists that it is
entitled to two ministers in the new cabinet-like executive that is
to be formed in the new Northern Ireland Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The Protestant unionist first minister of the Assembly, David
Trimble, insists that some IRA disarmament must begin before Sinn
Fein takes up the ministerial posts. But Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein
president, argues that the IRA weapons have been effectively
``decommissioned'' since the group began a cease-fire 17 months
ago.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Officials here in the Irish Republic and in the North are hoping
that the IRA will find a way to make a gesture toward disarmament,
not necessarily the actual surrender or destruction of weapons,
that will allay Protestant fears that the IRA has not permanently
abandoned violence.
</P>
<P>
   But in its New Year's message, the IRA stood by its refusal to
disarm and hinted, in the view of many officials, that it could
return to violence, as it did in February 1996 after a 17-month
cease-fire, after it decided the British government was delaying
the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Further anxiety arose when the Northern Ireland police said last
week that there was no sign that the IRA was preparing to disarm
and that IRA splinter groups were expected to make new terrorist
attacks, like the one that killed 29 people in August in the town
of Omagh.
</P>
<P>
   Also disturbing was the attempted robbery in a Dublin suburb 13
days ago of an armored truck carrying about $2 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the attempt failed when the getaway car stalled; the
masked, heavily armed robbers escaped on foot. Police said it was
the work of an IRA splinter -group whose members oppose the Belfast
peace agreement. The money was needed to stage new attacks, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Dublin on Sunday, an influential and respected Irish
politician, Ruairi Quinn, head of the Labor Party and a former
Finance Minister, seemed to reflect the view of many officials and
experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law is on the side of Sinn Fein,'' he said, referring to
the peace accord, which sets no deadline for disarmament. ``But
morality is on the side of David Trimble.''

 &HT;    Barbecue for 15,000, please
 &HT;    By Kitty Crider
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Four years ago Eddie Deen served plates to
15,000 people in 48 minutes, his personal best barbecue record. At
five to six people a second, that's faster than the average Texan
can say ``barbecue plate, please.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning today, he will again turn Colorado Street into a giant
outdoor kitchen to feed 12,000 to 15,000 guests attending the
second inauguration of Gov. George W. Bush on Tuesday. A $3 ticket,
purchased in advance, will get folks about a half-pound of meat _
the choices are brisket, smoked turkey breast, ham and sausage _
beans, cole slaw, potato salad, condiments, a big ol' homemade
yeast roll and a slice of chocolate fudge pecan or vanilla
buttermilk pie. Thank ya, kindly, sir. We need a nap now.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Deen &AMP; Company will cook the 800 briskets _ that's 400
steers _ at his headquarters in Terrell. ``But we will smoke the
turkeys fresh in Austin next to the Capitol. I have a 20-foot
smoker that will hold 200 turkeys,'' he adds. To accomplish this
mega 'cue, the cooking team will leave North Texas before daybreak
today en route to the Capitol grounds with trucks, trailers,
portable generators for cooking and the smoker in tow. (Tickets for
the barbecue may already be sold out. Call 494-1999 to check.)
</P>
<P>
   Much of the food for the inauguration day barbecue has been
donated: the sausage from football legend Earl Campbell, turkey and
ham from Hormel, beans from Ranch Style, water from Anaya, soft
drinks from Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Deen, speaking in a calm, slow drawl early one morning this
month, did not sound like a man sweating the big barbecue. ``We
catered over 3,000 parties last year. We've done the Cowtown Ball
in Fort Worth, the Cattlebaron's Ball in Dallas and Tyler,''
enumerated the 1979 A&AMP;M grad.
</P>
<P>
   To feed Texans as fast as a Nolan Ryan pitch, Deen will bring
100 or so people and set up 60 nonpartisan serving lines.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Bush's inauguration in 1995, when Deen says he was a
small company and went without sleep for a couple of days for this
event, this year's barbecue won't be a snooze loser. ``We were a
very small company four years ago,'' says Deen. But he snagged the
contract in a catering menu taste-off conducted by the inaugural
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Six or seven times larger now in space, volume and sales, he
averages eight parties a day and has done as many as 27 events at
the same time. This barbecue is just another big party.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not the only one he will be doing that day. There's
also a luncheon for 500 at Prestonwood Baptist Church in Dallas and
a Taste of Texas dinner for 2,500, also in Big D, with a more
complex menu encompassing different foods and flavors from the
various regions of the Lone Star State. Seafood. Mexican food.
German dishes.
</P>
<P>
   That little shindig down in Austin on Tuesday?
</P>
<P>
   Why, it's just a barbecue.

 &HT;    Security officers to keep watchful eye during inauguration
 &HT;    By Claire Osborn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When he was 4 years old, Mike Cox sat on a
granite windowsill upstairs at the state Capitol, watching the 1952
gubernatorial inauguration of Alan Shivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times were simpler then and security was less of an issue,''
said Cox, who is now a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public
Safety.
</P>
<P>
   That's for sure. It's best not to think of planting yourself on
a windowsill at the Capitol to watch Tuesday's inauguration
festivities or dream that you can park a few steps away from the
parade route. It's all part of the plan to make sure that Texans
peacefully celebrate the swearing-in of their state leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of watchful eyes belonging to DPS troopers, Austin
police, Capitol police and Secret Service agents will be scanning
the crowds to make sure participants leave with only pleasant
memories.
</P>
<P>
   Officials declined to say how many law enforcement officials
would be present. ``We never discuss security during an
inauguration or other major events,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Officers will be ready, however, just in case. ``Everything is
thought of, every possible security arrangement is made and every
possible scenario is thought through,'' said David Wilkinson, an
Austin Secret Service agent.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service agents, of course, will be protecting former
President George Bush and former first lady Barbara Bush. Their
son, George W. Bush, will be inaugurated for his second consecutive
term as governor.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson said he doesn't expect security to face any new
challenges in guarding the ex-president.
</P>
<P>
   ``With former President Bush we have not had more extra threats
than usual . . . nothing has escalated,'' Wilkinson said. He
declined to say what the ``usual'' threats against Bush entailed.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested three anti-war protesters who heckled former
President Bush in November, when he read from his book about the
end of the Cold War at the Capitol during the Texas Book Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Cox, who said he has attended every Texas inauguration since the
1950s, said he couldn't remember any large protests in the past
decade. Officials would not say if they expected any protesters
during Tuesday's festivities.
</P>
<P>
   It is not illegal to protest, but complaints might be drowned
out by all the groups marching down Congress Avenue in the
inaugural parade, which starts at 2:30 p.m. at Third Street and
Congress Avenue. There are 81 entries in the parade, including more
than 20 marching bands, a ``Texas Technology'' float, the ``Chinese
Golden Dragon Club,'' several divisions of soldiers and the Kilgore
Rangerettes.
</P>
<P>
   The swearing-in ceremony, scheduled for noon on the south steps
of the Capitol, and a 1 p.m. barbecue on the Capitol's south lawn
will precede the parade.
</P>
<P>
   Parking, of course, is prohibited along Congress Avenue and near
the Capitol along 11th and Colorado streets. Plenty of streets,
however, will be open downtown, including Fourth through 10th
streets except at their intersection with Congress Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Officials had no specific advice for best viewing of the
festivities. ``Get there early and get a high place,'' Cox said.

WITHIN THE PENTAGON, A RARE DISSENTING OPINION ON BUDGET INCREASES

(DW) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Not much has changed in the small office in the
Pentagon where Franklin C. Spinney has worked ever since he gained
a bit of notoriety in the 1980s with this jolting argument: All the
money President Ronald Reagan was pouring into defense would not
make the military any stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Congress held hearings. His bosses made him a celebrity by
trying to quash his views. Time magazine called him a ``Pentagon
Maverick'' on a cover in 1983. Still, Reagan's military spending
spree went on.
</P>
<P>
   Now, nearly two decades later, President Clinton has proposed
the first increase in the Pentagon's budget since 1991 and the
largest since those heady days: $12 billion in new spending in
2000, and $110 billion over the next six years. Spinney, still a
mid-grade analyst in the Pentagon's Office of Program Analysis and
Evaluation, is once again raising an alarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a horrible thing that's going on,'' Spinney said in an
interview in his cramped, cluttered office deep inside the
Pentagon. ``All it's going to do is reward the pathological
behavior that's creating the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks since Clinton announced his plan to raise the
Pentagon's budget, criticisms like Spinney's have been rare _
within the government exceedingly so.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent hearing before the Senate's Committee on Armed
Services, no senator spoke out against the increase. In fact, the
loudest criticism of Clinton's proposal on Capitol Hill has come
from Republicans who have argued that the President needs to pledge
more to defense.
</P>
<P>
   Before the administration and Congress open the defense spending
spigot, though, Spinney and a diverse group of advocates and
analysts have begun to make a case against an increase.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them argue that boosting defense is unnecessary since no
new threat like the Soviet Union has emerged. Others say new
spending will ease pressure to cut the Pentagon's inefficiencies
and waste. Still others say that in a time of relative peace, the
nation should devote its resources to education or other social
causes.
</P>
<P>
   A group called Business Leaders for Sensible Priorities began
broadcasting a 30-second television commercial calling for just
that. The first advertisements appeared on Friday and more are
scheduled to run on Monday and Tuesday, coinciding with Clinton's
State of the Union message to be delivered Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Cohen of Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade Inc., a longtime critic of
large defense budgets and one of the leaders of the group, said the
White House, the Pentagon and the Congress were spending money as
if the Cold War had never ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is now, literally, in an arms race with
itself,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposal, which will be outlined in detail when he
submits a budget proposal to Congress early next month, would
increase the Department of Defense's budget to about $268 billion
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   That is only $4 billion more than the currently projected level
of $264 billion, but Clinton also has agreed to let the department
keep another $8 billion in savings freed up as a result of
lower-than-expected inflation and fuel savings.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a Democrat who has had an uneasy relationship with the
military, agreed to an increase after Defense Secretary William
Cohen and the nation's military commanders warned that dwindling
resources since the collapse of the Soviet Union had strained the
military's ``readiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew F. Krepinevich, executive director of the Center for
Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a research organization in
Washington, said the Pentagon's budget reflects a military
preparing for major regional conflicts with the most advanced jets,
tanks and ships.
</P>
<P>
   Future enemies, he argues, will confront American forces with
cheaper weapons, like missiles or mines, that are harder to
counter.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the greatest challenge isn't a budgetary one,''
Krepinevich said. ``It's a strategic one.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes Spinney's criticism unusual is that it comes from
inside the Pentagon, where politics, bureaucracy and military
obedience discourage most public dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Spinney's argument is that the Pentagon plans to spend billions
of dollars to build new weapons that have become so complicated and
costly that it cannot buy enough of them to replace today's
arsenal. That means tomorrow's military will have to get by with
fewer new weapons, while relying on older weapons to last longer.
Meanwhile, the cost of operating the advanced new weapons keeps
rising.
</P>
<P>
   He calls this the ``defense death spiral.''
</P>
<P>
   Spinney does not dispute reports that the armed services face
readiness problems caused by backlogged repairs, shortages of parts
and growing wear and tear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spending more money the same way isn't going to fix
anything,'' Spinney said.
</P>
<P>
   Spinney, 53, has broken with orthodoxy almost from the day in
1977 that he arrived at the Pentagon's Office of Program Analysis
and Evaluation, an office first conceived by Robert S. McNamara in
1961 to provide (relatively) independent assessments.
</P>
<P>
   His own career began in the military, making him an unlikely
firebrand. He spent eight years in the Air Force after graduating
from Lehigh University in 1967 with a degree in engineering.
</P>
<P>
   He fell in with a band of like-minded reformers, who became
well-known on Capitol Hill and in the media for challenging
conventional wisdom at what Spinney calls ``Versailles on the
Potomac.''
</P>
<P>
   At the peak of Reagan's buildup, he argued that the Pentagon
underestimated the future costs of weapons, thus saddling the
nation with ever-growing defense budgets. After appearing before
the House and Senate, he lost his parking permit and, for a time,
access to budget figures, but his notoriety and civil-service rules
protected his job.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the Cold War allowed the Pentagon to reduce the size
of the military and its budgets. Spinney, like others, believes the
Pentagon did not take full advantage of the opportunity to
reconsider plans to modernize its arsenal with weapons originally
conceived to fight a superpower like the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force, he says by way of example, now plans to spend $35
billion to build 339 F-22 fighter jets, even though there is no
real challenger to America's best jets today. By comparison, the
force spent only $45 billion to build 1,094 F-15 fighters, which
are considered to be among the best jets in the air. Likewise, he
argues that the Navy has retired aging, though still usable attack
submarines to make room for fewer, more expensive versions.
</P>
<P>
   Within the Pentagon, Spinney has little official influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``They basically ignore me,'' Spinney said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he gets his views out _ by e-mail. Christopher Helman,
senior analyst at the Center for Defense Information, another
research group that has opposed the spending increase, said
Spinney's critiques have a purpose nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``He serves to generate some critical dialogue that would not
otherwise occur,'' Helman said.

WALTER H. PAGE, WHO HEADED J.P. MORGAN &AMP; CO., DIES AT 83 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.H., Mass.)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walter H. Page, a former chairman and president of J.P. Morgan &AMP;
Co., died Jan. 8 at his home in Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was heart failure, said his son Mark.
</P>
<P>
   Page joined the company as a trainee in 1937, when it was still
a privately held bank, and remained there until he retired in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Page worked in domestic banking early in his career, rising to
the position of assistant treasurer in 1948 and vice president in
1953. Morgan merged with the Guaranty Trust Co. in 1959, and Page
was named senior vice president of the new company, Morgan Guaranty
Trust, in 1964. The following year, he was appointed executive vice
president in charge of the international banking division.
</P>
<P>
   `` Page was one of the last bank executives to have worked under
John Pierpont Morgan Jr.,'' said D.W. Wright, the company historian
and a consultant to J.P. Morgan. He played a key role in shaping
the company's international strategy, Wright said, especially in
the 1960s and early 1970s, a period when United States banks were
expanding their overseas business.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, Page became a vice chairman of Morgan Guaranty and was
named to the corporate office, the company's senior management
group. In 1969, J.P. Morgan, a holding company, was formed to
acquire Morgan Guaranty Trust. Page was named vice chairman of J.P.
Morgan that year and president of both companies in 1971. He became
chairman in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Page helped create the plan that led to the
formation of the Saudi International Bank. ``The relationship
between Morgan and the Saudi central bank was considered a great
coup for the Morgan firm,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   When Page retired in 1979, the company had more than 20 offices
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   He remained on the board and in 1985 was named a member of an
advisory group to top management at the company.
</P>
<P>
   Page, born in Huntington, N.Y., graduated from Harvard College
in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   He married Jane Nichols, the granddaughter of John Pierpont
Morgan Jr., in 1942. He served in the Navy during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Page died on Dec. 15. Page is survived by a daughter, Jane
Mallinson of Exeter, N.H.; two sons, Walter, of Lincoln, Mass., and
Mark, of Brooklyn, and eight grandchildren.

 &HT;    Nobel prize winner says mercy is key
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Charles Walston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Belfast, Kosovo, Rwanda, and the tough inner cities of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Each place is the site of strife that may seem unique, but the
conflicts actually have much in common, a Nobel Peace Prize winner
said Sunday in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``All conflicts are about differences, whether it's your
religion, nationality or race,'' said John Hume, a 1998 Nobel
laureate for his role in forging a peace agreement in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Hume, leader of Northern Ireland's Social Democratic and Labor
Party, is in Atlanta today to receive the 1999 Martin Luther King
Jr. Non-Violent Peace Prize as part of the King Week celebration.
Sunday, he participated in a roundtable discussion on peace and
reconciliation at the Omni hotel in downtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the panel were King's widow, Coretta Scott King; retired
Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa, the 1984 Nobel
Peace Prize recipient; and former United Nations ambassador and
Atlanta mayor Andrew Young.
</P>
<P>
   They emphasized respect for differences as a key to resolving
conflicts, and wrestled with the question of whether those who
commit atrocities during wars or civil unrest should be made to pay
for their actions.
</P>
<P>
   Hume said people who are ``sucked into'' violence are victims of
long-simmering hatreds, and he urged forgiveness as the only way to
heal old wounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've reached resolution of your conflict, the best thing
you can do is draw a line over your past,'' said Hume. ``If you
keep bringing in the past, you're re-creating the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Hume invoked King's name to support his view, saying the civil
rights leader ``wasn't looking for victory over people who had
committed injustices, he was looking for equality.''
</P>
<P>
   Tutu, who headed a commission on Truth and Reconciliation in
South Africa after the nation rejected apartheid, offered a
somewhat different perspective.
</P>
<P>
   After years of repression of the black majority and armed
struggle to overthrow their government, Tutu said it was important
for South Africans to acknowledge that horrible acts had been
committed.
</P>
<P>
   Although the commission offered amnesty to most people who
admitted their role in crimes during apartheid, Tutu said that was
not the same as pretending the acts had never occured.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get amnesty unless you accept accountability,'' said
Tutu.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to know what our past is,'' he added. ``We say, 'We
did these things.' Having done that, we can now say we close the

KATHERINE BAIN, CHAMPION OF CHILD HEALTH  
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Mo., Ill., Ala., D.C.)   By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Katherine Bain, a pediatrician who became a high-ranking and
an outspoken Washington official concerned with the well-being of
infants and children, died on Jan. 10 in a Washington nursing home
she entered in October. She was 101 and had lived in Washington
since 1940.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bain's family said that she was the author or a co-author of
influential reports that led to the development of child-proof
safety caps for medicines and for chemicals in the home,
safety-release standards for the doors of refrigerators in order to
keep children from being trapped and suffocated, and some of the
first Federal guidelines for the nutrition of children.
</P>
<P>
   Her family said she carried out a pioneering survey of
breast-feeding practices in American hospitals' nurseries, and that
her findings led to important changes in doctors' opinions of
nursing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, she joined the Children's Bureau, an agency that was
then part of the Department of Labor and is now part of the
Department of Health and Human Services. She was the bureau's
deputy chief from 1958 to 1964 and became assistant to the director
of the Public Health Service in a reorganization in 1969. She
devoted herself to children's welfare issues in foreign countries
for the next four years and retired.
</P>
<P>
   In a report in The Journal of Pediatrics in 1954, Dr. Bain
presented statistics that pointed up the carelessness of American
families in protecting children in the home.
</P>
<P>
   Analyzing data supplied by the National Office of Vital
Statistics, she said that 400 children under the age of 5 died each
year in the United States from accidental poisoning. That rate was
four times the rate reported for England and Wales.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the deaths from accidental poisoning could be
prevented, Dr. Bain said, if aspirin, barbiturates, kerosene, lye,
lead and arsenic compounds were kept out of the hands of small
children.
</P>
<P>
   In a report issued in 1944, Dr. Bain said that World War II had
intensified the need for regular advice to mothers on how to keep
their babies well. ``We have a bumper crop of babies,'' she said.
``Nearly three million will be born in the United States this year.
At the same time we have a shortage of doctors and nurses for the
civilian population. About 50 percent of our younger practicing
physicians have gone into the armed forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bain said the United States would have to work hard and fast
to increase its number of clinics aimed at keeping babies well.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, she bemoaned disparities in medical care
available in different parts of the United States. Speaking to 500
child health and welfare experts in 1948 in Chicago, she said that
a survey had found ``that 1,000 children in Illinois have on an
average day twice as much medical care as 1,000 children in
Alabama.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One can only conclude,'' Dr. Bain added, ``that children in
Alabama are receiving at the most only one-half as much care as
they need.''
</P>
<P>
   The honors Dr. Bain received included an award in 1960 from the
New York Infirmary for work she had done in pediatrics and public
health.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bain was born in St. Louis, received a bachelor's degree in
1920 from the University of Missouri and her medical degree in 1925
from Washington University in St. Louis. She spent 13 years in
private pediatric practice in St. Louis before going to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by several nieces and nephews.

WILLIAM BALL ,  DEFENDER OF AMISH RIGHTS AND FEDERAL FUNDS FOR
PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS  (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Fla., Pa., Ind., Mexico)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Bentley Ball, a constitutional lawyer nationally known
for his defense of religious doctrine and practice against secular
encroachment, died Jan. 10 at Lee Memorial Hospital in Fort Myers,
Fla. He was 82, lived in Camp Hill, Pa., and was in Florida on
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Ball suffered a brief illness, said Richard E. Connell, a
partner in the Harrisburg, Pa., firm of Ball, Skelly, Murren &AMP;
Connell, which Ball helped found 30 years ago. At his death, he was
of counsel to the firm but had remained active in it to the end,
Connell said.
</P>
<P>
   Ball was the vice chairman of the National Committee for Amish
Religious Freedom, for which he won a precedent-setting case before
the Wisconsin Supreme Court in the early 1970s. The case, Wisconsin
vs. Yoder, reversed the conviction of three Amish farmers who had
refused to enroll their children in a small public school in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   The court held, 6 to 1, that requiring the children to attend
public school violated their constitutional right to freedom of
religion. It held that the state's compulsory-education law as
``applied to the Amish violates the free exercise clause of the
First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Ball's argument before the court made the case that government
must prove a compelling public need for actions affecting religious
groups. Subsequent court decisions weakened that doctrine, causing
Congress to pass the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 to
enshrine the compelling-reason doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   In a rebuke to Congress, the Supreme Court substantially gutted
that legislation in 1997. But the act had passed almost by
acclamation, and efforts continue to revive the issue perhaps in
narrower language acceptable to the court.
</P>
<P>
   Ball was a prominent Roman Catholic layman and member of the
Order of St. Gregory the Great, a papal knighthood. He often served
his church in the courts and before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   He was in the forefront of the church's efforts to block the
Kennedy and Johnson administrations from denying federal money to
parochial schools. He also testified before Congress against
federal policy on the dissemination and coordination of
birth-control information to individuals and public agencies on
request. At the time he appeared as general counsel to the
Pennsylvania Catholic Conference of bishops.
</P>
<P>
   He was active in the Pennsylvania Equal Rights Council, the
Christian Legal Society and the Catholic League for Religion and
Civil Rights.
</P>
<P>
   He was admitted to practice before the Supreme Court in 1969 and
argued nine cases relating to civil rights before it. He assisted
in 25 other cases, and practiced on the federal district and
appeals levels as well as in state courts.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Rochester, he graduated from Western Reserve University
in 1940 and received his law degree from the University of Notre
Dame in 1948. Early in his career he was a lawyer for W.R. Grace &AMP;
Co. and Pfizer Inc., and a law professor at Villanova University.
</P>
<P>
   Ball is survived by his wife of 55 years, Caroline Cook Ball; a
daughter, Virginia Duncan of Etters, Pa., and a sister, Mary Ball
Martinez of Mexico.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Minnesota Vikings' wide receiver Cris Carter could
not control his emotions. As he walked off the field Sunday after
the Atlanta Falcons won the National Football Conference title in
overtime, 30-27, Carter burst into tears. Other Viking players were
crying, and some simply had stunned looks. Linebacker Ed McDaniel
kept mumbling, ``I can't believe this.''
</P>
<P>
   Believe. That is what the Falcons have done all season, and
there is almost a mystical quality to this team. In the preseason,
few picked the Falcons to win their division. Once they did, riding
an emotional high from the successful heart surgery undergone by
Coach Dan Reeves, few thought they could beat what was being called
one of the best teams of all time in the Vikings. Minnesota was too
fast, too explosive, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Falcons believed, and they gained the franchise's first
trip to the Super Bowl when Morten Andersen kicked a 38-yard field
with 3 minutes 8 seconds remaining in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings kicker, Gary Anderson, who had not missed on 122
field-goal and extra-point attempts since December 1997, narrowly
missed a 38-yard field-goal attempt with 2:07 left in the fourth
quarter and the Vikings leading by 27-20.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the Falcons believe, but they attacked against the
heavily favored Vikings. From Tim Dwight returning kicks from 5
yards deep in his end zone, to gutsy quarterback Chris Chandler
throwing bombs early then leading a John Elway-like game-winning
drive, to the Falcons' defense playing without fear against a
deadly Minnesota passing game, Atlanta acted as if this were a
pressure-less exhibition contest against the Indianapolis Colts,
not the NFC championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Now the extremely confident Falcons go to Super Bowl XXXIII in
Miami where they will play the Denver Broncos, who beat the Jets,
23-10.
</P>
<P>
   That game will feature the intriguing story line of Reeves
facing the franchise that he coached from 1981 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are underdogs in that game as well. Again, they will
hear about how they cannot win; how Reeves, making his fourth trip
to the championship game, lost three times with the Broncos, and
how Denver's Mike Shanahan will outcoach him. No matter. Atlanta
will keep believing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that Minnesota disrespected us but everyone else
did,'' said Jamal Anderson, the Falcons running back. ``We're the
first team to go on the road for the conference championship with a
14-2 record. We've got a 3,000-yard passer, two 1,000-yard
receivers, an 1,800-yard rusher and a defense that was No. 2 in the
NFL stopping the run, and everybody was saying, `Look at the
Vikings.' We want you to disrespect us, we want to be the
underdogs, but at the end of the game we'll be the ones smiling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, it's incredible when you think about it, coming from
1-7 halfway through your first year, to be in the Super Bowl in the
second year,'' said Reeves, who came to the Falcons from the Giants
in 1997. ``It's an unbelievable group of guys. They believe and
they work hard and do the things that you have to do, what you
preach as a coach.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those things is discipline. That is key when playing the
Vikings at the Metrodome. The crowd of 64,060, louder than a
trombone in a library, has rattled many teams. Yet Atlanta was
never shaken, probably because the Falcons also play in a dome.
</P>
<P>
   But their victory went beyond being cool under pressure. They
executed a brilliant game plan on both sides of the ball. While
many thought that stopping Anderson was the key, it was not.
Anderson had just 67 yards on 23 carries. Atlanta's plan all along
was to attack a weak Minnesota pass defense. Atlanta racked up 427
yards of offense, but only 110 on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler was brilliant, completing 27 of 43 passes for 340
yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions. Receivers Tony Martin
(5 catches for 129 yards) and Terance Mathis (6 catches for 73
yards and two touchdowns) found themselves single-covered much of
the afternoon. They destroyed the Vikings' secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the Falcons gave up some big plays early as
Minnesota jumped to a 17-7 lead midway through the second quarter.
Wide receiver Randy Moss had five catches for 71 yards and a
touchdown at the end of two quarters, but just one catch for four
yards in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   That was because the Falcons made a smart tactical decision in
double-teaming Carter and Moss and taking their chance against the
run. Running back Robert Smith (71 yards) did some damage, but
taking away the receivers eliminated Minnesota's big-play
capability.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a key part of the game,'' said Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   Moss said he had incurred a stomach injury, but maintained that
he was not really slowed by it.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear if the strategy on covering the wide receivers was
solely responsible for slowing Minnesota's offense, which had
scored 48, 40 and 41 points in its last three home games.
Quarterback Randall Cunningham seemed out of sync, especially late
in the game. At times, his arm looked tired, though he denied
fatigue played any part in his sub-par fourth-quarter performance.
</P>
<P>
   What may have hurt the Vikings more than anything was a crucial
turnover just before the first half ended. Up by 13 points with
1:17 left, the Vikings decided to go for the throat. But
Cunningham, after dropping back to pass, had his arm hit by
defensive end Chuck Smith. The ball popped loose and was recovered
by defensive lineman Travis Hall at the Minnesota 14-yard line.
Chandler hit Mathis for a touchdown on the next play.
</P>
<P>
   After that fumble, the Vikings would score on just one of their
next eight possessions.
</P>
<P>
   When Minnesota's Anderson _ 35 for 35 on field-goal attempts in
the regular season _ missed a 38-yard field goal that would have
given the Vikings a 10-point lead late in the fourth quarter, the
momentum changed.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler led Atlanta on an eight-play, 71-yard drive that
concluded with a 16-yard touchdown pass to Mathis with 49 seconds
remaining to tie the score.
</P>
<P>
   In the overtime, Chandler directed one of the best playoff
drives of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Neither offense could move the ball well early in the overtime.
Then Chandler got hot. He threw passes for 15, 26 and six yards,
and unlike Cunningham, he was not jittery in the pocket. He coolly
guided the Falcons on a 10-play, 70-yard drive, setting up the
game-winning field goal by Andersen.
</P>
<P>
   ``That drive, with just the one timeout, ranks up right there
with the drive we had in Cleveland,'' said Reeves, speaking of
Elway's last-minute heroics against the Browns in the American
Conference title game in 1986 when Reeves was coach in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   This game, in some ways, may be even more rewarding for Reeves
than that one. He had open heart surgery some five weeks ago, and
just being on the sideline this afternoon is practically a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his health now, Reeves replied, ``If I can
stand today, my heart must be in good shape.''

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS  &UR; _  &LR; The more you think about what unfolded here
Sunday afternoon, the more incredible the feat becomes. The noisy
Metrodome was quieted, millions of Minnesota hearts were broken,
the powerful Vikings were disposed of and the Atlanta Falcons, a
team with dreary history and little tradition, were headed to the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not what is most incredible. Sunday's stunning
overtime victory goes slightly beyond football and into the heart,
literally, of the Atlanta Falcons' coach.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-December, Dan Reeves was being wheeled into the
intensive-care unit after undergoing quadruple-bypass surgery. The
operation was a success, and the burning sensation in his throat
that had driven him to the doctor in the first place was gone. Five
weeks later Reeves was here, winded, slightly drawn, watching his
Falcons complete one of the most dramatic turnabouts in the
National Football League: 3-13 two seasons ago, 7-9 in Reeves'
first season and now a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Robinson, the Falcons' veteran safety, who is making his
second Super Bowl trip in three years, said of Reeves: ``The Lord
has shown favor to our coach, because he had a quadruple bypass,
and look at him. He's going to the Super Bowl again.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson sensed fate in Atlanta's victory. He said: ``My wife
said, `Wouldn't it be great if your coach goes to the Super Bowl
and has to play his old team, Denver?' I said that would be a nice
dream. She said, `It could happen.'''
</P>
<P>
   For all the praise placed at the feet of Bill Parcells and the
Jets, Reeves is amazing in his own right. He took three Denver
teams to the Super Bowl, then left after friction with John Elway.
In 1993 he took a reeling Giants team that had finished 6-10 a
season earlier and led them to an 11-5 record and a playoff berth,
and Reeves was voted coach of the year. He left after an impasse
with a rigid Giants hierarchy that refused to relinquish control.
</P>
<P>
   But what Reeves accomplished in Atlanta in two short seasons _
what Reeves accomplished Sunday _ was stunning. ``That was a great
game,'' said Reeves, who was once again selected coach of the year.
He clearly was drained from a game that had seen him burst with
intensity over bad calls and exhort his team in the face of
adversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five weeks ago I'm in the operating room,'' he said. ``I just
thank the good Lord for allowing me to witness an awesome football
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is incredible when you think about it: to come from 1-7
halfway through your first year, then be in the Super Bowl your
second year. This is great for the league, when a team like the
Atlanta Falcons can be in the Super Bowl. It gives everybody in
this league hope, that regardless of what your situation is you can
turn it around.''
</P>
<P>
   Few people _ and I was not one of them _ gave Atlanta a chance
to reach the Super Bowl. Not because the Falcons aren't good, but
because, well, because they are the Falcons. Each time the Vikings
scored Sunday, especially in the fourth quarter, when they went
ahead by 27-17, you figured the Vikings' scoring machine was about
to grind Atlanta's dreams to dust.
</P>
<P>
   But the Falcons have their coach's resolve, and the Vikings, at
the moment of truth, performed as if they were walking on egg
shells: very careful, very delicate. Very different from the
bombs-away team that had scored more points during the regular
season than any team in National Football League history.
</P>
<P>
   Things happen: Gary Anderson missed his first field goal in 46
attempts for Minnesota _ his first miss since Dec. 15, 1997, with
San Francisco _ and Atlanta scored with 49 seconds left to tie at
27-27. After taking one shot at a touchdown, the Vikings opted to
let the clock run out in regulation with 37 seconds left and take
their chances in sudden death.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Falcons are perched to win the organization's first
Super Bowl. The high-scoring Vikings, whose defense was ground to
powder, is left to consider an axiom that Reeves embodies: It is
not how much you can hand out that matters, but ultimately how much
you can endure.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had their chance,'' Reeves said. ``All you can say is
that they didn't get the job done, and we took advantage of the
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   When someone asked how he felt, Reeves, who turns 55 on Tuesday,
said: ``If I can stand today, my heart's got to be in great shape.
I found out today that I can't control my emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   After Morton Andersen's 38-yard field goal ended a fantastic
battle, Coach Dennis Green of the Vikings trotted over to the
Falcons sideline to offer congratulations, saving Reeves a trip he
didn't need to take. ``That showed a lot of class,'' Reeves said.
``There's exhilaration for yourself at times like this, but you
also understand that when there's excitement for you, there's
someone else who's really dying.''
</P>
<P>
   The news conference finally broke up. Reeves shook hands with
well-wishers and was about to jump into a cart for the ride back to
Atlanta's jubilant locker room when Randall Cunningham, the
Vikings' quarterback, passed by. They hugged. I think I overheard
Reeves say, ``Sorry.'' Cunningham said, ``God's taking care of
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves shrugged. ``I don't understand it,'' he said climbing
into the cart. ``But I'll take it.''

ANALYSIS :  WITH FOREIGN RESERVES DOWN, BRAZIL HAD TO FLOAT THE
REAL
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Md.) (See also BRAZIL-IMF) 
 (DW) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO  
  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ On the trading floor of the Sao Paulo
stock exchange, it led to a breathtaking buying spree. In
Washington, officials were relieved. But in Brazil, the
government's decision to stop protecting the currency that beat
hyperinflation signaled the end of a celebrated monetary plan that
promised to transform Latin America's biggest country into a modern
nation.
</P>
<P>
   The dream has been personified by President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso, a multilingual former sociology professor and finance
minister who has roamed world capitals and financial centers for
the last four years, selling his vision of a modern Brazil, intent
on reform and backed by a stable currency, the real.
</P>
<P>
   He told Brazilians, most of whom had never lived without runaway
prices, that inflation was the cruelest tax of all, striking the
poor whose salaries lost value by the hour.
</P>
<P>
   It complicated long-term investments and planning, so industry
failed to modernize, relying instead on trade barriers to keep out
cheaper imports. Brazilians rewarded Cardoso for his Real Plan's
success in beating hyperinflation by voting him president twice _ a
first for Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investors signed on, seeing in Brazil huge, untapped
market of 160 million for everything from telephones to
refrigerators, and potential base for exports to the rest of South
America. Direct foreign investment, $2 billion at the Real Plan's,
totaled $36 billion by last year.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Cardoso stood before his nation on television for two
and a half minutes, to say that he had done all he could to protect
the real by intervening on currency markets, but could no longer
spend foreign reserves that had dwindled to $30 billion from $75
billion in five months. The real would be free to float on world
markets.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate reaction was frenzied buying, which gave the Sao
Paulo Bovespa index its second-biggest rise in a single day: 33.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The only higher increase, 36.05 percent, occurred on Feb. 4,
1991, when the second phase of former President Fernando Collor de
Mello's economic plan was announced. He left office one step ahead
of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Now, while economists and industrialists debate the size of
price increases likely to hit stores this week and the possible
nature of ``Real Plan II,'' there is little disagreement about the
cause of the current failure.
</P>
<P>
   The Real Plan foundered on the same rocks that sank a half dozen
other plans to transform Brazil over the last 15 years: the
government's inability to maneuver reform past vested interests
that enjoy benefits and breaks Brazil cannot afford.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso said a year ago that his predecessor, Collor de Mello,
was drummed from office not so much for corruption as for angering
the elite by going too fast with reform. This president learned the
lesson, and navigated reform measures through Congress cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   Ten months into office, he turned his attention to winning a
constitutional amendment to permit his re-election, a complicated
process that cost political capital needed he would need later. In
doing so, he put off the further economic and political change
needed to make Brazil the modern nation of his vision.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Cardoso has been brought up short by the refusal of a
political rival, Itamar Franco, governor of the second-largest of
Brazil's 26 states, to make his state's payments to the federal
coffers. Franco's default has whipped up a wave of discontent among
opposition governors, who are now demanding that the federal
government renegotiate the terms of their debts.
</P>
<P>
   Much as Cardoso and his government may try to portray Friday's
move as a simple shifting of gears to juggle the concerns of those
who favor growth, and those who want a stable currency, there is
little sign that the president had any option but to surrender
stability he could no longer sustain.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the financial markets appeared pleased that Brazil
would no longer drain foreign reserves to bolster its currency. But
there was a sense of betrayal among those who had believed Brazil's
leaders when they repeatedly ruled out devaluation. What other
elements of his vision will Cardoso surrender?
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, it's the emperor has no clothes syndrome,''
said Riordan Roett, director of the Western Hemisphere Programs at
the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Cardoso administration has made important
progress.
</P>
<P>
   It pushed through measures to force government to lay off public
workers if a state's payroll exceeds 60 percent of its budget, and
has had partial success adopting laws that should trim the deficit
left by pensions that are more generous than the state can afford.
It has privatized state-owned mining, telecommunications and
utility companies, and cleaned up state-owned banks notoriously
used as political kitties by state governors.
</P>
<P>
   But the heart of the Real Plan, its raison-d'etre, was its goal
of curbing inflation that topped 2,500 percent a year before the
plan's creation in July 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Controlling the real's value in relation to the dollar, the
Brazilian government told the International Monetary Fund last
fall, was crucial to encouraging fiscal responsibility and fighting
inflation. With last week's 18 percent devaluation, the government
is likely to be urged to print money to ease a building recession
and pay off dollar-denominated debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has become a group of characters in search of a
play,'' said Alexandre Barros, a political consultant based in the
capital, Brasilia. ``They had the play of the Real Plan, based on
some premises, but those premises are not valid anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the level of government indebtedness now will be
exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso's dream for Brazil grew more expensive each year that it
remained unrealized, because _ without the fig leaf of inflation _
the government has had to borrow to cover its overspending.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Real Plan began in 1994, the Brazilian government had
no deficit to speak of, Demosthenes Madureira de Pinho Neto, the
Central Bank's director for International Relations, said in
October. Government agencies would rely on inflation to cure any
shortfalls, delaying adjustments in salaries for inflation and
using the money saved to cover overspending elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Without inflation, the budget deficit has ballooned, lumbering
now toward $65 billion, or 8 percent of the gross national product.
Brazil owes some $285 billion in domestic debt, much of it dollar
denominated, and $228 billion abroad, according to Brazil's
November letter to the IMF.

JUST WHAT CONSTITUTES A CONSUMER STRANGLEHOLD? 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Mass.) 
 (ko) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Microsoft trial is a high-stakes exercise in legal warfare,
and the witnesses are foot soldiers. On each side they are
advocates, committed to winning and thoroughly coached.
</P>
<P>
   And no one expects that honesty will be presented in its
undiluted form _ ``the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the
truth.'' Instead, the witnesses generally offer their facts and
opinions selectively.
</P>
<P>
   So when a moment of unbiased honesty occurred last week at the
trial in Washington, it seemed almost endearing.
</P>
<P>
   The government's final witness, Franklin M. Fisher, a
Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist, was asked if there
was any present harm to consumers as a result of Microsoft Corp.'s
business practices.
</P>
<P>
   That is difficult to measure, Fisher replied. But after pausing
a moment, he added, ``On balance, I'd think that the answer is no
up to this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Fisher did say that he thought that Microsoft's
restrictive contracts with computer makers and Internet service
suppliers had the effect of reducing choice in the market for
software used to browse the World Wide Web by unfairly blocking its
rival, Netscape Communications Corp., from key channels of
distribution. Yet his main point was that most of what he believes
will be the damage to consumers, in higher prices and reduced
choice, from Microsoft's actions will come in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Fisher's comment did underline where the two sides
differed on key issues. The government contends that Microsoft has
a ``choke hold'' on software distribution and that consumers will
be harmed unless it is reined in. Microsoft replies that the
government has produced no real proof on either front.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson must sift through the conflicting
assertions and evidence from both sides to reach a verdict, guided
in large measure by antitrust doctrine and the case law that has
built up around it. The challenge, though, is that just how the
doctrine and the case law apply to the Microsoft case is by no
means clear cut.
</P>
<P>
   Take the issue of consumer harm. Microsoft's leadoff witness,
Richard Schmalensee, dean of MIT's Sloan School of Management,
testified last week that there was no evidence of consumer damage
from Microsoft's conduct and the suggestion that there might be in
the future was ``sheer speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   In court, the government did produce evidence showing that the
price Microsoft charges computer makers for its Windows operating
system had increased in recent years, even as the price of other PC
components had declined. But Windows still accounts for less than 5
percent of the price of most PC's and, as Microsoft asserts, it has
improved Windows over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Showing measurable harm to consumers, antitrust experts say, is
less important in a federal antitrust suit than it would be in a
private case. The Justice Department and 19 states suing Microsoft,
unlike a private plaintiff, are not seeking financial damages.
Instead, they are seeking court-ordered sanctions to curb what they
say is Microsoft's abuse of its monopoly power.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, the government must convincingly show ``the power
and conditions from which injury can be inferred,'' said Herbert
Hovenkamp, a University of Iowa law professor and a consultant to
the government in the case. ``Under antitrust law, we assume that
markets operate more efficiently for the benefit of consumers under
competition,'' Hovenkamp said.,
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department charges that Microsoft's contracts with
computer makers and others unfairly limited Netscape's access to
key channels of distribution. Microsoft replies, as Schmalensee
testified, that it does not have ``any significant market power
over software distribution,'' noting that Netscape distributed more
than 100 million copies of its browser last year.
</P>
<P>
   Exclusive distribution deals, in most cases, are not illegal
providing they do not foreclose rivals from a significant share of
product distribution. Microsoft's argument is that despite its
deals, Netscape could widely distribute its browser over the
Internet, by direct mail and in its own deals.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court ruling in 1997, Omega Environmental Inc.
vs. Gilbarco Inc., does seem to support that stance. Gilbarco, a
leading producer of gasoline pumps, had exclusive deals with nearly
40 percent of the nation's gasoline pump distributors. But in
ruling for Gilbarco, the court noted that pump makers had other
possible channels of distribution, like selling directly to filling
stations. If competitors can reach consumers by other means, it
wrote, ``it is unclear whether such restrictions foreclose from
competition any part of the relevant market.''
</P>
<P>
   The government, however, argues that when a company, like
Microsoft, has a powerful monopoly position, the prosecution does
not have to show the company tied up, say, 40 percent or more of
the distribution. For monopolists, the Supreme Court endorsed a
stricter standard in 1985, ruling in Aspen Skiing Co. vs. Aspen
Highlands Skiing Corp. that a contract is illegal if it
``unnecessarily excludes or handicaps competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   The government also asserts that expense, difficulty and quality
of access to distribution are issues in determining whether
Microsoft's contracts unfairly exclude rivals. Downloading a
browser for an hour from a Web site is an alternative distribution
channel, it argues, but it is no match for getting a browser
bundled with Windows on a new PC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is pointing to all the other paths of distribution
and undoubtedly takes comfort from the Gilbarco case,'' said
William Kovacic, a professor at the George Washington University
Law School. ``But its contracts could still be found to be
significantly anticompetitive. The law is by no means absolutely
clear.''

COMMENTARY: CAST OF CHARACTER
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Theodore Kheel, the great New York labor mediator,
dropped by the other day to tell me about the ``industry
university'' movement. Ted's in his 80s now, cheerfully vigorous as
ever, and is getting unions and corporations together to help his
foundation finance at-home ``distance learning'' for workers via
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``You did a good job of public relations for me once,'' he
recalled. ``Remember the Lawyer's Committee for Civil Rights?''
</P>
<P>
   That was about four decades ago. I was a hotshot press agent in
my late 20s. Kheel, big in the Urban League, called to ask me to
publicize a meeting of lawyers to support an outfit that was having
its troubles in the South. It would have to be a freebie, but Ted
assured me I'd make some good contacts.
</P>
<P>
   I checked with a young lawyer pal with some political
experience. He made a few calls and reported back that the guy
Kheel was pushing was suspected by the FBI of being manipulated by
a Communist backer. Did I, a true believer in the presidential
prospects of Richard Nixon, want to risk being labeled, at the
start of my career, as a commie dupe?
</P>
<P>
   I ran this past another lawyer pal in my age cohort. He said
that my fears were unworthy, and that Kheel's list of attorneys
supporting civil rights included such legendary lights as Sol Gelb.
Not only should I handle it, he advised, but to show how strongly
he felt about it, he said I should put his name down on the
letterhead and he'd come with me to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   I told the first lawyer that is what I would do. He said to
relax and go ahead and help Kheel publicize the guy's cause; he'd
loyally vouch for me if anybody said I was a pinko.
</P>
<P>
   We had a so-so turnout at the press conference following the
organizing meeting. The civil rights leader was civil and not very
militant. Because I felt presumptively guilty at what would be a
tepid response in the New York City media, I told the civil rights
leader I would follow up with a release.
</P>
<P>
   That meant I had to write up the formation of the group with a
little bit about what the rights outfit was doing. The leader _ a
fellow my age, short, serious _ filled me in as we stood on a
corner of Fifth Avenue in the Sixties.
</P>
<P>
   In my mind's eye, I could envision the FBI's secretly
photographing a black militant and his white flack conspiring to
overthrow the government, while some redneck on the other corner
got ready to take a pop at us. My agitator ``client'' sensed my
discomfort and told me, smiling, he got that creepy feeling often.
</P>
<P>
   The astute reader will have figured out some of the characters
in today's essay.
</P>
<P>
   The first lawyer was Roy Cohn. As a legman for the Tex and Jinx
McCrary column in The New York Herald Tribune, I covered his early
success in getting narcotics convictions at the U.S. attorney's
office; it had been his first press clip and he never forgot it.
Cohn's sources had been dead right about the FBI suspicion of my
civil rights leader. Roy's friend, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover,
later persuaded Attorney General Robert Kennedy to authorize a
wiretap, its renewal signed by his deputy, Nicholas Katzenbach,
which gave the color of law to subsequent bugging of the leader's
hotel rooms by state agencies seeking to besmear him. (Ironically,
Katzenbach was chosen by Democrats for expert testimony in the
House's impeachment inquiry.)
</P>
<P>
   My other lawyer-friend was Morton Janklow, now the literary
agent for every best-selling author from Danielle Steel to the
pope. Still a civil libertarian, he's remained my lawyer and agent
through the years _ not least because of his good, gutsy judgment
to call attention to a passionately peaceful man seeking to improve
America.
</P>
<P>
   The civil rights leader filling me in on the corner was, of
course, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. No pretense herein intended
that I did anything of substance in the civil rights revolution; I
did not do nearly enough. But in retrospect, I'm glad to have
ushered Jackie Robinson in to urge Nixon to call Dr. King in jail
in 1960, which the candidate mistakenly declined as
``grandstanding.'' Eight years later, after the assassination, I
reminded the candidate of that omission, as he was debating whether
to attend the King funeral; Nixon went.
</P>
<P>
   I still think of him as ``Martin''; we were the same age, all of
us. The lesson to today's ambitious young networkers: Do not fret
about associating yourself with a dedicated dissident, and one day
you may have a personal reason to celebrate a national holiday.

PENTAGON BACKS OFF ON ARMS INSPECTOR'S BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Defense Department announced Sunday that it was
dropping its demand that Scott Ritter, a former United Nations arms
inspector in Iraq, provide the Pentagon with advance copies of a
book in which he is expected to step up his criticism of the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   The Department said that a Pentagon letter to Ritter last month
demanding that his book be submitted for a prepublication security
review had been sent in error and that there had been no attempt to
intimidate him.
</P>
<P>
   David J. Rigby, a spokesman for the Defense Threat Reduction
Agency, the Pentagon unit that prepared the letter, said it was
written by a middle manager in the agency's contracting office and
``does not accurately reflect the agency's position.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure you that there was no senior-level involvement in
this from within the Department of Defense,'' he said of the
preparation of the Dec. 23 letter. ``There was no intention of
trying to intimidate Ritter.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Ritter, Matthew Lifflander, said he welcomed the
Pentagon's announcement Sunday but was still concerned that Ritter
was the target of efforts by the Clinton administration to
intimidate him into silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy that the Defense Department has come to its
senses,'' he said. ``I think they were very embarrassed at being
caught at this. But I think some very powerful forces out there are
still very upset with Scott.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritter, a former Marine intelligence officer, resigned last
summer from the U.N. Special Commission, the agency that oversaw
the search for chemical, biological and nuclear weapons in Iraq. He
has since accused the United States of having undermined the
inspections because of a vacillating policy on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Simon &AMP; Schuster announced that it would publish a
book by Ritter, tentatively titled ``Endgame,'' in which he would
detail some of his work for the United Nations and offer proposals
to the United States and other nations about how to contain Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter had been under contract to the Defense Department while
working on loan from the U.S. government to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   In its letter last month, the department demanded that Ritter
provide it with copies of the book at least 60 days before
publication and reminded him of his ``contractual obligations'' not
to divulge any information, classified or unclassified, that he
obtained while working at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Although their constitutionality is questioned by lawyers,
Pentagon contracts routinely require contractors to submit to a
prepublication security review of books and other materials that
touch on their work for the government.
</P>
<P>
   Rigby, the spokesman for the Defense Threat Reduction Agency,
said he did not know why the agency had decided not to demand that
Ritter comply with the requirement.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that the agency was ``concerned by the tone'' of the
letter and that ``it may not reflect our current position on the
issue of security reviews.'' The agency would still welcome an
advance copy of Ritter's book ``to assist him in insuring that no
classified information is disclosed,'' he said. ``But that is not a
demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Rigby said the agency decided to reverse itself on the demand
after inquiries last week from The New York Times, which had been
provided with a copy of the Dec. 23 letter by Ritter's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Lifflander, the lawyer, said Sunday that he was ``confident that
there's no classified information in the book'' and that Ritter
would now consider submitting the book for a security review ``so
long as it doesn't delay the publication date.'' Simon &AMP; Schuster
has said it expects to release the book in late March.

HARVEY MILLER, 63, COMEDY WRITER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y.)   (ko) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harvey Miller, a film and television comedy writer who was
nominated for an Academy Award for his collaboration on ``Private
Benjamin,'' died on Jan. 8 at his home in Los Angeles. He was 63
and had a second home in East Hampton, Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   While working as a social director for a hotel in the Catskills,
Miller liked to say, he became fascinated that men could attract
beautiful women simply by telling jokes. Eager to try his hand, he
pitched a three-page routine to comedian Vaughn Meader, who paid
him, to his amazement, $300. His talent was confirmed by stand-up
comedians like Dick Gregory, Shecky Green, Alan King and Sandy
Baron, who hired him to write their jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Miller moved to Hollywood in 1967 to work with Baron on the
``Hey Landlord!'' television series. With that show, he began a
longstanding relationship with the writing-producing team of Jerry
Belson and Garry Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, he became the writer, producer and director of ``The
Odd Couple,'' for which he received two Emmy Award nominations. He
also was nominated for an Emmy for ``Love, American Style,'' and
wrote and directed other hit series, including ``Taxi'' and ``The
Tracey Ullman Show.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, with Nancy Meyers and Charles Shyer, Miller wrote and
produced ``Private Benjamin,'' starring Goldie Hawn. The picture
was a box office success and earned the trio an Academy Award
nomination for best original screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   His other film credits included writing and directing ``Getting
Away With Murder'' and ``Bad Medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller is survived by a brother, Stanley Howard of Delray Beach,
Fla.

GAYLE YOUNG, 63, BALLET DANCER IN LEADING ROLES AND AS PARTNER 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.H., N.Y., Ky, Calif.)   By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gayle Young, a principal dancer with American Ballet Theater who
partnered such leading ballerinas as Margot Fonteyn and Cynthia
Gregory, died on Jan. 8 at Cottage Hospital in Woodsville, N.H. He
was 63 and lived in Haverhill, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was emphysema, said Darryl Dodson, his companion.
</P>
<P>
   Young was a tall, lean dancer whose quietly sympathetic manner
made him a natural lead dancer and partner in Antony Tudor's
dramatic ballets.
</P>
<P>
   He performed many of those roles during his 21-year career with
Ballet Theater, which he joined in 1960 as a corps dancer. He also
danced lead roles in ``Giselle,'' ``Swan Lake,'' ``Coppelia'' and
``The Nutcracker,'' and in ballets by Agnes de Mille.
</P>
<P>
   He played the father in a television version of ``The
Nutcracker.'' The ballerinas Young partnered also included Sallie
Wilson, Marcia Haydee, Lupe Serrano, Lynn Seymour and Maria
Tallchief.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Lexington, Ky., Young studied dance with Dorothy Prince
while a student at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Joffrey Ballet in 1958 and performed with the New
York City Ballet in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Young was a professor of dance at the State University of New
York at Purchase for the last 16 years. He also staged ballets for
companies throughout the world, most recently Bronislava Nijinska's
production of ``Les Noces'' for the National Ballet of Holland, the
Paris Opera Ballet, the Vienna State Opera Ballet and the Berlin
Opera Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   He also restored historic homes in New England and ran an
antiques business in Haverhill. In addition to Dodson, Young is
survived by a brother, Eugene, of Tenafly, N.J. &QL;

A SWINGING BRIDGE TO SPAN THE GENERATIONS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Mich., Calif., Texas, Fla., N.Y.)   (jw) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Madison Avenue is learning to sing, sing, sing _ with a swing.
</P>
<P>
   Swing sounds are becoming the music of choice in an increasing
number of campaigns for mainstream advertisers. Television and
radio commercials are reverberating with the voices of such vintage
vocalists as Louis Prima, Tony Bennett, Cab Calloway, Ella
Fitzgerald and Frank Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
   Marketers are also showing interest in the big bands of
musicians like Glenn Miller, Count Basie, the Dorseys, Duke
Ellington, Artie Shaw and Benny Goodman _ whose ``Sing, Sing, Sing
(With a Swing)'' may be the unofficial anthem of the trend _ as
well as in contemporary bands that reinterpret the swing music of
the 1930s and 1940s. Among them: the Brian Setzer Orchestra, Big
Bad Voodoo Daddy, Royal Crown Revue and Squirrel Nut Zippers.
</P>
<P>
   One agency, Devon Direct Marketing and Advertising in Berwyn,
Pa., even sent out holiday cards last month that resembled old
swing record albums and made swing the theme of its annual employee
party.
 &UR;  &LR; The ad boom comes after the recent revival for everything swing,
from dance clubs to hats for men to cocktails, fueled in part by
the 1996 film ``Swingers.'' That is indicative of the magpie nature
of consumer marketing, which raids popular culture for bright,
shiny objects to feather its nest.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, myriad music genres have always been sources of
soundtracks to peddle products by, as evinced by campaigns set to
rock 'n' roll, Motown, folk, opera and rap.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that swing is popular makes it relevant,'' said
Gunnar Wilmot, executive vice president at McCann-Erickson
Worldwide Advertising, who is also managing director at
McCann-Erickson Detroit in Troy, Mich., the longtime agency for the
Buick division of the General Motors Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the fact it's a resurgence makes it relevant to our older
Buick buyers as well as to the young,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   For Buick, McCann-Erickson Detroit _ part of the McCann-Erickson
World Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies _ created a
promotion carrying the theme ``Swing Into '99.'' Commercials
presented images of couples dancing to swing music, which were
echoed in an accompanying print campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for us to get both traditional buyers and
nontraditional buyers to respond to the same message,'' Wilmot
said. ``This really bridged the gap.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of which, Gap Inc. and its in-house agency are the
kings of ad swing, a result of a widely praised television
commercial that began running in April to promote khaki pants sold
at Gap stores. The spot, titled ``Khakis Swing,'' featured a group
of young, khaki-clad dancers performing acrobatic maneuvers to the
Prima recording of ``Jump, Jive an' Wail.''
</P>
<P>
   Swing is ``very energetic,'' said Michael McCadden, executive
vice president for global marketing at Gap in San Francisco. ``Its
ebullience calls you in from the next room.''
</P>
<P>
   The volume of letters, calls and e-mails hailing the commercial
was ``pretty unprecedented,'' he added, so it was brought back in
late summer for a second run.
</P>
<P>
   McCadden agreed with Wilmot about the multigenerational appeal
of swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``For young people who are not that familiar with it,'' McCadden
said, ``it sounds faintly `retro' but at the same time new. And for
their parents' generation, it's bringing back the past in a new
light.''
 &UR;  &LR; That dual appeal influenced the Seagram Americas unit of the
Seagram Co &UR; .  &LR;  to sponsor ``Chivas Swings,'' a promotion for its
Chivas Regal brand of Scotch whisky centered on a mobile stage,
which brings a troupe of swing dancers dressed in period garb _
baggy pants and twirling skirts _ to perform on city streets and in
bars and lounges in markets like Dallas, Houston, Miami and New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are getting dressed up and going out again, dancing and
drinking the classic cocktails,'' said Bob Dubin, Scotch category
manager for Seagram Americas in New York. ``That's where Chivas
Regal fits in.''
</P>
<P>
   Setzer, leader of the Setzer Orchestra, has also been signed to
an endorsement agreement with Chivas Regal that includes
sponsorship of his coming tour and a print campaign by the New York
office of TBWA/Chiat/Day, owned by Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason we decided to go with Brian and not another swing
band is the staying power he brings to the party,'' Dubin said,
referring to Setzer's previous musical incarnation with the Stray
Cats rock group. ``We did not want to be caught up in a fad.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, marketers' keenness for swing has waxed and waned
through the decades. During its first go-round, big brands
sponsored the radio shows of the big bands and swing singers. They
included Camel cigarettes for ``Benny Goodman's Swing School,''
Lever Brothers and Max Factor for ``The Frank Sinatra Show'' and
Lucky Strike cigarettes for ``Your Hit Parade.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, cigarette marketers are unlikely partners for swing
musicians. But the ties between swinging and swigging have inspired
Seagram Americas to promote a drink named after the Setzer
Orchestra's hit album, ``The Dirty Boogie,'' which features
Setzer's version of ``Jump, Jive an' Wail.''
</P>
<P>
   The cocktail, the Chivas dirty boogie, is a concoction of
Scotch, club soda and cherry juice.

DISPUTE STALLS SOFTBALL PROJECT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ By now, ground was supposed to be broken on the
``Field of Dreams'' softball complex at Cal State Northridge, but
the ongoing fight over the location of a proposed football field
has stalled the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the perception of the football stadium,'' said Steven
Soboroff, president of the Los Angeles City Recreation and Parks
Commission and a senior adviser to Mayor Richard Riordan. ``I'm
letting them run their course.''
</P>
<P>
   Soboroff is the point man in raising the $2 million to build the
1,500-seat facility, which will be used by the CSUN softball team
and area youths. Recently, Soboroff secured a $250,000 donation
from a local business and said the remaining funds would come from
naming rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would move a little bit faster if they were committed to
one specific site,'' Soboroff said. ``They don't want to mix the
perception of the women's field with what's going on with the
football stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   The site committee for the football field will meet for the
final time on Thursday, and it's expected the 12-member panel will
recommend to CSUN president Blenda Wilson that the 8,000-seat
stadium be placed on the North Campus.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, a determination can be made for the location of
the new softball field. Soboroff previously stated the location
would be just off Zelzah Avenue between the tennis courts and
student dorms. But the field might be built on its current site.
</P>
<P>
   Soboroff said the facility could still be ready for the 2000
season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Officials in quandary: When former CSUN women's basketball
coach Michael Abraham showed up at the Matadors' Jan. 7 game at
Portland State, the game officials weren't sure how to handle the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   According to Portland State officials, Abraham sat in the third
row across from CSUN's bench. But Portland State officials said
Abraham spoke to several players at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The three officials who worked the game _ Ernie Yarbrough, Laura
Rahe and Rick Showers _ did nothing during the game. But a call was
placed to Marla Denham, the coordinator of women's officials for
the Big Sky Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report we got was he was on the floor coaching at
halftime,'' Big Sky assistant commissioner Ron Loghry said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Loghry said further inquiries didn't find Abraham was
on the floor coaching during the game.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham resigned from CSUN in November in the wake of being
indicted on drug-trafficking charges by the FBI, but the case is
pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't been found guilty of anything, so he can be at the
game,'' Loghry said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Searching for a redshirt: Football coach Ron Ponciano said
CSUN is looking into the possibility of petitioning the NCAA for an
extra year of eligibility for junior nose guard Sean Beard.
</P>
<P>
   Beard suffered a season-ending broken leg in the first quarter
of the Matadors' fourth game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   According to NCAA rules, a player is eligible for a medical
redshirt if he/she played in 25 percent or less of his/her team's
games.
</P>
<P>
   Though Beard played in more than 25 percent, Ponciano said he's
hopeful the NCAA will grant Beard an exception because the injury
took place in the first quarter on ``an illegal block.''
</P>
<P>
   Beard broke the leg against Southern Utah when he was the victim
of an illegal chop block.
</P>
<P>
   __ Volleyball redshirts: Men's volleyball coach Jeff Campbell
said former Daily News first-team pick Jeff Toon, a Kennedy High
product and a freshman with the Matadors, is slated to redshirt
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Omer Samiri, a Chatsworth High and Pierce College
product, is scheduled to undergo major shoulder surgery. Campbell
is hopeful Samiri can return next season.
</P>
<P>
   Also, one-time Royal High star Steve Russell hasn't been cleared
to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's eligibility problems he has to get cleared up,''
Campbell said. ``It has nothing to do with his high school
grades.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Appearing here recently as the Wizard in a stage
show of ``The Wizard of Oz,'' Mickey Rooney stopped in at City Hall
to present Mayor Edward Rendell with a special souvenir.
</P>
<P>
   As he accepted a ceremonial key to Oz, Rendell took a moment to
congratulate the 78-year-old actor for a lifetime of charitable
work. Rooney was taken aback by the mayor's remarks. ``I'm not
through yet,'' he insisted, prompting Rendell to cut him off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep telling people here I'm not through yet, either,''
Rendell said.
</P>
<P>
   Embarking upon the last of his eight years as Philadelphia's
mayor and foremost cheerleader, a period of major economic and
psychological turnaround for the city, Rendell, a Democrat, hardly
seems ready to relinquish his reputation for drawing a spotlight to
cities as the economic engine of a metropolitan region. (Rendell
cannot run for re-election; Philadelphia has term limits.)
</P>
<P>
   There is a budget to balance. Policing strategies under a new
commissioner are still evolving. Thousands of untrained and
illiterate people are coming off the city welfare rolls this year.
Public schools need more money. And the city still needs to attract
businesses to sustain seven years of economic development.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the five things I want to do this year,'' the mayor
said in an interview the day after Rooney's visit.
</P>
<P>
   But if Rendell's achievements reflect a job well done, they also
stand as a formidable challenge for his potential successors.
</P>
<P>
   Five Democrats and one Republican are searching for issues to
run on this year while not appearing critical of a politician so
popular and effective that investors who watch municipal bond
ratings are beginning to wonder if his successor can match his
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants to distance themselves from what has happened
over the last six or seven years,'' said John Street, who resigned
as City Council president last month, after 18 years on the
council, to run for mayor.
</P>
<P>
   For all the candidates' desires to continue the momentum built
by Rendell, the election comes at a critical time for Philadelphia,
whose population, 1.47 million, reflects the loss of nearly 90,000
people to the suburbs and beyond since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Like other big cities with eroding populations and constant
social-service needs, Philadelphia is learning to do more with
less. It also finds itself competing with cities in the same
predicament for new industries, federal grants, even conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's successful pitch for the Republican convention in
2000, beating out New York and several other cities, was considered
a major victory for a city with a strong Democratic mayor, a
Democratic majority in the City Council and more than three times
as many registered Democrats as Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia won the prize in part because of its enormous
economic development in recent years: the new hotels, restaurants
and cultural institutions that have bloomed throughout the downtown
and waterfront areas. This year alone, 13 big hotels are scheduled
to open.
</P>
<P>
   But with those projects in the works, along with others like a
planned Disney entertainment complex and renovations for
Independence Mall, Rendell's successor is not likely to have as
many glamorous ventures to promote. The next mayor is almost
certain to confront decidedly unglamorous issues like revamping the
schools, expanding downtown development into neighborhoods and
figuring how to accommodate the 60,000 city residents who will
begin to lose welfare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed Rendell needed to be part cheerleader,'' said Charles
Pizzi, president of the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce.
``But now the ship is under wind, and the next mayor is going to
have to go below the deck to make sure it's still sailing.''
</P>
<P>
   As Rendell's partner on countless initiatives over the years,
Street has won the mayor's endorsement, which makes him one of the
favorites in the Democratic primary in May.
</P>
<P>
   But just as Rendell conceded that ``any of the candidates would
make a good mayor,'' the Democrats, at least, are expecting a
lively battle over the next few months. As the lone Republican, Sam
Katz, an expert on municipal finance, has no opponent in his
party's primary.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, all the candidates are focusing on improving
schools and public safety and on lowering a hated wage tax. And the
ways they approach those challenges are not altogether different.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, they are largely selling experience and leadership
qualities as much as solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Street, 55, who was council president for the last six years,
presents himself as Rendell's partner in the city's leap from an
accumulated deficit of more than $200 million in 1991 to six
consecutive years of surpluses, each a city record, including the
current $169 million. Street shepherded through many major pieces
of legislation that changed the city's physical as well as fiscal
condition.
</P>
<P>
   But other Democratic candidates contend that they have skills
that are just as valuable. Happy Fernandez, 59, the only woman
running, has been a member of the council since 1991. She describes
herself as ``a valued member of the Rendell-council team''
responsible for the city's fiscal recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Weinberg, 61, is a former city solicitor and was a close
adviser to former Mayor Frank Rizzo. Now the head of a large law
firm, he has made the overhaul of the school system a priority,
proposing that the school board become more accountable to the
mayor. He also wants to give police officers more training and
educational opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   As the only state legislator in the Democratic field, Dwight
Evans, 44, has also made schools a priority. He claims to have the
best leadership skills, pointing to his role in inviting the former
New York City police commissioner William Bratton to Philadelphia
to discuss crime fighting. The invitation ultimately led to the
city's hiring last year of John Timoney, Bratton's deputy, as
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   The other Democrat, John White Jr., 49, has served in a variety
of public service roles. He has been a member of the state
Legislature and the City Council and most recently was executive
director of the Philadelphia Housing Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Now an executive with a real estate development firm, White has
made improvements to the school system a cornerstone of his
campaign, promoting safety, after-school programs and an education
guaranteed to prepare students for a job or college.
</P>
<P>
   Katz, 49, who was a financial adviser to Rendell in his first
term, is facing the daunting task of becoming the city's first
Republican mayor since Bernard Samuel won election in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Katz is an enthusiastic supporter of Rendell. But he points out
that the city's population decline reflects problems that have to
be corrected, especially the crime rate and the underperformance of
children in the public school system.
</P>
<P>
   Katz lost in previous races for mayor and governor. But,
pointing to Republican mayors like Rudolph Giuliani in New York and
Richard Riordan in Los Angeles, he contends that the time is right
for a Republican in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say all the time that a Republican can't win here,'' he
said. ``That's silly, self-serving Democratic poppycock. You put
the better candidate out there, and it won't matter what the party
label is.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN _ Martin McGuinness, the chief negotiator for the
political wing of the Irish Republican Army, said Sunday that the
growing crisis in the Northern Ireland peace effort would be
resolved by the end of March, the target date for the British
government to return home-rule powers to the northern British
province of Ulster.
</P>
<P>
   The Northern Ireland Assembly, a mix of officials of the
Protestant majority and the Roman Catholic minority, is to begin
debate on Monday over the agreement reached by their leaders last
month on the new political structures for the province. The leaders
have set Feb. 15 as a deadline for approval. That would give the
British and Irish governments time to change their laws to permit
the transfer of power by the middle of March.
</P>
<P>
   The Protestant deputy leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, John
Taylor, said the effort to approve the home-rule agreement had no
better than a 50-50 chance of succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   But McGuinness, the chief negotiator for and No. 2 official of
Sinn Fein, the IRA political wing, said the impasse would be ended
by mid-March. By then, he said, his party would have ministers
taking part in the return of powers that Britain has exercised
directly from London since 1974. Since then, Northern Irish
officials have controlled only garbage removal and burial of the
dead.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on BBC radio, McGuinness did not, however, offer
a specific solution to the problem of IRA disarmament.

 &HT;    Broncos earn a return
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Of the 14 Denver Broncos quickly surveyed following
their 23-10 victory over the New York Jets in the AFC Championship
Game here Sunday evening, none was even remotely cognizant of the
Branch Rickey suggestion that luck is the residue of design.
</P>
<P>
   No matter, since Denver wide receivers Ed McCaffrey and Rod
Smith demonstrated on the game's signature play that it doesn't
require familiarity with axioms that are four decades old when you
know coach Mike Shanahan's game plan well enough to overcome what
should have been a forgettable formation faux pas.
</P>
<P>
   The 47-yard grab by McCaffrey on the botched play revived the
slumbering Broncos and sparked a 20-point third-quarter explosion
that lifted them into Super Bowl XXXIII in two weeks against the
Atlanta Falcons. In a matchup certain to dredge up the lingering
acrimony between the Shanahan-John Elway tandem and Falcons coach
Dan Reeves, the Broncos can become the seventh franchise to claim
consecutive Super Bowl titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until that big pass play, though, I didn't think we had a
chance,'' said Broncos tailback Terrell Davis, who rushed for 167
yards on 32 carries. ``Put a big red circle around that play,
because it turned everything around for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The play came with the Broncos trailing 10-0 and 11:45 remaining
in the third quarter. Shanahan and offensive coordinator Gary
Kubiak signaled in a deep play-action pass in a desperate attempt
to jump-start a moribund attack that had totaled just 120 yards to
that point and been overwhelmed by another clever game plan from
Jets defensive coordinator Bill Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith, who was to run a post pattern from the left side of
the set, lined up right. McCaffrey, supposed to clear ou the deep
middle of the secondary with an intermediate crossing route,
aligned to the left side of the formation. With the play-clock
close to expiration, Elway didn't have time to flip-flop the
receivers. Instead, he looked over to Smith, who nodded that he
understood he now had to run McCaffrey's route.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the snap, Elway whispered to McCaffrey to run the
post-route. The result was a little Mile High magic in what almost
certainly was Elway's last appearance at the raucous stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have been an incredible (screw-up) had we let it
be,'' said McCaffrey. ``Instead it turned out to be just the kind
of play we needed to get us going.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Broncos had run Davis off-tackle most of the
afternoon from the same set _ two tight ends, two wideouts and just
a single back _ the Jets defense anticipated another rushing play.
When strong safety Victor Green ill-advisedly moved forward to
defend Smith on the crossing route, McCaffrey sneaked behind
everyone by five yards.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, Denver got on the scoreboard on Elway's 11-yard
rocket to fullback Howard Griffith. The ice was broken and so was
the New York defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Games can turn on one play and we saw that today,'' said Jets
strongside linebacker Mo Lewis, the former University of Georgia
standout who had six tackles and a pair of passes defensed. `` They
set the trap, we took the bait and . . . the next time we looked
up, they had a 20 on the scoreboard where the zero had been.''
</P>
<P>
   The final score certainly overshadowed a brutal performance by
Elway, who completed just 13 of 34 passes for 173 yards and had
four attempts batted back in his face. At the behest of Shanahan,
the future Hall of Fame quarterback took a victory lap around the
track ringing the field. As he started his slow jog, McCaffrey
noted a crowd of fans who might delay the moment and pointed Elway
in the opposite direction. ``Good thing I didn't go the way I had
started,'' Elway agreed afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, luck and design had struck again.

   Not coming soon to your local B. Dalton: ``Whoa Nellie! The
Keith Jackson Story.''

   The now-retired ABC college football play-calling legend calls
the next part of his life a ``blank page,'' but it won't be filled
with autobiographical gobbledygook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been approached a few times, but I've chosen not to do a
book,'' he said. ``Don't think I know how to. I've seen old friends
start 'em and when they get to the end, they're staring at the

   ``Besides, in today's marketplace, it's hard to do one without

In land of unlikely, Falcons pull off `unthunkable' (For use by
NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ This is, after all, the land of the unlikely.
Around here, logic usually ends up buried in a snowbank.
</P>
<P>
   Like how can an ice hockey team fail in Minnesota only to become
an NHL success way down there in Texas?
</P>
<P>
   Or how can the state's new governor, who took the oath of office
on Saturday, be a cheesy former pro wrestler? At his inauguration
party, Jesse (The Body) Ventura once again reminded all of
Minnesota that him being elected ``shocked the world.''
</P>
<P>
   It was just 24 hours later, however, when even the flashy
Ventura was totally upstaged. Sunday at the Metrodome, the Atlanta
Falcons provided a more proper example of ``shocking the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In the state house, Minnesota will certainly survive Jesse. Hey,
it's only politics. But in the life-and-death world of the NFL
postseason, there may never be recovery for this part of the globe
after the beloved Vikings took such a mighty and unexpected fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would have thunk it. . .who indeed would have thunk it,''
screamed Falcons safety Eugene Robinson after Atlanta's outrageous
30-27 overtime upset in the NFC Championship Game.
</P>
<P>
   As an 11-point underdog, this Falcons victory was
``unthunkable.'' But if beating the Vikings ranked as one of those
against-all-odds propositions, it still doesn't compare to the
Falcons' Super Bowl hopes back in late August. Jesse Ventura had a
better chance of being elected president than Atlanta playing in
Miami on the final Sunday in January.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``Dirty Bird'' will now migrate far south. For the first
time in franchise history the forever-futile Falcons are no more,
because they're going to the Super Bowl. And, by gosh, it's no
fluke, either, not after a 14-2 regular season, a win over the
49ers in the playoffs, and now ``this.''
</P>
<P>
   In 72 minutes of all-action-all-the-time football, what happened
here Sunday will be remembered as one of the greatest games ever
played, not to mention producing one of the most improbable
winners.
</P>
<P>
   Until overtime, both teams were constantly role-playing. The
Vikings gave repeated indications, starting in the first half, of
using their nuclear offense to blow this one open. In contrast, the
Falcons appeared to be doing a Francois Botha imitation _ hanging
around, but still knowing the knockout punch was coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had all those chances to put it away, and couldn't,'' said
Minnesota coach Dennis Green, who had his can't-win-the-big-one
reputation expanded. ``Our guys wanted to win very badly. There is
no question of 100 percent being given at all times.''
</P>
<P>
   True. This was hardcore playoff effort on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   But offensive frustration, the most unlikely of all negatives
for the Vikings, started to build in the fourth quarter, and
certainly prevailed in overtime. Which, of course, is a huge credit
to coach Dan Reeves' defensive staff and players.
</P>
<P>
   Except for one drive at the end of the fourth quarter, Vikings
running back Robert Smith was erased as a weapon. To do this was
considered highly unlikely because Atlanta couldn't consistently
use a safety to shore up the front seven. The safeties had to help
in coverage due to the duo of Randy Moss and Cris Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Except super-rookie Moss also disappeared, as did his loud
mouth. After a big first half, Moss had one catch in the last 42
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, meanwhile, was held to 71 yards on 21 carries, and 44 of
them came on that one drive in the fourth quarter. It should have
been enough to salt down the win, except Gary Anderson shanked a
38-yard field-goal attempt with just over two minutes left in
regulation. That was an indication the football gods were smiling
on Atlanta. Anderson hadn't missed a kick all season.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a 10-point lead, and a celebration, the Vikings held
a 7-point margin, 27-20. Chris Chandler, six times a reject of
other teams during his career, became Roger Staubach at that point.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler whipped the Falcons downfield for the tying score, and
in overtime, launched a long drive to set up Morten Andersen's
clutch 38-yard game winner.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings' unheralded defense kept Minnesota in the game
throughout the second half, but couldn't hold off Chandler and Co.
forever.
</P>
<P>
   It was assumed the Falcons wouldn't win if running back Jamal
Anderson didn't carry them. That assumption was wrong. Anderson was
roadblocked, getting 67 yards in 23 carries. That left it up to
Chandler and his receivers to match the Vikings on the scoreboard.
And finally surpass the Falcons on the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, an all-time favorite in Dallas, has done miracle
coaching work in Atlanta, and, by the way, the surgically corrected
heart apparently pumps better than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thank the Lord I was here to watch this,'' said Reeves,
who had by-pass surgery five weeks ago. Laughing, Reeves added,
``if I can handle this, I can handle anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly what his Falcons are thinking for the Super
Bowl.

 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will propose in his State of the
Union message on Tuesday the most aggressive nationwide effort ever
to bring greater accountability to state and local school systems,
potentially affecting the allocation of billions of dollars in
federal education aid, White House officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to devote the bulk of his speech to the challenges
of educating the largest school-age population in American history
and insuring the welfare of aging citizens, officials said in
interviews over the weekend. Clinton will propose a set of rewards
for school districts that set high standards for teachers, enforce
guidelines for student promotions and closely monitor school
performance.
</P>
<P>
   The president had no plans to address his impeachment trial in
the Senate or the actions which occasioned it, aides said, even
though he will be speaking to the nation after his lawyers complete
their first day of arguments in rebuttal to the charges of perjury
and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers said Clinton is painfully aware of the awkward timing
of the speech, but chose to press ahead to demonstrate to the
American people that he is determined to carry out the business of
the nation even as Congress weighs the ultimate constitutional
sanction against him.
</P>
<P>
   The speech takes on a greater significance than usual because
Clinton will not, as in years past, be simply laying out a policy
wish list for the coming year. He will be making a plea to the
American people, and to history, to judge him on the nation's
progress and his performance in office rather than on his evident
personal failings.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will devote roughly a quarter of the address to foreign
policy and military matters, aides said. He will propose a major
initiative to help local governments prepare for a biological
weapons attack, providing federal money for early detection systems
and to begin stockpiling vaccines to combat biological warfare
agents, a senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   He will also propose an expanded effort to safeguard nuclear
weapons in Russia and other former Soviet states, going well beyond
existing programs to find new jobs for Russian weapons scientists
and to help convert Russian military complexes to civilian uses,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But the bulk of the speech will address domestic issues, chief
among them education, Social Security and other programs for the
elderly. Aides said Clinton would likely spell out broad principles
for strengthening Social Security but would not yet propose a
specific plan to address the looming deficits in the retirement
program.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leaders of the Senate and House, Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill., wrote to Clinton Sunday demanding to see a detailed Social
Security plan ``as soon as possible,'' and telling him that the
House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee
would hold a joint session on March 1 to receive his proposal.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said, however, that Clinton was not yet
ready to advance a Social Security solution that goes far beyond
repeating last year's pledge to reserve the federal budget surplus
until a means is found to shore up the retirement system.
</P>
<P>
   But on education, Clinton is prepared to propose major revisions
to the way the $20 billion in federal education spending is
apportioned, rewarding school districts that adhere to guidelines
on training teachers, enforcing classroom discipline, ending
promotion of unqualified students and reporting school performance
to parents. School districts that do not meet these standards risk
losing some or all of their federal assistance, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's plan marks a sea change in national education
policy, for the first time holding states and school districts
accountable for progress and rewarding them for results,'' said
Bruce Reed, the president's chief domestic policy adviser,
paraphrasing a passage from the State of the Union speech. ``The
national government invests over $20 billion a year in public
schools. President Clinton believes we must change the way we
invest that money, to support what works and stop supporting what
doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   There is relatively little new money in the budget Clinton will
propose for the coming fiscal year to support these programs. He
will ask Congress for $400 million in new aid to school districts
that end social promotion, the practice of promoting students from
grade to grade regardless of their educational achievement. The
money would be used for after-school and summer programs to assist
these students, as well as to provide a safe environment for
students whose parents are not home during after-school hours.
</P>
<P>
   The new budget proposal also contains $200 million in aid for
school systems that identify failing schools and take aggressive
steps to reform them, from firing poor teachers and administrators
to closing underperforming schools.

   &UR; GAMES _  &LR;  Video and computer gamemakers aren't just trying to
make the games look realistic; in some cases, they're selling
advertising space. This advertising scheme _ paying for product
placement _ already has invaded movies and television shows. Now,
it's becoming more common in electronic games as advertisers try to
reach teens and twentysomethings who are spending less time
watching TV and more time playing games. BY BENNY EVANGELISTA

   &UR; MICROSOFT _  &LR; Bill Gates is a brilliant programmer. Now he's
faced with the task of reprogramming his own image, which has been
tarnished by his appearance so far in the antitrust case against
Microsoft. Now that it's Microsoft's turn to present its case,
there's speculation that the software giant might call Gates as a
late witness to undo the damage he's done. By Benny Evangelista

 WASHINGTON: underperforming schools. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clinton also plans to renew his call for $4 billion in federal
spending over five years to build schools and classrooms to relieve
overcrowding and reduce class size in early grades, aides said. He
will also ask for more than $1 billion to help pay for the hiring
of 100,000 new teachers, a program approved last October in the
final negotiations over the current budget.
</P>
<P>
   But the chief incentive in the president's education proposal is
the withholding of existing money from schools that fail to meet
federal standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, we're insisting that states and school
districts take steps, such as providing qualified teachers, ending
social promotion and turning around failing schools,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think schools will do these things,'' he added. ``But if
they don't, their money will be at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed emphasized that federal sanctions would be designed not to
hurt students by withholding money for books, teacher salaries or
new facilities, but rather would be aimed at school administrators
who fail to ensure quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest impact will be that states and school districts
will no longer be able to make excuses for their worst schools,''
Reed said. ``They have to turn them around or shut them down.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Clinton's proposals have a familiar ring, having been
offered as federal legislation or enacted at the local level over
the last several years. Chicago, for example, has extensive
after-school programs for lagging students, and Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas, a Republican, has pushed many of the same measures
through the Legislature in his state. Clinton and Hillary Rodham
Clinton advocated several of the ideas in the mid-1980s as part of
an effort to improve education in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, too, have made education one of their chief issues
in recent years, but they have policy differences with Clinton.
Last year, Republicans rejected a school construction proposal, and
they have been resistant to programs that give the federal
government a say in how school dollars should be spent by
localities.
</P>
<P>
   The most controversial piece of Clinton's plan is a requirement
that all new teachers be tested for competence and certified to
teach the subjects to which they are assigned. In many rural and
inner-city districts, less than half of the math and science
teachers have certificates to teach those subjects, the Education
Department says.
</P>
<P>
   Teacher unions have balked at subjecting teachers to
standardized testing, arguing that such examinations do not
adequately measure a teacher's competence.
</P>
<P>
   In a concession to the unions, the president's proposal does not
require testing for existing teachers, only for new teachers
entering the profession.
</P>
<P>
   David Hornbeck, superintendent of schools in Philadelphia,
applauded Clinton's proposals. Hornbeck said his 215,000-student
district has adopted many of the same policies in the last few
years, but welcomed the federal emphasis on programs that appear to
be bringing results.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appreciate the funds that come along with it,'' Hornbeck
said in an interview Sunday, ``but I think one of the biggest
contributions is to give publicity to these things, to use the
bully pulpit and say this is important.''
</P>
<P>
   The foreign policy passages of the speech will highlight
administration progress toward bringing peace to troubled parts of
the world, from Northern Ireland to the Middle East to the Balkans,
a senior administration aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will urge the Senate to quickly ratify the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty, an agreement signed by 151 nations but not yet
ratified by the United States, the official said. Clinton will make
the case that the United States will lack the moral authority to
press India and Pakistan to restrain from testing nuclear weapons
until the Senate approves the test-ban treaty, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The president will propose spending $4.2 billion over the next
five years for converting Russia's defense industries and
safeguarding its nuclear stockpile, a 70 percent increase over
current spending levels. The official would not divulge the amount
of new money to be devoted to combatting biological weapons,
although the figure will be released as part of Clinton's budget
submission to Congress on Feb. 1, he said.

ADVERTISERS GET INTO THE VIDEO GAME 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - GAMES   By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR; In the video game Cool Boarders 3, the characters swoosh past
Butterfinger candy bar banners, riding Burton snowboards and
wearing Levi's jeans while attempting to beat opponents' times
recorded on Swatch watches.
</P>
<P>
   In NFL GameDay 99, Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Cris Carter
can haul in a touchdown pass in front of a banner for Upper Deck
trading cards.
</P>
<P>
   And in the X-Files computer game, agents Scully and Mulder track
down aliens with the help of the latest Nokia cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   Video and computer gamemakers aren't just trying to make the
games look realistic; in some cases, they're selling advertising
space.
</P>
<P>
   This advertising scheme _ paying for product placement _ already
has invaded movies and television shows. Now, it's becoming more
common in electronic games as advertisers try to reach teens and
twentysomethings who are spending less time watching TV and more
time playing games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day we released Cool Boarders 3, sponsors were lining up
saying, `How do we get into Cool Boarders 4?''' said Jeff Fox, vice
president of marketing for 989 Studios, a Foster City computer
gamemaker.
</P>
<P>
   In a few cases, companies actually pay video gamemakers to
showcase their products or logos. More often, the companies enter
cross-promotional deals.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Psygnosis of Foster City released a game last year
for the Sony PlayStation and the PC titled G-Police in which
characters wear Diesel apparel. &UR;  &LR; Diesel, in turn, marketed G-Police
jackets and had in-store kiosks where people could play the game.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Brand names have been showing up in electronic games,
especially sports-related ones, for years to add a touch of
realism. In the past, however, gamemakers had to beg well-known
companies to use their logos and sometimes even pay them.
</P>
<P>
   Now the tables are turning as companies see games as a new
advertising medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving away from the big-bang, big-budget media and are
trying to talk to the consumer more directly,'' said Barth Ballard,
digital marketing manager for San Francisco's Levi Strauss.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors are catching advertisers' eyes.
</P>
<P>
   First, sales of computer and video games in North America were
projected to hit $6.3 billion in 1998, a 32 percent increase from
1997, according to the marketing research firm NPD Group of Port
Washington, N.Y. More than 20 million PlayStation and Nintendo 64
game consoles alone were in U.S. homes, NPD said.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic games have become the fastest-growing segment of the
entertainment industry, according to the industry trade group
Interactive Digital Software Association.
</P>
<P>
   Second, game graphics have become so good that company logos and
products now can be faithly reproduced.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Psygnosis released a Sony PlayStation game in
November called Psybadek in which the main characters are decked
out in shoes and athletic wear from Vans Inc., a Southern
California sportswear company. The resolution is so good, you can
even make out a tiny Vans logo on a shoe.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Nokia Corp. wanted to substitute its latest-model
cellular phone for an older one used in the X-Files game, figuring
that players would be able to read the model number. Gamemaker Fox
Interactive held up production for a few days so that it could make
the switch.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Third, the demographics of video game users are appealing to
certain advertisers. Most are males ages 12 to 35 who don't spend a
lot of time with traditional media. Certain games, such as
snowboarding or jet skiing, appeal to fans of extreme sports _ just
the type of customer that companies like Burton Snowboards, Diesel
and Nokia are trying to reach.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike product placements in movies, which usually are seen just
once, placements in video games can provide more impressions
because they are played over and over, said David Cole, president
of DFC Intelligence, a computer-game industry magazine in San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even multiple impressions on a video game can't match
the exposure on a network television show like ``Seinfeld,'' which
was famous for product placements. About 108 million viewers
watched the last episode of ``Seinfeld,'' while a video game is
considered a big hit if it sells about 200,000 units.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But the potential is there, especially with advertisers
changing how they allocate their marketing dollars.
</P>
<P>
   `'Product placement used to be a tiny part of the mix, but now
it is a very big part of the mix, and it's only natural for it to
go forward into video games,'' said Dabney Day, president of
Catalyst Corp. of Burbank, a marketing firm that specializes in
product placement.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said companies like
Catalyst charge clients $500 to $20,000 a year for help in getting
product placements.
</P>
<P>
   Cole and other game industry experts don't expect product
placement to become a primary source of income for game companies
but said it eventually may help offset production costs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Fox of 989 Studios declined to say how much his company has
received for product placements, but an executive for a competing
gamemaker who did not want to be identified said he has been told
by advertisers that 989 Studios has been seeking fees between
$5,000 to $50,000 per product placement.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are drawbacks to charging for product placement in
games.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Roach, an executive vice president with Accolade Inc. of
San Jose, said doing so could tempt gamemakers to cross the line
between realism and the crass commercialism that would be a turn
off to players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Product placement is not an end to itself,'' &UR;  &LR; Roach said.
``You put (products) in there to extend the fantasy, so people will
like your product and buy more. The moment you take your eye off
that and get greedy, it can backfire.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, ads don't make sense in certain games, especially science
fiction and fantasy titles. Players would recoil if they saw Link,
the hero in Nintendo's best selling Legend of Zelda game series,
stop to sip a Coke.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, a company like Levi's would be loathe to have
its products show up in a violent or risque game.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Day expects more real-world products to show up in the
virtual world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a world of brands,'' Day said. ``We don't live in a
world of generics. I'm not a believer in gratuitous product
placement. But if a kid is bouncing a basketball in a video game,
to us it makes sense that it should be a Spalding basketball.''

 CHRON - MICROSOFT  
 Should Gates Take The Stand?  &HT;     By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Gates is a brilliant programmer. Now he's faced with the
task of reprogramming his own image, which has been tarnished by
his appearance so far in the antitrust case against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Gates' videotaped deposition was widely seen as hurting his
reputation and Microsoft's defense. He came off as evasive,
forgetful and defiant.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Now that it's Microsoft's turn to present its case, there's
speculation that the software giant might call Gates as a late
witness to undo the damage he's done.
</P>
<P>
   Bad idea, say legal and public relations experts. That would
give government attorneys even more ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd be dead meat,'' said Rich Gray, an intellectual property
and antitrust attorney with Bergeson, Eliopoulos, Grady &AMP; Gray in
San Jose. ``If Microsoft tries to put him on the stand, they're
just painting a bull's-eye on his heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say Gates would be better off doing another Barbara
Walters interview (he gave one a year ago, before the trial
started) or a ``60 Minutes'' appearance to repair a public image
that has changed from whiz-kid tycoon to scheming monopolist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of being one of the great entrepreneurs of the
century, he's going to be (seen as) one of the great
entrepreneurial robber barons of the late 20th century,'' said San
Francisco public relations executive Sam Singer.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Justice and 19 states sued Microsoft in
May, claiming that the Redmond, Wash., firm was using its monopoly
on computer operating software to crush Internet software rivals
like Netscape Communications Corp. Microsoft has denied the
charges, and last week began its defense in a trial that started
October 19 in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Gates is not on the list of 12 witnesses Microsoft plans to
call, but could come in as one of the two rebuttal witnesses
allowed each side.
</P>
<P>
   The government has played videotaped excerpts of 20 hours of
deposition taken from Gates this summer in Redmond. The tapes
showed Gates claiming that he did not remember writing e-mail the
government said proved Microsoft was out to harm competitors like
Netscape and Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   At points, Gates stubbornly debated the meaning of common words
like ``we'' and ``concerned.'' His testimony seemed to fly in the
face of his image as one of the sharpest business tycoons the world
has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft has lost significant credibility because of Gates'
videotaped deposition,'' said Hillard Sterling, an antitrust
attorney with the Chicago law firm Gordon &AMP; Glickson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gates appeared to be over-prepared and over-coached,''
Sterling said. ``Gates, if he testifies (in person), would be
steamrolled by his own deposition. The more Gates says now, the
deeper his foot will slip into his mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray, however, had a slightly different view. He said Gates
showed the type of restraint and nervousness that's typical of a
legal deposition, similar to how President Clinton behaved in his
own deposition.
</P>
<P>
   The betting in legal circles is that Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson will find that Microsoft did violate some antitrust laws.
The only questions are whether Jackson's rulings will survive the
appeals process in higher courts, and what kind of sanctions will
be imposed on Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter what happens in the court of law, public relations
experts say Gates should start some spin control now to sway the
court of public opinion. One way would be to try to project an
image of sincerity and contriteness.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't need to wholly admit everything,'' said Singer,
president of Kamer Singer &AMP; Associates, which has taken on some
tough public relations issues like labor strikes and the 49ers
stadium campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Bill Gates could do outside of this trial is have
Microsoft adopt and promote standards of practice, codes of conduct
on how they treat competitors, how they conduct business,'' Singer
said. ``Even if people held strong feelings against Bill Gates and
Microsoft, it would bring them a great deal of credibility right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically, tycoons like Charles Crocker, Andrew Carnegie and
John D. Rockefeller were reviled when they were accused of
monopolistic practices. But the public can be won back if they are
seen as sincere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like Bill Clinton reluctantly admitted (indiscretions),
Bill Gates and Microsoft need to find some way to clarify to the
public that they made some errors in their business practices,''
Singer said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of MICROSOF (58764 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``The president still has a great deal of believability when he
talks to the public,'' Singer said. But, he added, ``Bill Gates is
no Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   However, another public relations expert believes that win or
lose, Microsoft and Gates will emerge largely unscathed because the
public usually pays little attention to the intricacies of
antitrust cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average Joe or Mary Consumer is not going to understand
it,'' said David S. Margulies, president of Margulies
Communications Group of Dallas. The firm has specialized in
devising public relations strategies for companies hit with serious
issues like antitrust violations, pollution problems and sexual
harassment lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``People see him as a hard-nosed businessman,'' Margulies said
of Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, if well coached and prepared, could take the stand and be
a winning witness, Margulies said. But Gates doesn't have to
testify, ``and my strategy is (don't) do anything that will screw
up the case,'' Margulies said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If, after this is over, he wants to get his point out, he can
write another book, he can go on the `Today' show. He's got plenty
of money. He has lots of ways to control his image if it really
becomes a problem.''

 &HT;    Tyson's tricks reflect lapse in skills
 &HT;    By Tom Archdecon
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The answer tells you a lot about Mike Tyson and who
he has become.
</P>
<P>
   It was some 90 minutes _ and a few stitches _ after he'd come
from far behind on the judges' scorecards to knock out Francois
Botha with one, short, jack-hammer right hand in the fifth round of
a fight marred by extra-curricular thuggery and now Tyson was being
asked to respond to his opponent's assertion:
</P>
<P>
   ``Botha said you were trying to break his arm.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, surprisingly, was candid:
</P>
<P>
   ``That's correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's fans, his handlers and much of the press gathered at the
MGM Grand Garden, all laughed, though, in reality, the joke is on
Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   So much for that invincible warrior of old. Tyson is starting to
look more and more like those cartoonish World Wrestling Federation
characters with whom he aligned himself while in exile last year.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Tyson was in a boxing ring _ the June, 1997 bout
now called the Bite of the Century _ he ended up banned by the
Nevada State Athletic Commission for gnawing on both of Evander
Holyfield's ears.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, until Tyson landed that vintage KO punch, the
only time he had Botha hurt was when he pinioned the South
African's left forearm at the end of round one and, using his own
forearm for leverage, literally tried to break the bone.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout that first round, Tyson had been out of sync. The
fight plan he'd prepared with new trainer Tommy Brooks _ movement,
throw combinations _ was out the window 20 seconds after the
opening bell. From then on, Tyson, who looked trim, but weighed a
career-high 223 pounds, was standing flat-footed, trying to land
one punch and missing badly.
</P>
<P>
   The 233-pound Botha, it seemed, had traded that shaggy white
buffalo skin he wears as a robe _ to go with the ``White Buffalo''
nickname _ for a cloak of confidence. From the outset, he not only
showed he wasn't intimidated by Tyson, but that he could push the
smaller heavyweight around.
</P>
<P>
   And so just before the bell, Tyson latched onto Botha's arm
during a clinch. Botha bellowed in pain and, as the bell sounded
and Tyson continued to twist while referee Richard Steele pushed
in, Botha crashed a right hand into Tyson's head.
</P>
<P>
   More punches were thrown, the fighters refused to break and soon
it looked as if there would be ring anarchy reminiscent of the Bite
Fight. Handlers from both sides jumped into the ring, as did
security guards. Instantly, Las Vegas police crawled up on all
sides of the ring apron and provided a uniformed barrier between
the crowd and the chaos behind them. No one wanted a repeat of the
post-fight riot after the June 1997 bout.
</P>
<P>
   Once both fighters were shoved to their corner stools, Marc
Ratner, executive director of the NSAC, met with Steele. ``It was
very frightening,'' Ratner said. ``All the elements were there. It
was definitely scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele went to each corner and issued a warning: ``You can't win
on a foul.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson didn't listen. In the second round, Tyson again worked on
Botha's arm and then tried to follow through on a punch with an
elbow to the throat. Steele deducted a point from Tyson on all
scorecards for what he called ``unnecessary roughness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was doing so much,'' Steele said. ``I had to get him calmed
down.''
</P>
<P>
   The old Tyson never needed all the illegal tactics and tricks.
He just walked in and knocked guys out. But Saturday, whether it
was the rust of a 19-month layoff, the lack of confidence that
first surfaced against Holyfield, or the growing proof that his
skills are eroding dramatically, Tyson feels he needs something
more than he's got in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, he may be right.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's fight was to be his first step at redemption, but for
the first 4 1/2 rounds it was more of a back-pedal from the boxer
he once was. After four rounds, Dalby Shirley and Dave Moretti had
Botha winning, 40-35. Bill Graham had it 39-36, as did the Dayton
Daily News scorecard.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 12,512 was stunned by what it was seeing.
</P>
<P>
   In a collision of heads, Botha had opened a small cut above
Tyson's right eye. Then in the third round - with Tyson often
looking pleadingly at Steele as if the ref could get him out of
this mess _ Botha backed the former two-time heavyweight champ to
the ropes and in comical Three Stooges fashion, boxed both of
Tyson's ears at once.
</P>
<P>
   By the fourth round, Botha was dropping his hands, daring Tyson
to hit him and once even tried something of a fancy shuffle. ``I
think he thought he was the white Muhammad Ali,'' Tyson joked. ``I
wasn't worried though. I knew it was just a matter of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Botha started round five talking incessantly to Tyson, who had
been jawing back most of the night. ``I don't want to say what we
said all fight, it was really some bad words,'' Botha said. ``I was
trying to psyche him out. I told him, 'All America is watching you.
You better start boxing because you're losing.'''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson took the advice and soon capitalized on a Botha confidence
that led to carelessness. Fighting with his hands down _ ``I got
careless and started fooling around,'' _ Botha tried to land a slow
wide right that Tyson countered with a short textbook right hand
flush to Botha's nose.
</P>
<P>
   Botha melted instantly, landing butt first on the canvas. He
rolled over and twice tried unsuccessfully to push himself upright.
Counted out by Steele at 2:59 of the fifth, Botha finally got to
his feet only to stumble sideways and fall halfway through the
ropes.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson rushed across the ring and helped Steele pull Botha to
safety. It was one of three good things Tyson can take from this
bout. The most important, as was noted by new manager Shelly
Finkel, was that he didn't ``totally lose his composure'' after the
first shaky moments. And then there was the reaffirmation that a
puncher _ as Tyson has shown in 46 of 49 fights _ always has a
chance.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if Tyson can just keep from tripping over his psyche.
Coming out of the ring, he ranted to pay-per-view microphones that
he needed respect. That everybody was writing trashy articles and
trying to assassinate his character.
</P>
<P>
   Later, though, he was more subdued: ``I feel a little crappy. I
didn't prove anything and I wanted to shine tonight. I tried to do
well, but I've got a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's handlers know this is going to be a rebuilding process _
though, it's doubtful the 32-year-old heavyweight ever will become
the dominator he once was. The talk now is of a fight in April with
Axel Schulz, Lou Savarese or Vaughn Bean. First, though, comes a
sentencing in a Maryland court after his no-contest plea on an
assault of two motorists who rammed his wife's car. That could have
bearing on a Feb. 5 parole hearing and the worst case scenario for
Tyson would be a return to prison.
</P>
<P>
   Botha, meanwhile, praised Tyson's punching power and wished him
luck in his climb back toward the title. ``I think Mike Tyson will
go and get what he deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   It was meant as a compliment, but that might not be the case.
</P>
<P>
   What's coming _ as much in the ring, as out _ could be bad.

 CHRON - AIRTOUCH  
 AirTouch Still After Deal With Bell Atlantic  &HT;     By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Despite its agreement on Friday to sell out to Britain's Vodafone
Group PLC, AirTouch Communications Inc. still wants to negotiate a
deal with Bell Atlantic Corp. to create a national wireless network
in the United States, AirTouch chief executive Sam Ginn told The
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Pairing with Vodafone, which outbid Bell Atlantic in a
high-stakes battle for control of San Francisco's AirTouch, is
important for creating a global company, Ginn said, but the merger
doesn't solve a crucial problem in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to solve the footprint problem in the U.S. to stay
competitive,'' Ginn said. ``What I would hope to do is negotiate an
agreement with Bell Atlantic because our assets fit so naturally
together. We fit like hand-in-glove.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginn said the two companies had ``preliminary conversations''
about a joint venture in the United States, but those talks ended
when Vodafone won the battle for AirTouch. He said he plans to
resume those conversations with Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   AirTouch operates mainly in the West. In the Bay Area, it sells
cellular phone service through Cellular One, a joint venture with &LR; 
 &LR; AT&AMP;T, and paging service under its own name. Bell Atlantic's
territory is mainly in the East. Both companies need a nationwide
network or ``footprint'' so they can eliminate `'roaming''
agreements they must sign with other companies so their customers
can use their cell phones in every state.
</P>
<P>
   The costs of those agreements are passed along to customers, who
must pay roaming fees when they use their phones outside their home
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors with national networks, like AT&AMP;T Corp. and Sprint
PCS, have eliminated those fees and are luring away customers with
lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   While Vodafone is the No.1 carrier in the United Kingdom and has
9.1 million customers overseas, it does not have a presence in the
United States. AirTouch has more than 11 million customers in 25
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't do (a national network) with Bell Atlantic, we've
got to do it some other way,'' Ginn said.
</P>
<P>
   If a strong domestic network is so important to AirTouch, some
may wonder why the company accepted an offer from Vodafone, rather
than Bell Atlantic. The answer, Ginn said, came down to price and
strategy. Bell Atlantic was reportedly offering between $73 and $80
a share, as opposed to Vodafone's $97 per share stock-and-cash
offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, the board looked at the price and $97 per share
was a pretty good offer,'' Ginn said. ``The board had two excellent
alternatives. One was pointed at solving a footprint problem in the
U.S. and the other opportunity allowed us to create the premier
wireless company in the world. We were looking strategically at how
we positioned our direction.''
</P>
<P>
   But AirTouch's shunning of Bell Atlantic, which pulled out of
the bidding after realizing it would not win, may have had an
unwanted effect.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the New York phone company filed a lawsuit to void a
noncompete clause in its joint venture agreement with AirTouch. The
two companies jointly own PrimeCo Personal Communications LP, which
offers digital wireless service in 30 major cities, and the
agreement prohibits the companies from competing in the same
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic is in the process of acquiring GTE Corp., which
competes with AirTouch's Cellular One in San Francisco. If Bell
Atlantic had acquired AirTouch, the noncompete clause would have
been irrelevant because Bell Atlantic would have owned all of
PrimeCo. Now that AirTouch is merging with Vodafone, Bell Atlantic
wants to be able to keep competing in San Francisco and other GTE
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Ginn, who said he had not seen the lawsuit, said he hopes to
resolve the problem without going to court.
</P>
<P>
   If Vodafone AirTouch PLC, as the new company will be known, does
work out an agreement with Bell Atlantic, it could be good for Bay
Area wireless customers, who pay some of the highest cell phone
rates in the nation, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the two companies could eliminate roaming fees
and price their service to stay competitive with other national
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a deal with Bell Atlantic doesn't happen, Ginn said, the
agreement with Vodafone will be good for customers and employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``What customers ought to know is that we are going to keep our
competitors in our gun sights and offer prices that are competitive
with anybody in the nation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   AirTouch employees, including Ginn, stand to make a substantial
sum off the deal because almost every one of them has stock
options, said AirTouch spokesman Jonathan Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ginn, who built AirTouch into the world's largest
wireless carrier after spinning it off from Pacific Bell, said he's
``sad in a way'' that AirTouch has been sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am immensely proud of what we've been able to achieve,''
said Ginn, who will become chairman of the joint company.
Vodafone's chief executive Chris Gent will run the combined
company. Ginn said it was the right time to sell AirTouch because
of consolidation in the industry and other trends.

 &HT;    Stay tuned for behind-the-scenes hostility between Dan, John and
Mike
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Uh' oh. We're already prophetic. Let's just say that
the soap opera we'll see over the next two weeks involving Dan
Reeves, John Elway and Mike Shanahan began just moments after
Sunday's final gun shot through the chilly air inside Mile High
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. To the surprise of absolutely nobody who knows the
difference between Vinny Testaverde and John Elway, the most
persistent questions in the home locker room after the Denver
Broncos' 23-10 snoozer over the New York Jets weren't about the
Broncos sitting four quarters away from repeating as world
champions.
</P>
<P>
   They also weren't about the golden boy of the Rockies hinting at
playing his last game around here after 16 seasons. Oh, and there
was that matter of Terrell Davis chewing through the Jets' normally
staunch defense for 167 yards rushing and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Well, forget all of that. You can forget about everything
between now and the end of the month, except what we recently told
you would happen with a Super Bowl between the Atlanta Falcons and
the Broncos: Dan, John and Mike. Dan, John and Mike. Dan, John and
Mike.
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking about Peter, Paul and Mary here. Try something
like Bill, Linda and Monica.
</P>
<P>
   After Reeves spent his dozen years with the Broncos through the
1992 season, Elway described working as Reeves' quarterback as
``hell.'' As for Shanahan, the Broncos coach, all Reeves did to his
former Broncos assistant of seven years was fire him for
insubordination. That's because Reeves thought Shanahan and Elway
were working in collusion behind his back.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, it took two quarters, four minutes and a bunch of
ugliness by the Broncos and the Jets before Elway realized he was
so close to battling his arch-enemy again. Elway pushed the Broncos
past the Falcons in the Georgia Dome last season, but that was
before the Falcons became the Dirty Birds, and it definitely wasn't
the Super Bowl. Even then, Elway sprinted away in the aftermath to
keep from shaking Reeves' hand.
</P>
<P>
   So Elway got busy against the Jets. With Reeves already grabbing
that thriller in Minnesota to give the Falcons the NFC
Championship, Elway finally became Elway before a normally spirited
crowd that was as lifeless as the defending world champions.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Elway went from the goat who was 5 for 18 on his
previous throws to the hero who was rallying the Broncos from a
10-0 deficit. In the end, Elway did a victory lap around the
stadium. He thanked the fans. He praised the organization. This was
after Shanahan did the same, but neither could escape the only
questions that mattered to the masses.
</P>
<P>
   So, Mike, do you think Dan is responsible for the Asian
financial crisis, global warming or the Clinton trials in Congress?
</P>
<P>
   ``At times, we were best friends, '' Shanahan said. Then he
added, trying to keep his smile from fading, ``He's done a great
job with that football team, and we look forward to playing them in
Miami. It's really going to be a great game, and we're just happy
to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway said of Reeves, ``He's done a great job with the Falcons,
and you have to give him credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh-huh. Stay tuned.

 CHRON - NET FILES  
 Support for Net Pioneer's UFO Theory  
 By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
It's all alien to me.
</P>
<P>
   The phone calls and e-mail poured in last week after The
Chronicle's front-page story on Joe Firmage, the Internet pioneer
who was forced to resign as chief strategist at USWeb/CKS because
of his belief in aliens and UFOs.
</P>
<P>
   Firmage's otherworldly theory, detailed in his 600-page online
treatise, ``The Truth'' ( &LR; www.thewordistruth.org &LR; ), is a doozy: He
links many of history's major religious and technological events to
``visits'' from extraterrestrials. He even recounts a close
encounter of the third kind in his Los Gatos home in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The readers' overwhelming verdict? Firmage, 28, is an earnest,
brilliant individual who has put the truth, as he sees it, before
his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's on to something big that bears further investigation,''
said Suleiman Edmondson, a writer-TV producer based in Richmond.
``What Joe is saying is very accurate. Elements of the secret
government know about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Harold Puthoff, a respected physicist at the Institute for
Advanced Studies in Austin, Texas: ``These are certainly
speculative and provocative theories, but on the other hand, he's
not a crackpot. As far as whether we'll meet up with E.T., the jury
is still out. The proof is yet to be found. The fact that (Firmage)
opened up the issue required a lot of courage. He stuck his neck
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Marrs, a journalist in Dallas who has written extensively
about UFOs and the Kennedy assassination, said: ``Firmage is a
brilliant guy. He picked the brains of top researchers to come up
with his ideas. There have been dozens of works on the
Roswell-technology connection.''
</P>
<P>
   An authoritative read is the 1997 book ``The Day After Roswell''
by the late Colonel Phillip J. Corso and Bill Birnes, publisher of
UFO Magazine in Los Angeles. Like Firmage, they contend that the
origins of high-tech inventions such as lasers and the microchip
can be traced to a purported alien spacecraft crash in 1947 in
Roswell, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Truman absolutely wanted technology companies like
Bell Labs and IBM to take a look at material from the wreckage,''
Birnes said. ``Joe is right on.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, a Daly City woman who supports Firmage, claims that
she has been visited by aliens 33 times and has been implanted with
alien materials. And another man swore that extraterrestrials are
in cold storage at the White House. Uh-huh.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the growing fan club and wall-to-wall media coverage
(CNN, ``Hard Copy,'' WCBS-AM), Firmage's unique views are
tantamount to career suicide. Be careful what you wish for.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, he tendered his resignation, and he has spent
the past few days fielding a blizzard of media requests. Fearing a
market and public relations backlash, executives of USWeb/CKS, an
Internet services company worth about $2 billion, are trying to
keep a low profile. Nonetheless, he has his defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard the same skepticism about the JFK assassination when I
came out with my book (`Crossfire: The Plot to Kill Kennedy') in
1989,'' Marrs said. ``Now, my conclusions of a government
conspiracy are in the mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   So does this whole high-tech episode merit a future segment on
``The X-Files''?
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the popular TV program declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
OVERSEAS INTERNET: The World Wide Web is an American fad but hardly
a hit in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   While an estimated 60 million Americans _ almost a quarter of
the population _ are surfing the Web, less than 10 percent of
Europe's 350 million citizens regularly venture into cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   A major culprit: Slow acceptance of telecom deregulation
overseas has limited online penetration in Europe. In Italy, for
example, only 5 percent of the population is connected to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   That should change dramatically during the next few years,
however, as telecommunications rules loosen and foreign governments
encourage more Net connections to businesses and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Net will grow at an explosive rate, especially in
countries such as France, Sweden, Holland, Germany and England,
where Social Democratic governments are encouraging sales of
tax-free, low-cost computers,'' said Johan Stuel von Holstein,
founder of IconMedia Lab, the largest Internet service company in
Europe. ``Those countries want everyone to have access to PCs at
home and at work.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sweden, about 65 percent of the population is logged on.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, major European corporations, led by Volkswagen and
BMW, have vast Net access. Indeed, online-related revenues abroad
will skyrocket to $64.4 billion in 2001 but still lag far behind
the United States.

REPUBLICANS CONFIDENT ON WITNESSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House managers who are prosecuting the impeachment
case against President Clinton expressed hope Sunday that they had
changed enough minds in the Senate to allow witnesses to be called,
a move that Democrats said might stretch the trial into June.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, two Republicans said that it might be possible for
the Senate to vote to convict the president but then vote not to
remove him from office. But neither said he favored such an
outcome, and many constitutional scholars have said a convicted
president would be removed automatically.
</P>
<P>
   After three days of opening arguments in the Senate trial,
several House managers said on television talk shows that they
hoped their statements had persuaded the necessary 51 Republicans
to stick together to vote for witnesses, including Monica S.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've changed some minds in regard to witnesses and
that was a big part of the case,'' Representative Asa Hutchinson,
an Arkansas Republican manager, said on ABC's ``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hutchinson said that senators won't make a final
determination on witnesses until after the White House presents its
defense this week, he expressed confidence that there would be
enough votes in favor. ``I think we made a strong case . . . for
witnesses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, as they have since the trial began, said Sunday that
there is no need to call witnesses. But Senator Christopher J.
Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, said that if Republicans push for it,
the White House would be compelled to respond with a call for
witnesses who could testify on the president's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not an exaggeration if you go that route _ and you can
make a case for it _ we could be talking May or June before you
finish this trial,'' Dodd said on NBC's ``Meet The Press.'' ``And I
think the Senate ought to think seriously before it goes that
length of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican,
speculated on CBS's ``Face The Nation'' about whether it would be
possible for the Senate to convict Clinton but not vote to remove
him. Many constitutional scholars have said the president would
automatically be removed upon conviction, but some have suggested
that the Constitution is vague enough to leave open the option of
letting the president remain in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some historical precedent they could do that,''
Graham said. But he added that since 1936, ``the practice . . . has
been that a finding of guilty automatically results in removal. I
guess there's two ways you can do this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, however, has been among the most forceful in arguing for
the president's removal.
</P>
<P>
   Another guest on the CBS program, Senator Pete V. Domenici, a
New Mexico Republican, agreed that it might be possible to convict
but not remove the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could happen,'' Domenici said. ``I had not heard of it
until recently, and I hear nobody talking about it. But I assume,
in a sense, the United States Senate could do what it wanted in
that regard.''
</P>
<P>
   The appearance by the House managers and senators on the
television shows highlighted the split-screen nature of the
historic proceedings. On Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, the House
managers presented solemn arguments for conviction, while the
senators were required to sit silently and listen.
</P>
<P>
   But as both groups took to the airwaves, the partisan split was
evident, as the managers insisted they had made the case for
conviction and some Democrats argued the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   If the television questioning is an indication, Democrats are
being pressed to explain why some of them voted in 1989 to convict
US District Judge Walter L. Nixon Jr. on perjury charges in a
Senate impeachment trial, but may not be willing to make the same
vote on similar charges against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Senator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts did not
answer directly when ``Meet The Press'' moderator Tim Russert asked
whether he would vote to convict Clinton on the charges against him
if the president were a federal judge. The following exchange
between Russert and Kerry illustrated how the Nixon case has
affected the Clinton trial:
</P>
<P>
   Russert: ``If Bill Clinton was a federal judge, would you vote
to remove him from the bench based on what you know?''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry: ``Tim, I mean, those are the kinds of hypothetical
questions that just sort of get you into, I think, a bad place. And
I'm not trying to avoid you. Let me just try to draw the
distinction here. He's not a federal judge, he's president of the
United States, and we're dealing with a different set of facts. . .
. It is not a question of having a lower standard. The standard
should be high for both. It is a question of having a different
standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry explained that there is a different standard for Clinton
because judges ``serve on good behavior'' in a lifetime term.
Democrats frequently have pointed out that presidents are elected
by the people and serve four-year terms.
</P>
<P>
   Another guest on the program, Senator James M. Inhofe,
Republican of Oklahoma, disagreed, saying that he has never heard
any justification for ``having a lower standard for the president
of the United States than a federal judge. I mean, after all, the
president appoints the federal judges,'' he said.

 CHRON - ON TECH  
 The Trials and Tribulations of PC Installations  &HT;     By Dan Fost 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
In the past few months, I've heard Bill Gates and Craig Barrett _
the chief executives of computer giants Microsoft and Intel _ give
speeches exhorting the industry to make personal computers easier
to use.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few weeks, as I helped my mother-in-law buy and set
up a new PC, I learned that Gates and Barrett still have some work
to do.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing about the endeavor was easy. Not the purchase, not the
setup, not even filling out the rebate forms.
</P>
<P>
   Although selling to my mother-in-law, a self-described computer
illiterate, is a challenge, she is precisely the type of person the
industry needs to win over if it is to continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
   My in-laws are great, but technologically, they're stuck in a
time warp.
</P>
<P>
   I heard a computer consultant tell my brother-in-law last week
that his company now had e-mail and that a Web page would be up and
running soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's great,'' my brother-in-law replied. ``What's the
difference between e-mail and a Web page?''
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say, his parents are not too far ahead of him. In
fact, the most active e-mailer in the family is grandma, who just
traded up to an iMac.
</P>
<P>
   Intel CEO Barrett knows the problem. A month after he turned 59,
he told an industry gathering in Palm Springs, ``The main reason
people my age don't want to use a computer is they're afraid
they'll break them.''
</P>
<P>
   That's my mother-in-law. She's 62 and has the time and the money
to own a computer but fears crashes and error messages.
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of people, she just wants it to work.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 10 years, she's used a PC with a 286 MHz processor.
It ran DOS, had no graphics and used near-obsolete 51/4-inch floppy
disks. But it worked. She was happy.
</P>
<P>
   She recognized, though, that her computer at home should be
compatible with the Windows 95 machines at her office, and she also
wanted to tiptoe into e-mail and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   I told her she probably didn't need to spend more than $1,000
for a computer, and I said she should ask for a 56K modem, Windows
98 and Microsoft Word _ basic stuff.
</P>
<P>
   She asked a family friend, a retiree who spends hours on end
chatting away online in his basement.
</P>
<P>
   He sent her to a small firm in the Portland suburbs that
custom-builds computers.
</P>
<P>
   She went to that store. She might as well have gone to Ulan
Bator, Mongolia, for all she understood. She faxed me the specs.
</P>
<P>
   It was virtual gibberish: gigabyte 100 MHz P2/ATX motherboard,
64 MB 100 MHz SD-Ram Dimm memory, ATI 8 MB 3D AGP Xpert'98 video
card, and on and on. Is a normal person supposed to understand
this? In deciphering the list, I saw it was actually a heck of a
deal: a 350 MHz chip from Advanced Micro Devices, a 17-inch
monitor, 64 megabytes of RAM and a 4.3 gigabyte hard drive _ even a
separate 51/4-inch floppy drive, so she could transfer her old
files _ all for under $1,200.
</P>
<P>
   So I said, ``Buy it.'' So she bought it.
</P>
<P>
   When I got to her house, I took everything out of the boxes and
tried to hook it up. It seemed to go fine, except they had
forgotten to add the 51/4-inch drive, and there was no place to
plug in the keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   We called. They said, ``Oops.''
</P>
<P>
   We took it back to the store. They installed the drive, gave us
a quick tutorial and shoved us out the door.
</P>
<P>
   We took it home, hooked it up and _ because I had already
ordered her an Internet account _ tried to get online. It started
to dial, and the screen froze.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, every time we tried to connect, even to Microsoft to
register the software, the screen froze and the dialing stopped.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the system did not have Microsoft Word _ the only
reason she really needed a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, because it was a custom-built computer, it came with no
manuals. No support.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, I left town for a week of skiing and my
mother-in-law returned the computer. When I returned, I had one
afternoon to help coordinate the purchase of a new machine for her.
</P>
<P>
   A sales clerk at Office Depot was very helpful. He taught us
some vagaries of the computer we were eyeing: It comes with
Microsoft Works. If you wanted to upgrade to Microsoft Office 97
(even though it's now 1999), that's $200. If all you want is
Microsoft Word, that's also $200, so you might as well upgrade
because Word is part of Office. (Ah, Microsoft.)
</P>
<P>
   We bought a Hewlett-Packard 4450, with an HP monitor (because
that way you get a rebate) and an HP printer (because then you get
an even bigger rebate). In picking a printer, we kept in mind that
my mother-in-law didn't care about color cartridges or dots per
inch but that she just wanted no paper jams.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, my wife and her father were able to un-box it and
plug it all in. Things seemed to be getting easier. Yellow cords
went into yellow plugs. HP had included a manual and a big colored
map.
</P>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The City Council is considering legislation to
restrict handgun purchases, while officials debate whether to join
a growing movement among cities to sue gun makers for contributing
to handgun violence.
</P>
<P>
   The city ordinance would prohibit individuals from buying more
than one handgun a month in Los Angeles, which has 87 registered
gun dealers and firearms stores.
</P>
<P>
   The intent is to reduce the flow of handguns to criminals
through ``straw purchasers'' who legally buy several weapons at one
time and then resell them on the street. Supporters of the measure
say Los Angeles had 27,000 incidents of gun violence in 1996. The
incidents cost the city an estimated $35 million in police and
firefighter time.
</P>
<P>
   A City Council committee approved the proposed ordinance on
Wednesday and voted to send it on to the full council, which has
approved several gun control measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is impossible to imagine somebody who, seeking
self-protection, would need more than a gun a month,'' said Mike
Feuer, the councilman who drafted the measure. ``This is a
common-sense measure that will have a meaningful impact on public
safety in Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is based on new research suggesting a link
between the legitimate retail gun market and the secondary black
markets where criminals obtain guns, contrary to the traditionally
held belief that most guns used in crimes are stolen.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has reported
that as many as half of the guns it has traced from crimes were
sold by a dealer in the previous three years.
</P>
<P>
   A study conducted for the Los Angeles Police Department found
that more than half the handguns recovered by the police had been
sold by legitimate retailers within the previous two years and that
only 10 percent to 15 percent of the recovered guns had been
stolen.
</P>
<P>
   City officials are also considering a variety of legal theories
for potential suits against gun manufacturers. Strategies include a
product liability claim, like the one being pursued by New Orleans,
and a public nuisance claim, like the one being pursued by Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   California's new governor, Gray Davis, and the new attorney
general, Bill Lockyer, have also voiced more support for gun
control measures than their predecessors, and Lockyer has agreed to
help Los Angeles enforce the one-gun-per-month limit by giving
dealers in the city access to a state data base that would show
whether a customer had bought a gun anywhere in the state in the
previous 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is opposed by gun-rights advocates as an unfair
restriction on the rights of gun buyers who may want to buy several
guns for sport or collecting. They say federal law already protects
against gunrunning through multiple purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us believe we have a right to keep and bear arms, and
it's an undue burden on our Second Amendment right,'' said Alan
Gottlieb, the founder of the Second Amendment Foundation, which
successfully sued the city of San Francisco to overturn a ban on
possession of handguns.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles legislation would not prevent individuals from
buying a whole cache of handguns in another California city without
a limit.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with local jurisdictions' limits on sales, said
Franklin Zimring, a law professor at the University of California,
Berkeley, is that the measures can have no comprehensive effect.
``All you do is export the gun trade,'' Zimring said.

`VARSITY BLUES' WINS WEEKEND BOX OFFICE CHAMPIONSHIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- ``Varsity Blues'' hit pay dirt at the nation's
multiplexes with an estimated $14.3 million at 2,121 theaters
during the Friday-Sunday period, studio sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The Paramount comedy-drama, starring James Van Der Beek of
``Dawson's Creek'' as a Texas high school quarterback, benefited
from the massive appetite among younger moviegoers for films with
teen-age themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought this would be a good weekend for us since there
wasn't a lot of other competition for the young audience,'' said
Paramount distribution chief Wayne Lewellen.
</P>
<P>
   The studio reported ``Varsity Blues'' drew strong exit-poll
responses from males and females as it overcame a spate of negative
reviews. Its first-place finish underscored the strong market for
comedies, analyst Arthur Rockwell noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to be entertained these days, so the audience is
often much wider for comedies than it is for serious films,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewellen said attendance should be strong today, with many
moviegoers off work as part of the observance of Martin Luther King
Jr.'s birthday. He predicted ``Varsity Blues'' could end the
four-day period with $17 million.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source tracking service,
predicted ``Varsity Blues'' would take in as much as $40 million by
the end of its run. ``It was smart for Paramount to get this movie
out before there's a lot of competition for the young audience,''
he added, noting that 19 other youth-oriented films will be
released over the next 15 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's ``A Civil Action,'' which led last weekend as it moved
into nationwide release, finished a strong second with $10.9
million at 2,001 theaters, edging Universal's fourth weekend of
``Patch Adams'' with $10.7 million at 2,890 screens as the latter
lost only 15 percent of its audience. ``Patch'' has topped $97
million in 24 days and could take in an additional $50 million
overall.
</P>
<P>
   The widened release of 20th Century Fox's war drama ``The Thin
Red Line'' performed well in fourth with $9.8 million at 1,528
theaters, easily beating MGM's opening of ``At First Sight,'' a
romance-drama with Val Kilmer as a blind man regaining his vision,
with $7.1 million at 1,814 locations.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell, a former MGM executive, said the performance by ``At
First Sight'' was respectable but represents a disappointment to
the struggling studio. ``MGM had high hopes for the movie, but it's
hard to open pictures in such a tough marketplace,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's fourth weekend of ``Stepmom'' finished sixth with $6.6
million at 2,358 sites, followed by Universal's lukewarm opening of
science-fiction thriller ``Virus'' with $6.1 million at 2,020
screens. ``Virus,'' delayed from last year, represents another in a
long line of Universal releases that have failed to meet
expectations except for ``Patch Adams.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros.' sixth weekend of ``You've Got Mail'' delivered an
eighth-place finish with $6 million at 2,554 sites and has crossed
the $98 million mark. During the coming week, ``You've Got Mail''
and ``Patch Adams'' will become the 14th and 15th films released in
1998 to gross over $100 million domestically, a mark hit by only
180 other films.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks' fifth weekend of ``Prince of Egypt'' came in ninth
with $5 million at 2,215 theaters to top $81 million overall. Its
opening of horror-thriller ``In Dreams,'' however, was nearly dead
on arrival with $4 million at 1,670 screens. Bucksbaum noted that
opening ``Virus'' and ``In Dreams'' on the same weekend may have
been a problem, since both movies were aimed at basically the same
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax's sixth weekend of ``Shakespeare in Love'' may have also
cracked the top 10 with $3.9 million at 648 theaters. Disney's
third weekend of ``Mighty Joe Young'' took in $3.7 million at 2,087
sites, and its ninth weekend of ``A Bug's Life'' followed with $3.6
million at 1,815 screens to total $148 million, making it the
61st-highest domestic grosser ever.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of overall business totaled $107 million, similar to
the same weekend last year when the fifth weekend of ``Titanic''
topped $30 million.

GRINDA HOLDS OFF KUKAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. _ Jean-Noel Grinda takes pride in his
French heritage. When it comes to tennis, that means the red clay
of Roland Garros, or any French red clay.
</P>
<P>
   His love of hardcourts isn't as high on his list, even though
Grinda possesses a powerful serve and forehand that helps on the
fast surface. Still, the UCLA sophomore's ability paid off Sunday,
when he defeated USC's Roman Kukal 6-3, 6-4 to win the 23rd
National Collegiate Tennis Classic at Sherwood Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Grinda became the first UCLA player to win the tournament in
eight years.
</P>
<P>
   In women's singles, Stanford freshman Marissa Irvin, a
Harvard-Westlake graduate and top seed, overcame a sluggish start
to beat third-seeded Anita Kurimay of Cal 4-6, 6-2, 6-1 for her
first collegiate tournament title.
</P>
<P>
   Grinda, the tournament's No.4 seed, has the tennis pedigree. His
father, Jean-Noel, played for the French in Davis Cup competition
from 1958-62. At one time, the elder Grinda was ranked No.2 in
France.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the elder Grinda used his name to help his son get
the best tennis instructors. Father only coached son through age
12. Then he became too busy with his various real estate projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't have been in my best interests,'' Grinda said.
``He would not have been able to follow me enough, and my game
would have suffered.''
</P>
<P>
   Clay play came more naturally, but his father had the sense to
instruct Grinda in the ways of serve and volley, the style of
choice on other surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I hadn't been my father's son, I would have been a
grinder,'' he said. ``He taught me to come in. When I was a kid,
he'd advise me to serve and volley. On my natural side, I'd sit
back and hit from the baseline. It made me a complete player.''
</P>
<P>
   Kukal, who made an unexpected run to the final, last faced
Grinda five years ago in the Australian Open junior doubles
semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   Kukal won that day, but Sunday was different. His best chance
came in the second set, when he broke Grinda to pull to 3-3. But
Grinda, using ground strokes, broke back for a 4-3 lead. The two
held serve the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He served better than I did,'' Kukal said. ``I didn't start
too well. I felt tired. I couldn't move well.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin never thought she moved well against Kurimay but received
a break when Kurimay pulled a hamstring muscle and required a
massage in the second set. Irvin was up 5-2 at the time.
</P>
<P>
   After that, it was Kurimay who said she had problems moving.
</P>
<P>
   For Irvin, the victory took away some of the pain of losing the
doubles final earlier in the day. Cal's Amanda Augustus and Amy
Jensen, the second seeds, overcame a 5-1 deficit and beat Irvin and
Teryn Ashley 8-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played well in doubles. I didn't feel at any point I started
to play well here,'' she said. ``It's really exciting, but 10
minutes from now, I'll be like, `Oh, OK.' I think it stays with you
longer if you lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford's K.J. Hippensteel and Ryan Wolters won the men's
doubles final, 8-6 over USC's Ryan Moore and Nick Rainey.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' Brandon Hawk won the men's consolation singles title,
beating teammate Jack Brasington 7-6 (7-2), 1-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford's Gabriela Lastra won the women's consolation singles
title, 6-3, 6-2 over Laresa Marinova of Arizona.

<P>
   DENVER _ When the Jets were rolling toward the American Football
Conference championship game, Bill Parcells' face told you all you
needed to know about how he felt. His eyes glowed, his smirk had
mischief in it. But Sunday night, after the 23-10 loss to the
Broncos, the coach's eyes were flat and he had forgotten how to
smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the players I was proud of a lot of things they
accomplished; they did a good job in many areas,'' he was saying
now. ``But it would've been foolish to tell them they can pick up
next season where we left off. They have to go back to where we
started and they've got to get to where we were this season with a
different perception of what it takes to win it.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells then talked about ``making a few changes'' for next
season, but he didn't sound like he was including himself among the
changes.
</P>
<P>
   So if there's any consolation to the Jets not qualifying for
Super Bowl XXXIII, it's that Parcells surely will remain to finish
his job.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Jets somehow won the Super Bowl against the Atlanta
Falcons on Jan. 31 in Miami, it's not unreasonable to think that
the 57-year-old Parcells might have decided to stop being the Jets'
chief of football operations, retire to his Sea Girt, N.J., home
and let Bill Belichick take command as head coach.
</P>
<P>
   But not now. Not after this loss.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells knows why Leon Hess gave him all those millions _ to
win the Super Bowl, as he had with the Giants twice. He didn't get
all those millions just to make the Jets presentable; he got those
millions to make the Jets champions.
</P>
<P>
   But all that the Jets are champions of right now is the AFC's
Eastern Division. That is two levels shy of the standards that
Parcells demands _ conference champions, then Super Bowl champions.
</P>
<P>
   And after the way the Jets let Sunday's conference title get
away after holding a 10-0 lead, Parcells isn't about to depart
without continuing to meet those standards. The Jets sabotaged
themselves with four lost fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We missed a field goal and we turned it over three times in
the scoring zone,'' he said. ``That's a potential 24 points. You
can't do that in a game like this.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also reminded his listeners of what he called the
franchise's ``quantum leap'' in getting to the conference
championship game with a 13-4 record, an improvement over the 9-7
turnaround in his first season after taking over a team that had
been a 1-15 disaster in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it compares favorably with anybody in history,'' he
said. ``And I'm not saying that from an egotistical standpoint, but
from the accomplishment standpoint from the players' part.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he asked to leave the interview area, saying, ``I'm a
little tired right now.'' And more than a little disappointed.
Don't forget that this is a coach who must continually monitor his
heart since undergoing bypass surgery in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   If the Jets had won Sunday, Parcells would have joined another
coach who has had bypass surgery _ Dan Reeves of the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Several days after Reeves' emergency surgery on Dec. 14,
Parcells phoned to tell the Falcons' coach what it was like during
his own recuperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as anyone in this country, Dan can identify with me
and I can identify with him,'' Parcells said at the time. ``There
aren't too many coaches that have been through bypass. I told him
what it was like for me. I told him some of the problems I had in
the convalescent period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `Here's what it took me to do this' or `I was
doing this by this day.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran lightpoles on the boardwalk to get better. I'd run one,
walk one at first. If I didn't get to the next lightpole, it was,
`Parcells, you're weak,' then I'd have to go to the end of the
boardwalk. Or, it was `Parcells, you're a fat wimp.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Dan, `You're not going to be happy until you can run
around that Falcons' complex 15 times. When you can do that, then
you'll say, `I'm back.'''
</P>
<P>
   But even if Reeves hasn't yet run around the Falcon complex 15
times, he's back. And during the Jets' warmup, Reeves was even back
in Denver: On the video screen on Mile High Stadium's scoreboard,
he storming the sideline as his Falcons upset the Vikings, 30-27,
in overtime for the National Football Conference title.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the Falcons made a big play, the Bronco fans cheered.
They know Reeves from when he took the Broncos on three Super Bowl
trips, even if he lost all three.
</P>
<P>
   And now Reeves, who feuded with John Elway in their last few
seasons together, will be going against Elway and the Broncos in
the Super Bowl about six weeks after his heart-bypass surgery. More
than anybody else, Bill Parcells would appreciate Dan Reeves'
comeback. &QL;

 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The aura of greatness seemed to be gone from John
Elway, as missing in action as his passing touch. The rumored grand
exit from his hometown stage was blowing in the wind, a mile high.
</P>
<P>
   For one mistake-plagued half and a few minutes of another
Sunday, Vinny Testaverde looked like the future Hall of Famer,
piling on the yards, if not the points. Elway, slow dropping back,
throwing on the move, failing to so much as complete a pass for 20
minutes, fired low-angled balls that the Jets' defensive line
played paddle ball with.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind was tough, I was getting balls batted, we were just
out of sync,'' Elway said after the Broncos had grounded the Jets,
23-10, for the American Football Conference title. ``It was ugly,
that first half.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came one play-action call, one butchered formation, and one
display of timely improvisation that reminded the Jets of a
fundamental tenet of sports. Greatness eventually shows up. It is
as easy to bring down, to bury in the soil beneath the natural
grass, as Terrell Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos were losing, 10-0, and they had, as Elway said, done
nothing you would expect of defending Super Bowl champs. Dropped
passes. A fumbled pitchout. Bad snaps. A blocked punt. Then they
came out of the huddle three minutes into the third quarter,
first-and-10 from their 36, with their receivers lined up wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Ed McCaffrey, who was supposed to line up on the left, lined up
on the right. Rod Smith, who was supposed to line up on the right,
lined up on the left. Elway looked at this mistake, and calmly
transformed it into the Broncos' wake-up call.
</P>
<P>
   He looked over at Smith, who nodded, letting Elway know he would
change his route from a post pattern to a cross. Elway shouted over
at McCaffrey to make sure he realized to run the post. ``They're
bright men,'' Elway said. ``They knew what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The play-action fake froze the Jets' safeties just enough.
McCaffrey got into the secondary, behind Corwin Brown. Elway would
later admit that his pass, in the wind, was not the best he has
made in 16 years. It was a completion, though. It was for 47 yards,
to the Jets' 17-yard line. It was a play champions make when they
are down, and just about when they seem on the verge of being out.
</P>
<P>
   Elway, who would make few memorable plays in the AFC title game
he called ``the ugliest one'' of five, threw the pass that lit Mile
High Stadium, that set up a touchdown pass to Dwayne Carswell and
set off an explosion of 20 Denver points. In 11 minutes 38 seconds
from Bill Parcells' worst nightmare, the Broncos were the Bulls
blowing away the Utah Jazz in Game 3 of the NBA finals. They were
the Yankees loading up on the Padres in the first two games of the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to get out of a funk, to get the fans back into
it,'' Elway said. ``It perked everyone up.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway wound up throwing for 173 yards Sunday, that total more
than doubled by Testaverde, who deserved better from his team than
he got. A missed field goal by John Hall wasted a game-opening
drive. Fumbles by Curtis Martin, Keith Byers and Alex Van Dyke
short-circuited others. With no running game, in the biggest pro
game of his career, Testaverde at times dominated the Broncos'
defense. Three points, ultimately, is what the Jets' offense
produced on its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept my focus,'' Testaverde said, sadly. ``I won't be
satisfied until I win the championship.''
</P>
<P>
   He had a storybook year, was a prince of a guy, and the only
consolation was that he was beaten by the king. By the quarterback
with the star over his head. Elway won his first Super Bowl last
year, but made it to the game three times much earlier in his
career. Some guys have the supporting casts, the looks, the luck.
Very few play 16 years in one city, as Elway has in Denver, and get
to finish _ as Elway will if he does retire _ by taking his coach's
advice to address the hometown fans, on national TV. By looking
into the camera and telling them, ``I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   By carrying a championship trophy above his head, leaving the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Elway, in fact, could not have scripted a better finish, except
for the pass to McCaffrey in the end zone, as the game wound down.
Mike Shanahan claimed it made sense for the Broncos to go for a
touchdown, ahead by 13, on fourth down from the Jets' 25. That it
may have been Elway's last pass at Mile High had nothing to do with
the play call, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan, just last spring, set the standard for the
dramatic superstar exit, but Elway's pass was inches too long, off
McCaffrey's outstretched hand. Incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   ``My decision on retirement won't be made until after the next
game,'' Elway said.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, right. There remains one more game, one more finish, one
more chance for the perfect, Jordanesque goodbye.

<P>
   DENVER _ It was a busted play that gave Denver life at the start
of the third quarter, but it was a Broncos running back who busted
open the American Football Conference championship game, and with
it, the Jets. John Elway got the victory lap around Mile High
Stadium. The man who made it possible, Terrell Davis, got bags of
ice around his powerful legs.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, the National Football League's leading rusher and only
the fourth running back in league history to gain 2,000 yards in a
season, finished the day with 167 yards on 32 carries. But it was
his third-quarter performance that allowed the Broncos to return to
the Super Bowl and defend their title. He carried nine times for 78
yards and propelled the Broncos to four consecutive scores for 20
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see how hard-nosed he runs,'' said Denver tackle Tony
Jones, ``how he tears people up and keeps bruising away at them, it
really gives you a boost. They had stopped us, but we knew it was a
matter of getting T.D. untracked.''
</P>
<P>
   Down by 3-0 _ shut out in the first half for the first time
since 1993 _ and down by 10-0 early in the second half, the Broncos
started the second half with these dire words from Elway: ``We
aren't going to win with no points.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he backed them up by finding Ed McCaffrey for a 47-yard
pass play to the Jets' 17-yard line early in the third quarter, on
the possession after the Jets had scored their touchdown. Elway
could laugh afterward about how McCaffrey and Rod Smith came out of
the huddle on the wrong side. How they switched assignments at the
line of scrimmage, with McCaffrey running the post instead of the
deep cross as he was supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both are bright enough guys to make the adjustment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the one long strike softened the Jets up enough to turn the
game back into Davis' &UR;  &LR; hands. He had galloped for 75 yards in the
first half, but the Broncos had failed to convert on third downs
and could &UR;  &LR; not get him into the end zone on third &UR; - &LR; and &UR; - &LR; goal from
the 2. In fact, they were only 21 percent efficient in that
category for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hadn't stopped Terrell all day,'' said Broncos tight end
Shannon Sharpe. ``We just hadn't given them any help.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, he was on his way to his sixth consecutive post-season
game over 100 yards. After Elway hit Griffith for an 11-yard
touchdown pass to cut the score to 10-7, Davis and his undersized
line went to work. Jets Coach Bill Parcells said before the game
that his team could play perfect defense against Davis and the
running back could still gain 5 yards on a carry. He did. Often.
</P>
<P>
   He had runs of 5 and 15 yards to set up Elway's second touchdown
pass and to set up Jason Elam's 44-yard field goal to tie the
score. The next time Davis took the field, he cut back to the
middle for 20 yards and down to the Jets' 21-yard line to set up
another Elam field goal.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, he did it all by himself. On third-and-3 from the
Jets' 31- yard line, Davis swept left and broke down the sideline
until he reached the end zone. In just nine carries, he had powered
the Broncos to a 20-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pitch play and the backside was open,'' Davis said of
his touchdown run. ``I just told myself to be patient. I saw the
flow of the line, cut back and saw a seam. I thought a lot of our
players were over anxious. We just wanted to go back and start
playing our game and executing better. We wanted to go back to the
basics. It was just one of those game, but we came out and played a
great second half and wore them down.''

JETS' SPECIAL TEAMS FALL APART IN THE WIND

<P>
   DENVER _ Special-teams play is the pet project of Jets coach
Bill Parcells. He believes it is the area that can provide the
margin of victory in certain games and in certain situations.
Sunday was one of those games, and the unusual situation was a
swirling wind that gusted at unpredictable times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a scary thing,'' said Broncos kicker Jason Elam. ``I
don't think the Jets knew what to do. I don't think they know what
hit them.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, it looked as if the Jets' special teams were going to
be a factor in a New York victory. But the Broncos' special teams
aren't too shabby either. And when it was over, and Denver had
clinched a 23-10 victory and another American Football Conference
championship, the Broncos' special teams were standing tall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we had to hang in there, because we didn't really play
that well in the first half,'' said Broncos linebacker Keith Burns,
who recovered a fumbled kickoff that led to Denver tying the score
at 10-10 on a 44-yard field goal in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being on special teams sometimes you don't feel like you get
the credit you deserve, that the guys on offense and defense get
all the credit,'' Burns said. ``But we have a veteran group of guys
on special teams and we know how special we are to our offense and
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was one of those days and it couldn't have happened in a
bigger situation.
</P>
<P>
   Elam kicked field goals of 44, 48 and 35 yards in the swirling
wind. Punter Tom Rouen had a punt blocked, which led to the Jets'
only touchdown, and fumbled a punt snap. But he handled the
unpredictable wind, kicking three other punts inside the Jets' 20
yard-line (one at the 6, one at the 7, and another at the 17) to
give New York poor starting field position. Kickoff returner Vaughn
Hebron had a 28-yard return right before quarterback John Elway hit
receiver Ed McCaffrey on a 47-yard pass that helped set up the
Broncos' first touchdown, in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Darrien Gordon had a 36-yard punt return that set the Broncos up
at the Jets' 36-yard line and led to a 31-yard run by running back
Terrell Davis that helped give Denver a 20-10 lead near the end of
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Things didn't start out that rosy for either of the
special-teams units.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' John Hall missed a 42-yard field goal with 9:20 to
play in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind was blowing so hard on that field goal that he didn't
have much of a chance at making it,'' said Elam, who used that
miss, which went wide right, to gauge his field-goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   But Hall nailed a 32-yarder at the other end of the field with
the wind at the close of the first half to give the Jets a 3-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   On his fumbled punt in the second quarter, Rouen said that the
wind caught the ball as it was snapped by linebacker Glen Cadrez.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball just started rising up,'' he said. ``I caught the tip
of it with one hand and then as I squeezed the ball it just shot
out of my hand. The ball was moving all over the place. It was
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Near the beginning of the third quarter, the Jets' punt-return
team exploited a weakness in the Broncos' cover team at the line of
scrimmage. Blake Spence, a third-string tight end who was active
for just his second game this season, came in free from the right
side of the line and blocked Rouen's punt. The Jets recovered at
the Broncos' 1 and running back Curtis Martin ran it in for a
touchdown to put the Jets up by 10-0.
</P>
<P>
   But the tide turned for the Broncos' special teams in the second
half. Elam got a better idea of which way the wind was blowing and
he began to use it to his advantage. Elam estimated that at certain
levels of the stadium the wind was gusting between 50 and 60 mph.
</P>
<P>
   On the two field goals that he hit heading into the north end of
the stadium, Elam said he aimed the ball 15 to 20 yards wide right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would aim to the right and the wind would pull it back in,''
he said. ``I'd just try to keep the ball low, like a line drive and
hope nobody got a hand on it. I was just trying to hit the heck of
it every time.''
</P>
<P>
   The one time that Elam got the ball up in the air was on a
kickoff. It rose and then dropped as if it had hit a brick wall.
That was the kickoff that fell about 20 yards short of the Jets'
return man, Dave Meggett, was mishandled by James Farrior and was
recovered by Burns at the Jets' 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was no one else's responsibility,'' said Meggett. ``I have
to take it wherever it goes. The previous kick came to the 4, but
the wind held the second one in the air and I didn't get a good
read on it. The wind was very tricky.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said it was a lucky break for the Broncos, remarking,
``You can't tell me they intended to kick it that short.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that Meggett was too far back, and I'm not sure whether
their front guys saw that the ball just hit the wind and dropped,''
Burns said. ``I knew it was a live ball. I was pretty lucky,
because it hit the ground and just bounced right back to me. It was
a good bounce for me.''

TYSON MYSTIQUE HAS VANISHED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Tyson is no longer Mike Tyson. That was clear on Saturday
night in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he was rusty after a 19-month layoff. And, yes, Francois
Botha put up a good fight before he was knocked out by one
monstrous punch with one second left in the fifth round.
</P>
<P>
   Let's be honest, though: The Mike Tyson who fought Saturday
didn't remotely resemble the tornado who swept through the
heavyweight division and captured the imagination of the public in
the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   This Tyson has one weapon: a big punch. Two long layoffs and age
_ he's 32 _ have sapped his once-remarkable skills and at least
some of his quickness. Even the fury that was a cornerstone during
his peak was subdued on Saturday at the MGM Grand.
</P>
<P>
   It's to a point where he's losing his appeal. Oh, fans are still
intrigued by the power and his unpredictable nature but not to the
extent they once were.
</P>
<P>
   The Tyson act is getting old. The pay-per-view numbers for
Saturday's card are expected to reflect that and it might get even
worse the next time out.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson insists he's not through and asks for patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be back in the gym in two weeks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, it's too late for Iron Mike. Clever trainer Tommy
Brooks might be able to lift Tyson's performance to a somewhat
higher level in his coming fights, but he can't resurrect the dead.
And the Mike Tyson we've come to know is dead.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks' mission during training was to correct Tyson's ``bad
habits.'' The goal: Get him to jab, to move his head, to throw
punches to the body and in combination as he did during the first
and most successful installment of his career.
</P>
<P>
   What'd Tyson do? None of the above.
</P>
<P>
   He was all the things that twice made him such easy prey against
Evander Holyfield: He jabbed only minimally, he was a stationary
target, he didn't try to find Botha's substantial stomach and he
threw single punches with a knockout on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, he was dominated by Francois Botha _ Francois Botha _
before the big right hand saved his career. He took many more
punches than he landed, which was reflected in the scoring: Botha,
a 7-1 underdog, won all but one round on the card of one judge.
</P>
<P>
   It appears the only thing Tyson got out of training camp was
conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Is Brooks worried?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' he said. ``He learned his lesson tonight, he
learned his lesson tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   That's right, Tommy. Say it over and over again and you just
might begin to believe it.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, who worked with Holyfield the past several years before
becoming Tyson's main man shortly after he regained his boxing
license in October, said before the bout that Tyson would beat
Holyfield if they were to meet again.
</P>
<P>
   That was ludicrous even then. Now? No way Brooks could say it
again with a straight face. He knows it, Tyson knows it, we all
know it: This is a new but hardly improved Mike Tyson who remains
better than most heavyweights but is really nothing special.
</P>
<P>
   But his career moves on. His next battle is against a familiar
foe: the justice system. He will learn next month whether an
altercation with two men on a Maryland highway constitutes a
violation of his conditions for parole on his rape conviction.
</P>
<P>
   If so, he could return to prison and his career could be over.
</P>
<P>
   If not, he'll fight again in April, once more perhaps in July
and then _ if all goes well _ face Holyfield for a third time in
November or December in what could be the richest matchup in
history.
</P>
<P>
   And he'll probably get there. Those guiding his career will
continue to put mediocre opponents in front of him so he won't lose
the big payday against Holyfield. Such names as Axel Schulz, Vaughn
Bean and Lou Savarse keep popping up as possible opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly mouth-watering, is it?
</P>
<P>
   Tyson will get Holyfield again and all the money. And, again,
Holyfield will pummel an inferior fighter even though the champion
will be 37 years old when it happens.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Tyson even knows it. He said he plans to retire after
his fourth bout _ against Holyfield _ and fighters almost never
retire after a victory.
</P>
<P>
   __ Scary moment: The mini-riot at the end of the first round
Saturday was frightening.
</P>
<P>
   As the round ended, Tyson had Botha's left arm locked under his
and refused to let go. When referee Richard Steele was unable to
free Botha, handlers from both camps and then security personnel
rushed into the ring to restore order as police officers lined the
apron to contain the mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   It took only a few minutes to sort things out and, after Steele
warned both fighters, the bout continued.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada officials, fearful that Tyson might snap again as he did
when bit Holyfield's ears in his last fight, were relieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I was worried,'' said Marc Ratner, director of the
Nevada State Athletic Commission. ``I just talked to Richard
(Steele) and told him, `It's your fight. Take control.' And he did
a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Tyson being Tyson: Tyson was relatively gracious after the
fight.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to help Botha up as he was sprawling against the ropes
after the knockout and he hugged his opponent warmly a few moments
later.
</P>
<P>
   And, at the post-fight news conference, he kept his swearing to
a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   However, he made one comment that surprised no one. Asked to
comment on Botha's contention that Tyson tried to break his arm at
the end of the first round, he said with a smile:
</P>
<P>
   ``That's correct.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Huge mistake: Botha squandered an opportunity to make a
fortune and his place in history when he became overconfident in
the fifth round.
</P>
<P>
   Had he continued to keep his distance and fire punches from long
range, while tying up Tyson when danger approached, he might've
won. Instead, he became brave. He exchanged punches with his much
more powerful opponent and ultimately paid a very expensive price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thought it was going to be easy,'' said Botha,
referring to a conclusion he reached a few minutes into the fight.
`` . . . I got careless. I knew I was in control. I was slowly but
surely getting a hand on the fight. I just walked into the punch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I got a little cocky _ and I paid for it.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, Botha proved what many knew going into the
bout: He's a good fighter who will have other opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rabbit punches: Unbeaten heavyweight Lance ``Mount''
Whitaker's victory over Alex Stewart was a positive step in his
career.
</P>
<P>
   However, he's too cocky in and out of the ring for his own good.
</P>
<P>
   In it, he needs to keep his hands in front of his face _ not at
his sides _ and fight with more urgency. Outside it, he made
comments to the effect it wasn't a difficult or important fight. In
fact, it was both. . . .
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see how Julio Cesar Chavez does with
Joe Goossen as his trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, even at 36, has a lot of fight left in him if he can
keep his focus.
</P>
<P>
   Goossen might be just the trainer he needs. He's a fun-loving
guy, but, in the gym, he demands a tremendous amount of his
fighters. Chavez will learn this quickly.

AMBITIOUS STATE OF THE UNION IS PLANNED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The high drama of the Senate impeachment trial will
give way to the high purpose of the State of the Union Tuesday
night when President Clinton goes before a joint session of
Congress to deliver the annual presidential address.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican House members are planning not to attend the
speech, for a variety of reasons. Some House Democrats, who plan to
be there, said the GOP leadership has not given members much
incentive to return to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   With the House not in session and no votes scheduled until
February, the only reason most House members would travel is for
the State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after his lawyers begin presenting the case to senators
for why he should not be removed from office, Clinton will go to
the House chamber, where he became the first elected president to
be impeached, and lay out what his aides say is the most ambitious
policy agenda of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The last State of the Union by a president in the 20th century
will also be the first delivered in person by a president who has
been impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress, Republicans and Democrats, had wanted
Clinton to delay the address, while some White House officials had
wanted to postpone his lawyers' opening presentation in the Senate
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   But the speech will be given as scheduled. Clinton will deliver
his seventh State of the Union address before members of Congress
who have impeached him and others who are considering whether to
oust him from office.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to his colleagues Friday, House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, a Republican from Illinois, said, ``These are
extraordinary times.'' While he did not explicity urge lawmakers to
attend the address, he offered some advice for how they should act
if they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of respect for the office of the presidency and for the
state of our union, we will listen to the president's remarks
soberly and with the dignity that befits the United States,'' he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he does not intend to mention impeachment in
his address. ``Tuesday night, I'm going to ask the country to go
back to work because we've still got a lot to do,'' he said before
a gathering of Democrats on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House official involved in the planning for the
speech reported on the prevailing mood: ``People who listen to the
State of the Union want to hear what we have to say that makes a
difference in their lives, not ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will take advantage of the spotlight to promote a host
of poll-tested policy initiatives focused on aging baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the agenda has been previewed through a series of
carefully orchestrated news leaks and staged White House
ceremonies, though aides have hinted at something new.
</P>
<P>
   One big unknown is how Clinton will advance his call of last
year to ``Save Social Security first,'' a mantra to Republicans not
to use the budget surplus for tax cuts. White House communications
director Ann Lewis said Clinton will tell Congress and the American
public that ``this is the year we should get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposals include increasing military spending,
tripling money for after-school programs, creating tax credits and
health care grants to help disabled Americans go to work, improving
food safety, and extending funding for community policing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will also renew his effort to restrict teenage smoking,
calling this year for a new 55-cent-a-pack cigarette tax.
</P>
<P>
   He will also recycle proposals that did not go anywhere last
year, including raising the minimum wage, modernizing schools, and
allowing Americans as young as 55 to buy into Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a president who is looking backward in the seventh
year of his presidency,'' Lewis said. ``He is looking forward. In
fact, these are ideas that you might see in a first year.''
</P>
<P>
   The fate of those proposals and others, however, hangs in the
balance of an increasingly uncertain relationship between the White
House and Congress that has been strained by the weight of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans, including Henry J. Hyde, the chairman of the
House Judiciary Committee and a prosecutor in the impeachment
trial, said they will not attend the president's speech.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde told ABC's ``Nightline'' last week that he would watch the
address from home ``mostly because it's not fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Tom Coburn, a Republican from Oklahoma, said he
will not attend because he does not think it is appropriate for
Clinton to deliver the speech while the Senate is conducting his
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is not the time for a presidential moment,'' he said
through his press secretary, John Hart.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican leadership aide said, ``There will be a handful who
won't come. I don't think it will be a colossal amount.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Democrat from Lowell and a
member of the House Judiciary Committee, said he was disappointed
that no House floor votes had been scheduled for Tuesday or
Wednesday to ensure that lawmakers, who are on recess, get back to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there are no votes, my experience has been that some of
the members don't come to Washington,'' he said, adding that he
wasn't assigning ``motives'' to the Republican leadership's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Fields, author of ``Union of Words: A History of
Presidential Eloquence,'' said members of Congress have long
preferred that presidents not deliver the State of the Union in
person and that this year the problem is heightened by Clinton's
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is awkward tension between being a participant and
performer,'' said Fields, who also directs American culture studies
at Washington University in St. Louis. ``He's up there giving the
speech, but they are part of the act. And that's always awkward.''

   INTERNET-SHOPPING SURVEY SHOWS MIXED REACTIONS
</P>
<P>
   Amid post-holiday giddiness about the stellar drawing power of
Web merchants and portals, a survey to be released Monday by
Jupiter Communications, a new-media research company, found that
while record numbers of Americans tried Internet shopping, they
were not always happy with their experiences.
</P>
<P>
   The number of consumers who expressed satisfaction with online
shopping dropped by 14 percentage points from six months earlier,
although 74 percent still considered it a positive experience. The
No. 1 reason consumers voiced dissatisfaction was a problem as old
as retailing: The product they wanted was out of stock. Unhappiness
about high shipping costs was a close second.
</P>
<P>
   NETWORKS NURTURE MIDSEASON HITS
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding the land-rush congestion of the fall television season,
three networks started new series this month, and all of them
scored ratings that would qualify them as hits. The shows _ NBC's
``Providence,'' Fox's ``The PJ's,'' and CBS's ``60 Minutes II'' _
received heavy promotion aimed at maximum exposure. Executives at
the networks and the studios that produce series said they foresaw
an increased emphasis on holding back shows for midseason to gain
such lavish promotion.
</P>
<P>
   THE MURK IN THE MICROSOFT CASE
</P>
<P>
   While the government contends that Microsoft has a ``choke
hold'' on software distribution and that consumers will be harmed
unless the software giant is reined in, Microsoft replies that the
government has produced no real proof on either front. The
challenge for the courts is that how antitrust doctrine and the
case law apply to the Microsoft case is by no means clear cut.

about what's happening around town did not go over very well in the
newsroom.

<P>
   HEARINGS ON INTERNET SMUT LAW
</P>
<P>
   Court hearings will begin this week on the Child Online
Protection Act, which was signed into law in October but has never
gone into effect because of legal challenges. Supporters of the
act, which makes it a crime for a commercial Web site to knowingly
make certain sexually explicit material available to those younger
than 17, say it would shield children from smut. Critics say the
measure would undercut free speech and Internet commerce.
</P>
<P>
   THE CUSTOMER AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT
</P>
<P>
   Few industries have gorged themselves on digital commerce with
greater appetite than telecommunications companies, but the result
has been a wired world that seems to care little about providing
additional value for customers.

   HOFFMAN SUES MAGAZINE OVER PHOTO
</P>
<P>
   Actor Dustin Hoffman is pressing a lawsuit against Los Angeles
magazine for its use of his face in a fashion spread. In the March
1997 issue, the magazine superimposed an image of Hoffman's face
from his role in ``Tootsie'' _ in which his character disguised
himself as a woman to get an acting job _ on a model wearing a gown
and high heels. The suit centers on an area of law called right of
publicity, which is supposed to give celebrities the right to
control their names and images for commercial purposes.

HOLIDAY USE SOURS A FEW CONSUMERS ON WEB SHOPPING
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Amid post-Christmas giddiness about the stellar
holiday drawing power of Web merchants like Amazon.com and portals
like America Online, a survey to be released Monday found that
while record numbers of Americans tried Internet shopping, they
were not always happy with their experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers who expressed satisfaction with their online shopping
excursions dropped by 14 percentage points from six months earlier,
although the vast majority _ 74 percent _ still considered it a
positive experience, according the survey, which was conducted by
Jupiter Communications, a new-media research company located in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter's results are based on a questionnaire filled out by
2,369 households that use the Internet. In about 44 percent of
those households, someone bought something online during November
and/or December.
</P>
<P>
   The households were selected from a group of 4,000 homes
randomly chosen by Jupiter's research partner, National Family
Opinion, to reflect the total online population in the United
States. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The data strongly suggested that the Web had evolved in
consumers' perception from an exciting novelty to an alternative
venue for shopping that had benefits and problems all its own.
Still, the No. 1 reason consumers voiced dissatisfaction was a
problem as old as retailing: The product they desired was out of
stock. Unhappiness about high shipping costs was a close second.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, concerns about merchants' protecting credit-card
numbers, previously the single largest concern about purchasing
merchandise on line, ranked fourth among reasons for survey
participants' unhappiness.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, discontent with online merchants' return policies and
their communication problems with customers ranked in the bottom
half of the list of consumer beefs.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers were also surprisingly tolerant of technical mishaps.
Asked whether poor performance affected their site use, 51 percent
responded ``no,'' and only 9 percent said that such glitches would
cause them to stop using a site permanently.
</P>
<P>
   However, 28 percent said that when a site had problems, they
sought out an alternative, which they continued to stick with.
Nicole Vanderbilt, a senior analyst with Jupiter, said online
merchants should view these deserters as ``a warning sign.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a lot of hype about immense growth on the
Web,'' Ms. Vanderbilt said. What retailers need to be careful of
now is taking that for granted. 1998 brought in a lot of new
dollars, but they are going to have to play the game very carefully
to maintain their momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Several other research firms have also recently released studies
on consumer Internet purchasing patterns during the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   Infobeads, a unit of Ziff-Davis Inc., the publisher of P.C. Week
magazine, conducted telephone interviews with 1,000 adults selected
at random. Aaron Goldberg, the company's executive vice president,
said his firm found that of those users who had actually bought
something, 55 percent rated the experience as ``easy'' and 43
percent said that they had saved money while shopping on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   But a not-yet published survey suggests still another potential
area of concern for online merchants. On Tuesday, Ernst &AMP; Young
will release a survey of 1,300 consumers and 125 online retailers,
which will say that a full 57 percent of consumers were visiting
Web sites only to research products. They did their actual
purchasing later in a store or by phone or fax.

 SENEGAL BANS FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION  (jw) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ In a step toward eradicating the tradition of
female genital mutilation in Africa, the Parliament of Senegal
banned it this week, responding to a campaign by Senegalese women.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign had unusual origins, said Rana Badri, who
coordinates action against the practice by Equality Now, a New
York-based group helping women in the developing world as well as
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Badri attributed the campaign to a private Senegalese
women's organization called Tofhan, which means breakthrough. But
she said the group had not set out to fight genital mutilation.
Rather, the effort came about as a result of literacy classes and
human-rights discussions among women at the grass-roots level.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started with basic reading and writing,'' she said. ``They
didn't ask the community to stop the practice. This came as a
result of the women's awareness of their rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The procedure, which many Africans call ``female circumcision,''
involves the removal of all or part of the external female
genitals. The often crude and painful operations not only deprive
victims of sexual feelings but may also injure them in ultimately
life-threatening ways.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Bellamy, executive director of UNICEF, welcomed the
Senegalese Parliament's decision, which was reached on Thursday.
``Senegal's action is of great significance,'' she said, ``because
it reflects the resolve of African women to end a cruel and
unacceptable practice which violates the rights of all girls to
free, safe and healthy lives.''
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, estimates that 130
million women, most of them in Africa, have undergone genital
mutilation. Each year more than 2 million girls undergo the
procedure, some of them in infancy, the agency says.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Somalia and Sudan account for
75 percent of cases, according to UNICEF. In some countries, as
many as 95 percent of girls are affected.
</P>
<P>
   Several African nations south of the Sahara have now instituted
bans, which are enforced with fines and jail terms. The procedure
is barred in Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic, Djibouti,
Ghana, Guinea and Togo. Other countries, among them Uganda,
discourage it.
</P>
<P>
   In North Africa, the Egyptian Supreme Court upheld a ban on the
practice last year and also ruled that it had no place in Islam.
</P>
<P>
   In Senegal, President Abdou Diouf lent his support to the
campaign, making legislative action easier.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bellamy said this week that international support for local
groups was also important. The work of African grass-roots
organizations seems increasingly to demonstrate that most women
would not accept female genital mutilation as a part of tradition
if they had the power to change their fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women around the world who have the courage to take a stand on
female genital mutilation need sustained international support,''
Ms. Bellamy said, ``in order to convince their societies to move
away from this horrendous practice.''  &QL;

MANISTIQUE WINS FEATURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. Manistique's narrow victory over Gourmet Girl in
Sunday's El Encino Stakes at Santa Anita wasn't pretty. But trainer
John Shirreffs and jockey Gary Stevens knew the result could have
been a lot worse.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-5 favorite stumbled badly out of the gate in the $150,000
Grade II race for 4-year-old fillies. She then had to run for her
life to hold off outclassed Gourmet Girl by a head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just hoping Gary would stay on,'' said Shirreffs of the
Manistique's start. ``He did a great job of riding her.''
</P>
<P>
   Manistique had only two horses to beat in the 1 1/16-mile event
but, according to Stevens and Shirreffs, the temperamental filly
was never really relaxed after a short delay in the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not one to stand still,'' Shirreffs said.
</P>
<P>
   Manistique, however, did right herself and led from the
quarter-pole en route to her fifth victory in six career starts.
</P>
<P>
   Manistique finished the 1 1/16-mile race in 1:43.10 and paid
$2.80 to win. There was no place or show wagering because
Tranquility Lake was scratched.
</P>
<P>
   Second-choice Magical Allure, who was stretching out, faded
badly in the stretch and finished three lengths back in third, even
though she had a perfect opening along the rail.
</P>
<P>
   But Manistique's first race at Santa Anita was made interesting
as Gourmet Girl, an unlikely challenger, battled all the way to the
finish. Shirreffs admitted he was worried about Gourmet Girl
``because Manistique isn't the kind of horse that has a big closing
charge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't intimidated by Manistique,'' said Gourmet Girl's
trainer, Pico Perdomo. ``This is a tough filly. Like I said before,
thank God they don't teach horses to read the (Daily Racing) Form.
Because then she'd know she was a $3,500 horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to face (Manistique) again in the La Canada
(Stakes on Feb. 7). We'll see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She ran a winning race,'' said jockey Kent Desormeaux of
Gourmet Girl, who has won four of 11 races. ``There was no shame in
defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also no shame in a close victory, according to
Shirreffs and Stevens, even for a highly regarded filly who is
expected to be a factor in the 1999 Breeders' Cup Distaff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kent's filly ran the race of her life and this is the first
time my filly has ever really been in a battle,'' Stevens said.
``She showed her talent and how game she is today. I was proud of
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``This definitely wasn't one of her better races, and that's why
I'm not discouraged. If she had run one of the best races of her
life and won by a head, then I might be discouraged. Believe me, on
a scale of of 1-10, this rates about a 3 or a 4. And that's not too
bad if she's still able to win a Grade II race.''
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Bob Baffert had been pointing Magical Allure to the
Grade I seven-furlong Santa Monica Handicap on Jan. 23, but plans
were changed and the El Encino turned out to be little more ``than
kind of a good workout,'' said jockey David Flores.
</P>
<P>
   Magical Allure had won seven of her previous eight races, but
only two of the victories were in races of a mile or more.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish Prize and Laffit Pincay Jr. held off longshot Fearless
Pirate by a nose in the second feature, the $100,000 Sensational
Star Handicap for Cal-bred 4-year-olds and up at 6{ furlongs on the
turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always tries hard,'' trainer Richard Mandella said.
``Laffit always seems to get him in the right place.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory was Turkish Prize's fifth in 10 starts, and he paid
$5.20, 3.40 and 2.60.
</P>
<P>
   Fearless Prize returned $9.80 and 5.60. Naval Academy, which led
much of the race, paid $3.40 to show.

BRONCOS HURDLE THE JETS AND RETURN TO THE SUPER BOWL
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: SUBS to add quotes, integrate game stats into the story; now
in 2 takes. ) 
(ms) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ For more than half of Sunday's American Football
Conference championship game, the Jets could see all the way to
Miami and the Super Bowl, the game that they had helped turn into
one of the biggest spectacles in sports 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But then they began to drop the ball, turning it over six times
on a day when the Denver Broncos needed the gifts. And in a
10-minute splurge after halftime, the Broncos, the defending Super
Bowl champions, rallied for 20 points and defeated the Jets by
23-10 to earn the trip to Super Bowl XXXIII on Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The victory by the high-powered Broncos was not a surprise, but
their Super Bowl opponent is: the Atlanta Falcons, who shocked the
heavily favored Minnesota Vikings for the National Conference
championship, winning by 30-27 in overtime in Minneapolis. The
Falcons _ led by a coach, Dan Reeves, who had heart bypass surgery
a month ago _ will play in the Super Bowl for the first time in
their 33-year history and will again be underdogs, this time to the
Broncos, Reeves' former team.
</P>
<P>
   On the best of days it would have been difficult for the Jets to
halt Denver, which was 14-2 in the regular season and had won 18
consecutive games at Mile High Stadium. But the Jets, who led by
10-0 early in the second half, could not overcome their mistakes:
the six turnovers, including four fumbles, and a botched kickoff
that set up a Denver field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can do the things we did in a championship
game against a team like this,'' said a subdued Bill Parcells, the
Jets' coach, who in two breathless seasons had rebuilt the National
Football League laughing stocks and brought them within 60 minutes
of the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   While Parcells held his post-game news conference, Elway was
busy running a victory lap around Mile High Stadium after what was
probably his last game in Denver. The quarterback, who was
energized by the fans and by the Jets' mistakes in the second half,
is likely to retire after the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old Elway, who won his fifth AFC championship in his
16th season, was not at his best, completing 13 of 34 passes for
173 yards. But his 11-yard touchdown pass to Howard Griffith in the
third quarter started Denver's comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Davis once again led the Broncos, rushing for 167 yards
and a touchdown. The Jets' failures, meanwhile, were punctuated by
the startling fact that Curtis Martin, their leading runner and one
of the best in football, was held to 14 yards on 13 carries. It was
the worst day of his pro career, and it included a lost fumble, his
second in the playoffs. During the regular season, he had lost the
ball only once in 369 carries.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets were making their first appearance in a conference
championship game in 16 years, and their upset victory 30 years ago
in Super Bowl III remains their only Super Bowl visit. But into the
second half Sunday, their surprising run to the playoffs seemed to
be gaining even more momentum. Vinny Testaverde, who had come to
symbolize the Jets' resurrection under Parcells, completed his
first 13 passes and would finish 31 of 52 for 356 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fantastic,'' Jets guard Todd Burger said. ``There was
so much optimism. But then you think you've got almost 250 yards by
halftime and you've only got 3 points, and Denver must be thinking,
`All we're behind is by 3 and we're playing lousy.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, one of the NFL's best-conditioned teams, had not
collapsed like this in a game this season. Reasons for Sunday's
failure could be found, perhaps, in the mile-high altitude or the
atmosphere in the tumultuous stadium, where more than 75,000 people
stomped their feet so hard it seemed that the looming Rockies might
quiver.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the Jets came apart near the end, with Testaverde
intercepted twice in the fourth quarter, it was apparent that the
franchise had gone into a new era. It just was not going to the
Super Bowl yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a team we came a long way,'' Testaverde said. ``A longer
way than people expected us to.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Byars, one of the ``good hands'' people with whom Parcells
had surrounded Testaverde, produced a rare fumble after a reception
to stifle a drive deep in Denver territory in the second quarter.
The game was scoreless, and mistakes like that kept Denver hoping.
In fact, the Jets lost the ball to Denver three times within the
20-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the ball tucked,'' said Byars, the leading career
receiver among NFL running backs. ``If I had to do it over again,
I'd do it the same way. I must have made that play hundreds of
times.''
</P>
<P>
   He just didn't make it Sunday. Nor did other Jets.
</P>
<P>
   These two teams combined for more than 900 points during the
regular season. But it took almost the entire first half before
anyone scored even 3 points. That turned out to be the Jets, who
finally put up points after dominating for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   That sole score was John Hall's 32-yard field goal as time
expired, and it was positioned, in the mistake-filled half, by a
Broncos penalty on a punt. That put the Jets in good field position
after they had misfired repeatedly themselves. Indeed, the game's
opening drive ended with a failed 42-yard field-goal attempt by
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it was kicked amid gusts that hit 32 mph and sent
orange balloons swirling, flags snapping to attention and stray
pieces of paper flying. Whatever the reason, a Jets drive deep into
Denver territory was wasted.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos went three-and-out and the Jets got the ball again,
but Martin lost the ball and Tyrone Braxton recovered at the Denver
44.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' defense troubled Elway for much of the game. He moved
his team to the 1-yard line after Martin's fumble, but the Broncos
were halted. On fourth-and-goal from the 1, Mo Lewis tipped away
Elway's pass.
</P>
<P>
   But the Broncos weren't only stopped close. Repeatedly, they
could not solve the defense orchestrated by Bill Belichick. The
Jets, using a 3-4 alignment that relied on a coordinated rush and a
pass-defense alignment that took away the center of the field,
simply looked better than Denver. Elway did not have a completion
in his first three drives. The Jets took away the middle,
double-teamed the Pro Bowl tight end Shannon Sharpe and did not
seem concerned about Elway throwing the ball deep.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second half, the Broncos heard their first boos _
quite possibly their first here of the season _ when they went
three-and-out and Tom Rouen botched a 29-yard punt.
</P>
<P>
   Two drives later, a Jets rookie tight end named Blake Spence,
who had not even put on a uniform for 10 straight games, loomed out
of obscurity to block a punt that put the Jets only 1 yard out of
the Denver end zone. Spence, a fifth-round draft pick, suited up
because Parcells was unhappy with free safety Jerome Henderson. So
Spence blocked Rouen's punt from the end zone. The Jets' Fred
Baxter recovered on the 1.
</P>
<P>
   One play later, Martin found the end zone, and the Jets led by
10-0.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Jets could not build on that momentum. In fact, the Broncos
smothered it immediately. Vaughn Hebron returned the kickoff 28
yards, and then Elway connected with Ed McCaffrey, who had earlier
dropped two passes, for a 47-yard completion over a fooled Victor
Green.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Elway and the Broncos had rediscovered their
quick-strike capability. The drive took 93 seconds and ended with
an 11-yard touchdown toss to Howard Griffith.
</P>
<P>
   And then the Jets' turnovers finally cost them points. Jason
Elam's kickoff, held by the wind, bounced in front of the returner,
David Meggett. The Jets' James Farrior tried to snare the ball, but
fumbled it away to Keith Burns on the Jets' 32.
</P>
<P>
   That led to a 44-yard field goal by Elam to tie the score at
10-10 with 8 minutes 23 seconds left in the third quarter. The
sense that something had turned was palpable. Soon, helped again by
good field position after Darrien Gordon's 11-yard punt return,
Elam cut through the dangerous winds for a 48-yard field and a
13-10 lead. It was Denver's first.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the third quarter ended, Davis punctuated the
Broncos' comeback with a 31-yard scoring run.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth quarter brought another Jets fumble, this time by the
seldom-used receiver Alex Van Dyke, and then Testaverde's first
interception of the game. Gordon returned it 18 yards to the Jets'
18, and it led to Elam's 35-yard field goal and the crushing 23-10
lead. Later, Testaverde was intercepted again, on a deflection as
he started to throw the ball _ a reminder of times when he played
for teams who needed his strong arm to mount comebacks.

<P>
   DENVER _ For more than half of Sunday's American Football
Conference championship game, the Jets could see all the way to
Miami and the Super Bowl, the game that they had helped turn into
one of the biggest spectacles in sports 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But then they began to drop the ball, turning it over six times
on a day when the Denver Broncos needed the gifts. And in a
10-minute splurge after halftime, the Broncos, the defending Super
Bowl champions, rallied for 20 points and defeated the Jets by
23-10 to earn the trip to Super Bowl XXXIII on Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The victory by the high-powered Broncos was not a surprise, but
their Super Bowl opponent is: the Atlanta Falcons, who shocked the
heavily favored Minnesota Vikings for the National Conference
championship, winning by 30-27 in overtime in Minneapolis. The
Falcons _ led by a coach, Dan Reeves, who had heart bypass surgery
a month ago _ will play in the Super Bowl for the first time in
their 33-year history and will again be underdogs, this time to the
Broncos, Reeves' former team.
</P>
<P>
   On the best of days it would have been difficult for the Jets to
halt Denver, which was 14-2 in the regular season and had won 18
consecutive games at Mile High Stadium. But the Jets, who led by
10-0 early in the second half, could not overcome their mistakes:
the six turnovers, including four fumbles, and a botched kickoff
that set up a Denver field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can do the things we did in a championship
game against a team like this,'' said a subdued Bill Parcells, the
Jets' coach, who in two breathless seasons had rebuilt the National
Football League laughing stocks and brought them within 60 minutes
of the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   While Parcells held his post-game news conference, Elway was
busy running a victory lap around Mile High Stadium after what was
probably his last game in Denver. The quarterback, who was
energized by the fans and by the Jets' mistakes in the second half,
is likely to retire after the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old Elway, who won his fifth AFC championship in his
16th season, was not at his best, completing 13 of 34 passes for
173 yards. But his 11-yard touchdown pass to Howard Griffith in the
third quarter started Denver's comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Davis once again led the Broncos, rushing for 167 yards
and a touchdown. The Jets' failures, meanwhile, were punctuated by
the startling fact that Curtis Martin, their leading runner and one
of the best in football, was held to 14 yards on 13 carries. It was
the worst day of his pro career, and it included a lost fumble, his
second in the playoffs. During the regular season, he had lost the
ball only once in 369 carries.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets were making their first appearance in a conference
championship game in 16 years, and their upset victory 30 years ago
in Super Bowl III remains their only Super Bowl visit. But into the
second half Sunday, their surprising run to the playoffs seemed to
be gaining even more momentum. Vinny Testaverde, who had come to
symbolize the Jets' resurrection under Parcells, completed his
first 13 passes and would finish 31 of 52 for 356 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fantastic,'' Jets guard Todd Burger said. ``There was
so much optimism. But then you think you've got almost 250 yards by
halftime and you've only got 3 points, and Denver must be thinking,
`All we're behind is by 3 and we're playing lousy.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, one of the NFL's best-conditioned teams, had not
collapsed like this in a game this season. Reasons for Sunday's
failure could be found, perhaps, in the mile-high altitude or the
atmosphere in the tumultuous stadium, where more than 75,000 people
stomped their feet so hard it seemed that the looming Rockies might
quiver.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the Jets came apart near the end, with Testaverde
intercepted twice in the fourth quarter, it was apparent that the
franchise had gone into a new era. It just was not going to the
Super Bowl yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a team we came a long way,'' Testaverde said. ``A longer
way than people expected us to.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Byars, one of the ``good hands'' people with whom Parcells
had surrounded Testaverde, produced a rare fumble after a reception
to stifle a drive deep in Denver territory in the second quarter.
The game was scoreless, and mistakes like that kept Denver hoping.
In fact, the Jets lost the ball to Denver three times within the
20-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the ball tucked,'' said Byars, the leading career
receiver among NFL running backs. ``If I had to do it over again,
I'd do it the same way. I must have made that play hundreds of
times.''
</P>
<P>
   He just didn't make it Sunday. Nor did other Jets.
</P>
<P>
   These two teams combined for more than 900 points during the
regular season. But it took almost the entire first half before
anyone scored even 3 points. That turned out to be the Jets, who
finally put up points after dominating for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   That sole score was John Hall's 32-yard field goal as time
expired, and it was positioned, in the mistake-filled half, by a
Broncos penalty on a punt. That put the Jets in good field position
after they had misfired repeatedly themselves. Indeed, the game's
opening drive ended with a failed 42-yard field-goal attempt by
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it was kicked amid gusts that hit 32 mph and sent
orange balloons swirling, flags snapping to attention and stray
pieces of paper flying. Whatever the reason, a Jets drive deep into
Denver territory was wasted.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos went three-and-out and the Jets got the ball again,
but Martin lost the ball and Tyrone Braxton recovered at the Denver
44.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' defense troubled Elway for much of the game. He moved
his team to the 1-yard line after Martin's fumble, but the Broncos
were halted. On fourth-and-goal from the 1, Mo Lewis tipped away
Elway's pass.
</P>
<P>
   But the Broncos weren't only stopped close. Repeatedly, they
could not solve the defense orchestrated by Bill Belichick. The
Jets, using a 3-4 alignment that relied on a coordinated rush and a
pass-defense alignment that took away the center of the field,
simply looked better than Denver. Elway did not have a completion
in his first three drives. The Jets took away the middle,
double-teamed the Pro Bowl tight end Shannon Sharpe and did not
seem concerned about Elway throwing the ball deep.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second half, the Broncos heard their first boos _
quite possibly their first here of the season _ when they went
three-and-out and Tom Rouen botched a 29-yard punt.
</P>
<P>
   Two drives later, a Jets rookie tight end named Blake Spence,
who had not even put on a uniform for 10 straight games, loomed out
of obscurity to block a punt that put the Jets only 1 yard out of
the Denver end zone. Spence, a fifth-round draft pick, suited up
because Parcells was unhappy with free safety Jerome Henderson. So
Spence blocked Rouen's punt from the end zone. The Jets' Fred
Baxter recovered on the 1.
</P>
<P>
   One play later, Martin found the end zone, and the Jets led by
10-0.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Jets could not build on that momentum. In fact, the Broncos
smothered it immediately. Vaughn Hebron returned the kickoff 28
yards, and then Elway connected with Ed McCaffrey, who had earlier
dropped two passes, for a 47-yard completion over a fooled Victor
Green.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Elway and the Broncos had rediscovered their
quick-strike capability. The drive took 93 seconds and ended with
an 11-yard touchdown toss to Howard Griffith.
</P>
<P>
   And then the Jets' turnovers finally cost them points. Jason
Elam's kickoff, held by the wind, bounced in front of the returner,
David Meggett. The Jets' James Farrior tried to snare the ball, but
fumbled it away to Keith Burns on the Jets' 32.
</P>
<P>
   That led to a 44-yard field goal by Elam to tie the score at
10-10 with 8 minutes 23 seconds left in the third quarter. The
sense that something had turned was palpable. Soon, helped again by
good field position after Darrien Gordon's 11-yard punt return,
Elam cut through the dangerous winds for a 48-yard field and a
13-10 lead. It was Denver's first.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the third quarter ended, Davis punctuated the
Broncos' comeback with a 31-yard scoring run.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth quarter brought another Jets fumble, this time by the
seldom-used receiver Alex Van Dyke, and then Testaverde's first
interception of the game. Gordon returned it 18 yards to the Jets'
18, and it led to Elam's 35-yard field goal and the crushing 23-10
lead. Later, Testaverde was intercepted again, on a deflection as
he started to throw the ball _ a reminder of times when he played
for teams who needed his strong arm to mount comebacks.
</P>
<P>
   For Sunday, the team that had surrounded him most of the season
had collapsed, and so did many of its big-play performers.

JETS NOTEBOOK: HENDERSON'S MISPLAY COSTS HIM A UNIFORM
</HEADLINE>
   (ms)

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ In a matter of weeks, Jerome Henderson has gone from
being a starter to the bench to not even dressing for Sunday's
game. Henderson, the Jets' former starting free safety, was
supposed to help Otis Smith on Jan. 10 as the half came to a close.
Instead, Jacksonville's Jimmy Smith slipped between the defenders
and snared a 52-yard touchdown pass from Mark Brunell. The Jets
won, but Henderson fell irretrievably out of favor.
</P>
<P>
   A first-stringer for the first 14 games, Henderson was first
benched in favor of Corwin Brown, a better open-field tackler. The
little-used rookie tight end Blake Spence suited up in place of
Henderson on Sunday. Spence blocked a third-quarter punt that gave
the ball to the Jets on the Denver 1-yard line. Curtis Martin
scored on the next play.
</P>
<P>
   DELAY OF GAME
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Paul Tagliabue delayed the Jets-Broncos start for
10 minutes because the National Football Conference championship
game between Atlanta and Minnesota had gone into overtime. The
actual kickoff came at 4:17 p.m., Eastern _ the moment Atlanta won
on a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   A ROOTING INTEREST
</P>
<P>
   The used-car chain owned by H. Wayne Huizenga, the Dolphins'
owner, took out an ad in The Rocky Mountain News before the game,
telling the Broncos, ``We look forward to welcoming you to Miami
for Super Bowl XXXIII.'' Many of the Jets were furious that
Huizenga would take out an ad to, in effect, root for their
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   NOT FRANCHISE PLAYERS
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have to list Monday the five players they are going to
make available to the Cleveland Browns in the expansion draft. Each
club can pull back two players after losing one. The maximum number
of players any team can lose is two.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Like picking a lock, like cracking a safe, the Denver
Broncos tried a variety of combinations on the Jets. The Broncos
brought a slick plan and sly hands and crafty tools. But nothing
was working. The Jets were leading, 10-0, with 11 minutes 56
seconds left in the third quarter of the American Football
Conference championship game.
</P>
<P>
   And then what happened for the rest of the quarter was the stuff
that makes the Broncos so frightening. The Jets allowed a 47-yard
pass play that led to Denver's first points. The Jets let a kickoff
blow in the wind to lead to more Denver points. The Jets allowed
more big pass plays and then gave up Terrell Davis' 31-yard
touchdown run when they pursued too much and tackled too softly.
Swoosh! A 20-point quarter. A foot to the pedal. Another to the
throat.
</P>
<P>
   And that did it. The Broncos were galloping now. They stretched
the field and stepped to another gear and left the Jets gasping,
wallowing in their mistakes, marveling at the Broncos' force. It
was a 23-10 Denver victory before a crowd of 75,482 at Mile High
Stadium that pushed Denver into its second consecutive Super Bowl.
It won last year. It will shoot for another championship against
the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   In the end the Jets were talking about their mistakes (six
turnovers) and the wind. They said it was a gusting, swirling wind,
one that changed the kicking game and the passing game.
</P>
<P>
   But really, the force of the Broncos, their mad dash to keep
their season alive was what blew the Jets away.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would be standing on the sideline and the wind would blow
you two feet,'' said Jets special teams ace Chris Hayes. ``It was
hard to judge the ball. I have never felt wind like that. But you
know, they are the champions. They played in it. They know how to
compete, especially at this level. We were up 10-0. And then I
looked at the scoreboard and all of sudden it was 20-10. I couldn't
believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Momentum changed. In the first half the Jets held the hybrid
Denver offense to a long run of 18 yards and long pass completion
of 12 yards. And then in the third quarter, after Denver receiver
Ed McCaffrey, wide open and deep over the middle, grabbed a 47-yard
catch to the Jets 17, the lock had been picked. The safe was
cracked. The Denver offense would earn a scoring pass of 11 yards
(John Elway to fullback Howard Griffith) and Davis would crank a
run of 20 yards before scoring on the 31-yarder.
</P>
<P>
   It was different. A different Denver from the game's first 33
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we get off the ground, we can fly,'' said Denver
linebacker Seth Joyner. ``Our offense got them on their heels. When
the Jets went up 3-0, we said, OK, we can make that up anytime. But
when they got up 10-0, we said, enough. We kicked it into another
gear. That' the type of football team we have. You look at the
Cowboys that won Super Bowls and the 49ers that won them, and they
had the kind of teams that if they got focused and would bear down,
you were in trouble. That's the kind of team this is. A 10-0 game
sinks in. It was knuckle up time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets were up 10-0 and then Elway hit McCaffrey for 47 yards.
Elway threw the scoring pass to Griffith. The Jets let the ensuing
kickoff flutter in the air and land short and Denver recovered it;
that let to a Denver field goal. The Jets let another kick flutter
before recovering this one short of the 20. The Jets went three
plays and punted. Denver took over and drove for another Elam field
goal. The Jets went three plays and punted. Davis scored on a
31-yard touchdown run.
</P>
<P>
   Swoosh!
</P>
<P>
   We always hear about the howling wind at Giants Stadium, how it
swirls and spins and turns visiting teams upside down and inside
out. One would think the Jets would be familiar with this, even
here. They were not. They dropped the ball, they turned it over,
the passing game blew against the wind and the Jets, for all of
their effort on offense, would not score for nearly the final 42
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came in wanting to deliver some blows and tackle hard, but
no way did we think they would turn it over like that,'' said
Denver safety Steve Atwater. ``We took their running game away and
that hurt them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets gained 14 rushing yards. Denver gained 178.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that is not the way that they wanted to play this
game,'' Joyner said. ``I know they didn't want to put it all on the
passing game.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right. Forced to throw it in the wind, the Jets chances
blew away. So did their confidence and their ability to hold onto
the ball. Denver, meanwhile, rode the wind like a friend. Once they
cracked the Jets, it was a swift breeze.
</P>
<P>
   The initial gust was the pass to McCaffrey. That was where the
Broncos began to pick the lock. To solve the combination.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, but it was on a near busted play. The Broncos receivers,
McCaffrey and Rod Smith, lined up opposite. McCaffrey ran toward
Elway under center as the team lined up but Elway told him to get
back, to go back to the left side of the formation. Elway simply
switched their pass routes. Smith, on the right, would now run the
crossing route. McCaffrey, on the left, would now run the post.
</P>
<P>
   And the Jets safety Victor Green would bite at play action and
at receiver action in front of him. He looked toward Smith, who was
crossing in front of him. McCaffrey flew past Green, wide open,
with Corwin Brown making the saving tackle at the Jets 17. The
Broncos call this kind of action a Cadillac route. It turned out
regal and royal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had struggled all day making a big play and the coaches saw
Green biting on stuff in front of him and called a great play,''
McCaffrey said. ``John did a great job of getting us together when
we weren't together. Green jumped on Rod's route. That left me
free. I was glad to get it started.''
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Sharpe, the Broncos tight end, said of Elway's
improvisation: ``Just another example of John making chicken salad
out of you-know-what. That's what a veteran and great leader like
John can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Momentum swung. The wind blew. After McCaffrey's catch, Denver
started beating the Jets with the first hit on both sides of the
ball. The doors flew open. The defending champions rose.
</P>
<P>
   In high school, college, in the pros, in all levels of football,
momentum changes things. One could feel it turning, sense it
blossoming for Denver in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to say it,'' said John Hall, the Jets kicker, ``but I
guess you'd have to say they are better than us. That was some
third quarter for them.''
</P>
<P>
   One where the Jets were swept away.

A TOWN COMES TO LIFE FOR ITS HOMETOWN HERO
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ As night fell on this working-class hamlet just
over the Nassau County border from the borough of Queens, the
Testaverde family home looked like any other house here. The front
window glowed blue.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Mercedes out front with ``HEISMN86'' license plates
suggested the people inside might be a little more worked up than
their neighbors about the Jets-Broncos game on television.
</P>
<P>
   Across Elmont, the once-again-proud hometown of Jets quarterback
Vinny Testaverde, it seemed as if everyone was feeling the strain
of the American Football Conference championship game: Dogs didn't
get walked until halftime. Pizza makers raced to fill
house-party-sized orders, spinning pies with one eye on the game.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, and for the first time in memory, life in sleepy,
out-of-the-way Elmont has actually been exciting. Longtime Giants
fans draped themselves in Jets green. Students at Sewanhaka High
School, Testaverde's alma mater, became used to the television
cameras out front. Little kids practically tripped over their
bright new oversized No. 16 jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   The die-hard fans _ the ones whose beat-up shirts and hats have
the swept-wing design from the long, lean years _ have had to prove
themselves to upstarts who never winced through an entire season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I own this bar nine years,'' said Joe Funaro, pulling beers at
Bleachers, near the south end of town, as his tavern filled with
fans. ``The Jets always took a back seat to the Giants, until
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Civic pride surfaced on the signs of shops along Hempstead
Turnpike just east of Belmont Raceway. Cinelli's Restaurant
advertised its $5.95 lunch special beneath a more pressing message:
``Vinny Vidi Vinci _ Go Jets Go _ Beat the Broncos!'' The Giordano
family, owners of Tulip Caterers, got into the act, too, coming up
with the Vinny Testaverde hero: prosciutto, sopressata, fresh
mozzarella, roasted peppers and red onions on a footlong roll.
Sunday, they were selling faster than scratch tickets and beer.
``This makes my blood flow,'' said Vincent Giordano Sr., standing
behind the counter. He added that his son had played Pop Warner
football with Testaverde when they were both 10 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Even Sunday night, as the Jets squandered an early lead in a
23-10 loss, people kept comparing their connections to the
Testaverdes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vinny's father did the patio on my backyard,'' said Mike
Tetro, a retired postal worker who was visiting American Legion
Post 1033.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mechanic's helper is his nephew,'' said Frank Klappert, a
retired electrician. ``He once got a tour of the locker room.''
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the bar, three generations of men named Bill
Ost were watching the game, losing their voices spelling
``J-E-T-S'' just in time to sit too quietly through a disappointing
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Bill J. Ost, 68, the post commander, was hoping the Jets would
pull out a victory and make it to the Super Bowl so Testaverde
could follow up a storybook season with an appearance as grand
marshal of Elmont's Memorial Day parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he got the Heisman Trophy, we gave him a parade,'' Ost
said. ``That was the first time they closed down Hempstead Turnpike
on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill M. Ost, 41, a technician for Bell Atlantic and a Sewanhaka
booster, was thinking of what a Super Bowl appearance would do for
Elmont and the high school. ``Telly Savalas went to Sewanhaka,'' he
said. ``And Al Oerter. He won four gold medals in the discus. But
that's nothing next to the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill E. Ost, 16, a backup running back on this year's Sewanhaka
football team, was hoping all the hype would renew interest in his
team's games, which has been flagging as the school's enrollment
has dwindled in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to say a rosary,'' his grandmother, Mary Ost, said
near the end of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better make it a novena,'' her son said.
</P>
<P>
   All of Elmont's prayers weren't enough. By 7:45 p.m., minutes
after the game ended, the American Legion hall was as quiet as
ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate this!'' said young Bill E. Ost, walking out, his voice
hoarse, with nothing to show for it. ``Just when you think they're
finally going to make it, it's `wait till next year' again.''

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Wait until the boys who were out ice-fishing
Sunday afternoon get wind of this one.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota Vikings, with the most prolific offense in the
history of the game, reinforced by a kicker who hadn't missed since
before the country ever heard of Monica Lewinski, supposedly could
walk across a lake whether it was frozen or not.
</P>
<P>
   But in the second half of the NFC championship game, when the
walleye had to be biting more than the Atlanta Falcons'
cornerbacks, who stayed in a soft zone and prevented Minnesota's
big-play receivers from doing their thing, the Vikings took a
chilling dip.
</P>
<P>
   After Gary Anderson of the Vikings had a streak of 101
successful place-kicks come to a stunning end when he misfired from
38 yards with 2:18 to go, Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler drove
his team to a tying touchdown and then to the game-winning field
goal in overtime that put the Falcons into their first Super Bowl
with a 30-27 upset win.
</P>
<P>
   Exciting, but not heart-stopping, as Falcons Coach Dan Reeves
vouched.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can stand today, my heart must be in pretty good shape,''
said Reeves, who had bypass surgery five weeks ago. ``The only
thing better would be doing the Dirty Bird (the Falcons' victory
dance) in downtown Miami in two weeks. That might not be pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta meets the AFC champion Denver Broncos, the team that
Reeves took to the Super Bowl three times in the 1980s, for the NFL
title in Miami on Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons led the NFL in time of possession and turnover
margin, two statistics that go a long way toward assuring victory.
Their defense was second only to San Diego's in stopping the run.
</P>
<P>
   But few gave them a chance against the explosive Vikings, who
scored an NFL-record 566 points in the regular season and 41
against the Cardinals in their playoff opener. But Minnesota, which
had the ball eight times after halftime, scored only seven points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then a guy who never misses, missed,'' Reeves said. ``When
they drove it into field-goal range, I'm sure they felt pretty good
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, 39, with 17 years' experience, has made more field
goals than any kicker in the history of the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously that's a disappointing time for that to happen,''
Anderson said. ``We were working as hard as we can to get to the
Super Bowl, and then for that to happen. . . . That is a part of
field-goal kicking. My job is to line up and fire those field goals
through, and unfortunately, that one didn't go through. Most of
them have, which makes it bitterly disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler, who counts the Cardinals among the many teams that
cast him off, completed four passes for 58 yards, including a
16-yard touchdown pass to to Terance Mathis, that tied the score at
27 with 49 seconds left in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Then, to the disgust of the 64,060 in the Metrodome, Vikings
Coach Dennis Green ordered quarterback Randall Cunningham to take a
knee with 30 seconds remaining on third down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had two good downs, and if you don't have a first down by
then, there are a lot of things that could have happened with
another play that would not have worked in our favor,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Vikings' strategy just before halftime, when they
had the ball and a 20-7 edge with 1:17 remaining, was questioned by
the fans. Rather than running out the clock and taking the
two-score lead at the break, the Vikings might have gotten greedy.
</P>
<P>
   From their 18-yard line, Cunningham threw twice, completing
neither. On third down, Cunningham tried to throw again, but
Falcons defensive end Chuck Smith got to Cunningham and stripped
the ball. Falcons tackle Travis Hall recovered at the 14 with 59
seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler, who completed 27 of 43 passes for 340 yards and three
touchdowns, needed only one play to connect with Mathis on a
scoring pass that reduced the Falcons' halftime deficit to 20-14.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was huge,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   But not as huge as the Falcons making the Vikings punt twice in
overtime, or as huge as Chandler firing two passes for 41 yards to
tight end O.J. Santiago, whose second-quarter fumble set up a
Vikings touchdown. That positioned another aging kicking legend,
Morten Andersen _ also in his 17th season _ to send the Falcons to
the Super Bowl with a 38-yard field goal, from nearly the exact
spot where Gary Anderson had missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear about our defense but never about our offense,''
Falcons linebacker Cornelius Bennett said. ``You hear about
Minnesota's offense. But I don't think our offense gets enough
credit. We have a great offense, and Chris Chandler and the guys
keep proving it over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are still going to say that we don't deserve to be in
the Super Bowl. If we win, they'll say we are lucky. It's going to
take some time, but maybe some day we'll get some credit. We have a
pretty good football team.'' &QL;

DOES TYSON HAVE FUTURE?  
 MANY EXPERTS FIND KO OF BOTHA UNCONVINCING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Mike Tyson's comeback victory Saturday night over
Frans Botha got mixed reviews that left questions about his ability
to regain a major title, but there was no doubt about his immediate
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson said he is returning to the Valley to live and train for
his next bout, which could be set for April 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got love for Phoenix,'' Tyson said after he overcame a shaky
four rounds to score a fifth-round knockout with a single punch, a
straight right hand. ``I'm coming back. Definitely.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson said he hopes to resume training at Phoenix's Madison
Square Garden in about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to correct all the things I messed up tonight,'' said
Tyson, who was unable to put together combinations and appeared to
have lost some critical hand speed in the early going of his first
fight in 19 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't prove anything. I'm just trying to do well. I have a
long way to go. I have a new trainer (Tommy Brooks). We're working
on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The job figures to be difficult, if not impossible. More than
one commentator said Tyson appeared to be finished as a heavyweight
contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``A shot fighter,'' ESPN analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   But the jury is still out. Evander Holyfield also was dismissed
in the same terms in the weeks before he overcame impossibly long
odds to beat Tyson in their first bout.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, one thing seemed clear. Tyson's next opponent
probably will be cut along the same lines as Botha. Axel Schulz,
Vaughn Bean and Lou Savrese are possibilities, according to Tyson
adviser Shelly Finkel.
</P>
<P>
   None of the three appears to have much more of a chance than
Botha did. Meanwhile, any of three would give Tyson another chance
to rediscover dormant skills.
</P>
<P>
   But the Tyson nominees also present a problem. By all accounts,
Botha-Tyson was a tough sell. Pay-per-view receipts have yet to be
announced, but cable operators reported that sales were slow.
</P>
<P>
   At the MGM Grand Arena, there was a subdued crowd of 12,519,
about 2,000 short of capacity. Many of those seats, initially
priced between $200 and $1,200, were sold to MGM employees for $16
to $48.
</P>
<P>
   Main Events, a New Jersey promotional firm, is expected to push
Andrew Golota as an opponent if pay-per-view sales are a
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-hitting, controversial Golota probably would generate a
lot more interest than any of the other three, who might as well be
Manny, Mo and Jack to an increasingly indifferent public.
</P>
<P>
   But Tyson's difficulty against light-hitting, slow-footed Botha
served notice that he isn't ready for Golota, whose big punches
could terminate a plan for Tyson to eventually fight Holyfield for
a third time.
</P>
<P>
   For the always-troubled Tyson, there is another potential
disruption. His freedom hinges on a rematch with a judge in
Maryland. On Feb. 5, he faces sentencing on a no-contest plea to
misdemeanor assault charges.
</P>
<P>
   After he is sentenced, a judge in Indianapolis is expected to
rule on whether he violated the terms of his parole. He has been on
probation since his release from prison in 1995 after serving time
on a sexual-assault conviction.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't likely that his angry, profane outbursts throughout
last week will assure any judge that he can stay out of further
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   His volatile temper flared even in victory. At the post-fight
news conference, he continued to condemn the media for what he
called ``character assassination.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he was asked to explain why he rushed to rescue
Botha from falling through ropes in the seconds after his vicious
knockout blow landed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a brother,'' Tyson said. ``Look, this is boxing. It's not
that serious. But there are some people I'd like to let go through
the ropes.''
</P>
<P>
   They're all sitting along press row.
</P>
<P>
   Still a New Yorker &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Tyson declared the Valley his new home in October, he said
he might be introduced before the opening bell Saturday night as
being from Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale can relax. Tyson was still from Catskill, N.Y. &QL;

NEW YORK'S VOICE GROWS FAINTER IN CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif. Texas) (ko) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ No one ever said it was easy being a member of
Congress from New York state, with all those stereotypes to
overcome. Too liberal. Too greedy. Too pushy. Too New York City.
(Even if you are from Buffalo.)
</P>
<P>
   And it just might be getting harder.
</P>
<P>
   As the 106th Congress prepares to get down to business in the
coming weeks, New York's delegation finds itself in a potentially
depressing, but increasingly familiar, spot: losing seniority on
important committees, marginalized by the Republican leadership and
likely to lose two more seats in the post-2000 redistricting, which
is expected to drop New York from the second to the third largest
delegation, behind California and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Last year alone, the delegation lost its three most influential
Republicans, a crucial change in a GOP-controlled Congress. Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato was defeated by Charles Schumer, then a member of
the House, while two other congressmen retired: Gerald Solomon of
Glens Falls, who was chairman of the powerful House Rules
Committee, and Bill Paxon from the Buffalo region, who was a top
political adviser to House leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Those departures came on top of the 1977 resignations of Susan
Molinari, a Staten Island Republican who was part of the House
leadership, and Floyd H. Flake, a respected six-term Democrat from
Queens. And last year, one of the delegation's longest-serving
Democrats, Thomas J. Manton from Queens, retired.
</P>
<P>
   If all that were not enough, the state's senior Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, a four-term Democrat who sits on the Finance
Committee and has been a major force in directing federal aid to
the state, plans to retire at the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Michael J. Malbin, a professor of political science at the State
University of New York at Albany, said that together those
departures would ``hurt the state's ability to get things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Al D'Amato, whatever else you thought about him, was a man who
fought hard for projects,'' Malbin said. ``Schumer will work just
as hard, but he'll have less bargaining power with the Republican
majority.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is upset by the changes: For junior members, the
turnover represents an opportunity to shine. ``We've experienced a
loss, and we need to work hard to help fill that vacuum,'' said
Rep. Rick Lazio, a four-term Republican from Suffolk County who as
a deputy whip is now the highest ranking New Yorker in the House
Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   To Democrats, the ouster of D'Amato, a powerhouse in both state
and national Republican politics, was a major victory, particularly
since he has been replaced by Schumer, who served nine terms in the
House and is expected to be a force in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But state and local officials worry that the delegation's
diminished stature could hamstring their efforts to obtain federal
money for hospitals, education and transportation projects this
year. The delegation will also have its hands full fending off
attempts in Congress to block New York City from transporting its
garbage to other states.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon, in a recent interview, said he was concerned that the
new Congress would not meet New York's needs. ``We in New York are
discriminated against by the rest of the country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and even some Republicans questioned the significance
of the delegation's recent departures, contending that Paxon and
Solomon were not always effective advocates for the state among
their conservative colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   But many members said they expected the delegation to have to
scratch and claw a bit harder for most of the things it wants this
year.
</P>
<P>
   It was not that long ago that the rest of the House allied
itself against New York mainly because the state's delegation was
so big and influential. As recently as in the 1960s, New York's
41-member delegation was the largest. But the state's population
growth has not kept pace with growth in the South and the West, and
the delegation has shrunk steadily to its current 31 members, a
distant second to California's 52.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the delegation's diminished size, some analysts contend
that New York's current members of Congress, a few exceptions
notwithstanding, lack the flamboyance and aggressive ambition of
their predecessors. But, paradoxically, that may be to the state's
benefit if it means today's members stay put, gaining seniority and
power in the House the way Southern members historically have done.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is Rep. Charles Rangel, who is arguably less
colorful than the man he unseated, Adam Clayton Powell Jr., but
whom his peers consider a more effective legislator. Rangel is in
line to become chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee
if the Democrats recapture the House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Still, New York's delegation has several important things going
for it. For one, its many moderate Republicans are in a position to
exert considerable influence over their conference this year
because their party holds such a thin majority and the Republican
leadership will need their votes to pass anything.
</P>
<P>
   For another, several New Yorkers, particularly Schumer, have
strong ties to the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Third, New York members hold leading positions on several major
committees, the most important being five seats on the House
Appropriations Committee, which sets federal spending levels.
</P>
<P>
   Other New Yorkers have emerged as leaders in areas of particular
importance for the state, including Rep. James Walsh, a Republican
from Syracuse, as chairman of a subcommittee that oversees veterans
affairs and housing, and Rep. John LaFalce of Buffalo, as the
ranking Democrat on the banking committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, a Republican from Utica, said: ``We've
always had to scramble. And we'll be just fine. It's New York
against the world.''

TKACHUK MAKES EARLY RETURN TO LINEUP  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Coyotes Captain Keith Tkachuk hastened his return to
the ice Sunday night against the Chicago Blackhawks after missing
eight games because of a broken rib.
</P>
<P>
   Plans were for him to return Tuesday night at home vs. St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to sit out, especially when you're the captain,''
said Tkachuk, who wore a protective flak jacket, before Sunday's
game. ``When you don't win, you want to be down there helping and
contributing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably be a little cautious, but when you tell the
coach you want to play and he puts you out there, there are no
excuses. Whether you're 100 percent, 20 percent, 80 percent, you
have to go out and play.''
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Bobby Smith said the decision was made to play
Tkachuk only after it was determined Tkachuk wasn't putting himself
at risk.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes' play of late has been ragged, straying from the
strong forechecking and solid neutral zone game they had played
earlier in the season. Entering the Chicago game, they were 9-9-1
in December and January, after a 14-2-2 start and an unbeaten
November. Tkachuk missed 12 of those games because of various
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one guy playing right now, and that's Nikolai
Khabibulin,'' Tkachuk said. ``We're not playing well as a team. We
play one good game and then three bad. We don't have the
consistency we need.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning of the year we did, and played well in every
game. We did the right things. We weren't turning the puck over and
doing the stupid things that make you lose games. We have to get
back to playing solid and just play our game.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Crime scene &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jim Schoenfeld based his decision to start struggling
goalie Jimmy Waite against the Blackhawks partially on trying to
exorcise Waite's slump at the United Center, the very building in
which it started.
</P>
<P>
   After opening the season 6-0-2, Waite has allowed 14 goals in
his past three games. All were losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy can win the game,'' Schoenfeld said. ``It's a good
challenge for him. He'd been playing great hockey until our last
game in Chicago (4-3 loss). He had back-to-back performances below
his standards. We think this is the best place to come back and
turn his season around.''
</P>
<P>
   Slap shots &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With Tkachuk's return, the Coyotes reassigned center Trevor
Litowski to Springfield of the American Hockey League on Sunday
afternoon. Litowski scored his first NHL two games ago in a 5-3 win
over Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Deron Quint was a healthy scratch for the second
straight game since the Coyotes obtained defensive J.J. Daigneault
from Nashville. &QL;

CAL WINS BOLLER LOTTERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GERRY GITTELSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VALENCIA, Calif. _ Kyle Boller, who passed for a state-record
4,851 yards and 59 touchdowns for Hart High this season, has
accepted a football scholarship at California, he announced on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Boller, of Valencia, had narrowed his choices to Cal and Oregon.
He chose Cal after visiting the Berkeley campus over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``After seeing the campus, I just decided I liked the
atmosphere, the players, and coach (Tom) Holmoe.'' Boller said. ``I
just got the feeling this was MY place. It was sweet, and there is
so much to do there. I'm so happy and way excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Boller, a 6-foot-3, 210-pounder known for long-bomb touchdowns,
has a good chance to start as a freshman. Starter Justin Vedder
(2,322 yards, 11 TDs) graduates, while no returner attempted more
than 12 passes in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have an opportunity to play right away, and coach
Holmoe said the best one is going to start, so that is good to
know,'' Boller said. ``The coach was real honest with me from the
beginning, and I can really see myself playing for him for the next
four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Boller said he liked Berkeley much more than Oregon after
surveying both campuses over the last two weekends. He had also
considered Colorado, Florida State, and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Boller said he will sign a letter of intent Feb. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kyle weighed everything, but I think a big part of his
decision was because he wants to play right away,'' Hart coach Mike
Herrington said. ``Cal gives him that opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Boller led Hart (in nearby Newhall) to the Southern Section
Division III championship and was named Daily News Player of the
Year. His commitment to Cal means Boller can finally start
answering the telephone again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad to have the weight off my shoulders,'' Boller said.
``Everyone has been asking me where I'm going. I could not wait any
longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Boller said he will visit Cal again during spring football
practice before enrolling for summer school on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   He could become the second outstanding Cal quarterback from Hart
High _ after Joe Kapp, first-team All-American in 1958 (and much
later the Golden Bears' head coach).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing he decided because everyone has been wanting
to know,'' teammate Patrick Norton said. ```Where's Kyle going?
Where's Kyle going?' That's all anybody ever asks me. All I know
is, wherever he goes, he's going to be great. I said all along he's
the best quarterback I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Jerry Owens, a wide receiver, has committed to UCLA.
There is speculation that All-Southern Section linebacker Scott
Hunt also might sign with a Pacific-10 program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been nice to go to the same college,'' said
Owens, who was with Boller celebrating his decision Sunday. ``But
as things turned out, we each had to go our on own way. I think
it's awesome we're both going to play against each other in the
Pac-10 because we grew up together and now we get to keep in
touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Boller rose to prominence in one season after attempting just 27
passes as a junior.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave Kyle the ball and just went along for the ride,''
Herrington said. ``He's the one who pulled the trigger for us. I
predict he will continue having great success. Eventually, he will
be there playing on Sundays.''

CRITICS QUESTION CANCER MAPPING EFFORT'S METHODS AND PACE 
</HEADLINE>
 (ko) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was an audacious plan standing uneasily at the intersection
of cancer science and cancer politics: to explore possible links
between pollution and cancer by mapping every neighborhood in New
York state, showing cancer cases and sources of water, ground or
air contamination. Nothing like it had ever been attempted.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Legislature allocated $1 million for the effort,
but Gov. George Pataki vetoed it. The governor said the project
could be accomplished with existing money, and, mindful of the
powerful cancer survivors' lobby, he promised that the state Health
Department would proceed with the project. The veto, however, meant
that it was no longer a legislative mandate; it was entirely in his
administration's control.
</P>
<P>
   Nine months after the veto, the project has strayed far from
what the Legislature intended. The Pataki administration intends,
at least at the start, to map cancers only on a county-by-county
level, though that information is already public and researchers
say it has little scientific value. Administration officials say
they are not sure whether the first round of maps will include any
information on contaminants, which legislators and cancer survivors
say is the whole point of the project.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Department insists that it will eventually create
truly local maps, including environmental data, but it cannot say
when.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most disturbing to advocates of the project is that it
has become clear that maps of any kind are years away, even though
administration officials promised last year that preliminary maps
would be published within months.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer survivors' groups, particularly those on Long Island, and
environmentalists keenly want to see the maps to validate long-held
suspicions that there are higher-than-expected concentrations of
similar cancers in one discrete area that can be traced to
landfills, factories or water wells.
</P>
<P>
   But the scientific establishment has largely dismissed the
notion that such cancer clusters can be traceable to environmental
causes. And corporations that own polluted sites, and some real
estate interests, have quietly lobbied against the project, fearing
the liability it could mean for them.
</P>
<P>
   The administration contends that it must proceed cautiously to
produce the best possible data, and some of its independent
scientific advisers agree. It also asserts that if it publishes
maps without great care and a heavy layer of interpretation, it
risks alarming or confusing the public.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's critics counter that the state already has
the raw data to produce a basic version of the maps in weeks or
months and that more nuanced ones could come later. They say the
public has a right to see where cancer ``hot spots'' coincide with
pollution. Researchers would then know where to look for more
finely honed data, the critics say, giving a head start to the
effort to establish environmental causes for a disease that kills
40,000 New Yorkers a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're getting instead of a cancer map is an empty and
misleading effort that does nothing to place the facts before the
people of the state,'' said Assemblyman Richard Brodsky, a
Westchester County Democrat and chairman of the Environmental
Conservation Committee. Brodsky was a prime sponsor of the mapping
bill that the governor vetoed and is one of more than a dozen
Assembly members who wrote last week to the Health Department,
expressing concern at the direction of the project.
</P>
<P>
   Zenia Mucha, Pataki's communications director, said: ``The
Department of Health has to do what they think is the best
scientific study they can do. We're not going to allow political
considerations or political pressure to dictate how to do a
scientific study.''
</P>
<P>
   The cancer map was first proposed by cancer survivors on Long
Island's eastern end, where breast cancer and other cancers are
more prevalent than statewide or nationwide. They had charted
suspected cancer clusters in their own villages, by ZIP code, by
type of cancer and by proximity to hazardous-waste sites, an
exercise they hoped to duplicate across New York.
</P>
<P>
   Private researchers and government agencies have also
occasionally done local cancer mapping where there was already
suspicion of a cluster, but no one has attempted a detailed cancer
map of a state.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Department has a cancer registry, which collects the
name, address and type of cancer for every New Yorker found to have
the disease or determined by autopsy to have had it. The department
uses the information to publish annual reports on cancer incidence.
</P>
<P>
   The state also knows the positions of 2,000 toxic-waste sites,
400 industrial sites that it says are responsible for 95 percent of
toxic releases into the environment, every landfill and other
pollution sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cancer data already exist and the environmental factor
data already exist,'' Brodsky said. ``What the Legislature intended
was that the two be overlaid in the quickest responsible fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to criticism that the county-by-county mapping was
simply a repackaging of existing information and on other aspects
of the project, the department referred all questions to its public
affairs office.
</P>
<P>
   ``That tabular data exist, but it is not easy for the lay person
to read,'' said Kristine Smith, a department spokeswoman. ``A
graphic representation of information is much more
understandable.''

 &HT;    EDs: 1ST UPDATE _ also sent to (a) General News category.
 &HT;    Fans' dream comes true
 &HT;    By Virginia Anderson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlantans, as inexperienced at celebrating a pro
football championship as teenagers embarking on a first date,
figured out what to do by the thousands as they partied in the
streets of Buckhead, jammed Hartsfield International Airport and
swarmed the city of Suwanee to welcome home their Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   When Morten Andersen's overtime field goal sailed through the
uprights Sunday, it propelled the Falcons to their first Super
Bowl. It also set off a wild celebration that had metro Atlanta
partying well into the night, and sent fans scrambling to make
travel arrangements for Miami.
</P>
<P>
   More than 6,000 people filled the E concourse at the airport
awaiting the 10:35 p.m. arrival of the team. Thousands more were
turned away after 8:30 p.m. when airport security closed access for
fear the crowd posed a safety threat.
</P>
<P>
   More than 4,000 other fans were waiting in Suwanee at the team's
training facility. Suwanee police requested help from nearby police
forces for traffic and crowd control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been waiting for this for 30 years,'' said Gala
Hambrick, 35, who was part of the airport throng.
</P>
<P>
   ``This feels great,'' said her brother-in-law Kelvin Hill Sr.,
36, who brought his wife, son, two sisters-in-law and niece to
celebrate. ``I'm so proud of them, I could just burst.''
</P>
<P>
   In Suwanee, Ga., a spirited crowd clogged streets, honking horns
and waving signs. Thousands spilled over the practice field waiting
for the late arrival of their beloved Falcons. Traffic was at a
crawl.
</P>
<P>
   Delta officials gave periodic updates of the chartered jet's
flight home from the North, and with each announcement, the crowd
cheered louder. At 10:05 p.m., Delta announced the jet was just
south of Gainesville, Ga., and the crowd erupted into a frenzy,
chanting ``Super Bowl, Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   No serious incidents were reported at the airport or in Suwanee,
according to officials. At the airport, one fan was evicted from
the concourse for shoving a man in a wheelchair to position herself
for a better view. No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   The airport crowd included a lot of young children who have a
school holiday today for Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to beat Denver,'' said Andrew Filipp, 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mother told us if the Falcons won, we could have a Super
Bowl party with pizza and everything,'' said Andrew's brother,
Brett Mitchell, 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm in a dream,'' said Helen Lowe, 50, of Atlanta.
``In a minute, I'm afraid I'm going to wake up and it's not going
to be real.''
</P>
<P>
   Phones at travel agencies began ringing immediately after the
game ended as fans looked for deals to fly to Miami for the Jan. 31
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phones have been ringing off the hook,'' said Don Furlong,
division manager at AAA Norcross World Travel.
</P>
<P>
   Most commercial airlines are sold out to Miami already, said
Furlong. Super Bowl packages are not for the budget-conscious: A
four-night air travel deal including end-zone tickets goes for
$3,999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last Sunday we offered a charter to Minneapolis for the
championship game, it was sold out by Tuesday morning,'' said
Furlong.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Bross of Peachtree City already has booked airline tickets
and a hotel room. She's a Falcons season ticket holder who has
entered the lottery for a chance to buy Super Bowl tickets. If the
lottery doesn't come through, she'll go to Miami anyway and
scrounge for tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's phenomenal,'' she said. ``I've been following the Falcons
for 20 years and I can't believe we're going to the Super Bowl.''
When the Falcons overcame the Vikings in overtime, emotion overcame
Don Lancaster, 33.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cried. I mean you can't beat that,'' said Lancaster. ``When
you take into consideration how many people it takes to make
something like that work and then a team like Atlanta that just
hasn't had any support, and then it took somebody like Dan (Reeves)
to bring it together. You've got to thank him for that.''
</P>
<P>
   One fan who could have attended the NFC Championship game but
chose not to was Rebecca Smith, the daughter of team president
Taylor Smith. She stayed home to celebrate her 14th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was exciting to watch it on TV, but I was kind of mad I
wasn't with my dad,'' Rebecca said. ``I was cheering, I was so
excited, I was real tense, I couldn't watch. I had my doubts, but I
knew something good would come out of it.''

   NEW YORK _ At school-bus stops and in playgrounds, parents
across New York  &QR; 
state greeted their fourth-graders for three days in a row last
week with the same question: ``How was the test?'' Now, as everyone
emerges from the rocky debut of the feared and heralded
fourth-grade English test, the state's first major new test in a
decade, education officials are being forced to confront a painful
version of the same question: Was it a good test, or was it
hopelessly compromised?
</P>
<P>
   In many ways it was plagued by problems like late distribution
and accusations that some children might have had an unfair
advantage because they had been exposed to some of the subjects,
even a reading passage, in advance.
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews over the last few days, experts on educational
testing said the reality was more complicated: The new exam
embodied not only the worst but also the best of what standardized
testing is all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good test has to be worth teaching towards, and hopefully
this is,'' Lucy Calkins, a professor of education and a reading and
writing expert at Teachers College in New York City, said last
week. ``It's a huge jump ahead from our high-stakes exam last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The new test raises the bar for what children should know.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, fourth-graders were tested on skills like
listening and note-taking and were required to synthesize
information and write it down, rather than simply answer
multiple-choice questions about reading passages. In future years
the test will play a crucial role in whether fourth-graders move on
to fifth grade, but even this year it will be used to compare
schools with one another, unless the state decides that any such
comparison was compromised by the security lapses.
</P>
<P>
   Most troubling to many parents were the suggestions that the
test was vulnerable to widespread cheating and fraud, in part
because of what some critics called a series of missteps by state
officials and by the testing company, CTB/McGraw-Hill, which has a
three-year, $5.8 million contract with New York state to develop
and distribute the test. State Education Commissioner Richard P.
Mills has promised to appoint a panel to investigate such charges.
</P>
<P>
   In a bit of urban folklore typical of the charged atmosphere,
the test was rumored to have been posted on the Internet, said
Education Department spokesman Alan Ray. The rumor was false, he
said, although someone did post the official practice test.
</P>
<P>
   And in many ways, Deputy Education Commissioner James Kadamus
said, the new English Language Arts test is more secure than the
Degrees of Reading Power test it replaced. The old multiple-choice
test, he said, recycled the same questions roughly every three
years. Although teachers were not supposed to use old tests for
practice, they inevitably became increasingly familiar, if not
intimate, with the actual questions.
</P>
<P>
   Some state officials, along with outside testing experts, came
to believe that this familiarity with the test accounted for some
of the steady improvement in scores. In 1997, 94 percent of
students outside New York City passed the old test. Reading
passages and questions on the new test, Kadamus said, will be
changed every year, and never repeated.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the old answer sheets, scored by machine and locked up,
the test booklets' essays are graded by committees of teachers and
will be returned to schools so that children, teachers and parents
can see how they performed.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts said security was beside the point. Because the
new test focuses on reading long passages from literature, on
making inferences and writing essays with correct spelling, grammar
and punctuation, simply recognizing the literature or having
studied the subject may not confer much of an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Darling-Hammond, a professor of education at Stanford
University, compared the new test to the exam for a driver's
license. ``Most people already know what they're going to have to
do: parallel park, observe certain safety laws,'' she said. ``The
whole point of the test is not to be secret, but to demonstrate
that people actually have the skills it's designed to evaluate.''
</P>
<P>
   In the biggest blow to the test's credibility, children at many
public schools were delighted to discover that two out of six
reading passages on the multiple-choice section covered subjects _
the Wright brothers and the inventor Elijah McCoy _ that they had
studied in class. Those subjects had been included in a popular
commercial curriculum used in more than 260 schools across the
state, including 78 in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   But Susan Harmon, a teacher in San Pablo, Calif., who has
written about test bias, said a test that reflected the
fourth-grade curriculum, as this one does, could level the playing
field for disadvantaged children who are not exposed to the kind of
books, travel and other enrichment that middle-class children
typically enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew, who has sparred with
the state commissioner over whether it is fair to use a new test to
judge schools, said he, too, found some value in the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been one of the healthiest discussions we've had
in New York City since I've been here,'' he said Friday. ``I do
think there's a special kind of commendation that goes to these
children, in the sense that they have withstood all the anxiety,
that was adult-driven anxiety. At the same time, they are getting
clear messages about what it takes to do hard work.''

 &HT;    Fans' dream comes true
 &HT;    By Virginia Anderson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlantans, as inexperienced at celebrating a pro
football championship as teenagers embarking on a first date,
figured out what to do by the thousands as they partied in the
streets of Buckhead, jammed Hartsfield International Airport and
swarmed the city of Suwanee to welcome home their Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   When Morten Andersen's overtime field goal sailed through the
uprights Sunday, it propelled the Falcons to their first Super
Bowl. It also set off a wild celebration that had metro Atlanta
partying well into the night, and sent fans scrambling to make
travel arrangements for Miami.
</P>
<P>
   More than 6,000 people filled the E concourse at the airport
awaiting the 10:35 p.m. arrival of the team. Thousands more were
turned away after 8:30 p.m. when airport security closed access for
fear the crowd posed a safety threat.
</P>
<P>
   More than 4,000 other fans were waiting in Suwanee at the team's
training facility. Suwanee police requested help from nearby police
forces for traffic and crowd control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been waiting for this for 30 years,'' said Gala
Hambrick, 35, who was part of the airport throng.
</P>
<P>
   ``This feels great,'' said her brother-in-law Kelvin Hill Sr.,
36, who brought his wife, son, two sisters-in-law and niece to
celebrate. ``I'm so proud of them, I could just burst.''
</P>
<P>
   In Suwanee, Ga., a spirited crowd clogged streets, honking horns
and waving signs. Thousands spilled over the practice field waiting
for the late arrival of their beloved Falcons. Traffic was at a
crawl.
</P>
<P>
   Delta officials gave periodic updates of the chartered jet's
flight home from the North, and with each announcement, the crowd
cheered louder. At 10:05 p.m., Delta announced the jet was just
south of Gainesville, Ga., and the crowd erupted into a frenzy,
chanting ``Super Bowl, Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   No serious incidents were reported at the airport or in Suwanee,
according to officials. At the airport, one fan was evicted from
the concourse for shoving a man in a wheelchair to position herself
for a better view. No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   The airport crowd included a lot of young children who have a
school holiday today for Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to beat Denver,'' said Andrew Filipp, 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mother told us if the Falcons won, we could have a Super
Bowl party with pizza and everything,'' said Andrew's brother,
Brett Mitchell, 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm in a dream,'' said Helen Lowe, 50, of Atlanta.
``In a minute, I'm afraid I'm going to wake up and it's not going
to be real.''
</P>
<P>
   Phones at travel agencies began ringing immediately after the
game ended as fans looked for deals to fly to Miami for the Jan. 31
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phones have been ringing off the hook,'' said Don Furlong,
division manager at AAA Norcross World Travel.
</P>
<P>
   Most commercial airlines are sold out to Miami already, said
Furlong. Super Bowl packages are not for the budget-conscious: A
four-night air travel deal including end-zone tickets goes for
$3,999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last Sunday we offered a charter to Minneapolis for the
championship game, it was sold out by Tuesday morning,'' said
Furlong.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Bross of Peachtree City already has booked airline tickets
and a hotel room. She's a Falcons season ticket holder who has
entered the lottery for a chance to buy Super Bowl tickets. If the
lottery doesn't come through, she'll go to Miami anyway and
scrounge for tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's phenomenal,'' she said. ``I've been following the Falcons
for 20 years and I can't believe we're going to the Super Bowl.''
When the Falcons overcame the Vikings in overtime, emotion overcame
Don Lancaster, 33.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cried. I mean you can't beat that,'' said Lancaster. ``When
you take into consideration how many people it takes to make
something like that work and then a team like Atlanta that just
hasn't had any support, and then it took somebody like Dan (Reeves)
to bring it together. You've got to thank him for that.''
</P>
<P>
   One fan who could have attended the NFC Championship game but
chose not to was Rebecca Smith, the daughter of team president
Taylor Smith. She stayed home to celebrate her 14th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was exciting to watch it on TV, but I was kind of mad I
wasn't with my dad,'' Rebecca said. ``I was cheering, I was so
excited, I was real tense, I couldn't watch. I had my doubts, but I
knew something good would come out of it.''

LOOPHOLE ALLOWS MOTORISTS TO DODGE CALIFORNIA'S MANDATORY AUTO
INSURANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LEE CONDON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE, Calif. -- When judges in Glendale Municipal Court
fired traffic commissioner Dona Bracke, they exposed a loophole
that officials say allows hundreds of drivers to escape the state's
mandatory auto insurance law.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers ticketed for failing to carry proof of insurance were
turning up in her courtroom to fight $1,325 fines with what they
said were valid insurance cards.
</P>
<P>
   Without any formal method for verifying the cards, Bracke
ordered bailiffs to call insurance companies and check _ angering
lawyers because she was overstepping her judicial bounds but
exposing more than 50 cheats this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a perception out there that you can lie in traffic
court, that it's OK,'' said Bracke, who held her job for seven
years before she was fired. &UR;  &LR; ``People shouldn't be able to get off
for an inventive, imaginative story.''
</P>
<P>
   Glendale police officers said they will miss Bracke.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me she was expediting a system that definitely has some
loopholes that people found and were abusing,'' said Sgt. Rick
Young, a spokesman for the Glendale Police Department. ``She was
trying to fill that loophole. She was seeking truth in a system
that often doesn't get to the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Bracke's system clearly was not foolproof. Public defenders
fighting off the perjury charges against traffic defendants accused
her of collecting evidence and taking on the role of prosecutor. In
some cases traffic defendants who did have insurance were hauled
off to jail because insurance companies gave Bracke bad
information. Bracke was sued in federal court by three former
defendants alleging she violated their civil rights, but the case
was dismissed because the judge found she had judicial immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Bracke freely admits she made up the insurance verification
procedures in her courtroom as she went along, trying to come up
with the most efficient way possible to deal with an annual
caseload of 15,000-18,000 defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be easier for everyone if I just called the
insurance company. It was like one-stop shopping. They didn't have
to take another day off work,'' Bracke said. ``If there's no way to
check then the law is gutted.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislator who wrote the law will try to introduce new
legislation that would close the loophole by linking courts and the
Department of Motor Vehicles with insurance companies. And five
insurers are signed up for a pilot program that might lead to
quicker verification of a driver's insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The new insurance law has dramatically increased the caseload at
municipal courts throughout the state. In Los Angeles County,
nearly 50 percent of the cases heard in traffic court now involve a
defendant trying to fight off the fine for driving without proof of
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically what you have to do is rely on the person who is
saying, `This is my insurance,' that it's the truth,'' said Terrie
Wilfong, a government affairs analyst for the Judicial Council of
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge really doesn't have the authority to demand anything
other than what it says in the code. There's no sure way to find
out whether a person has insurance without getting the insurance
companies involved.''
</P>
<P>
   After judges objected to Bracke's techniques, she abandoned them
in March and began requiring people with questionable proof to
return with a letter from their insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her softening, her courtroom demeanor continued to
bother lawyers and she was fired in mid-December. Though Bracke is
gone _ she is considering a wrongful termination lawsuit _ the case
has legislators, police and court officials pondering how to close
the loophole.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Jackie Speier, D-San Francisco, wrote the mandatory
insurance bill in 1996 when she was in the Assembly. Insurance
companies at the time fought off her attempt to get them to
electronically link their records with the DMV and the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The insurance industry has got to get with the program. That
way judges and the DMV and the police making the stop would know if
a person has insurance or not,'' Speier said.
</P>
<P>
   Speier said she was happy that Bracke tried to enforce the law,
but acknowledged that the commissioner may have gone too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``My intention wasn't to get people thrown in jail. My intention
was to get people to buy auto insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   The DMV is slated next month to start a pilot program that would
electronically link five insurance companies to the state agency so
workers can immediately check whether a policy is valid.
</P>
<P>
   The DMV receives about 100,000 registration renewals every
working day and cannot now check the validity of all the proof of
insurance documents that are presented to them, said spokesman Evan
Nossoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The volume makes it difficult and we don't have funding for
that level of effort. The law does not set up checks and
balances,'' Nossoff said. ``The law says they have to present
proof. It doesn't authorize us to conduct investigations.''
</P>
<P>
   Vito Scattaglia, a commander in the DMV division of
investigations, said the quality of fake documents is improving and
that the problem grows worse by the day.
</P>
<P>
   When investigators do stings at DMV offices, about 35 of every
50 documents labeled as suspicious by front-line clerks turn out to
be bogus. But there is little review of registration renewals sent
in by mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's minimal screening of the mailings. That's a big flaw
in our system now,'' Scattaglia said.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists working for insurance companies oppose linking
insurance records with the DMV and courts.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Packer, a spokesman for the Association of California
Insurance Companies, said they have opposed electronic transfer and
will continue with that position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard the error factor could be as high as 35 percent.
You'd have a situation where hundreds of insurance companies with
all different kinds of computer systems trying to link up with one
(DMV) computer system,'' Packer said.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance arm of the Auto Club of Southern California is
part of the pilot program.
</P>
<P>
   Glendale police are finding that counterfeit car insurance
documents have become a major problem with the insurance law. Young
noted that some of Bracke's referrals to the police led them to
investigate bogus insurance companies that were selling fake
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Defendants have pleaded guilty in three cases, one case is in
trial and a fifth is still under investigation. One case involved
79 victims.
