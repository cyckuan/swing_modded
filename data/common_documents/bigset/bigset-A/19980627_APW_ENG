Poll: Ruling party running even to recapture Mexico governorship 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's ruling party has a strong chance to
win all three governorships at stake in July 5 elections, according
to a poll published Friday by the daily Reforma.
	   In the northern state of Chihuahua, the Institutional
Revolutionary Party held a 45-41 percent advantage among
respondents over the conservative National Action Party, but the
poll's 3 percent margin of error means the race is about even.
National Action won the gubernatorial race in 1992.
	   The poll found the PRI was in a dead heat with the leftist
Democratic Revolution Party in the north-central state of
Zacatecas, with each party favored by 42 percent of those polled.
The PRI currently holds power in Zacatecas.
	   In Durango, also in the north, the PRI was leading its closest
challenger, Nation Action, 39-31 percent.
	   A victory in Chihuahua would be a major boost for the PRI, which
has seen its once-ironclad control over Mexico eroded by reforms
that have made elections fairer and by the growth of opposition
forces.
	   The PRI, founded in 1929, did not lose a governor's race until
National Action won the Baja California governorship in 1989.
National Action has since won again in Baja California, as well as
in Guanajuato, Nuevo Leon, Jalisco and Queretaro. Democratic
Revolution won the Mexico City mayorship _ which is considered of
gubernatorial rank _ in 1997.

Chinese welcome Clinton at Tiananmen; agreements reached Clinton-Jiang statements AP White House Correspondent 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Top 10 grafs new to past-tense agreements; will be topped with
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _President Billl Clinton and Chinese President
Jiang Zemin held summit talks Saturday after a solemn welcoming
ceremony at Tiananmen Square, the sprawling plaza haunted with
memories of China's bloody crackdown against freedom nine years
ago.
	   ``I know I speak for the vast majority of the American people
when I say that this effort to improve and strengthen our
relationship is very welcome,'' Clinton told Jiang.
	   The two leaders agreed to no longer aim long-range nuclear
missiles at each other's country. It was a largely symbolic step,
since missiles could be retargeted in a matter of minutes. In
sealing the accord, the United States did not agree to relinquish
the possible first use of nuclear weapons, as China had demanded,
officials said.
	   Clinton thanked the Chinese leader for ``the open and honest
relationship we have developed in discussing all matters.''
	   Jiang said closer U.S.-China relations ``are an inevitable
development of history and are irresistible by any force on
Earth.''
	   The two leaders met in the Maoist-era Great Hall of the People
after standing at the edge of Tiananmen Square in an 11-minute
welcoming ceremony that included a 21-gun salute. Dozens of human
rights groups, as well as a House-passed resolution, had urged
Clinton not to step foot in Tiananmen because of the symbolism.
	   The two leaders announced a series of modest agreements.
	   China will move toward imposing stiffer export controls on
missile technology to third-world nations with nuclear ambitions.
With a nuclear arms race under way in South Asia, the two leaders
called anew on India and Pakistan to stop all nuclear tests. China
also said it would expand the export control list of chemicals that
could be used for weapons purposes.
	   In a sensitive area, China agreed to permit inspections of high
tech American exports, such as supercomputers, to insure they are
used for intended purposes.
	   To Americans, Tiananmen Square is a reminder of the military's
1989 killings of hundreds _ if not thousands _ of democracy
advocates. But to China, it is the country's spiritual and
political heart, where Mao Tse-tung declared victory in the
communist revolution of October 1949.
	   Clinton's arrival marked the final step in a gradual process of
ending America's post-Tiananmen diplomatic isolation of China. It
was a personal victory for Jiang, who made it a priority to arrest
the downward spiral in U.S.-Chinese relations and bolstered his
diplomatic stature in the process.
	   But the occasion was marred by China's arrest of several
dissidents, acts that clearly upset the White House.
	   ``The Chinese security apparatus (is) doing what comes naturally
to them,'' said National Security Adviser Sandy Berger. ``People
are not debris to be swept up for a visitor and we have expressed
our concern about this to the Chinese government.''
	   ``Their response so far has not been terribly satisfactory,''
Berger said. ``They dispute the facts.'' He said Clinton would tell
Chinese leaders that ``this is thoroughly unacceptable.'' While
China has made dramatic progress in some areas, Berger said,
``China's human rights record is terrible.''
	   Yet White House officials made clear that Clinton was not
prepared to punish China or pull back from expanding cooperation.
	   Critics in the United States kept after Clinton in the hours
before the welcoming ceremony.
	   At a hearing of a House International Affairs panel, Rep.
Christopher Smith, a conservative Republican, asserted that
Clinton's ``gentle'' criticism was not enough. He added, ``The
tortures are not gentle.''

U.S.-China summit talks yield missile pact 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with details from joint statement
With BC-Clinton-China
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The United States and China agreed Saturday to no
longer target each other's cities with nuclear missiles. But summit
talks fell short of U.S. hopes to stop China from selling missile
technology to Third World nations.
	   The agreement, hammered out over weeks of diplomatic
negotiations leading up to the summit, was formalized by President
Bill Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin in private meetings
at the Great Hall of the People.
	   In a joint statement, they also agreed to continue regular
U.S.-China summit meetings. On human rights, the most contentious
issue of Clinton's trip, the statement said:
	   ``The United States and China affirm their commitment to the
promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.
While the two countries have differences on human rights they agree
that candid dialogue is an important element for resolving those
differences.''
	   China, one of five declared nuclear powers, has 18 long-range
missiles _ 13 of them currently aimed at U.S. cities _ compared
with the United States' 6,000 or so nuclear warheads.
	   ``This demonstrates to the entire world that China and the
United States are partners, not adversaries,'' Jiang said in
remarks to reporters after his talks with Clinton.
	   Even with the detargeting agreement, a largely symbolic pact
that Russia also made with the United States last year, both U.S.
and Chinese missiles could easily be retargeted, but without the
hair-trigger speed that Clinton has said could lead to accidental
launch.
	   Beijing had wanted, as a condition of detargeting, a U.S.
promise never to be the first to launch nuclear weapons. Clinton
did not make that concession.
	   While he could claim a victory on detargeting, Clinton was
unable to extract from Jiang a pledge to stop selling missile
know-how to potentially volatile nations.
	   Instead, an administration official said China would agree only
to move toward imposing stiffer export controls on missile
technology to Third World nations with nuclear ambitions _ from the
Indian subcontinent to the Korean Peninsula.
	   The Chinese agreed to adhere to guidelines of the Missile
Technology Control Regime and to consider formally adopting the
arms-control measure, but no timetable was specified.
	   Further, China said it would expand the export control list of
chemicals, equipment and technology ``to assure they are not used
for production of chemical weapons.'' The two countries also called
for strengthening a biological weapons convention and affirmed
their ``commitment to ending the export and indiscriminate use of
antipersonnel land mines and to accelerating global humanitarian
mining.''
	   In a sensitive area, China said it would let the United States
check that high-technology American products exported to China,
such as supercomputers, are being used for approved purposes and
not being resold.
	   On trade, no breakthroughs were reached. China did not win U.S.
support for joining the World Trade Organization, but another round
of talks was scheduled for the week of July 20 in Geneva.

URGENT
With BC-Clinton-China
By WALTER MEARS
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ President Bill Clinton and Chinese President
Jiang Zemin agreed Saturday that they would no longer target their
nuclear weapons at each other's country, a decision Jiang said
``demonstrates the United States and China are partners, not
adversaries.''
	   After summit talks, Jiang also said in a joint appearance with
Clinton that China will not be the first to use nuclear weapons
``under any circumstances.'' Left unsaid was China's push for the
United States to make the same promise.
	   The presidents expressed satisfaction with the relationship
between China and the United States.
	   Said Jiang, ``We will make constant progress in the direction of
building a strategic partnership between China and the United
States'' as the nations move toward the 21st century.
	   He said, ``As China and the United States have different social
systems, ideologies, values and cultural traditions, we have some
difference of views on certain issues. However, they should not
become the obstacles in the way of the growth of China-U.S.
relations ... The development paths of the countries of the world
should be chosen by the peoples of the countries concerned.''
	   The Chinese leader said the United States must stick to its
policy of recognizing only one legitimate Chinese government, ``in
the interest of a smooth growth'' in U.S.-China relations.
	   Clinton said he and Jiang agreed to work to maintain stability
on the Korean Peninsula, and he reaffirmed the U.S. ``one China''
policy which opposes independence for Taiwan. He said he encouraged
more direct talks between Taipei and Beijing.
	   ``Clearly a stable, open, prosperous China ... is good for
America,'' Clinton said.

	   ``We agreed to that we need to work together to avoid

All Blacks win second test 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ All Blacks winger Jeff Wilson
scored two tries as New Zealand overcame an improved England 40-10
in the second rugby test at Eden Park on Saturday.
	   England put up its most committed performance of a dismal tour
and was behind 14-7 at halftime and 14-10 in the second half.
	   ``Obviously things didn't go right today,'' said All Blacks
captain Taine Randell. ``It was not a pretty performance but we go
there in the end.''
	   The scores might have been leveled in the dying minutes of the
first half but flanker Ben Clarke was held up by the defense near
the All Blacks' try-line.
	   Wilson and center Mark Mayerhofler scored ominous early tries
before England's tough captain Matt Dawson scored a superb solo try
to narrow the margin.
	   England's tackling was much improved from the record 76-0 and
64-22 losses to Australia and New Zealand respectively in the
previous two tests on tour.
	   But the early signs looked bleak when Wilson brushed aside
opposite number Austin Healey _ who was injured in the process _ to
touch down in the fifth minute and Andrew Mehrtens converted.
	   England, without a recognized goalkicker, saw Dawson and
fullback Matt Perry miss penalty chances before Mayerhofler
squeezed over after Randell had set up a powerful attacking
platform.
	   England could have folded at that stage, but scrum-half Dawson
led by example, cutting inside Mehrtens and Christian Cullen to
score a try which he also converted.
	   Jonah Lomu wasted a chance to increase New Zealand's lead,
allowing Josh Lewsey to tackle him with two men unmarked, then got
involved in a scrap with England hooker Richard Cockerill that
earned both players a warning from Australian referee Peter
Marshall.
	   Dawson cut the gap to 14-10 with a penalty 10 minutes after the
restart before Wilson crossed for his second try after 56 minutes.
	   He regathered a chip kick from replacement back Carlos Spencer,
who added the conversion.
	   The All Blacks moved out of danger on 63 minutes when Joeli
Viridi scored his first test try, finishing off a slick backline
move. Spencer's second conversion took the hosts to a 28-10 lead.
	   Three minutes later Isitola Maka scored a try on debut after
Cullen kicked through and Randell rounded off the scoring with a
try in the final minutes, giving Spencer a third conversion.
	   Scorers:
	   New Zealand 40 (Jeff Wilson 2, Mark Mayerhofler, Joeli Viridi,
Isitola Maka, Taine Randell tries; Andrew Mehrtens 2 goals, Carlos
Spencer 3 goals) def. England 10 (Matt Dawson try, Dawson 1 goal, 1
penalty goal). (tjh)

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ One Russian was killed and three were

said they are investigating why the Russian-made four-wheel-drive
vehicle overturned.
	   Traffic accidents are on the rise in Vietnam, claiming thousands

Washington and Baghdad could face tough choices after nerve gas report 
</HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Baghdad and Washington face tough choices
now that Army scientists have found traces of nerve gas in Iraqi
warheads, the most significant discovery by U.N. inspectors since
1995.
	   Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler told the Security
Council on Wednesday that there is ``no doubt'' the finding is
accurate, although he has asked Swiss and French laboratories for
confirmation.
	   If they confirm the U.S. military lab's findings, Iraq must
decide whether to admit to years of denying that it weaponized
deadly VX nerve gas and provide detailed information about the
program.
	   Otherwise, the United States and Britain will have a strong case
against any move by the Security Council to lift economic sanctions
imposed in 1990 after Saddam invaded Kuwait, touching off the Gulf
War.
	   Washington faces hard choices, too, with Iraq insisting
sanctions be removed and given the trouble the United States had
garnering support the last time Iraq challenged the United Nations.
The next opportunity for the Security Council to review _ and
theoretically lift _ the sanctions will come in October after
Butler files his next six-month report.
	   Unless the Iraqis provide the information by then, chances for
an end to sanctions this year are remote. Iraq's U.N. ambassador,
Nizar Hamdoon, says Baghdad had been hoping the inspections could
be finalized this year.
	   Even if Iraq makes a full disclosure, verifying the data could
take months, further delaying any end to sanctions.
	   ``If it doesn't look at any point the sanctions will be lifted,
Iraq will be reconsidering its policy,'' Hamdoon told PBS'
``NewsHour with Jim Lehrer.'' In a worst case scenario, that could
mean ordering the U.N. inspectors out of Iraq and hoping fellow
Arabs would ignore the sanctions.
	   Iraq also could gamble that a new crisis would force the
international community to negotiate a new deal more favorable to
Baghdad.
	   That tactic was used last year when the Iraqis threw out
American arms inspectors and barred the rest from visiting Saddam's
palaces, prompting U.S. President Bill Clinton to send U.S. forces
to the gulf and threaten airstrikes.
	   Iraq relented and allowed the Americans to return. In February,
Iraq accepted a deal with Secretary-General Kofi Annan to open the
palaces, nullifying the need for airstrikes.
	   But the confrontation did succeed in drawing Annan into a
greater role in the inspection program. Annan's staff has been
pressuring the inspectors to finalize their work so sanctions can
be lifted.
	   If Iraq repeats that tactic near the October review, Clinton
must decide whether to send U.S. forces back to the gulf only weeks
before the mid-term presidential elections.
	   During the winter standoff, Washington won little support beyond
the British and few other allies. The Arabs strongly opposed using
force and warned that airstrikes would undermine U.S. interests
throughout the Arab world.
	   On Friday, Saddam's adviser, Lt. Gen. Amer al-Saadi, said Iraq
did not want to create a crisis over the inspections. But he also
warned that the inspectors may trigger one if they press the nerve
gas issue.
	   Butler and the Iraqis reached an agreement earlier this month on
an accelerated inspection program before the October review. But
the VX report has changed the equation.
	   It is the most damning evidence of Iraqi deception since the
1995 defection to Jordan of Saddam's son-in-law Lt. Gen. Hussein
Kamel al-Majid, who headed Iraq's secret weapons program.
	   Only then did Iraq admit developing biological weapons. Hussein
Kamel was killed after returning to Iraq.
	   Realizing the VX report's sensitivity, Butler chose not to
release it, hoping the Iraqis would own up if confronted with the
evidence discreetly. But the report was leaked to The Washington
Post, raising fears among U.N. officials that Iraq will be less
likely now to come clean.

	   Recalling his formal welcome Saturday morning in Tiananmen
Square, Clinton recited the long history of the huge plaza which
stands in Americans' minds as a symbol of China's crackdown on
democracy demonstrators in 1989.
	   ``There nine years ago Chinese citizens of all ages raised their
voices for democracy,'' Clinton said. ``For all of our agreements,
we still disagree about the meaning of what happened then,'' he
added. ``I believe and the American people believe the use of force
and the tragic loss of life was wrong.''
	   Yet Clinton made clear he wants to press ahead with closer ties
to the communist regime.

Second North Pole seal caught off Vietnam's central coast

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Maybe there's some kind of Club Med for
seals nearby.
	   For the second time in less than a month, a seal that was
believed to have come all the way from the North Pole has been
found in tropical waters off Vietnam's central coast, a Vietnamese
scientist said Saturday.
	   The second seal was transported to the institute on Thursday,
where both seals are being cared for, said Bui Hong Long, deputy
director of the Nha Trang Institute of Oceanology.
	   A reward of 3 million dong (dlrs 230) was paid to the fisherman
who captured it 10 days ago off the coast of Quang Binh province,
Long said.
	   He said it was the same size, 14 kilograms (31 pounds), as the
one caught by another fisherman off Quang Ngai province a month
ago. The first seal has grown to nearly 16 kilograms (35 pounds),
thanks to a rich diet of about two kilograms (three pounds) of fish
a day.
	   While seals are known to range as far south as the Sea of Japan,
about 3,200 kilometers (2,000 miles) north of here, the sea mammals
are not known to live in tropical oceans.
	   The institute, based in the central coastal province of Khanh
Hoa, is Vietnam's biggest oceanology study organization, with
branches in Hanoi and the northern port city of Haiphong.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ President Bill Clinton and Chinese President
Jiang Zemin agreed Saturday that they would no longer target
nuclear weapons at each other's country, a decision Jiang said
``demonstrates the United States and China are partners, not
adversaries.''
	   With the Chinese and American flags at their sides, the two
leaders spoke in the Western Hall of the Great Hall of the People
after several hours of summit talks.
	   Asked about Beijing's detention of pro-democracy dissidents in
Xian as Clinton's tour began, Jiang said Clinton raised the issue
in their talks. He said local authorities had taken measures to
handle activities that were ``detrimental'' to security. ``In China
we have our laws,'' he said.
	   Recalling his formal welcome Saturday morning in Tiananmen
Square, Clinton recited the long history of the huge plaza which
stands in Americans' minds as a symbol of China's crackdown on
democracy demonstrators in 1989.
	   ``There nine years ago Chinese citizens of all ages raised their
voices for democracy,'' Clinton said. ``For all of our agreements,
we still disagree about the meaning of what happened then,'' he
added. ``I believe and the American people believe the use of force
and the tragic loss of life was wrong.''
	   Even so, Clinton made clear he wants to press ahead with closer
ties to the communist regime.
	   ``Our friendship may never be perfect. No friendship is, but I
hope it will last forever,'' he said.
	   ``We must understand and respect the enormous challenges China
has faced in trying to move forward against great odds with a clear
memory of the setbacks suffered in past periods of instability.''
	   On trade, no breakthroughs were reached. China did not win U.S.
support for joining the World Trade Organization, but another round
of talks was scheduled for the week of July 20 in Geneva.
	   ``I regret we did not make more progress on this front. We must
recommit ourselves to achieving that goal on strong terms,''
Clinton said without elaborating.
	   In opening their joint appearance, Jiang announced the
detargeting agreement and said China will not be the first to use
nuclear weapons ``under any circumstances.'' Left unsaid was
China's push for the United States to make the same promise.
	   The presidents expressed satisfaction with the relationship
between China and the United States.
	   Said Jiang, ``We will make constant progress in the direction of
building a strategic partnership between China and the United
States'' as the nations move toward the 21st century.
	   He said, ``As China and the United States have different social
systems, ideologies, values and cultural traditions, we have some
difference of views on certain issues. However, they should not
become the obstacles in the way of the growth of China-U.S.
relations ... The development paths of the countries of the world
should be chosen by the peoples of the countries concerned.''
	   The Chinese leader said the issue of Taiwan is an important and
sensitive one and that the United States must stick to its policy
of recognizing only one legitimate Chinese government ``in the
interest of a smooth growth'' in U.S.-China relations.
	   Clinton reaffirmed the U.S. ``one China'' policy which opposes
independence for Taiwan, and he encouraged more direct talks
between Taipei and Beijing. In another important regional issue
Clinton said he and Jiang agreed to work to maintain stability on
the Korean Peninsula.
	   Clinton listed broad areas in which the United States and China
are working together, including the environment, health, judicial
matters, efforts to maintaining stability in global currency
markets, and technical cooperation in preventing the spread of
weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``We agreed to that we need to work together to avoid
destabilizing world currencies,'' he said.
	   ``Clearly a stable, open, prosperous China ... is good for
America,'' Clinton said.
	   Clinton said he pressed Jiang to start a dialogue with the Dalai
Lama ``in return for the recognition that Tibet is a part of China
and a recognition of the unique cultural and religious heritage of
that region.''
	   The detargeting agreement was forged over weeks of pre-summit
negotiations and formalized by Clinton and Jiang in their meeting.
	   China has 18 long-range missiles _ 13 of them currently aimed at
U.S. cities _ compared to the United States' 6,000 or so nuclear
warheads.
	   The detargeting agreement follows one between the United States
and Russia that was concluded in 1997. While Chinese missiles could
easily be retargeted in the event of hostilities, the agreement
would make less likely any sort of accidental launch toward the
United States.
	   Beijing had wanted, as a condition of detargeting, a U.S.
promise never to be the first to launch nuclear weapons _ a
concession that administration officials said in advance that
Clinton would not make.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ President Bill Clinton and Chinese President
Jiang Zemin agreed Saturday that they would no longer target
nuclear weapons at each other's country, a decision Jiang said
``demonstrates the United States and China are partners, not
adversaries.''
	   With the Chinese and American flags at their sides, the two
leaders spoke in the Western Hall of the Great Hall of the People
after several hours of summit talks.
	   Asked about Beijing's detention of pro-democracy dissidents in
Xian as Clinton's tour began, Jiang said local authorities had
taken measures to handle activities that were ``detrimental'' to
security. ``In China we have our laws,'' he said.
	   Clinton raised the issue with Jiang and said later there had
been progress in the release of Chinese dissidents but noted others
were still incarcerated. ``I believe we are making progress,'' he
said.
	   In blunt terms, Jiang denied year-old allegations that China may
have funneled financial contributions to Clinton's political
campaigns.
	   ``I really think it's very absurd and ridiculous and I think
they are sheer fabrications. China can never do such a thing and
China never interferes in other countries' internal affairs,'' he
said, adding that his government had conducted a ``very earnest
investigation'' which concluded that ``there was never such a
thing.''
	   Recalling his formal welcome Saturday morning in Tiananmen
Square, Clinton recited the long history of the huge plaza which
stands in Americans' minds as a symbol of China's crackdown on
democracy demonstrators in 1989.
	   ``There nine years ago Chinese citizens of all ages raised their

and the tragic loss of life was wrong.''
	   Even so, Clinton made clear he wants to press ahead with closer
ties to the communist regime. ``Our friendship may never be
perfect. No friendship is, but I hope it will last forever,'' he
said.
	   Jiang noted that Clinton had raised the matter of the 1989
Tiananmen crackdown, which he called ``political disturbances.'' He
recalled what he had said about this last fall during his U.S.
visit. ``I have stated our position that with regard to the
political disturbances in 1989, had the Chinese government not
taken the resolute measures, then we could not have enjoyed the
stablity that we are enjoying today.''
	   Clinton replied in a discourse that ``stability in the 21st
Century will require high levels of freedom.'' Acknowledging that
``any system can be abused,'' he said it is a mistake ``if you
limit people's freedom too much.''
	   ``We must understand and respect the enormous challenges China
has faced in trying to move forward against great odds with a clear
memory of the setbacks suffered in past periods of instability,''
he said.
	   On trade, China did not win U.S. support for joining the World
Trade Organization, but another round of talks was scheduled for
the week of July 20 in Geneva.
	   ``I regret we did not make more progress on this front. We must
recommit ourselves to achieving that goal on strong terms,''
Clinton said without elaborating.
	   In opening their joint appearance, Jiang announced the
detargeting agreement and said China will not be the first to use
nuclear weapons ``under any circumstances.'' Clinton fended off
Jiang's efforts for the United States to make the same promise.
``We have not changed our position,'' Clinton said, ``nor are we
prepared to do so.''
	   The presidents expressed satisfaction with the relationship
between China and the United States.
	   ``We will make constant progress in the direction of building a
strategic partnership between China and the United States'' as the
nations move toward the 21st century,'' Jiang said ...
	   ``As China and the United States have different social systems,

	   Clinton said he pressed Jiang to start a dialogue with the Dalai
Lama ``in return for the recognition that Tibet is a part of China
and a recognition of the unique cultural and religious heritage of
that region.'' Jiang came back to the subject later and said the
``demise of the theocracy in Tibet came much later than the demise
of theocracy in Europe before the Renaissance.'' He said the
current control of Tibet had enhanced conditions there and that the
Chinese had funded renovation of religious facilities.
	   The detargeting agreement was forged over weeks of pre-summit
negotiations and formalized by Clinton and Jiang in their meeting.
	   China has 18 long-range missiles _ 13 of them currently aimed at
U.S. cities _ compared to the United States' 6,000 or so nuclear

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ All it took for the New York Yankees to get on

	   Paul O'Neill hit a three-run homer in the seventh inning on
reliever Mel Rojas' first pitch and the Yankees beat the Mets 8-4
on Friday night in the opener of the series.
	   O'Neill's home run put the Yankees ahead 6-4 and sent them to

U.S., China agree not to target each other with nuclear missiles AP Special Correspondent

Eds: New material on Tibet. Joint appearance just ended.
With BC-Clinton-China
By WALTER MEARS
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ President Bill Clinton and Chinese President
Jiang Zemin agreed Saturday that they would no longer target
nuclear weapons at each other's country, a decision Jiang said
``demonstrates the United States and China are partners, not
adversaries.''
	   With the Chinese and American flags at their sides, the two
leaders spoke in the Western Hall of the Great Hall of the People
after several hours of summit talks. The session lasted more than
an hour and included a frank exchange of differing views over
Tibet, human rights and the repression of 1989 in and around
Tiananman Square.
	   Asked about Beijing's detention of pro-democracy dissidents in
Xian as Clinton's tour began, Jiang said local authorities had
taken measures to handle activities that were ``detrimental'' to
security. ``In China we have our laws,'' he said.
	   Clinton raised the issue with Jiang and said later there had
been progress in the release of Chinese dissidents but noted others
were still incarcerated. ``I believe we are making progress,'' he
said.
	   In blunt terms, Jiang denied year-old allegations that China may
have funneled financial contributions to Clinton's political
campaigns.
	   ``I really think it's very absurd and ridiculous and I think
they are sheer fabrications. China can never do such a thing and
China never interferes in other countries' internal affairs,'' he
said, adding that his government had conducted a ``very earnest
investigation'' which concluded that ``there was never such a
thing.''
	   Recalling his formal welcome Saturday morning in Tiananmen
Square, Clinton recited the long history of the huge plaza which
stands in Americans' minds as a symbol of China's crackdown on
democracy demonstrators in 1989.
	   ``There nine years ago Chinese citizens of all ages raised their
voices for democracy,'' Clinton said. ``For all of our agreements,
we still disagree about the meaning of what happened then,'' he
added. ``I believe and the American people believe the use of force
and the tragic loss of life was wrong.''
	   Even so, Clinton made clear he wants to press ahead with closer
ties to the communist regime. ``Our friendship may never be
perfect. No friendship is, but I hope it will last forever,'' he
said.
	   Jiang noted that Clinton had raised the matter of the 1989
Tiananmen crackdown, which he called ``political disturbances.'' He
recalled what he had said about this last fall during his U.S.
visit. ``I have stated our position that with regard to the
political disturbances in 1989, had the Chinese government not
taken the resolute measures, then we could not have enjoyed the
stablity that we are enjoying today.''
	   Clinton replied in a discourse that ``stability in the 21st
Century will require high levels of freedom.'' Acknowledging that
``any system can be abused,'' he said it is a mistake ``if you
limit people's freedom too much.''
	   ``We must understand and respect the enormous challenges China
has faced in trying to move forward against great odds with a clear
memory of the setbacks suffered in past periods of instability,''
he said.
	   On trade, China did not win U.S. support for joining the World
Trade Organization, but another round of talks was scheduled for
the week of July 20 in Geneva.
	   ``I regret we did not make more progress on this front. We must
recommit ourselves to achieving that goal on strong terms,''
Clinton said without elaborating.
	   In opening their joint appearance, Jiang announced the
detargeting agreement and said China will not be the first to use
nuclear weapons ``under any circumstances.'' Clinton fended off
Jiang's efforts for the United States to make the same promise.
``We have not changed our position,'' Clinton said, ``nor are we
prepared to do so.''
	   The presidents expressed satisfaction with the relationship
between China and the United States.
	   ``We will make constant progress in the direction of building a
strategic partnership between China and the United States'' as the
nations move toward the 21st century,'' Jiang said ...
	   ``As China and the United States have different social systems,
ideologies, values and cultural traditions, we have some difference
of views on certain issues. However, they should not become the
obstacles in the way of the growth of China-U.S. relations ... The
development paths of the countries of the world should be chosen by
the peoples of the countries concerned.''
	   The Chinese leader said the issue of Taiwan is an important and
sensitive one and that the United States must stick to its policy
of recognizing only one legitimate Chinese government ``in the
interest of a smooth growth'' in U.S.-China relations.
	   Clinton reaffirmed the U.S. ``one China'' policy which opposes
independence for Taiwan, and he encouraged more direct talks
between Taipei and Beijing. In another important regional issue
Clinton said he and Jiang agreed to work to maintain stability on
the Korean Peninsula.
	   Clinton listed broad areas in which the United States and China
are working together, including the environment, health, judicial
matters, efforts to maintaining stability in global currency
markets, and technical cooperation in preventing the spread of
weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``We agreed to that we need to work together to avoid
destabilizing world currencies,'' he said.
	   ``Clearly a stable, open, prosperous China ... is good for
America,'' Clinton said.
	   Clinton said he pressed Jiang to start a dialogue with the Dalai
Lama ``in return for the recognition that Tibet is a part of China
and a recognition of the unique cultural and religious heritage of
that region.'' Jiang came back to the subject later and said the
``demise of the theocracy in Tibet came much later than the demise
of theocracy in Europe before the Renaissance.'' He said the
current control of Tibet had enhanced conditions there and that the
Chinese had funded renovation of religious facilities.
	   The detargeting agreement was forged over weeks of pre-summit
negotiations and formalized by Clinton and Jiang in their meeting.
	   China has 18 long-range missiles _ 13 of them currently aimed at
U.S. cities _ compared to the United States' 6,000 or so nuclear
warheads.
	   The detargeting agreement follows one between the United States
and Russia that was concluded in 1997. While Chinese missiles could
easily be retargeted in the event of hostilities, the agreement
would make less likely any sort of accidental launch toward the
United States.

Indonesian president invites foreign investors to come back: reports 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's president has called on
foreign investors to return to his crisis-stricken country, saying
calm had been restored after bloody riots last month, news reports
said Saturday.
	   The official Antara news agency quoted President B.J. Habibie as
saying there was no more reason for foreigners to worry.
	   Violence broke out in the capital Jakarta in May after weeks of
protests. As many as 1,200 people died in the civil unrest that
helped force former President Suharto to end 32 years of autocratic
rule.
	   Habibie, who replaced Suharto, is now trying to repair the
country's battered economy, which is mired in the worst crisis in
30 years.
	   Several foreign companies suspended or closed down operations
because of the turmoil, and thousands of foreign nationals were
evacuated.
	   Many fear violence could flare again if soaring inflation and
mass unemployment are not brought under control.
	   Habibie downplayed the possibility of more trouble after he
visited the city of Malang on the eastern end of the main island of
Java on Friday.
	   ``Economic activity in Indonesia has returned to normal,'' he
was quoted as saying by Angkatan Bersenjata, a daily newspaper
published by the politically important armed forces.
	   ``The situation right now should not be compared of that of the
May 14 and 15,'' he said in reference to the two worst days of
rioting.
	   In a sign that things may be returning to normal, Indonesia and
the International Monetary Fund signed a new agreement Wednesday to
restart a dlrs 43 billion economic rescue plan.
	   Three other accords between Indonesia and the IMF stalled during
Suharto's final months after the former president failed to satisfy
demands for sweeping economic reform.
	   Habibie, Suharto's former deputy, has pledged full cooperation
with the IMF and says he's ready to move ahead with economic
reform.
	   He has also pledged to bring in big political changes,
culminating in elections next year.

	   Even without being asked, Jiang addressed allegations that the
Chinese government tried to influence American policy with illegal
campaign contributions.
	   ``I really think it's very absurd and ridiculous and I think
they are sheer fabrications,'' Jiang said. ``China can never do
such a thing.''
	   Both leaders stressed the importance of strengthening ties.
Pointing to their agreement not to target missiles at each other's
country, Jiang declared, ``this demonstrates the United States and
China are partners, not adversaries.''
	   Jiang dismissed charges that China had cracked down on
dissidents as Clinton arrived. He said that ``any lawbreaking
activity must be dealt with according to law.''
	   Clinton said: ``There are legitimate and honest differences in
the way we look at this. But I believe we are making progress and I
believe we will make more.''
	   At the welcoming ceremony that featured a 21-gun salute, Clinton
and Jiang under a hazy sun had walked side by side to review an
honor guard of the People's Liberation Army at the edge of the
historic Tiananmen Square. The two leaders appeared at ease,
chatting and smiling as troops marched by.

<TEXT>
	   SEPANG, Malaysia (AP) _ Awash in glittering klieg lights and
regal ceremony, Malaysia on Saturday unveiled its sleek new
airport, designed to put the Southeast Asian nation on the
international map in the new millennium.
	   In place of squirrels scampering beneath shady rows of oil palms
in the Golden Hope plantation, wide-bodied jets will begin howling
across the sky on Tuesday.
	   Malaysia's King Tuanku Ja'afar was to officially open Kuala
Lumpur International Airport Saturday night, bringing to reality
the lofty vision of the region's champion of superlatives, Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   ``It is good for the ego,'' Mahahtir told the Far Eastern
Economic Review when asked why his still-developing nation needed
such a massive airport. ``It is important because small people
always like to appear tall. If you can't get tall enough you put a
box under you.''
	   That box beneath Malaysia is colossal.
	   Once all three phases are developed, the airport's backyard will
include hiking trails for jet-lagged travelers, golf courses, a
shopping center, hotels and a track to host the 1999 Formula One
motorbike championship.
	   With a rambling roof resembling white Bedouin tents, the
five-level KLIA boasts the world's tallest air-traffic control
tower, biggest passenger lounge and capacity for 25 million people.
	   Airport authorities claim the 10.5 billion ringgit (dlrs 2.5
billion) airport is the world's largest, spread over 10,000
hectares (24,700 acres) of rain forest.
	   The superlatives could also bring super-duper headaches.
	   To accommodate millions more passengers and the faster jets
which require longer runways, the KLIA has been pushed 70
kilometers (42 miles) south of downtown Kuala Lumpur.
	   That's too far for some travelers, who liked the old airport
only 30 kilometers (18 miles) outside the city.
	   ``From now on, I'm driving,'' declared Cheryl Ng, a lawyer who
regularly jets to Singapore, 380 kilometers (225 miles) south of
Kuala Lumpur, for weekend shopping trips.
	   ``It's so troublesome and expensive getting to Sepang, and I
barely save one extra hour if I fly.''
	   For the past week, harried government officials have been
huddling to come up with a cheaper fare structure.
	   Outlet operators who want to hawk their array of chocolates,
silk and luggage are having second thoughts, complaining that rents
are too high.
	   Malaysia Airlines, the country's national carrier, has also
warned that it could be forced to hike its fares by as much as 80
percent to offset higher operating costs.
	   ``Some major airlines fly to the U.S. only from Singapore, so
it'll be an extra hassle for our customers'' said a travel agent.
``Our clients can complain all they want, but like it or not, they
still have to use it.''
	   It will be several years before KLIA determines whether it can
lure the major Western carriers from the Singapore hub.
	   Meanwhile, glitches in the central computing system _ the first
in the world to link all airport functions _ could ground
operations to a halt.
	   Earlier this month, more than 3,000 volunteers found themselves
pacing the KLIA passenger lounge for hours after the airport's 600
million ringgit (dlrs 154 million) computer system crashed during a
trial run.
	   Aviation experts point out similarities between the ultramodern
KLIA with the dlrs 5 billion Denver International Airport in
Colorado.
	   In 1995, the similar automated baggage system drew international
derision for chewing up and spitting out bags in trial runs. Just
last week, Denver had to shuttle thousands of passengers to and
from concourses on 30 buses after the computerized train system
failed.
	   The KLIA dual-caboose ``AutoTrain,'' which can carry as many as
3,000 passengers an hour, is also computer-driven.
	   The economic slump sweeping across Asian skies has also curbed
Asian wanderlust; tourism in the region dropped by 13 percent last
year.
	   Nevertheless, KLIA supporters say Mahathir's push to finish the
airport was opportune. Malaysia saved money, they said, by getting
the KLIA infrastructure into place before the ringgit lost nearly
40 percent of its value.
	   The boom times will eventually return, KLIA proponents say. A
recent report by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said the
number of passengers traveling between the United States and Asia
could well double by 2009.
	   No one can deny that KLIA, designed by renowned Japanese
architect Kisho Kurokawa, is spectacular. And it opens just as tens
of thousands of visitors prepare to descend on Kuala Lumpur for the
Commonwealth Games in September.
	   More than a million exotic trees and shrubs have been planted in
and around the main terminal. The concourse for connecting
international flights is awash in natural light streaming through
windows that stretch from floor to ceiling. By night, starlight
casts shadows across the granite floors.

U.S., China agree not to target each other with nuclear missiles AP Special Correspondent

With BC-Clinton-China  &HT;    
By WALTER MEARS
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ President Bill Clinton and Chinese President
Jiang Zemin agreed Saturday that they would no longer target
nuclear weapons at each other's country.''
	   Our friendship may never be perfect ... but I hope it will last
forever,'' said Clinton after a day of superpower summitry.
	   With the Chinese and American flags at their sides, the two
leaders spoke in the Western Hall of the Great Hall of the People
after several hours of summit talks. The session before reporters _
broadcast live on television in China and the United States _
lasted more than an hour.
	   It included a spirited exchange of differing views over Tibet,
human rights and the 1989 crackdown on democracy demonstrators in
and around Tiananman Square.
	   Near the end, Jiang said he welcomed the ``very friendly''
discussions and abandoning his interpreter he added in English,
``This is democracy.''
	   Asked about Beijing's detention of pro-democracy dissidents in
Xi'an as Clinton's tour began, Jiang said local authorities had
taken measures to handle activities that were ``detrimental'' to
security. ``In China we have our laws,'' he said.
	   Clinton raised the issue with Jiang and said later there had
been progress in the release of Chinese dissidents but noted others
were still incarcerated. ``I believe we are making progress,'' he
said.
	   In blunt terms, Jiang denied year-old allegations that China may
have funneled financial contributions to Clinton's political
campaigns.
	   ``I really think it's very absurd and ridiculous and I think
they are sheer fabrications. China can never do such a thing and
China never interferes in other countries' internal affairs,'' he
said, adding that his government had conducted a ``very earnest
investigation'' which concluded that ``there was never such a
thing.''
	   Recalling his formal welcome Saturday morning in Tiananmen
Square, Clinton recited the long history of the huge plaza which
stands in Americans' minds as a symbol of China's repression of a
popular pro-democracy uprising in 1989.
	   ``There nine years ago Chinese citizens of all ages raised their
voices for democracy,'' Clinton said. ``For all of our agreements,
we still disagree about the meaning of what happened then,'' he
added. ``I believe and the American people believe the use of force
and the tragic loss of life was wrong.''
	   Even so, Clinton made clear he wants to press ahead with closer
ties to the communist regime. ``Our friendship may never be
perfect. No friendship is, but I hope it will last forever,'' he
said.
	   Jiang noted that Clinton had raised the matter of the Tiananmen
crackdown, which he called ``political disturbances.'' He recalled
what he had said about this last fall during his U.S. visit. ``I
have stated our position that with regard to the political
disturbances in 1989, had the Chinese government not taken the
resolute measures, then we could not have enjoyed the stability
that we are enjoying today.''
	   Clinton replied in a discourse that ``stability in the 21st
Century will require high levels of freedom.'' Acknowledging that
``any system can be abused,'' he said it is a mistake ``if you
limit people's freedom too much.''
	   ``We must understand and respect the enormous challenges China
has faced in trying to move forward against great odds with a clear
memory of the setbacks suffered in past periods of instability,''
he said.
	   On trade, China did not win U.S. support for joining the World
Trade Organization, but another round of talks was scheduled for
the week of July 20 in Geneva.
	   ``I regret we did not make more progress on this front. We must
recommit ourselves to achieving that goal on strong terms,''
Clinton said without elaborating.
	   Clinton said they agreed on the ned ``to work together to avoid
another round of destabilizing currency devaluations in the
region.''
	   In opening their joint appearance, Jiang announced the
detargeting agreement and said it ``demonstrates the United States
and China are partners, not adversaries.'' He said China will not
be the first to use nuclear weapons ``under any circumstances,''
but did not win a reciprocal declaration from Clinton. ``We have
not changed our position,'' Clinton said, ``nor are we prepared to
do so.''
	   The presidents expressed satisfaction with the relationship
between China and the United States.
	   ``We will make constant progress in the direction of building a
strategic partnership between China and the United States'' as the
nations move toward the 21st century,'' Jiang said ...
	   ``As China and the United States have different social systems,
ideologies, values and cultural traditions, we have some difference
of views on certain issues. However, they should not become the
obstacles in the way of the growth of China-U.S. relations ... The
development paths of the countries of the world should be chosen by
the peoples of the countries concerned.''
	   The Chinese leader said the issue of Taiwan is an important and
sensitive one and that the United States must stick to its policy
of recognizing only one legitimate Chinese government ``in the
interest of a smooth growth'' in U.S.-China relations.
	   Clinton reaffirmed the U.S. ``one China'' policy which opposes
independence for Taiwan, and he encouraged more direct talks
between Taipei and Beijing. In another important regional issue
Clinton said he and Jiang agreed to work to maintain stability on
the Korean Peninsula.
	   Clinton listed broad areas in which the United States and China
are working together, including the environment, health, judicial
matters, efforts to maintaining stability in global currency
markets, and technical cooperation in preventing the spread of
weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``We agreed to that we need to work together to avoid
destabilizing world currencies,'' he said.
	   ``Clearly a stable, open, prosperous China ... is good for
America,'' Clinton said.
	   Clinton said he pressed Jiang to start a dialogue with the Dalai
Lama ``in return for the recognition that Tibet is a part of China
and a recognition of the unique cultural and religious heritage of
that region.'' Jiang came back to the subject later and said the
``demise of the theocracy in Tibet came much later than the demise
of theocracy in Europe before the Renaissance.'' He said Chinese
control had enhanced conditions in Tibet.
	   Jiang said that as long as the Dalai Lama was willing to
acknowledge that Tibet and the island of Taiwan are both part of
China, then ``the door to dialogue and negotiation is open.''
	   The detargeting agreement was forged over weeks of pre-summit
negotiations and formalized by Clinton and Jiang in their meeting.
	   China has 18 long-range missiles _ 13 of them currently aimed at
U.S. cities _ compared to the United States' 6,000 or so nuclear
warheads.
	   The detargeting agreement follows one between the United States
and Russia that was concluded in 1997. While Chinese missiles could
easily be retargeted in the event of hostilities, the agreement
would make less likely any sort of accidental launch toward the
United States.

With BC-Malaysia-Airport's Takeoff
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ As officials trumpet the high tech
glories of Malaysia's monumental new international airport,
ordinary folks are grousing over how much time and money it will
take just to get there.
	   Fares to the Kuala Lumpur International Airport, about 70
kilometers (42 miles) south of the capital, are set to cost from 55
ringgit to 88 ringgit (dlrs 14 to dlrs 22.50) by taxi or limousine.
A bus will cost 6.50 ringgit (dlrs 1.60), but it could take two
hours to get to KLIA.
	   ``For me, I'll just take a train or a bus,'' to travel
domestically, said Wan Enderi. A doorman at a local hotel, Wan said
the average worker in the capital can't foot the taxi bill to KLIA.
	   ``I don't want to spend all that time and money just to get to
the airport,'' said Wan. ``You've seen our recession, 60 ringgit is
just unbearable.''
	   ``My customers, some call me and ask me about the price and how
long it will take and they say, `Oh that's too high and oh that's
too far,''' said Tony Yeow, a private taxi driver who will charge
70 ringgit (dlrs 18) for the airport trip in his luxury sedan.
``Still, I've got five bookings for the new airport already.''
	   Their only other choice, Yeow said, is to take a bus. But a
trial run by buses last week showed it took two hours and 40
minutes to reach the state-of-the-art airport.
	   Recession has grounded for several years the futuristic train
link which will shuttle passengers from downtown into the airport
lobby in 20 minutes.
	   The government admitted earlier in the week that it had received
many complaints from commuters and it would revisit the fares after
the first flights take off Tuesday.
	   ``We will look into ways to reduce the cost of public
transportation and at the same time ease the burden of the
commuters,'' said Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.

Chinese welcome Clinton at Tiananmen; agreements reached AP White House Correspondent

EDs: Combines pvs, edits to tighten
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ After a Tiananmen Square welcoming heavy with
symbolism, President Bill Clinton chided China about its human
rights record Saturday but said Beijing and Washington must
cooperate despite differences. President Jiang Zemin declared the
two nations were ``partners, not adversaries.''
	   ``Our friendship may never be perfect,'' Clinton said. ``No
friendship is. But I hope it will last forever.''
	   After a morning of talks, the two leaders announced an agreement
not to aim nuclear-tipped missiles at one another's nation. It was
a largely symbolic accord, since the missiles could be retargeted
in minutes.
	   They met in the Maoist-era Great Hall of the People after a
welcoming ceremony in Tiananmen Square, the sprawling plaza haunted
with memories of China's bloody crackdown against freedom nine
years ago.
	   For nearly an hour, Clinton and Jiang engaged in a friendly
debate in a news conference touching on differences on everything
from human rights and Tibet to the first use of nuclear weapons.
	   Directly addressing China's squelching of demonstrators at
Tiananmen in 1989, Clinton said, ``For all of our agreements, we
still disagree about the meaning of what happened then.''
	   ``The use of force and the tragic loss of life was wrong,'' he
said.
	   Jiang offered the same explanation he has given in the past for
the crackdown: ``Had the Chinese government not taken the resolute
measures, we would not have enjoyed the stability that we are
enjoying today.''
	   Earlier, Clinton walked side by side with Jiang to review an
honor guard of the People's Liberation Army at Tiananmen Square.
More than 30 advocacy groups in the United States, as well as the
House of Representatives, had urged Clinton not to go to Tiananmen
because of its symbolism of China's repression.
	   Clinton said it was vital to look beyond the past. ``It is
important that whatever our disagreements over past actions, China
and the United States must go forward on the right side of history
for the future sake of the world. The forces of history have
brought us to a new age of human possibility. But our dreams can
only be recognized by nations whose citizens are both responsible
and free.''
	   Even without being asked, Jiang addressed allegations that the
Chinese government tried to influence American policy with illegal
campaign contributions.
	   ``I really think it's very absurd and ridiculous and I think
they are sheer fabrications,'' Jiang said. ``China can never do
such a thing.''
	   Both leaders stressed the importance of strengthening ties.
Pointing to their agreement not to target missiles at each other's
country, Jiang declared, ``This demonstrates the United States and
China are partners, not adversaries.''
	   Jiang dismissed charges that China had cracked down on
dissidents as Clinton arrived. He said that ``any lawbreaking
activity must be dealt with according to law.''
	   Clinton said: ``There are legitimate and honest differences in
the way we look at this. But I believe we are making progress and I
believe we will make more.''
	   At the welcoming ceremony that featured a 21-gun salute, Clinton
and Jiang under a hazy sun had walked side by side to review an
honor guard of the People's Liberation Army at the edge of the
historic Tiananmen Square. The two leaders appeared at ease,
chatting and smiling as troops marched by.
	   It was a sweltering morning and the normally busy square was
cleared for the ceremony.
	   Thousands of Chinese massed on the northern edge of the square
to see Clinton being formally greeted by Jiang. The crowds would
have been larger _ even though their view was blocked by trees _
but police maintained an intimidating presence, sealing off streets
and sidewalks leading to the square an hour before Clinton's
arrival.
	   In their appearance, televised live in China, the two leaders
announced a series of modest agreements.
	   China will move toward imposing stiffer export controls on
missile technology to third-world nations with nuclear ambitions.
With a nuclear arms race under way in South Asia, the two leaders
called anew on India and Pakistan to stop all nuclear tests. China
also said it would expand the export control list of chemicals that
could be used for weapons purposes.
	   In a sensitive area, China agreed to permit inspections of high
tech American exports, such as supercomputers, to insure they are
used for intended purposes.
	   To Americans, Tiananmen Square is a reminder of the military's
1989 killings of hundreds _ if not thousands _ of democracy
advocates. But to China, it is the country's spiritual and
political heart, where Mao Tse-tung declared victory in the
communist revolution of October 1949.
	   Clinton's arrival marked the final step in a gradual process of
ending America's post-Tiananmen diplomatic isolation of China. It
was a personal victory for Jiang, who made it a priority to arrest
the downward spiral in U.S.-Chinese relations and bolstered his
diplomatic stature in the process.
	   But the occasion was marred by China's arrest of several
dissidents, acts that clearly upset the White House.
	   While criticizing China on human rights, Clinton did not go
nearly as far as his national security adviser, Sandy Berger. At a
briefing Friday, Berger declared that, ``China's human rights
record is terrible. I think China is an authoritarian nation.''

Highlights of Clinton, Jiang statements With Clinton-China 
</HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	   Highlights of the news conference Saturday by President Clinton
and Chinese President Jiang Zemin:
	   _Detargeting nuclear missiles: ``This demonstrates to the entire
world that China and the United States are partners, not
adversaries,'' Jiang said. Clinton said the agreement would enhance
global stability and prevent accidental launches.
	   _The 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown: ``For all of our
agreements, we still disagree about the meaning of what happened
then,'' Clinton said. ``I believe and the American people believe
the use of force and the tragic loss of life was wrong.'' Jiang
countered: ``Had the Chinese government not taken the resolute
measures, then we could not have enjoyed the stability that we are
enjoying today.''
	   _On fresh dissident arrests since Clinton's arrival: Jiang said
local officials had taken steps to handle activities that were
``detrimental'' to security. ``In China we have our laws,'' he
said. Clinton acknowledged progress in the release of Chinese
dissidents but noted that others were still incarcerated.
	   _The Dalai Lama: Clinton pressed Jiang to start a dialogue with
the Dalai Lama ``in return for the recognition that Tibet is a part
of China and a recognition of the unique cultural and religious
heritage of that region.'' Jiang said Chinese control had enhanced
conditions in Tibet and, as long as the Dalai Lama was willing to
acknowledge that Tibet and the island of Taiwan are both part of
China, then ``the door to dialogue and negotiation is open.''
	   _Allegations of China funneling illegal donations to Democrats
in the 1996 campaign: Jiang said his government conducted a ``very
earnest investigation'' and concluded ``there was never such a
thing.'' He called the allegations ``very absurd ... sheer
fabrications.''
	   _Taiwan: Clinton reaffirmed U.S. policy of opposing independence
for Taiwan, and Jiang said the United States must stick to that
policy ``in the interest of a smooth growth'' in U.S.-China
relations.

Clinton praises China for resisting pressures to devalue its currency LAURA MYERS 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Clinton-China
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ President Bill Clinton on Saturday praised the
Chinese government's ``great statesmanship'' in helping to avert
renewed turmoil in Asian currency markets and said Washington and
Beijing are committed to working together to boost the world
economy.
	   ``We agreed that we need to work together to avoid another round
of destabilizing currency devaluations in the region and to restore
economic growth,'' Clinton said in an opening statement at a news
conference with President Jiang Zemin at the Great Hall of the
People.
	   Government officials and analysts have been concerned that a
devaluation of the Chinese currency, the yuan, could force other
Asian nations to follow suit and deepen the financial crisis that
has battered the region for the past year.
	   The two leaders also discussed China's efforts to gain
membership in the World Trade Organization, which sets the rules
for global trade. ``I regret we did not make more progress on this
front,'' Clinton said, ``and we must recommit ourselves to
achieving that goal on strong terms.''
	   Senior trade officials from both governments had worked hard in
recent weeks to resolve the matter of WTO membership for China, but
the United States still insists that China make more progress first
in opening its markets for manufacturing, agricultural products and
services.
	   The Clinton administration's tough stance over the issue of WTO
membership is driven in part by the fact that America's trade
deficit with China is soaring. It jumped 26 percent to a record
dlrs 49.7 billion last year, and many experts believe it could
surpass the deficit with Japan this year.
	   A round of lower-level talks on the trade issue is scheduled for
the week of July 20 in Geneva.
	   In Clinton's joint appearance with Jiang, after lengthy talks in
the Great Hall, the first question from assembled reporters was how
the Chinese and American governments intended to cooperate in
ensuring stability in currency markets and the world economy.
	   ``I think that China has shown great statesmanship and strength
in making a strong contribution to the stability not only of the
Chinese people and their economy but the entire region by
maintaining the value of its currency,'' Clinton said.
	   He said he and Jiang agreed that the United States and China
would do ``whatever we can'' to restore confidence in the Japanese
economy. Weakness in Japan's economy and a slide in the value of
its currency is considered vital to the region's economic health.
	   ``The key here, I believe, is for the plans to reform the
financial institutions in Japan and take other steps that will get
growth going and get investments going in Japan to be made,''
Clinton said.
	   ``I think that ultimately President Jiang and I would give
anything to be able to just wave a wand and have all of this go
away,'' he added. ``We are not the only actors in this drama, and a
lot of this must be done by the Japanese government and the
Japanese people. We can be supportive, but they have to make the
right decisions.''
	   Jiang did not comment on the matter. In a joint written
statement, the two leaders pledged to continue discussing Asian
economic and financial matters in coming months, and they said the
United States welcomed China's commitment to maintaining the
stability of its currency.

Four with suspected links to World Trade Center bombing arrested in Thailand 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with officials confirming arrests, other details
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai authorities said Saturday they
were holding four Pakistanis suspected of being members of an
extremist group involved in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade
Center building in New York.
	   Immigration Police arrested the four Friday in Bangkok in a raid
staged with agents of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation.
	   ``They will be charged with overstaying their visa. That's
pretty much all we can do with them. The rest would be pretty much
up to the U.S. authorities,'' said an officer of the Immigration
Police Investigation Unit who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   According to sources quoted by the English-language newspaper
The Nation, the four were suspected of planning to assassinate U.S.
Ambassador William Itoh and launch a terrorist strike against the
embassy here.
	   But the police official said at present there was only evidence
that the four had broken the Thai immigration law.
	   A U.S. embassy spokesman could not be reached for comment.
	   The Nation quoted senior Thai officials as saying swift
extradition of the four to the United States was possible.
	   The World Trade Center bombing killed six people and injured
more than 1,000. Six men were convicted in the United States
between 1994 and 1997 in connection with the attack and sentenced
to life imprisonment.
	   Last November, a New York court convicted Ramzi Yousef of
Pakistan on murder and conspiracy charges. He was described as one
of the masterminds of the bombing at the twin 110-story buildings
in Manhattan.
	   The Nation said the four men _ Mohamad Rahim, 30, Hadja Pahu
Sasa, 25, Hara Haj Husem, 26, and Hareef Husen, 25 _ are being
jointly questioned by Thai and U.S. investigators.

All Blacks win second test

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ All Black winger Jeff Wilson scored
two tries as an uninspiring New Zealand overcame an improved
England 40-10 in the second rugby test at Eden Park on Saturday.
	   England put up its most committed performance of a dismal,
winless, five-match tour and was behind 14-7 at halftime and 14-10
before an All Blacks surge in the last 24 minutes.
	   ``Obviously things didn't go right today,'' said All Blacks
captain Taine Randell. ``It was not a pretty performance but we got
there in the end.''
	   New Zealand faces Australia and South Africa in the coming
tri-nations series and appears vulnerable.
	   With record-breaking captain Sean Fitzpatrick _ who received a
special tribute Saturday _ and Zinzan Brooke gone this season, the
two southern hemisphere rivals have a good chance of ending the All
Blacks' supremacy.
	   For England, a 30-point loss was a victory of sorts on a
forgettable tour.
	   ``The pack was so committed, they never once shirked their
responsibilities and were hitting the All Blacks from all angles,''
said tough England captain Matt Dawson. ``I can honestly say that
is as good a forward performance I have ever played behind and I
feel disappointed for them that it didn't finish a lot closer than
40-10.''
	   Wilson and center Mark Mayerhofler scored ominous early tries
before Dawson crossed for a superb solo effort to narrow the
margin.
	   England's tackling was much improved from the record 76-0 and
64-22 losses to Australia and New Zealand respectively in the
previous two tests on tour.
	   But the early signs looked bleak when Wilson brushed aside
opposite number Austin Healey _ who was injured in the process _ to
touch down in the fifth minute and Andrew Mehrtens converted.
	   England, without a recognized goalkicker, saw Dawson and
fullback Matt Perry miss penalty chances before Mayerhofler
squeezed over after Randell had set up a powerful attacking
platform.
	   England could have folded at that stage, but scrum-half Dawson
led by example, cutting inside Mehrtens and Christian Cullen to
score a try which he also converted.
	   Dawson cut the gap to 14-10 with a penalty 10 minutes after the
restart before Wilson crossed for his second try after 56 minutes.
	   He regathered a chip kick from replacement back Carlos Spencer,
who added the conversion.
	   The All Blacks moved out of danger on 63 minutes when Joeli
Viridi scored his first test try, finishing off a slick backline
move. Spencer's second conversion took the hosts to a 28-10 lead.
	   Three minutes later Isitola Maka scored a try on debut after
Cullen kicked through and Randell rounded off the scoring, and a
man-of-the-match performance with a try in the final minutes,
giving Spencer a third conversion.
	   England lost wingers Healey and Tom Beim to shoulder injuries
and team manager Roger Uttley said they were in doubt for a test
against South Africa in Cape Town on Saturday.
	   Scorers:
	   New Zealand 40 (Jeff Wilson 2, Mark Mayerhofler, Joeli Viridi,
Isitola Maka, Taine Randell tries; Andrew Mehrtens 2 goals, Carlos
Spencer 3 goals) def. England 10 (Matt Dawson try, Dawson 1 goal, 1
penalty goal). (tjh)

	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ France scored 24 unanswered points in the
second half to claim a 34-9 victory over Fiji in their rugby union
test Saturday.
	   The tourists were ahead 10-9 at half-time and finished with four
tries to none against a team which upset Scotland earlier this
month.
	   Thomas Lievremont, Philippe Bernat-Salles, Arthur Gomes and
David Autagne scored tries. Thomas Castaignede kicked four
conversions and two penalties while Fiji's points came from three
penalties by Nicky Little.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai authorities said Saturday they
were holding four Pakistanis suspected of being members of an
extremist group involved in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade
Center building in New York.
	   According to Thai sources quoted by The Nation newspaper, the
four were suspected of planning to assassinate U.S. Ambassador
William Itoh and launch a terrorist strike against the embassy
here.
	   But a U.S. Embassy spokesman said it did not appear any
Americans or American interests in Thailand had been targeted.
	   ``Thus far there is no evidence of any threat to the U.S.
ambassador in Thailand. Thus far we cannot find any connection with
the World Trade Center bombing,'' the spokesman said.
	   He confirmed that American authorities were cooperating with
Thai police in the investigation, which a reliable diplomatic
source said was focusing on suspected terrorist activities but not
necessarily related to the World Trade Center or Americans in
Thailand.
	   The four were being held in Immigration Police prison after
their arrests Friday in Bangkok in a raid staged by Thai
Immigration Police and agents of the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation.
	   ``They will be charged with overstaying their visa. That's

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ As officials trumpet the glories
of Malaysia's new international airport, ordinary folks are
grousing over the time and money to get there.
	   Fares to the Kuala Lumpur International Airport, about 70
kilometers (42 miles) south of the capital, are set to cost from 55
ringgit to 88 ringgit (dlrs 14 to dlrs 22.50) by taxi or limousine.
A bus will cost 6.50 ringgit (dlrs 1.60), but it could take two
hours to get to KLIA.
	   ``For me, I'll just take a train or a bus,'' to travel
domestically, said Wan Enderi. A doorman at a local hotel, Wan said
the average worker in the capital can't foot the taxi bill to KLIA.
	   ``I don't want to spend all that time and money just to get to
the airport,'' said Wan. ``You've seen our recession, 60 ringgit is
just unbearable.''
	   ``My customers, some call me and ask me about the price and how
long it will take and they say, `Oh that's too high and oh that's
too far,''' said Tony Yeow, a private taxi driver who will charge
70 ringgit (dlrs 18) for the airport trip in his luxury sedan.
``Still, I've got five bookings for the new airport already.''
	   Their only other choice, Yeow said, is to take a bus. But a
trial run by buses last week showed it took two hours and 40
minutes to reach the state-of-the-art airport.
	   Recession has grounded for several years the futuristic train
link which will shuttle passengers from downtown into the airport
lobby in 20 minutes.
	   The government admitted earlier in the week that it had received
many complaints from commuters and it would revisit the fares after
the first flights take off Tuesday.
	   ``We will look into ways to reduce the cost of public
transportation and at the same time ease the burden of the
commuters,'' said Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.

	   ``I don't want to spend all that time and money just to get to
the airport,'' said Wan. ``You've seen our recession, 60 ringgit is
just unbearable.''
	   ``My customers, some call me and ask me about the price and how
long it will take and they say, `Oh that's too high and oh that's
too far,''' said Tony Yeow, a private taxi driver who will charge
70 ringgit (dlrs 18) for the airport trip in his luxury sedan.
``Still, I've got five bookings for the new airport already.''
	   Their only other choice, Yeow said, is to take a bus. But a
trial run by buses last week showed it took two hours and 40
minutes to reach the state-of-the-art airport.
	   Recession has grounded for several years the futuristic train
link which will shuttle passengers from downtown into the airport
lobby in 20 minutes.
	   The government admitted earlier in the week that it had received
many complaints from commuters and it would revisit the fares after
the first flights take off Tuesday.
	   ``We will look into ways to reduce the cost of public
transportation and at the same time ease the burden of the
commuters,'' said Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.

Highlights of Clinton, Jiang statements 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Clinton-China
EDs:UPDATES with more details from news conference
By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	   Highlights of the news conference Saturday by President Clinton
and Chinese President Jiang Zemin:
	   _Detargeting nuclear missiles: ``This demonstrates to the entire
world that China and the United States are partners, not
adversaries,'' Jiang said. Clinton said the agreement would enhance
global stability and prevent accidental launches.
	   _Weapons of mass destruction: Clinton welcomed their joint
agreement not to provide assistance to ballistic missile programs
in South Asia, and China's commitment to tighten nuclear export
controls, to strengthen controls on the export of chemicals that
can be turned into weapons, and to work with the United States to
strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention. Jiang emphasized that
``since the very first day when China came into possession of
nuclear weapons, China has undertaken not to be the first to use
nuclear weapons under any circumstances.'' Clinton reiterated
long-standing U.S. policy not to make such a pledge.
	   _The 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown: ``For all of our
agreements, we still disagree about the meaning of what happened
then,'' Clinton said. ``I believe and the American people believe
the use of force and the tragic loss of life was wrong.'' Jiang
countered: ``Had the Chinese government not taken the resolute
measures, then we could not have enjoyed the stability that we are
enjoying today.''
	   _On fresh dissident arrests since Clinton's arrival: Jiang said
local officials had taken steps to handle activities that were
``detrimental'' to security. ``In China we have our laws,'' he
said. Clinton acknowledged progress in the release of Chinese
dissidents but noted that others were still incarcerated. ``I think
you should at least appreciate the fact that we now have an
atmosphere in which it is possible for us to be honest, and honest
in great detail about this,'' he said.
	   _The Dalai Lama: Clinton pressed Jiang to start a dialogue with
the Dalai Lama ``in return for the recognition that Tibet is a part
of China and a recognition of the unique cultural and religious
heritage of that region.'' Jiang said Chinese control had enhanced
conditions in Tibet and, as long as the Dalai Lama was willing to
acknowledge that Tibet and the island of Taiwan are both part of
China, then ``the door to dialogue and negotiation is open.''
	   _Allegations of China funneling illegal donations to Democrats
in the 1996 campaign: Jiang said his government conducted a ``very
earnest investigation'' and concluded ``there was never such a
thing.'' He called the allegations ``very absurd ... sheer
fabrications.''
	   _Taiwan: Clinton reaffirmed U.S. policy of opposing independence
for Taiwan, and Jiang said the United States must stick to that
policy ``in the interest of a smooth growth'' in U.S.-China
relations.
	   _Asian finanial crisis: Clinton saluted China for showing
``great statesmanship and strength in making a strong contribution
to the stability not only of the Chinese people and their economy
but the entire region by maintaining the value of its currency.''
Jiang did not comment, but signed a joint statement pledging to
continue U.S.-China discussions on the crisis.

	   GALLE, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Torrential rains forced umpires to call
off yet another match in the three nation independence cup cricket
tournament before a ball could be bowled between New Zealand and
Sri Lanka Saturday.
	   Both teams shared a point each. It was the third game in the
series to be affected by rain, and the second in Galle after a
match between India and New Zealand was called off midway in
Colombo last Tuesday.
	   On Thursday, the match between India and Sri Lanka was washed
off in the ancient port city.
	   New Zealand and India are scheduled to play the last match in
Galle on Monday before traveling to Colombo to contest the
remaining qualifying round games.
	   India and Sri Lanka are level with four points each, while New
Zealand has two points.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Two people were killed and 36 others
injured when 13 passenger cars of a Bangkok-bound train jumped the
tracks while rounding a curve, police said Saturday.
	   The accident occurred Friday night in rugged jungle about 150
kilometers (93 miles) south of Chiang Mai, according to the police
officer, who declined to be named.
	   The train was carrying 350 passengers, he said.
	   The English-language The Nation said at least four people had
died in the derailment.
	   The accident blocked the tracks and stalled at least four trains
between Bangkok, the Thai capital, and Chiang Mai, the northern
Thailand hub and tourist center.
	   The officer said salvage operations began Saturday and
authorities were investigating the cause of the accident.
	   The Bangkok-Chiang Mai railroad is one of Thailand's major
transport links, carrying thousands of domestic and foreign
passengers each week.

Pakistan devalues rupee by 4.2 percent 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Faced with a tumbling stock market and
an ailing economy, the State Bank of Pakistan on Saturday devalued
its rupee by 4.2 percent.
	   The new buying rate was set at 46 rupees to the dollar, compared
to the previous buying rate of 44.05 rupees. The new selling rate
of 46.46 rupees to the dollar compares to the previous rate of
44.4909.
	   Although the government gave no explanation for the devaluation,
Pakistan has been struggling to stabilize its foreign exchange
reserves in recent weeks.
	   It also is trying to increase its exports, which would be helped
by a devalued rupee.
	   The country's foreign exchange reserves stand at less than dlrs
1 billion. The government froze all foreign currency accounts after
conducting six nuclear tests last month, in response to neighboring
India's testing of five atomic bombs.
	   The accounts were frozen to prevent a flight of capital from
Pakistan, an outflow that would have depleted the country's foreign
exchange reserves and threatened its ability to repay its debts.
	   The stock market closed Friday at an all-time low of 876.90. The
president of the Karachi Stock Exchange, Yasin Lakhani, called for
the resignation of the governor of the State Bank of Pakistan.
	   Lakhani blamed the weakened stock market on the government's
inconsistent exchange rate policies and its decision to freeze
foreign currency accounts.

Warmer Pacific means El Nino on the ropes, satellites show AP Science Writer 
</HEADLINE>

By JANE E. ALLEN
<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ El Nino is dying.
	   According to satellite images, the Pacific Ocean waters warmed
by El Nino are receding. Colder temperatures are creeping in.
	   But scientists say it's still too early to say whether it's time
to crown a successor: La Nina, the cooling masses of water that
often follow the El Nino warming trend.
	   ``It's way too early to call this a La Nina,'' said Bill
Patzert, a research oceanographer at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena, California.
	   ``It may be too soon to say `goodbye' to El Nino and `hello La
Nina,' because the effects of El Nino will be in the climate system
for a long time,'' he said Friday.
	   If La Nina is on its way, ``we'd expect to see clear, strong
indication of it by late summer or early fall _ in approximately
August or September _ just like we did last year with El Nino,''
Patzert said.
	   El Nino is created when trade winds weaken, allowing a large
mass of warm water in the western Pacific to pulse to the east
along the equator toward South America. The phenomenon, which takes
its name from the Spanish words for the Christ child, is so named
because the warm waters typically reach South America around
Christmas, at the end of December.
	   During El Nino, the warm water interacts with the atmosphere
above it, creating a worldwide disruption in weather patterns. The
1997-98 El Nino, the strongest ever recorded, meant heavy flooding
in Peru, drought and wildfires in Indonesia, heavy rains in
California and tornadoes and flooding in the southeastern United
States.
	   La Nina, Spanish for ``little girl,'' is just the opposite. The
warm conditions of El Nino return to the west and trade winds roar
back more strongly than normal. Cold water extends from South
America into the central Pacific, also disrupting global weather
patterns.
	   During La Nina, which typically lasts at least a year, dry
conditions take hold of South America, Africa has alternate periods
of drought and flooding and rains return to Asia.
	   In North America, La Nina brings dry conditions to the South and
cold, wet conditions to the North.
	   ``The real impact of La Ninas and the El Ninos over the
continental U.S. comes in the wintertime, not the summertime,''
Patzert said. ``There's no need to panic yet.''
	   Patzert said current conditions show the ocean in transition.
The satellite images show El Nino remnants along the coast of
Central and South America and just north of the equator.
	   Scientists released their interpretation of sea surface height
measurements taken June 14 by a U.S.-French satellite that measured
the amount of heat stored in ocean waters.
	   JPL scientist Lee-Lueng Fu said the central Pacific near the
equator has dropped to 7 inches (18 centimeters) below normal in
the last month, a sign of a colder ocean. During the height of El
Nino, it had been 7 inches (18 centimeters) above normal.
	   ``It appears now the central equatorial Pacific ocean will stay
colder than normal for some time to come,'' Fu said. ``It is not
clear yet, however, if this current cooling trend will eventually
evolve into a long-lasting La Nina situation.''

From a distance, Chinese watch Clinton's welcome in Tiananmen Square 
</HEADLINE>
BC-China-Clinton Watchers
With BC-Clinton-China
By CHARLES HUTZLER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Under the watchful eyes of swarming plainclothes
police, Chinese thronged to the verge of Tiananmen Square this
morning to glimpse President Bill Clinton's formal welcome to
China's capital.
	   Tourists and traveling businessmen by the thousands rubbed
shoulders with Beijing's more politically jaded residents beneath a
portrait of communist revolutionary Mao Tse-tung on the square's
north side as President Jiang Zemin and Clinton reviewed a military
honor guard.
	   ``The United States is such a great country. We wanted to see
its president,'' said Liu Gaoliang, who took a break from his
business trip from Inner Mongolia to come to the square.
	   The U.S. and Chinese flags hanging from lampposts around the
square offered tourists a new backdrop for photos. Some discovered
it was possible to photograph the American flag fluttering before
Mao's portrait.
	   The crowd exhibited none of the exuberance that greeted Clinton
in the provincial city of Xi'an on Thursday, the first stop in his
nine-day China tour.
	   Police maintained an intimidating presence. No one was allowed
into the square _ the political heart of Beijing. Streets and
sidewalks around the vast plaza were sealed off an hour before
Clinton's arrival.
	   Plainclothes police, made obvious by their two-way radios badly
hidden in newspaper, mixed with the onlookers who arrived before
the curfew. The police eavesdropped on interviews conducted by
foreign reporters and often questioned the Chinese once the
reporters walked away.
	   In a joint news conference with Jiang later at the Great Hall of
the People, on the edge of Tiananmen Square, Clinton brought up the
1989 crackdown. ``For all of our agreements, we still disagree
about the meaning of what happened then,'' Clinton said. ``I
believe and the American people believe the use of force and the
tragic loss of life was wrong.'' Jiang countered: ``Had the Chinese
government not taken the resolute measures, then we could not have
enjoyed the stability that we are enjoying today.''
	   For many, Clinton was a curiosity; for some, he was a symbol of
China's new status as a world power. Still others took his visit as
a hopeful portent for China's future.
	   ``For China, receiving the U.S. president here means Chinese
leaders now recognize America's modernity and prosperity, that
there's no going back on market reforms. They can't close off
China,'' said businessman Liu Yuanfang, from Xingtai in nearby
Hebei province.

Chinese experts give Mrs. Clinton an earful on women's issues 
</HEADLINE>
By ELAINE KURTENBACH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Hillary Rodham Clinton, an accomplished public
speaker, is unlikely to be struck by a loss for words _ but neither
were the women she joined Saturday for a lively discussion on women
in China.
	   The group of six panelists were so eager to tell Mrs. Clinton
about their work in education, legal issues and health that at
times they all seemed to be speaking at once _ barely allowing the
First Lady to slip a word in.
	   ``I don't think I have ever been in such a lively, energetic,
well informed discussion as this one,'' Mrs. Clinton said in
concluding remarks to the gathering of members of the All China
Women's Federation at Beijing's newest and fanciest hotel.
	   Several panelists noted that in the countryside, traditional
attitudes hold that men work outside the home, women inside.
	   ``There are lots of challenges, lots of difficulties. Attitudes
must change,'' said Feng Cui, a leading member of the
government-backed women's federation.
	   The panelists told many stories of hope: of impoverished mothers
sacrificing to send their daughters to school, of women escaping
abusive husbands after learning their legal rights, and of
handicapped women achieving economic self-sufficiency through small
business loans.
	   Mrs. Clinton listened intently, frequently nodding her head in
agreement.
	   ``American and Chinese women have very much in common in terms
of the issues and problems we face,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
	   ``No society will be successful that does not empower women,''
she added. ``I've always liked your saying that `women hold up half
the sky,' but we can't do it if we are not educated, not healthy
... not respected by the men in our lives.''
	   Noting that her own mother and daughter, Chelsea, were in the
audience, Mrs. Clinton praised China's efforts to overcome the
traditional preference for boy babies _ sons to carry on the family
work and name.
	   ``The president and I feel that, since we have a daughter, that
daughters are just as important as sons.''
	   Mrs. Clinton asked about changes in the health care system and
for statistics on rising suicide rates among rural women.
	   ``Do we have any statistics? No. Because our research is
inadequate,'' said Ge Youli, a program officer for the United
Nations Development Program's Beijing office.
	   Xie Lihua, editor-in-chief of the magazine Rural Women Knowing
All, noted that while the situation of rural Chinese women might
appear quite difficult by American standards, it had improved
greatly since China began market-style reforms in the late 1970s.
	   ``We have our own standard for progress and social change. Now,
women have far more choices to make. Before, they were unable to
leave the land, stuck in communes,'' Xie said. ``It's a question of
the level of development, not of discrimination. All eat according
to their efforts but all are poor.''
	   Zheng Bijin, director of women's studies at Peking University,
noted that in Ningxia, a predominantly Muslim region, girls were by
religious custom not allowed to attend classes taught by men.
	   ``If no girls attend school, where will the women teachers come
from?'' Zheng asked.
	   ``Just getting girls to attend school is half the battle,''
agreed Ge of the UNDP.
	   Mrs. Clinton remarked several times that she had seen the
problems faced by Chinese women elsewhere, including in her home
state of Arkansas.
	   Underscoring her interest in education and health, following the
discussion Mrs. Clinton attended the signing of an agreement
between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Beijing
Medical University to expand a seven-year-old collaboration in
research on birth defects.

Malaysian animal conservators turn hunters to kill man-eater

	   KAMPONG JONG, Malaysia (AP) _ Father Stripes is dead.
	   For a week, villagers in these wooded mountains of northern
Malaysia were herded into barricaded huts, with armed police
guarding them against a tiger that had taken two men to a
horrifying death.
	   Trampling through bamboo groves and rubber trees, forest rangers
cornered the beast, the very animal they are trained to protect,
and felled it with bullets late Friday night.
	   The hunt for the tiger, known as ``Father Stripes'' by the
locals, had shattered the serenity of the forest as Special Field
Forces rumbled through the foliage in their jeeps.
	   At daybreak Friday, rangers set out on foot, loaded rifles slung
on their shoulders and scampered among palm trees and bamboo
groves, scouring the ground for pug marks of the prowling beast
that tops the list of endangered animals.
	   Sivanathan Elagupillay, the chief tiger conservator at Malaysian
government's Wildlife Management Unit, headed the operations with a
heavy heart.
	   ``It has been a difficult decision for us,'' he said. But, he
added, ``two lives have already been lost.''
	   The man-eater initially disappeared into the jungles after being
shot near the head. It was then killed a few hours later by another
game warden.
	   The tiger first struck on June 16 at Kampong Kajang village, a
clutch of about 20 families eking out an existence by tapping
rubber, cutting bamboo sticks and selling bananas. All that
remained of Jais Long after the tiger struck were bones.
	   Three days later, the tiger was in Kampong Jong, five kilometers
(three miles) away. It mauled 46-year-old Kamaruddin Noh, leaving
his skull and half-eaten upper torso and dragging away his lower
body.
	   For a week, the tiger had refused to be lured into a camouflaged
cage with a dead goat as bait.
	   On Friday, desperate police carted in a tailor's mannequin,
dressed it in a T-shirt and trousers and left it crouching with
human blood splattered around.
	   The man-eater, in the area where there are 50 more tigers, had
left the villagers terrified, cowering in a barricaded cluster of
bamboo huts on log stilts.
	   ``We have lived with the tiger. We go our own way and he goes
his,'' said Ngah Hitam, 30, who like most villagers in the area is
an aboriginal Orang Asli. They called the tiger ``Pak Belang,'' or
Father Stripes, out of ancient respect.
	   Since the 1970s, logging has left the mountains pockmarked with
bald patches as the lush forests have been turned into
cash-generating oil palm and rubber plantations.
	   With the chopping of natural foliage, wild boar and deer, the
tiger's normal prey, have been depleted.
	   The Malaysian government estimates it has 500 tigers left in the
wild. In 1952 there were about 5,000 tigers, but most were lost
before the Southeast Asian nation banned tiger hunts in 1972.
	   There are only some 5,000 tigers remaining worldwide, down from
10,000 at the beginning of the century.

Clinton to Jiang: You'd like the Dalai Lama if you talked to him 
</HEADLINE>
By JOHN LEICESTER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ President Clinton urged Chinese President Jiang
Zemin to hold talks with Tibet's Dalai Lama, saying following a
summit meeting Saturday that he believed the two men would like
each other ``very much'' if they actually talked.
	   For his part, Chinese President Jiang Zemin said talks were
possible if the exiled Tibetan Buddhist leader accepts that Tibet
and the island of Taiwan are both part of China.
	   ``If he acknowledges that Tibet is an inseparable part of China
_ at the same time he also must admit that Taiwan is a province of
China _ then, as far I see it, the door to negotiation is open,''
Jiang said during a post-summit news conference.
	   ``I hope the Dalai can change positively,'' Jiang said.
	   Jiang refrained from using the label Chinese officials usually
apply to the Dalai Lama _ that of a dangerous ``splittist'' intent
on making Tibet independent.
	   The Dalai Lama, who fled his Himalayan homeland after a failed
uprising against Chinese rule in 1959, has said he seeks greater
autonomy, rather than independence, for Tibet.
	   Clinton agreed that Tibet was Chinese territory and said he
understood why China was insisting the Dalai Lama do so too before
agreeing to hold talks.
	   At the same time, there are ``many, many Tibetans who still
revere the Dalai Lama and view him as their spiritual leader,''
Clinton said.
	   He said he had urged Jiang ``to assume a dialogue with the Dalai
Lama in return for the recognition that Tibet is a part of China,
and in recognition of the unique cultural and religious heritage of
that region.''
	   With a chuckle, Clinton later added: ``I have spent time with
the Dalai Lama. I believe him to be an honest man, and I believe
that if he had a conversation with President Jiang, they would like
each other very much.''
	   Clinton's comments, which were broadcast live on Chinese state
television, likely shocked ordinary Chinese who are used to seeing
the Dalai Lama lambasted in state media as a separatist, a
manipulator of Western public opinion and even a religious fraud.
	   China, which sent troops into Tibet in 1950, says the region has
been Chinese territory since ancient times. Tibetans contend they
were independent for centuries before the Chinese seized control.

After Kosovo talks fail, focus on a key crossroads 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Yugoslavia-Serbs, BC-ANALYSIS-Kosovo-What To Do?

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A day after a top U.S. envoy left
Kosovo with no agreement in hand, international officials Saturday
were closely watching a worsening trouble spot west of the
secessionist province's capital.
	   Richard Holbrooke, whose four days of shuttle diplomacy failed
to produce the cease-fire or Serb pullback he was demanding, noted
that fighting is escalating around Kijevo, a key crossroads on the
main east-west road between Pristina and the Serb-dominated town of
Pec.
	   Adem Demaci, a key ethnic Albanian official with whom Holbrooke
talked at length on his trip, was expected in Kijevo on Saturday as
both sides continued waging control for the strategic spot.
	   Demaci declined to reveal what he and Holbrooke discussed.
	   More than 300 people have died in Kosovo since early March in
intensified fighting that began after Serbian police launched a
crackdown against militant resistance, led by the shadowy Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   As the conflict dragged on with no hint of a resolution,
Holbrooke warned Friday that NATO had stepped up plans for
intervention.
	   Speaking to reporters at Pristina airport, while Yugoslav
fighter jets soared above, he warned both Serbian security forces
and ethnic Albanian militants that their next major clash could
have ``tragic consequences.''
	   According to Holbrooke, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
has agreed to allow a diplomatic corps from dozens of countries to
tour Kosovo to gather information on what's going on. The diplomats
are expected in the next few days.
	   The West remains divided on when and how to act. U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and others caution that military
action can only follow a decision by the U.N. Security Council,
which plans to discuss Kosovo on Monday.
	   Speaking in London on Friday, Annan said the world body would
carry out its ``grave responsibility'' in Kosovo if diplomatic
efforts to halt the violence fail.
	   ``All our professions of regret, all our expressions of
determination to never again permit another Bosnia, all our hopes
for a peaceful future for the Balkans will be cruelly mocked if we
allow Kosovo to become another killing field,'' he said.
	   Serbian forces are using force to try to secure their hold on
the independence-minded province, where ethnic Albanians outnumber
Serbs by 9-to-1.
	   The KLA now claims to control up to 40 percent of Kosovo. Road
travel is increasingly dangerous, with KLA and Serb police
checkpoints blocking normal routes. Daily gunbattles are waged for
control of key arteries.

Arafat arrives in Qatar for talks on peace process 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DOHA, Qatar (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat arrived in
Qatar Saturday for talks on the stalled Middle East peace process,
a Palestinian diplomat said.
	   Qatar's emir, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, met Arafat at
the airport.
	   The two leaders will discuss the peace process, a Palestinian
diplomat said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   An Israeli Cabinet decision last week to extend municipal
services from Jerusalem to Jewish settlements on the West Bank has
enraged Palestinians. They fear the step will lead to the
annexation of West Bank land and the cutting off of Arab parts of
Jerusalem from other Palestinian areas.
	   Palestinians want east Jerusalem to be the capital of their
would-be state.
	   Peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel stalled after
the May 1996 election of hard-line Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
	   Qatar has no diplomatic relations with Israel, but the two
states have trade missions in each other's countries.
	   Arafat was last in Doha in November attending the Middle East
and North Africa Economic Conference.
	   He is expected to leave later Saturday for Bahrain.

IMF gets to work on new loan package after sharp market drop 
</HEADLINE>
By MAURA REYNOLDS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A team of analysts from the International Monetary
Fund began work Saturday toward deciding whether to lend Russia an
additional dlrs 10 billion to help stabilize its precarious
economy.
	   Investors, anxious about Russia's markets for weeks, had a new
case of nerves Friday, with the Russian stock market dropping 5
percent and heavy selling of government treasury bonds.
	   That prompted the the Central Bank to raise key interest rates
sharply to 80 percent from 60 percent in an effort to keep more
investors from fleeing.
	   The Kremlin's liaison with international lenders said he was not
troubled by the market drop and was confident that talks with IMF
officials would produce an agreement.
	   ``Such fluctuations are inevitable, and one should not think
that once talks with the IMF get under way, all indicators will
start to rise,'' Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais said,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   ``We need an end result, and when it is achieved, it will bring
stability to the market,'' he said.
	   The IMF team, which arrived late Friday, began deliberations
with Russian officials on Saturday, Interfax reported.
	   Russia wants dlrs 10 billion to dlrs 15 billion in new lending
to restore its Central Bank reserves, to back up its government
bonds and forestall a run on the ruble.
	   Chubais said Russia was also hoping for help from other
institutions, including the World Bank, other countries and private
banks.
	   The IMF decided Thursday to release a dlrs 670 million
installment in an existing dlrs 9 billion loan. That tranche had
been delayed to press Russia to do more to balance the budget and
reform key areas of the economy, especially the ineffective tax
collection system.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko presented a new austerity plan
to parliament earlier this week that officials said appeared to
meet many of the fund's criteria.
	   But the hard-line lower house of parliament, the State Duma, has
delayed action on legislation needed to implement the plan. Some
investors fear the Duma may not pass the measures before it
recesses July 3.
	   Russia's stock market has lost about half its value since the
beginning of the year, and the Central Bank has been using hard
currency reserves to keep the value of the ruble steady.
	   The economic crisis comes after Russia made what appeared to be
significant progress last year _ the stock market was the world's
best performer, and the economy posted its first growth since the
Soviet collapse.
	   But the Asian financial crisis has made many investors leery of
developing markets, and labor unrest earlier this summer and a drop
in oil prices also sapped confidence in Russia's economy.
	   The Central Bank insists its dlrs 16 billion in reserves are
more than adequate to continue supporting the ruble, but
acknowledges that they are not enough to cover the estimated dlrs
21 billion in ruble-denominated government bonds.

One man shot dead, two wounded in clash in East Timor 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian troops shot dead one man and
seriously wounded two others when rival groups of protesters
clashed in a town in East Timor Saturday, witnesses said.
	   The shootings coincided with the start of an fact-finding visit
to the disputed territory by three Jakarta-based ambassadors
representing the European Union.
	   An Indonesian security official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the incident happened in front of a Catholic church
in Manatutu, about 60 kilometers (40 miles) east of the territory's
capital, Dili.
	   He said troops opened fire when opposing groups of pro- and
anti-Indonesian demonstrators began fighting.
	   Hundreds of people took part in the melee, which was also marred
by rock throwing.
	   Later anti-Indonesian activists brought the body of the dead
man, identified as Manuel Marquez Soares, 21, to Dili and carried
it through its streets in protest.
	   They took it to the University of East Timor, a center of
separatists protest, where more than 800 gathered to mourn the dead
victim and to demand that the Indonesian government hold a
referendum on the future of the former Portuguese colony.
	   ``We will continue our demands for a referendum. A referendum is
the best solution for the East Timor problem,'' said Mathius
Pereira, a protest organizer.
	   Unconfirmed reports said police used tear gas to break up other
groups of protesters in a another part of Dili Saturday.
	   Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975 and
annexed it a year later as its 27th province, triggering a long
running guerrilla war and human rights abuses.
	   The United Nations and many governments refuse to recognize
Indonesia's claim of sovereignty.
	   Indonesia's President B.J. Habibie has offered to grant special
status to East Timor and to release imprisoned rebel commander
Xanana Gusmao in exchange for international recognition.
	   However, separatist groups, as well as Portugal and Gusmao,
demand a referendum.
	   The EU also does not recognize Indonesia's claim over East
Timor. The current three-day visit by ambassadors, from Britain,
the Netherlands and Austria, is the first of its kind for the EU.
	   On Friday thousands of pro-Indonesian demonstrators protested
against calls for a referendum. They claim that a ballot could
result in bloodshed between rival East Timorese groups.

Palestinians in Jerusalem strike on anniversary of annexation 
</HEADLINE>
By IMAD MUSA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Commerce came to a halt Saturday in the Arab
sector of Jerusalem to mark the 31st anniversary of Israel's
annexation of east Jerusalem.
	   A leaflet distributed in the streets during the week called on
Palestinians to observe a general strike ``to respond to the
Israeli conspiracy.'' The leaflet was signed by ``the Palestinian
national forces in Jerusalem.''
	   The leaflet said Israel's recent decision to extend municipal
services to the Jewish West Bank settlements that ring Jerusalem
was ``a new and dangerous milestone in the Israeli policies to
surround and besiege east Jerusalem.''
	   Israel is trying to ``make the Arab presence in the city
negligible and transient,'' the leaflet charged.
	   The leaflet also ordered Palestinians to boycott the Jerusalem
municipal elections scheduled for later this year. The mayor, Ehud
Olmert, is a member of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
hard-line Likud Party. Some Palestinians have already announced
plans to run for the city council.
	   Israel captured east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
War. Saturday's strike marked the anniversary of the subsequent
Knesset decision to annex the eastern sector of the city, which
Palestinians claim as a future capital.
	   The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem as a future capital. Most
of the world has not recognized the Israeli annexation of east
Jerusalem.
	   The strike was observed in the major Arab commercial areas of
east Jerualem. Jewish commercial areas in the city were also
deserted in observance of the Jewish Sabbath.
	   Commercial strikes were frequent during the seven-year
Palestinian intefadeh, or uprising, but have been much less common
since the signing of the Israel-Palestinian peace accords in 1993.

U.S.-China summit yields detargeting pact, no missile-export or trade breakthroughs 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Clinton-China
EDs: UPDATES with details of talks
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The U.S.-China summit yielded a symbolic
agreement to stop aiming nuclear missiles at each other, but failed
to firmly resolve China's export of missile technology to Third
World nations or its membership in the World Trade Organization.
	   China did agree to expand its list of controlled exports to
include chemicals, equipment and technology in order to ``assure
they are not used for production of chemical weapons.''
	   A joint statement formalized Saturday in private meetings
between President Bill Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin at
the Great Hall of the People outlined other modest agreements,
including that they continue regular U.S.-China summits.
	   On human rights, the most contentious issue of Clinton's
nine-day trip, the statement said:
	   ``The United States and China affirm their commitment to the
promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.
While the two countries have differences on human rights they agree
that candid dialogue is an important element for resolving those
differences.''
	   The presidents agreed to foster between their two nations
exchanges among officials and religious figures on the role of
religion, which is not practiced freely in China.
	   They also committed to two forums in the latter half of this
year: the first a human-rights dialogue between senior State
Department officials and counterparts from the Chinese Ministry of
Foreign Affairs; the second a non-official discussion between human
rights groups from both nations.
	   China, one of five declared nuclear powers, has 18 long-range
missiles _ 13 of them currently aimed at U.S. cities _ compared
with the United States' 6,000 or so nuclear warheads.
	   Even with the detargeting agreement, a largely symbolic pact
that Russia also made with the United States last year, both U.S.
and Chinese missiles could easily be retargeted, but without the
hair-trigger speed that Clinton said could lead to accidental
launch.
	   Beijing had wanted a U.S. promise never to be the first to use
nuclear weapons, but Clinton refused. ``We have not changed our
position, nor are we prepared to do so on that,'' he said.
	   While he could claim a victory on detargeting, Clinton was
unable to extract from Jiang a pledge to stop selling missile
know-how to potentially volatile nations.
	   Instead, China agreed only to move toward imposing stiffer
export controls on missile technology to Third World nations with
nuclear ambitions, and to ``actively study'' _ with no specified
timetable _ formally adopting the arms-control guidelines of the
Missile Technology Control Regime.
	   With a nuclear arms race underway in South Asia, China and the
United States did jointly pledge not to export to Pakistan or India
missiles, missile equipment or materials capable of delivering
nuclear weapons. The agreement covers only medium- and long-range
missiles.
	   Further, the two countries called for strengthening a biological
weapons convention and affirmed their ``commitment to ending the
export and indiscriminate use of antipersonnel land mines and to
accelerating global humanitarian demining.''
	   In a sensitive area, China said it would let the United States
check that high-technology American products exported to China,
such as supercomputers, are being used for approved purposes and
not being resold.
	   On trade, China did not win U.S. support for joining the World
Trade Organization, but a round of lower-level talks was scheduled
for the week of July 20 in Geneva.
	   ``We must recommit ourselves to achieving that goal on strong
terms,'' Clinton said.
	   Senior trade officials from both governments had labored in
recent weeks to resolve the WTO question, but the United States
still insists that China make more progress first in opening its
markets for manufacturing, agricultural products and services.
	   In exchange for concessions on technology exports, Beijing had
demanded that Washington ease restrictions on high-technology
sales.
	   But Clinton had no political room to give on that issue. Thorny
questions remain unresolved _ in congressional and Justice
Department investigations _ about possible transfers of sensitive
technology to China under satellite launch deals that he approved
for U.S. aerospace executives who contributed to the Democratic
party.
	   On the environment, China and the United States agreed to
intensify cooperation on clean energy and on building a nationwide
air-quality monitoring network to cut down on the greenhouse gas
emissions believed to contribute to global warming.
	   China agreed to new tariff cuts across a wide range of products,
``though not enough, particularly in some of the key export areas
that are important to American workers and producers,'' said Gene
Sperling, Clinton's National Economic Council chairman. He said
China also made its first proposal for opening its
telecommunications market to foreign competition.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai and American law enforcement
agents have seized four Pakistanis suspected of planning to carry
out ``illegal activities'' in Thailand, a senior police officer
said Saturday.
	   The head of the country's Immigration Police, Lieut. Gen.
Chidchai Vanasatidya, denied some press reports that the four were
linked to the bombing of New York's World Trade Center and were
planning to assassinate the U.S. ambassador here.
	   The English-language newspaper The Nation had quoted Thai
sources as saying the Pakistanis had targeted Ambassador William
Itoh and the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok. The report also linked them
to the 1993 New York City bombing.
	   ``We do have reasons to believe that the four suspects were in
the process of planning to carry out illegal activities in
Thailand. I cannot elaborate,'' the police officer said in an
interview.
	   The four were seized Friday during a raid on a downtown Bangkok
apartment by Thai police and agents of the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation.
	   A U.S. Embassy spokesman also said it did not appear any
Americans or U.S. interests in Thailand had been targeted.
	   ``Thus far there is no evidence of any threat to the U.S.
ambassador in Thailand. Thus far we cannot find any connection with
the World Trade Center bombing,'' said the spokesman, who asked
that his name not be used.
	   He confirmed that American authorities were cooperating with
Thai police in the investigation, which a reliable diplomatic
source said was focusing on suspected terrorist activities.
	   ``Yes, the operation was carried out by both the Thais and the
FBI. It's a normal, standard operation, nothing unusual about it.
We have long been working with other countries and embassies on the
international terrorism and drug trafficking and so on,'' Chidchai
said.
	   The four were being held in Immigration Police prison but have
only been charged with overstaying their visas while the
investigation continues.
	   The Nation identified the four men as Mohamad Rahim, 30, Hadja
Pahu Sasa, 25, Hara Haj Husem, 26, and Hareef Husen, 25.
	   Thailand has been the scene of terrorist activities in the past.
	   Earlier this year, the Thai Supreme Court acquitted an Iranian
accused of plotting to bomb the Israel Embassy in Bangkok.
	   The ``truck bomb'' incident, in which a Middle Eastern-looking
man abandoned an explosives-laden truck following a minor traffic
accident, occurred in 1994.
	   The World Trade Center bombing killed six people and injured
more than 1,000. Six men were convicted in the United States
between 1994 and 1997 in connection with the attack and sentenced
to life imprisonment.
	   In November, a New York court convicted Ramzi Yousef of Pakistan
on murder and conspiracy charges. He was described as the
mastermind of the bombing at the twin 110-story buildings in
Manhattan.

World Cup: Host France takes on outsider Paraguay in 2nd Round 
</HEADLINE>
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Both teams have rediscovered their scoring
touch at the World Cup, yet France is the overwhelming favorite
going into Sunday's second-round game against Paraguay, the
surprise team of the World Cup so far.
	   France won all three of its first-round games with a 9-1 scoring
record and is brimming with confidence as it seeks to become the
first host nation to win the cup since Argentina in 1978.
	   Star playmaker Zinedine Zidane is sitting out the second game of
his red-card suspension, but other regular starters will be rested
and ready after coach Aime Jacquet fielded a slew of substitutes in
last Wednesday's 2-1 win over Denmark.
	   ``I know there are tougher matches than this, but when it comes
to concentration, it is tough to prepare for this,'' said Jacquet.
	   Paraguay boldly warned it should not be underestimated.
	   ``We have great players and we are capable of going all the
way,'' said coach Paulo Cesar Carpeggiani ahead of the France game.
	   Paraguay surprised everyone by surviving the Group of Death,
finishing second in Group D behind Nigeria. The South Americans
relegated Bulgaria and Spain to the misery of early elimination
with a stunning 3-1 win over Nigeria on Wednesday.
	   While the majority of Paraguay's players are unknown to the
French, the aura of goalkeeper-captain Jose Luis Chilavert
continues to grow.
	   Chilavert is the lock on a tough defense, which conceded only
one goal in the first round against three of the toughest teams in
soccer.
	   ``We've got the best defense in the world,'' said Chilavert, the
driving force behind Paraguay's team and famed for coming out of
the net to take free kicks for his side.
	   But France would beg to differ.
	   Its first-choice defense has yet to be seriously tested and even
the second-string defenders allowed only a single goal against the
Danes.
	   The ability to smother penetrations has proved a great basis on
which to build a team.
	   ``The team is oozing confidence and my philosophy is to impose
play instead of being subdued by it,'' said Jacquet.
	   Les Bleus have taken their sparkling play to the opposition from
the opening game, and with young forwards like Thierry Henry, who
scored three goals, and David Trezeguet, they've enchanted the home
crowds.
	   The team is sure to get a great reception in Lens, a small city
in France's industrial belt and home to some of the most rabid
soccer fans in Europe.
	   However, soccer romantics will pull for Paraguay in this David
vs. Goliath matchup.
	   Qualification itself set off huge celebrations in one of the
poorest South American nations, and any additional advancement in
the World Cup would be considered a miracle.
	   After being held scoreless in the first two games, Paraguay
exploded with three goals in its decisive match against Nigeria. It
scored the quickest goal of the Cup within the first minute and,
with wide-open play, added two more.
	   ``Finally, the goals came,'', said midfielder Miguel Angel
Benitez.
	   They will need to come again.
	   The last time the two teams met was at the 1958 World Cup in
Sweden when France prevailed 7-3. France went on to take third
place.

After Kosovo talks fail, focus on a key crossroads With Yugoslavia-Kosovo Serbs, ANALYSIS-Kosovo-What To Do? 
</HEADLINE>
By ADAM BROWN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A day after a top U.S. envoy left
Kosovo with no agreement in hand, international officials on
Saturday were closely watching a worsening trouble spot west of the
secessionist province's capital.
	   Richard Holbrooke, whose four days of shuttle diplomacy failed
to produce the cease-fire or Serb pullback he was demanding, noted
that fighting is escalating around Kijevo, a key crossroads on the
main east-west road between Pristina and the Serb-dominated town of
Pec.
	   Adem Demaci, a key ethnic Albanian official with whom Holbrooke
talked at length on his trip, was expected in Kijevo on Saturday as
both sides continued to struggle for the strategic village.
	   Demaci declined to reveal what he and Holbrooke discussed.
	   More than 300 people have died in Kosovo since early March in
intensified fighting that began after Serbian police launched a
crackdown against militant resistance, led by the shadowy Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   Serbian forces are using force to try to secure their hold on
the independence-minded province, where ethnic Albanians outnumber
Serbs by 9-to-1. Many Serbs consider Kosovo to be the cultural
heartland of Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   The KLA now claims to control up to 40 percent of Kosovo. Road
travel is increasingly dangerous, with KLA and Serb police
checkpoints blocking normal routes. Daily gunbattles are waged for
control of key arteries.
	   As the conflict dragged on with no hint of a resolution,
Holbrooke warned Friday that NATO had stepped up plans for
intervention.
	   Speaking to reporters at Pristina airport, while Yugoslav
fighter jets soared above, he warned both Serbian security forces
and ethnic Albanian militants that their next major clash could
have ``tragic consequences.''
	   According to Holbrooke, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
has agreed to allow a diplomatic corps from dozens of countries to
tour Kosovo to gather information on what's going on. The diplomats
are expected in the next few days.
	   The West remains divided on when and how to act. U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and others caution that military
action can only follow a decision by the U.N. Security Council,
which plans to discuss Kosovo on Monday.
	   Speaking in London on Friday, Annan said the world body would
carry out its ``grave responsibility'' in Kosovo if diplomatic
efforts to halt the violence fail.
	   ``All our professions of regret, all our expressions of
determination to never again permit another Bosnia, all our hopes
for a peaceful future for the Balkans will be cruelly mocked if we
allow Kosovo to become another killing field,'' he said.

One more body found, search goes on after Indonesian ferry accident 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Rescuers found one body in a search
Saturday for dozens of people feared drowned after a ferry capsized
and sank.
	   The ferry overturned Thursday night in the Alas Straits off the
island of Sumbawa, 1,125 kilometers (700 miles) east of the
capital, Jakarta. It was heading to the island of Lombok, a popular
destination for tourists.
	   Anton Enoch, a port official in Lombok, said at least 94
passengers and crew had been on board, although the exact number
had not been confirmed. All aboard were believed to be Indonesians.
	   He said there were fears that some children had been taken
aboard by their parents, but had not been registered in the
official passengers count.
	   There were 52 survivors. Rescuers initially found four bodies
and retrieved a fifth late Friday. At least another 37 remain
missing.
	   The cause of the capsize was not immediately known.
	   Enoch said all vessels passing through the accident area had
been ordered to help in the search for survivors.
	   Additionally, 10 divers were sent to the site on Saturday in a
bid to locate the sunken ferry. A navy ship from nearby Bali island
was scheduled to arrive on Sunday, Enoch said.

Chirac brings French executives to southern Africa

<TEXT>
	   MIDRAND, South Africa (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac
isn't just mouthing the slogan ``trade not aid'' during his visit
to southern Africa.
	   Top executives of 44 French corporations, from oil giant Total
to Cartier jewelers, are accompanying Chirac and his ministers of
foreign affairs and economics.
	   The French arrived in South Africa on Friday and wasted no time
getting down to business. While President Nelson Mandela was
greeting Chirac, the business leaders headed to an economic forum
in Midrand, a corporate area blooming in the grassy expanses
between Pretoria and Johannesburg.
	   Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, who has taken over day-to-day
running of the country from the 79-year-old Mandela and likely will
succeed him next year, bluntly assessed Franco-South African
relations.
	   ``Historically, the links between South Africa and France are
very weak,'' Mbeki told the 1,500 South African and French business
leaders.
	   Although trade between the two countries has nearly doubled
since 1994, it lags behind the United States, Germany and Britain.
About 140 French companies operate in South Africa.
	   During his four-nation trip, which began Thursday, Chirac has
tried to shoot down speculation that France was trying to rival
U.S. interest in southern Africa. Clinton, the first American head
of state to visit the region, promoted an Africa trade bill here
three months ago.
	   ``Contrary to the polemics I'm hearing, there is no competition
between the United States and France in Africa. That is completely
absurd,'' Chirac said in Namibia, the first stop in his trip. He
also will visit Mozambique and Angola.
	   Although Chirac's trip was welcomed by South African leaders,
there was an undercurrent of cynicism about increased Western
interest after decades of running roughshod over the continent,
deciding national borders and propping up dictators.
	   Thabo Mokenela, who heads a business consulting firm, said he
believed it was partly motivated by guilt.
	   ``In the old days, Britain, France and Germany would sit over
their coffee tables and decide African policy,'' Mokenela said.
``Because they destroyed Africa, they now feel guilty and want to
contribute. It's as if you kill someone in a traffic accident and
then you want to pay for the coffin or pay for the education of the
victim's kids.''
	   Mokenela also suspects self-enrichment is a motive.
	   ``Before, they treated us like monkeys in the trees,'' the
executive told a reporter. ``Now they see us driving Mercedes and
making guns, and they want a part of it.''

Sri Lanka acts to counter Millennium Bug 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ The government is forming special
teams to ensure that the software snag known as the Millennium Bug
doesn't pitch state institutions into chaos on Jan. 1, 2000, an
official said Saturday.
	   The ministry of science and technology will head efforts to
assess the likely impact in Sri Lanka of a worldwide software
breakdown triggered by the Millennium Bug, said a senior ministry
official, Palitha Seniviratna.
	   The danger is that the inability of computers to read any
sequence of numbers for dates after Dec. 31, 1999, could wipe out
entire directories of information from airports, government offices
and stock exchanges.
	   Priority for the protection of computer records will go to major
utilities like telecommunications, energy and ports, Seniviratna
said. The government also will enlist the support of private
individuals.

From a distance, Chinese watch Clinton's welcome in Tiananmen Square 
</HEADLINE>
RETRANSMITTING to fix code line &HT;    
With BC-Clinton-China
By CHARLES HUTZLER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Under the watchful eyes of swarming plainclothes
police, Chinese thronged to the verge of Tiananmen Square this
morning to glimpse President Bill Clinton's formal welcome to
China's capital.
	   Tourists and traveling businessmen by the thousands rubbed
shoulders with Beijing's more politically jaded residents beneath a
portrait of communist revolutionary Mao Tse-tung on the square's
north side as President Jiang Zemin and Clinton reviewed a military
honor guard.
	   ``The United States is such a great country. We wanted to see
its president,'' said Liu Gaoliang, who took a break from his
business trip from Inner Mongolia to come to the square.
	   The U.S. and Chinese flags hanging from lampposts around the
square offered tourists a new backdrop for photos. Some discovered
it was possible to photograph the American flag fluttering before
Mao's portrait.
	   The crowd exhibited none of the exuberance that greeted Clinton
in the provincial city of Xi'an on Thursday, the first stop in his
nine-day China tour.
	   Police maintained an intimidating presence. No one was allowed
into the square _ the political heart of Beijing. Streets and
sidewalks around the vast plaza were sealed off an hour before
Clinton's arrival.
	   Plainclothes police, made obvious by their two-way radios badly
hidden in newspaper, mixed with the onlookers who arrived before
the curfew. The police eavesdropped on interviews conducted by
foreign reporters and often questioned the Chinese once the
reporters walked away.
	   In a joint news conference with Jiang later at the Great Hall of
the People, on the edge of Tiananmen Square, Clinton brought up the
1989 crackdown. ``For all of our agreements, we still disagree
about the meaning of what happened then,'' Clinton said. ``I
believe and the American people believe the use of force and the
tragic loss of life was wrong.'' Jiang countered: ``Had the Chinese
government not taken the resolute measures, then we could not have
enjoyed the stability that we are enjoying today.''
	   For many, Clinton was a curiosity; for some, he was a symbol of
China's new status as a world power. Still others took his visit as
a hopeful portent for China's future.
	   ``For China, receiving the U.S. president here means Chinese
leaders now recognize America's modernity and prosperity, that
there's no going back on market reforms. They can't close off
China,'' said businessman Liu Yuanfang, from Xingtai in nearby
Hebei province.

Tunisia leaves World Cup with one point and a lesson 
</HEADLINE>
By TAREK EL-TABLAWY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS, France (AP) _ They came, they played, but they didn't
come close to conquering.
	   Tunisia's World Cup soccer team won't be returning home to a
hero's welcome. But after the team's 1-1 draw with Group G winners
Romania, they won't have to face the humiliation of a scoreless
World Cup either.
	   ``I only hope that the Tunisian people forgive us for the slow
start and ... that they can be proud of the way we finished the
match,'' striker Adel Sellmi told The Associated Press.
	   A 20-year absence from the World Cup left Tunisia in the
unenviable position of being the underdog in a group that included
such powers as England, Romania and Colombia.
	   And, by the team's own admission, there was no serious hope of
advancing much beyond the second round.
	   After losing 2-0 to England in their opener, a more perplexing
1-0 loss to Colombia followed. Tunisia's fate was sealed and Polish
coach Henry Kasperczak was fired. Without a chance to advance,
Tunisia suddenly was playing for pride alone.
	   Kasperczak's replacement, Ali el-Selmi, said the match would be
an effort ``to honor Tunisian and Arab football with a good
performance against a strong team.''
	   Tunisia achieved that objective by scoring a goal and holding
the Romanians to a draw.
	   ``The first half time was the best moment we had out of the
three matches,'' said el-Selmi after the match.
	   The performance was a marked improvement over the two previous
matches where Tunisia looked like it had a hard time functioning as
a team. In the match against England, its defense showed serious
weaknesses. In the showdown against Colombia, the defense got its
act together, but the offense failed to pull its end.
	   A frustrated Sami Trabelsi, team captain for those two matches,
complained that it was unfortunate that the team had to pay the
price for differences in abilities between the defense and offense.
	   ``In the first match against England, we were playing at a
disadvantage, against a team that had more experience. Against
Colombia, we weren't able to put our best foot forward,'' said
striker Sellmi, who plays for FC Nantes.
	   The shortcomings were not evident against Romania, especially in
the first half of the match where Tunisia proved capable of
dominating a match, but also playing the way its players said they
can _ with skill.
	   ``I think we played a match which can be a source of pride for
Arab soccer,'' Sellmi said after the Romania match.
	   Trabelsi said, ``We did not succeed in showing the real Tunisian
soccer in this World Cup, until the very end, when it was too late.
We were lacking at first in physical stamina, in technique.''
	   And while the result of the match against Romania showed to
players and fans alike that Tunisia is capable of holding its own
against strong team, Trabelsi believes that a more valuable lesson
was learned.
	   ``Most important is that we gained experience, confidence and
the knowledge that with more practice, we will be able to put on a
stronger performance in the next Cup.''

Estrada opens door to cooperation with Aquino, anti-Marcos groups 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Seeking to make amends with some of
this opponents, President-elect Joseph Estrada said Saturday he
asked former President Corazon Aquino to serve as one of his senior
advisors.
	   The gesture comes after Estrada angered groups led by Aquino by
endorsing a plan to bury the remains of dictator Ferdinand Marcos
at a heroes' cemetery.
	   Estrada said he spoke with Aquino late Friday, inviting her to
his oath-taking on June 30 and asking her to fill one of the
special advisor jobs. President Fidel Ramos be also serve as
advisor when he steps down.
	   ``I am deeply honored and elated that former President Aquino
has agreed to be one of my senior advisers,'' Estrada said
Saturday. ``She said she will pray for the success of my
administration, and I told her I need all the prayers I can get.''
	   Estrada aroused anger among anti-Marcos groups, including
Aquino, when he endorsed the Marcos family plans to bury the
dictator at Heroes' Cemetery.
	   Groups that had fought Marcos' strongman rule immediately
launched protests. Estrada, a former Marcos supporter, dismissed
the opposition as mere nuisance.
	   Aquino joined one demonstration near the Malacanang presidential
palace last week where she said Marcos did not deserve to be buried
at the cemetery because ``he is not a hero.''
	   Bowing to the widespread protests, Marcos' widow, Imelda, backed
off on Wednesday and said she will indefinitely postpone the
burial. On Thursday, Estrada said he would urge the family to bury
Marcos in his hometown instead.
	   Marcos was ousted in a ``people power'' revolt in 1986, ending
his 20-year rule and installing Aquino as president. He died in
exile in Hawaii three years later but his body was not allowed to
be returned to the country until 1993 under Ramos.
	   Both Aquino and Ramos refused to allow Marcos' remains to be
buried at the heroes' cemetery for fear of clashes between his
opponents and supporters.
	   Imelda Marcos said it was her husband's dying wish to be buried
at the heroes' cemetery, which is reserved for soldiers who fought
during World War II and other battles. Two former presidents are
also buried there.

World Cup: Nigeria, Denmark aim for first quarterfinal 
</HEADLINE>
By HOWARD FENDRICH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Nigeria, carrying the World Cup hopes
of a continent, and Denmark both aim to erase painful memories from
past trips to the second round when they square off at France '98.
	   Neither has ever reached the quarterfinal stage, but that will
change after their meeting Sunday at the Stade de France.
	   Just 60 seconds and Roberto Baggio stood between Nigeria and the
quarterfinals four years ago, but the Super Eagles' suspect defense
let a 1-0 lead slip away. Denmark's only other trip to the round of
16 _ in 1986 _ ended in humiliation with a 5-1 loss to Spain.
	   ``They are playing for themselves, for Nigeria and also for
Africa,'' Nigeria coach Bora Milutinovic said of his talented
squad, which topped Group D. ``These types of games bring out their
best.''
	   The African contingent here of five teams was the highest ever,
but only Nigeria is left in the draw. It could become just the
second team from the continent, after Cameroon in 1990, to reach
the quarters.
	   The confident players are thinking even bigger.
	   ``We are now one of the favorites,'' defender Taribo West said.
``Denmark plays an English style, which is an advantage for us. We
know that tactic.''
	   Denmark scraped through Group C, managing only a 1-1-1 record
and a total goals tally of 3-3.
	   But built around the get-to-everything goalkeeping of Manchester
United's Peter Schmeichel and the solid play of the Laudrup
brothers, Denmark is precisely the type of squad that could give
Nigeria fits. If the Scandinavians play a down-tempo, ball-control
style, it might disrupt the Super Eagles, who prefer free-flowing
soccer.
	   ``They have good tactical discipline and that could be a
problem,'' Nigeria winger Mutiu Adepoju said. ``We'll have to try
to push the pace.''
	   His teammates do that as well as anyone in the tournament,
turning up the volume on a bop-'til-you-drop brand of attacking
play. Milutinovic, the only man to coach four teams into the second
round, has a wealth of weapons and Nigeria's five goals so far have
been scored by five different players.
	   ``We're going to try to play our football,'' said captain Uche
Ukechukwu, a central defender who missed Nigeria's final group game
_ a half-hearted 3-1 loss to Paraguay _ through suspension. ``We
always do, no matter who we play. Schmeichel is very good but you
have to win as a team, not as individuals.''
	   Nigeria should take that to heart.
	   The team's weak point, aside from defensive inconsistency, is a
tendency to look too often for the pretty one-on-one play.
	   ``In the course of a game, a team like Nigeria will always be
tempted to exaggerate its playing with the ball. That is exactly
where we should enter the game,'' said Brian Laudrup, captain
Michael's younger brother.
	   Milutinovic, who previously guided Mexico (1986), Costa Rica
(1990) and the United States (1994) to the round of 16, has just
one injury doubt: striker Daniel Amokachi, who has a twisted knee.
Given the luxury of a meaningless match _ Nigeria had clinched
first place in Group D after two opening wins _ Milutinovic rested
the bulk of his starters against Paraguay.
	   Denmark coach Bo Johansson has to worry about ailing defenders
Marc Rieper (back) and Michael Schjoenberg (knee) and midfielder
Allan Nielsen (ankle). In addition, reserve forward Miklos Molnar
is suspended.

Ex-president son rejects calls to resign from assembly: report 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The youngest son of ex-President
Suharto has reportedly rejected calls that he and three siblings
resign from an assembly that is scheduled to chose a new head of
state next year.
	   Hutomo Mandala Putra, 36, commonly known as Tommy, said he would
remain a member of the People's Consultative Assembly.
	   ``Why should I resign? What's the reason?'' the Jakarta Post
quoted him as saying.
	   Tommy along with three other Suharto children were appointed
members of the assembly before their father quit last month, ending
32 years of power, after Indonesia was rocked by protests and
riots.
	   On Thursday senior officials from the ruling Golkar Party, once
the main supporter of Suharto, urged members of the assembly
appointed to resign if they had been appointed because of nepotism.
	   The Post said about 50 had already stepped down in the wake of
Suharto's departure.
	   Suharto successor and former deputy President B.J. Habibie has
promised to hold an election for a new Parliament by mid-next year.
	   The newly elected legislators are to join appointees of the
assembly to chose a new president and vice president in late 1999.

Prospects of West Bank withdrawal shake Israeli settlers 
</HEADLINE>

By HILARY APPELMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ From his office, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu can just see the gravelly field where dozens of Jewish
settlers are camped in a last-ditch protest against a West Bank
troop withdrawal.
	   ``Netanyahu _ don't cross the red line,'' urge huge banners
above the tents, pitched in hopes of bringing the settlers back
into Netanyahu's political vision. ``You were elected to protect
the Land of Israel.''
	   Settlers were once Netanyahu's staunchest supporters, propelling
him to a 1996 election victory in the belief that he would end the
previous government's land-for-peace policies with the Palestinians
and usher in a new era of growth for Jewish settlements in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   Now, settlers believe Netanyahu is planning to sign an agreement
turning over 13 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians _ a
move they fear will put their very existence on the line.
	   ``The future of the settlement movement in Judea, Samaria and
the Gaza Strip is hanging in the balance for the first time,''
settler leader Israel Harel wrote in the Haaretz newspaper, using
the biblical terms for the West Bank.
	   Recent polls suggest a majority of Israelis support a West Bank
withdrawal, which was promised under the Israel-Palestinian peace
agreements. But to settlers and their supporters, many of whom
consider the West Bank part of the God-given biblical Land of
Israel, giving up land is heresy.
	   ``The government promised us one thing, and now they say they're
going to do something different,'' said Nurit Ben Zimra, a
protester who came to the camp with her seven young children from
the northern West Bank settlement of Maale Levona. ``He promised he
wouldn't give away any more land.''
	   While the government hasn't released any maps, there is general
agreement that redeployment of Israeli troops would for the first
time leave a number of outlying West Bank settlements _ 18 by one
estimate, including Maale Levona _ surrounded by
Palestinian-controlled territory.
	   Settlers are quick to make comparisons with Netzarim, an
isolated settlement in the Palestinian-run Gaza Strip, and the West
Bank city of Hebron, where a tiny Jewish community lives surrounded
by Palestinian autonomy zones.
	   Further withdrawal would bring those communities' embattled way
of life to other settlements, the protesters say. Residents would
be restricted to coming and going in armed convoys; new families
and businesses would stay away; water and electricity supplies
could be endangered.
	   ``It's very hard for a settlement to exist under such
conditions,'' said Shalom Deitch, another protester from Maale
Levona.
	   His arms around his 18-month-old son, Deitch reflected on
whether he would stay put if his settlement became an island in a
Palestinian-controlled sea.
	   ``If where we are turns into a place under threat ... I can't
imagine what it would be like,'' he said. ``I don't want to think
about it. It's not exactly peace.''
	   While the Palestinians grow daily more frustrated over
Netanyahu's failure to sign a redeployment agreement, settlers and
their supporters are bitterly divided over how to respond in the
event he does.
	   On one side are those who want to maintain a pure ideological
stand against withdrawal _ even if it means forcing Netanyahu out
of office and risking election of a less sympathetic government. On
the other are those who endorse working with his government to
minimize the damage of any troop redeployment.
	   Netanyahu ``is going to sign the agreement,'' Shaul Yahalom,
Israel's transportation minister and a member of the pro-settler
National Religious Party, said in an interview with The Jerusalem
Post. ``So we have to fight to limit the damage, to minimize the
withdrawal, to demand reciprocity, to demand that the settlements
won't be endangered.''
	   The purists denounce such compromise as treachery and dismiss
the suggestion that they help draw up maps for a withdrawal.
	   ``I don't know how to draw a map when you're asked which finger
would you like to cut off,'' Deitch said with a shrug.
	   With their faith in Netanyahu shattered, some settlers are
looking elsewhere for salvation. Shlomo Filber, a leader of the
Yesha settlers' council, sees an unlikely ally: Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
	   He finds hope in Arafat's threat to declare _ over Israeli
opposition _ a Palestinian state when the interim peace agreements

Two overnight bombings on Corsica 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BASTIA, Corsica (AP) _ Attackers bombed two police stations on
northern Corsica overnight, causing damage but no injuries, French
authorities said Saturday.
	   A suspect on a motorcycle threw an explosive device at a police
station in Saint-Florent at about 9:15 p.m. Friday, police said.
The device, loaded with birdshot, caused minor damage, shattering
windows.
	   In Corte, a small bomb exploded at the entrance of the police
station, shattering windows in nearby apartments, the authorities
said on customary anonymity.
	   There was no claim of responsibility for the bombings on the
French Mediterranean island. But suspicion fell on nationalists
waging a 23-year campaign of bombings against public buildings and
French businesses, demanding greater autonomy or even independence.
	   The February assassination of France's top administrator on the
island _ Prefect Claude Erignac _ sparked a new crackdown by
authorities and another spate of bombings.
	   Last month, a bombing on the mainland damaged a regional
government building in Marseille, and three men were arrested on
Corsica with explosives outside a state bank.
	   In a poll early this year, more than one-third of mainland
French were in favor of cutting the cord on heavily subsidized
Corsica, and more than half backed a referendum on independence.
More than 80 percent of Corsicans opposed independence.

	   KASAOKA, Japan (AP) _ American Brian Watts shot a 68 Saturday to
grab a one-stroke lead on the third day of the 100 million yen
(dlrs 709,000) Mizuno Open golf tournament.
	   Watts, who won in the Yomiuri Open last week, had five birdies
against one bogey and heads into the final round at 11-under-par.
	   Overnight leader Brandt Jobe of the United States had three
bogeys against one birdie to fall to second-place at 10-under 206,
along with Japan's Keiichiro Fukabori and Tsukasa Watanabe.
	   Both Fukabori and Watanabe carded three birdies against one
bogey.
	   Tied for third at 207 were Frankie Minoza of the Philippines and
Australian Anthony Gilligan.
	   First prize is 18 million yen (dlrs 128,000).
	   The winner also qualifies for the British Open July 16-19, along
with the top four players in the Japan PGA money rankings in the
last seven tournaments and any players in the world top 50 rankings
as of May 28.

Clinton and Jiang debate human rights, announce series of agreements 
</HEADLINE>
By LAURA MYERS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ President Bill Clinton and Chinese President
Jiang Zemin engaged in a spirited, televised debate Saturday over
human rights and the Tiananmen Square crackdown, and announced a
string of agreements on arms control, energy and environmental
matters.
	   There were no announced breakthroughs on American human rights
concerns, including Tibet, but both leaders accentuated the
positive side of an evolving U.S.-China relationship even as they
made clear they won't shy away from disagreements.
	   Clinton praised Jiang's government for resisting pressure to
devalue its currency, a move many fear would worsen Asia's
financial crisis. But they could not agree on terms to allow China
entry into the World Trade Organization, which sets global trade
rules.
	   It was clear, however, that the most senstive issues were human
rights and the continuing controversy over China's decision, nine
years ago this month, to use force in putting down student-led
democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square.
	   ``It is important that whatever our disagreements over past
action, China and the United States must go forward on the right
side of history for the future sake of the world,'' Clinton said at
a joint news conference with Jiang after two hours of talks at the
Great Hall of the People.
	   In an animated manner, Jiang said the fact that the U.S. and
Chinese leaders can disagree publicly is a healthy sign for
relations.
	   ``I think President Clinton is a strong defender of the American
interest, and I am a strong defender of the Chinese interest,''
Jiang said. ``But despite that, we still can have very friendly
exchanges of views and discussion. And I think that is democracy.''
	   The summit began with a short, solemn welcoming ceremony outside
the Great Hall of the People at the edge of Tiananmen Square. It
was a spectacle Clinton's critics said he should have avoided in
memory of hundreds of pro-democracy students and other
demonstrators killed by the Chinese military on surrounding streets
during the 1989 crackdown.
	   Clinton reviewed Chinese troops and received a 21-gun salute,
the cannon fire echoing across the vast square, site of pro- and
anti-government demonstrations throughout Chinese history. It was
here that Mao Tse-tung celebrated the victory of his communist
government in 1949.
	   At the joint news conference, which White House officials said
was broadcast live across China, Clinton directly addressed the
Tiananmen crackdown.
	   ``For all of our agreements, we still disagree about the meaning
of what happened then,'' Clinton said. ``I believe and the American
people believe that the use of force and the tragic loss of life
was wrong.''
	   Jiang, countering with the long-standing Chinese reponse, said
the crackdown was necessary to maintain order and ensure a smooth
transition from a still-developing nation to a modern-day economic
force.
	   ``Had the Chinese government not taken the resolute measures,
then we could not have enjoyed the stability that we are enjoying
today,'' he told Clinton during the freewheeling 70-minute exchange
reminiscent of their October summit in Washington where Clinton
said China was ``on the wrong side of history.''
	   Jiang appeared relaxed, sometimes laughing and smiling. Clinton,
who appeared tense when he first brought up Tiananmen, also seemed
to relish the back and forth exchange. ``I think this debate and
discussion today has been a healthy thing and a good thing,'' he
said.
	   The Chinese president didn't appear upset when Clinton
complained about the detaining of dissidents during his visit and
called on China to release political prisoners, including those
from 1989.
	   ``In China we have our laws,'' Jiang said bluntly.
	   He told Clinton that although their countries have different
social systems, ideologies, values and cultural traditions, ``they
should not become the obstacles in the way of the growth of
China-U.S. relations.''
	   Aides to Clinton said they were pleased by the summit's results,
especially China's decision to broadcast the post-summit news
conference. Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, said
it was the first time such a news event had been broadcast live in
China.
	   ``This is a summit that produced substantial, concrete
results,'' Berger said.
	   In his remarks, Jiang pointed to the agreement to stop targeting
nuclear missile at one another's countries, a symbolic gesture
since missiles can be retargeted in a matter of minutes.
	   ``This demonstrates the United States and China are partners,
not adversaries,'' Jiang said.
	   Clinton agreed the detargeting pact was an important show of
much improved U.S.-China ties for the future.

Communist officials ousted for keeping mistresses 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Two officials in southern China's Guangdong
province have been expelled from the Communist Party and lost their
jobs for keeping mistresses, according to an official report seen
Saturday in Beijing.
	   The report noted that Guangdong, a booming and rather
freewheeling province bordering Hong Kong, had regulations banning
party members from partaking of ``erotic massage'' or keeping
``second wives.''
	   Mai Lianlin, married with one child, lost his post as deputy
propaganda director in Huaiji county after he was found to have
taken a mistress and had two children by her, the local newspaper
Yangcheng Evening News reported Friday.
	   The report said a middle school principal, Yang Jinchang, had
been arrested for attacking his mistress with a knife after she
arranged an abortion following an argument over money.
	   Yang, a married man with one daughter, had moved in with the
woman after she promised to bear him a son, the report said.
	   The reports were carried on the newspaper's front page, with a
prominent note that Guangdong province would severely enforce the
ban on erotic massage and other ``severe offenses.''
	   The Communist Party's morality campaign has made limited headway
in the face of widespread corruption and changing social mores.

Premier, IMF, work to steady Russian economy members. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with prime minister meeting parliament
By MAURA REYNOLDS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's prime minister urged reluctant parliament
leaders Saturday to act quickly to implement his austerity plan,
saying swift action is needed to save the country's economy.
	   Premier Sergei Kiriyenko's talks with leaders of the State Duma
came as analysts from the International Monetary Fund began work on
a possible bailout loan to help stabilize Russia's precarious
economy.
	   Investors, anxious about Russia's markets for weeks, had a new
case of nerves Friday, with the Russian stock market dropping 5
percent and heavy selling of government treasury bonds.
	   That prompted the the Central Bank to raise key interest rates
sharply to 80 percent from 60 percent in an effort to keep more
investors from fleeing.
	   The Kremlin's liaison with international lenders said he was not
troubled by the market drop and was confident the IMF would approve
a new loan.
	   ``Such fluctuations are inevitable, and one should not think
that once talks with the IMF get under way, all indicators will
start to rise,'' Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais said,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   ``We need an end result, and when it is achieved, it will bring
stability to the market,'' he said.
	   The IMF team, which arrived late Friday, began deliberations
with Russian officials on Saturday, Interfax reported.
	   Russia wants dlrs 10 billion to dlrs 15 billion in new lending
to build up its Central Bank reserves in order to back up its
government bonds and forestall a run on the ruble.
	   The IMF decided Thursday to release a dlrs 670 million
installment in an existing dlrs 9 billion loan. That tranche had
been delayed to press Russia to do more to balance the budget and
reform key areas of the economy, especially the ineffective tax
collection system.
	   Kiriyenko presented a new austerity plan to parliament earlier
this week that officials said appeared to meet many of the fund's
criteria.
	   But the hard-line lower house of parliament, the State Duma, has
delayed action on legislation needed to implement the plan. Some
investors fear the Duma may not pass the measures before it
recesses July 3.
	   Kiriyenko met Saturday with the head of the Duma's largest
faction, Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, and urged him to
accelerate action on the plan, Interfax reported, citing
Kiriyenko's spokesman. He was scheduled to see the chairman of the
Duma's budget committee later in the day.
	   Zyuganov and other hard-liners dominate parliament and oppose
most of President Boris Yeltsin's economic policies, including
Russia's dependence on international loans.
	   Russia's stock market has lost about half its value since the
beginning of the year, and the Central Bank has been using hard
currency reserves to keep the value of the ruble steady.
	   The economic crisis comes after Russia made what appeared to be
significant progress last year _ the stock market was the world's
best performer, and the economy posted its first growth since the
Soviet collapse.
	   But the Asian financial crisis has made many investors leery of
developing markets, and labor unrest earlier this summer and a drop
in oil prices also sapped confidence in Russia's economy.

Layoffs in Singapore set to exceed earlier estimates 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Spurred by a souring economy, layoffs in
Singapore will exceed earlier estimates and reach an all-time high
if the current pace keeps up, a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   During the first five months of 1998, 12,000 workers were laid
off as the pace of job losses quickened in April and May, according
to The Business Times.
	   ``Going by the pace now, it will probably exceed 25,000 this
year,'' Minister of State for Manpower Othman Haron Eusofe was
quoted as saying _ well over the government forecast of 20,000.
	   That figure, reached during a recession in 1985, stands as the
country's highest annual number of layoffs.
	   Singapore's economy appear to be inching closer to recession. A
host of private economists, analysts and investment houses have
predicted recession as some point this year, despite government
forecasts of slight growth.
	   Statistics released earlier this month showed that unemployment
is rising while the number of job vacancies drops. A number of
companies, including large multinational corporations, have
retrenched workers recently.
	   For example, electronics manufacturer Hitachi Electronics Device
on Friday laid off 20 percent of its work force _ 363 employees,
according to The Straits Times.
	   A government-linked panel issued recommendations Friday to
minimize layoffs and help those who lose their jobs find work.
	   The panel proposed shorter work weeks, temporary layoffs, and
flexible wages to reduce costs for struggling companies. The
recommendations also included measures to help retrain workers who
are laid off.

France beats Fiji 34-9 drop goal instead of 2 penalties 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS quotes, details. CORRECTS Castaignede to 1 penalty and 1
<TEXT>
	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ France scored 24 unanswered points in the
second half to claim a 34-9 victory over Fiji in their rugby union
test Saturday.
	   The tourists were ahead 10-9 at half-time and finished with four
tries to none against a team which upset Scotland earlier this
month.
	   Thomas Lievremont, Philippe Bernat-Salles, Arthur Gomes and
David Autagne scored tries. Thomas Castaignede kicked four
conversions, a penalty and a drop goal while Fiji's points came
from three penalties by Nicky Little.
	   French team manager Jo Maso said his team made too many errors.
	   ``We didn't play wonderful rugby because we dropped too many
balls,'' Maso said. ``What we needed was continuity and I think
this also applied to the Fijian team.''
	   Fiji coach Brad Johnstone said he was satisfied with the
performance, but the French had deliberately slowed the game down
and ``banged our players every time they looked dangerous.''
	   ``This took a lot out of our guys and they just couldn't come
through with the goods in the end,'' Johnstone said. ``I thought
the Fiji boys played very well for the first 60 minutes but the
pressure and the (lack) of fitness might have told in the end.''
	   Fiji scored within the first few minutes when five-eighth Nicky
Little landed an easy penalty from near the French 22 meter line.
Castaignede kicked France level with a penalty on 10 minutes before
No.8 Lievremont crossed for the first try following a scrum near
Fiji's line.
	   Castaignede's conversion made it 10-3 but Little kept his team
in the game by the break with two further penalties.
	   France's second try came from right winger Philippe
Bernat-Salles, who ran through the Fiji defense from deep inside
his own half, while the next two tries also followed long runs.

Norwegian government proposes dlrs 60 million settlement for Jews 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The Norwegian government has presented
parliament with a proposal to pay 450 million kroner (dlrs 60
million) in compensation for Jewish suffering during World War II,
the news agency NTB reported.
	   The measure presented on Friday follows up on a proposal made in
April by Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik.
	   About one-third of Norway's prewar community of 2,100 Jews died
in the Holocaust. When survivors returned from Nazi internment,
they got little help in a country struggling to recover from the
1940-45 Nazi occupation. Much of their property had been seized,
and was never returned.
	   Under the proposal, 200 million kroner (dlrs 27 million) would
go to individuals and the remainder to various funds aimed at
supporting Jewish culture and Holocaust studies.
	   In 1996, Norway established a commission to locate property
seized by the Nazis from Jews.
	   Last June, after 15 months of reviewing thousands of documents
and about 1,700 cases, the seven-member commission _ the first such
panel in Europe _ couldn't agree on the level of compensation.
	   That criticism was an embarrassment to Norway, which prides
itself both on its tolerance and on its role in the Mideast peace
process.

Feared hooligan battle averted amid heavy security

<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ ``Is there a war in France?'' Matthew, a
young English fan asked early Saturday, as rows of riot police
armed with rubber bullets and tear gas watched the crowds after a
high-risk World Cup match attended by Prince Charles.
	   ``It really wasn't worth the trouble to bring all that out,'' he
said. ``The only problems you risk having are drunken guys angry
about getting that kind of police reception.''
	   But after repeated violence since the five-week soccer
championship began June 10, police took no chances in this town on
the Belgian border. It was feared the England-Colombia match would
draw hooligans from England and competing toughs from Germany who
shook Lens last Sunday.
	   As a result, heavy police presence, a strict alcohol ban and
tougher border checks that turned away suspected hooligans appeared
to do the trick. England's 2-1 victory, and the presence of
royalty, likely had a calming effect as well.
	   Shops in this town near the Belgian border closed early, giant
outdoor World Cup screens were taken down and bars served
non-alcoholic drinks as about 2,000 police stood ready as
surveillance helicopters hovered overhead.
	   Scattered clashes broke out Friday afternoon between police and
English fans, many of them already drunk after arriving by train
from nearby Lille, where no alcohol restrictions were imposed. Many
brought beer with them that police confiscated.
	   In nearby Lille, meanwhile, Lens-bound English fans clashed with
local North African French youths. Police boosted their forces
there to face crowds after the match.
	   Police arrested about 50 fans in Lens and a dozen in Lille,
officials said.
	   About 100 people, mostly drunken English soccer fans en route to
the match, were arrested in clashes overnight Thursday in northern
France and neighboring Belgium, police said.
	   Many suspect English nationals never made it to Lens. French
authorities reported turning away 400 of them who arrived Friday at
Calais, Lille airport and train station, and at the Belgian border.
	   Nevertheless, the high number of drunken English fans in this
town of 30,000 kept tensions high ahead of the evening match.
Prince Charles and his son, Prince Harry, were in a VIP box at the
heavily guarded stadium packed with 41,000 fans.
	   Most locals lay low, and schoolchildren stayed home.
	   ``Police are right to be here in force; it's reassuring. But
it's too bad it had to come to that. Soccer isn't war, after all,''
said Nadja, a Lens college student.
	   After the match, sending England to the round before the
quarterfinals, fans chanting ``England, England'' danced in the
streets.
	   As hundreds of helmeted CRS riot police looked on, fans made
their way to parking lots, hotels and the city's train station. The
less-fortunate simply curled up and slept at the station.
	   It was strikingly different scene from the one in Lens last
Sunday, when rioting by German thugs left a French policeman in a
coma.
	   The newspaper Le Monde on Thursday cited an intelligence memo as
saying German extremists planned to travel to Lens ``to combat the
English enemy and try to gain the title of `best hooligans of
Europe.'''
	   But the prediction didn't materialize. German authorities had
stepped up border checks of France-bound travelers, turning back a
number of suspected hooligans.
	   Clashes outside several of the World Cup's 10 stadium across
France have left more than 100 injured. English fans have clashed
with, or were attacked by, North African French youths from poor
suburbs.
	   French authorities backed by police from participating countries
have detained about 600 people and deported a number of English and
German hooligans.

Special World Cup soccer screenings in Bhutan 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Soccer enthusiasts in the tiny Himalayan
kingdom of Bhutan, where television has long been banned, are
watching the World Cup matches on giant mounted screens, a local
journalist said Saturday.
	   In Thimpu, the Bhutanese capital, the Olympic Association has
put up the screen in a sports stadium, said Kinley Dorji, editor of
Kuensel, Bhutan's government-owned newspaper. Dorji spoke by
telephone from Thimpu.
	   King Jigme Singhe Wangchuk himself is an avid soccer fan.
	   The government also has allowed some private institutions to
screen the matches in three other towns, Dorji said.
	   Bhutan, wedged between India and China, is a developing country
of 600,000 people where Buddhist tradition remains strong and
serious crime is rare.
	   Television is banned and mass tourism is discouraged in Bhutan
to avoid outside influence on its Buddhist way of life.

Sydney budget reforecast approved 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Sydney 2000 Olympic organizers ratified
a budget reforecast Saturday which puts the cost of hosting the
games up U.S. dlrs 90 million to U.S. dlrs 1.56 billion.
	   The increase in costs was offset by an expected gain in revenue,
leaving the projected surplus at about U.S. dlrs 18 million.
	   ``I don't foresee the need for another full budget reforecast
between now and the Games, but obviously revenue and expenditure
will be kept under review,'' said organizing committee chief
executive Sandy Hollway. ``There's no surprise that expenditure has
crept up a bit _ in no way can it be considered a blowout.''
	   Hollway declined to specify why expenditure had increased by
U.S. dlrs 90 million, but it is believed the cost of upgrading
venues had been higher than expected.
	   He said the budget contained a healthy contingency, believed to
be about U.S. dlrs 96 million. The additional revenue is understood
to have come from a number of areas, including increased television
rights fees, merchandising income and changes in commissions for
various groups.

	   NISHIKAMOGUN, Japan (AP) _ Japan's Natsuko Noro shot a 71
Saturday to take a one-stroke lead on the third day of the 70
million yen (dlrs 496,000) Japan Women's Open Golf Championship.
	   Noro, the first round co-leader, carded five birdies against
four bogeys for a 2-under 214 total over the 6,320-yard, par-72
Miyoshi Country Club course.
	   Overnight co-leader Huang Yu-chen of Taiwan, who shot a 73, and
New Zealand's Marnie McGuire, who fired a 72, are tied for second
at 1-under 215.
	   Akiko Fukushima of Japan carded six birdies against two bogeys
for the day's best score of 4-under 68 and surged into fourth at
216.

Top Egyptian belly dancer quits 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ One of Egypt's top belly dancers, Dina, is
quitting following a controversy that erupted after she traded in
the traditional sequined costume for biking shorts and a bikini
top, newspapers reported Saturday.
	   The opposition Al-Ahrar newspaper said Dina's decision to quit
came after government inspectors, who monitor the clothing that
belly dancers wear for modesty, questioned her several times.
	   Dina had shocked traditionalists when she abandoned the
traditional glittering, sequined halter, wide embroidered belt and
long, gauzy skirt.
	   But Dina, who like most belly dancers uses only one name, told
the government-owned Al-Ahram newspaper that her decision to quit
was personal and had nothing to do with the controversy.
	   ``I found inside me something which makes me hate belly
dancing,'' Al-Ahram quoted her as saying. ``Probably because of the
nudity or the places where belly dancing is performed.''
	   Dina has said she will, however, continue acting in movies and
plays.
	   Dina is the latest female Egyptian artist to quit at the height
of her career. Many of the actresses and singers have left and
turned to religion.
	   Opposition newspapers in Egypt have said that some of the
artists received large sums of money from conservative Gulf
businessmen to abandon careers that traditional Muslims consider
immodest for women.
	   Al-Ahram said Dina earned 84 million pounds (dlrs 25 million)
during her career as a dancer.
	   Dina dismissed the figure as ``media exaggerations.''

Top Bosnian Serb official leaves key party post 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The party leader of
Bosnian Serb hardliners resigned Saturday amid growing peacetime
disunity among Serb officials who led their people during the
Bosnian war.
	   Aleksa Buha, one of the founders of the nationalist Serb
Democratic Party in the early 1990s when former Yugoslavia began to
disintegrate, stepped down as the party president, local media
reported. Along with alleged war criminal Radovan Karadzic, he was
a leader of the 1992 Serb rebellion against Bosnia's independence.
	   An informed source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Buha resigned following a dispute over party policies with another
hardliner, Momcilo Krajisnik, who currently holds the post of Serb
member in Bosnia's joint three-man presidency.
	   Buha declined to comment his resignation.
	   He served for years as Bosnian Serb foreign minister, first in
the self-styled rebel government and also later when the 1995 peace
agreement recognized the autonomous Serb entity within Bosnia. The
entity, known as Republika Srpska, comprises 49 percent of Bosnia.
	   Buha left the government late last year after the election
victory of Bosnian Serb reformists over his hardliners.
	   It was not immediately clear if Buha, who before the war was a
philosphy professor, would withdraw from politics alotogether.

Clinton and Jiang debate human rights, announce series of agreements 
</HEADLINE>

By LAURA MYERS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ President Bill Clinton and Chinese President
Jiang Zemin engaged in a spirited, televised debate Saturday over
human rights and the Tiananmen Square crackdown, and announced a
string of agreements on arms control, energy and environmental
matters.
	   There were no announced breakthroughs on American human rights
concerns, including Tibet, but both leaders accentuated the
positive side of an evolving U.S.-China relationship even as they
made clear they won't shy away from disagreements.
	   Clinton praised Jiang's government for resisting pressure to
devalue its currency, a move many fear would worsen Asia's
financial crisis. But they could not agree on terms to allow China
entry into the World Trade Organization, which sets global trade
rules.
	   It was clear, however, that the most senstive issues were human
rights and the continuing controversy over China's decision, nine
years ago this month, to use force in putting down student-led
democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square.
	   ``It is important that whatever our disagreements over past
action, China and the United States must go forward on the right
side of history for the future sake of the world,'' Clinton said at
a joint news conference with Jiang after two hours of talks at the
Great Hall of the People.
	   Later Clinton held talks over lunch with Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji. Clinton aides said Zhu reassured Clinton of his
government's firm resolve not to devalue the Chinese currency, and
they agreed Zhu would pay an official visit to Washington.
	   In an animated manner, Jiang said the fact that the U.S. and
Chinese leaders can disagree publicly is a healthy sign for
relations.
	   ``I think President Clinton is a strong defender of the American
interest, and I am a strong defender of the Chinese interest,''
Jiang said. ``But despite that, we still can have very friendly
exchanges of views and discussion. And I think that is democracy.''
	   The summit began with a short, solemn welcoming ceremony outside
the Great Hall of the People at the edge of Tiananmen Square. It
was a spectacle Clinton's critics said he should have avoided in
memory of hundreds of pro-democracy students and other
demonstrators killed by the Chinese military on surrounding streets
during the 1989 crackdown.
	   Clinton reviewed Chinese troops and received a 21-gun salute,
the cannon fire echoing across the vast square, site of pro- and
anti-government demonstrations throughout Chinese history. It was
here that Mao Tse-tung celebrated the victory of his communist
government in 1949.
	   At the joint news conference, which White House officials said
was broadcast live across China, including into Tibet, Clinton
directly addressed the Tiananmen crackdown.
	   ``For all of our agreements, we still disagree about the meaning
of what happened then,'' Clinton said. ``I believe and the American
people believe that the use of force and the tragic loss of life
was wrong.''
	   Jiang, countering with the long-standing Chinese reponse, said
the crackdown was necessary to maintain order and ensure a smooth
transition from a still-developing nation to a modern-day economic
force.
	   ``Had the Chinese government not taken the resolute measures,
then we could not have enjoyed the stability that we are enjoying
today,'' he told Clinton during the freewheeling 70-minute exchange
reminiscent of their October summit in Washington where Clinton
said China was ``on the wrong side of history.''
	   Jiang appeared relaxed, sometimes laughing and smiling. Clinton,
who appeared tense when he first brought up Tiananmen, also seemed
to relish the exchange. ``I think this debate and discussion today
has been a healthy thing and a good thing,'' he said.
	   The Chinese president didn't appear upset when Clinton
complained about the detaining of dissidents during his visit and
called on China to release political prisoners, including those
from 1989.
	   ``In China we have our laws,'' Jiang said bluntly.
	   He told Clinton that although their countries have different
social systems, ideologies, values and cultural traditions, ``they
should not become the obstacles in the way of the growth of
China-U.S. relations.''
	   Aides to Clinton said they were pleased by the summit's results,
especially China's decision to broadcast the post-summit news
conference. Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, said
it was the first time such a news event had been broadcast live in
China.
	   ``This is a summit that produced substantial, concrete
results,'' Berger said.
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said the
broadcast ``shows we have adopted an open attitude'' in welcoming
Clinton.
	   ``We would like people to understand the different views of the
different sides,'' Zhu said. ``Chinese society is more and more
open. People have their own opinons and can make their own
judgements.''

World Cup: Japanese coach determined to quit, team departs 
</HEADLINE>
By YURI KAGEYAMA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ Coach Takeshi Okada is determined
to call it quits after ending Japan's first World Cup with no wins.
But Japan's soccer federation wants him to stay on for 2002.
	   ``Mr. Okada has excellent analytical skills, a logical approach
to the game and the ability to bring the team together,'' Japan
Football Association technical committee chairman Kuniya Daini said
Saturday. ``We do not believe we made a mistake choosing Mr. Okada
as coach.''
	   Taking over as coach last October when chances for getting to
the World Cup looked dismal, Okada led Japan to a dramatic
turnaround to its first ever World Cup.
	   But the 41-year-old coach, who has been hinting for days he
would step down, announced his decision after Friday's final game,
a 2-1 loss to Jamaica.
	   Okada said he took his job too seriously not to resign.
	   ``If I couldn't produce results and I take the easy way out, I
don't think I can go on believing in myself,'' he told reporters.
	   Although Okada said he did not have a single moment of
satisfaction at the World Cup, he also said he had no regrets.
	   ``It may be millions of years since the Earth was born, a
lifetime may be 80 years and a game is only 90 minutes,'' he said.
``But we have to deal with each moment and give it everything.''
	   Midfielder Takashi Hirano said he still respected Okada.
	   ``He brought us here. He changed history. So he's great. He's a
professional so he has to quit,'' Hirano said.
	   Daini, the soccer official, defended Okada by saying that
expecting a win at the first World Cup was too much, given that
Japan still lacks strong defense, quick switches to offense, long
passes as well as the finishing touches needed to score.
	   ``These are the longtime problems for the Japanese team,'' Daini
said.
	   But Okada and the players said they should have won, especially
against fellow newcomer Jamaica.
	   ``We had many chances,'' said captain Masami Ihara. ``I learned
a lot, although I feel many problems remain.''
	   ``Being able to play at the World Cup is a rare experience. And
I'm only 18,'' said Shinji Ono, the only teen-ager on the squad.
``I'm sure the other teams weren't great from the start. They had
to go through all this and that's how they became great. So if we
work at it, we'll get there, too.''
	   The team, which departed from the resort town-training camp
Saturday, is scheduled to fly out of Paris on Sunday.

World Cup: Nakata has most to say about why he won't talk 
</HEADLINE>
By YURI KAGEYAMA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ Japan's standout midfielder
Hidetoshi Nakata had little to say about his World Cup experience
but had lots to say about why he refuses to speak to reporters.
	   ``So many people were watching,'' Nakata said Saturday of the
World Cup. ``I thought it was a bigger tournament, but it wasn't
that different from other matches.''
	   In a rare news conference, the soft-spoken player with the
orange hair went on for quite a length about why he boycotts the
press.
	   ``Only if everything I say is reported truthfully,'' he said
quietly. ``I want to talk but there have been so many lies. I don't
want to condone that.''
	   Nakata, 21, is the only member of the World Cup team who did not
speak with the reporters assigned to covering the team at its
training camp and World Cup games.
	   Japan's sports reporting is dominated by tabloids, and athletes
complain that these newspapers often publish speculation or
incorrect reports.
	   ``As long as there are people who bend the truth, I will not
change,'' Nakata said. ``The problem lies with those who can't
report the truth.''
	   Nakata _ the biggest star on the Japanese team _ said he felt
happy overall with the way he played at the World Cup and wouldn't
change a thing with his training, once he gets home.
	   ``Of course, I don't feel that I performed my very best,''
Nakata said. ``No matter what one does, one never reaches a level
of total satisfaction. I'll never be satisfied.''

Coast guard impounds cargo ship as ``floating death trap'' 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ABERDEEN, Scotland (AP) _ The coast guard has impounded a
Panamanian-registered cargo ship which it described as ``a floating
death trap.''
	   The 2,740-ton Lolo, owned by the Al Amin Shipping company in
Syria, collided with another vessel Friday while maneuvering into
the harbor in Aberdeen. It was traveling from Greece with a cargo
of minerals.
	   The collision was not a serious incident, but inspectors from
Britain's Maritime and Coastguard Agency who boarded the vessel
said they found 14 faults which could jeopardize the ship's safety
and the crew's ability to perform in an emergency.
	   The agency said one of the faults was responsible for the
collision and impounded the Lolo on Friday.
	   ``This is one of the worst vessels I have surveyed,'' said
Duncan McDonald, principal surveyor for the agency, known as the
MCA. ``She is a floating death trap and will be detained until the
owners can satisfy the MCA that she no longer represents a danger
to her crew and others.''
	   The agency said vital safety instructions are printed in Russian
_ but the crew are Syrian and don't speak a word of Russian. It
branded the ship's radio officer as ``incompetent'', unable to
operate the equipment or even tell people how to abandon ship. It
also cited engine problems and fire hazards, and said ventilators
on deck are so rusty that the ship could sink.
	   Coast guard authorities have the right to detain any vessel, of
any flag, visiting British ports which do not meet international
safety requirements.

World Cup: German coach wants group format in second round, more European finalists 
</HEADLINE>
By NESHA STARCEVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ German coach Berti Vogts would like to
revert to the old World Cup format of having groups in the second
round, and said Europe should receive more slots in the finals.
	   ``European soccer is the winner of this World Cup, while Asia
and Africa are the big losers,'' Vogts said Saturday. ``Europe and
South America have confirmed their strengths.''
	   ``FIFA should see how many European teams qualify for the
finals,'' Vogts said of the governing body of world soccer.
	   He said the number of European teams in the finals should be
raised from 14 to 16, half of the teams in the finals.
	   Ten European nations have advanced to the round of 16, along
with five South American teams and only one African _ Nigeria.
	   Vogts said the new 32-team format was fine, because it brought
in some ``refreshing teams.''
	   ``But we should then have four groups of four teams in the
second round, with the winners going to the semifinals,'' Vogts
said.
	   ``Look at England-Argentina, one of the favorites will have to
go home before the quarterfinals,'' Vogts said. ``It could happen
on a refereeing error.''
	   ``Look what happened to Morocco, they played beautiful soccer
and ended up going home because of a false decision, perhaps
because the referee wasn't at the right place,'' the German coach
said.
	   Morocco beat Scotland 3-0 in its final first-round match, but
ended up going home because Norway beat Brazil 2-1 on a late
controversial penalty.
	   England and Argentina are clashing in one of the round of 16
matches.
	   ``If you think that you will see better and more offensive
soccer in the second round because of the knockout system, you'll
be disappointed,'' Vogts said.
	   ``I don't think it would be boring. You can afford to lose one
game and still advance to the semifinals and that could be very
exciting,'' Vogts said.
	   The World Cup format has been changed several times, as more and
more teams were allowed into the finals.
	   The last time the World Cup used a group format in the second
round was in 1982, with four groups of three teams and the winners
going to the semifinals.
	   In 1974 and 1978, the second round consisted of two groups of
four teams, with the winners going to the final.
	   Before that, with fewer teams, two top-placed teams from four
groups would go straight into the quarterfinals.
	   Because of the number of teams in the first round, 32, a group
format would be perfect for the second round, Vogts said.
	   ``Having groups of three teams is not so good because one team
is always idle. But with for teams, it works and you could fit it
into the same number of days,'' Vogts said.

Thousands of residents protest murder of Russian mayor 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Thousands of angry residents demonstrated in a
major oil-producing city Saturday to mourn their mayor, who was
shot and killed in a suspected contract murder, news reports said.
	   Nefteyugansk Mayor Vladimir Petukhov died after sustaining
point-blank gunshot wounds to the head and chest as he walked to
work on Friday. His bodyguard was in critical condition.
	   Residents poured into the central square Friday and remained
Saturday, demanding police bring the killers to justice, ORT
television reported. They blocked the city's main bridge for
several hours overnight.
	   Police have detained two men matching descriptions given by the
bodyguard, news agencies said.
	   Nefteyugansk, a city 2,000 kilometers (1,400 miles) east of
Moscow, is a rich oil-producing city in the Tyumen region. Police
were trying to determine whether the motive for his killing was
related to his political or economic dealings.
	   Most of its residents work for Yuganskneftegas, a subsidiary of
Yukos, one of Russia's largest oil companies. Petukhov recently led
rallies of oil workers demanding months of back wages from the oil
company.
	   Petukhov's wife, who handled his business affairs and ran the
city's main market, said she was confident the killing was ordered,
the Interfax news agency reported without elaborating.

Eds: ADDS reference to Germany meeting Mexico in 2nd round
By NESHA STARCEVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ German coach Berti Vogts would like to
revert to the old World Cup format of having groups in the second
round, and said Europe should receive more slots in the finals.
	   ``European soccer is the winner of this World Cup, while Asia
and Africa are the big losers,'' Vogts said Saturday. ``Europe and
South America have confirmed their strengths.''
	   ``FIFA should see how many European teams qualify for the
finals,'' Vogts said of the governing body of world soccer.
	   He said the number of European teams in the finals should be
raised from 14 to 16, half of the teams in the finals.
	   Ten European nations have advanced to the round of 16, along
with five South American teams and only one African _ Nigeria.
Germany, one of the top favorites plays Mexico on Monday in
Montpellier.

Ukrainian authorities detain border guard who killed five comrades 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian forces detained a border guard
Saturday suspected of shooting dead five of his comrades before
fleeing his unit in Crimea, officials said.
	   Vadim Sobko, 19, was detained by an elite interior troops' unit
near the town of Alupka on the Black Sea, where he was stationed,
said Lt. Gen. Pavlo Shisholin, the border guards' chief of staff.
	   No violence was reported during the detention, although Sobko
was armed with a Kalashnikov rifle.
	   Sobko killed his unit commander, a sergeant and three soldiers
Thursday before escaping into the mountainous area of Alupka's
forest reserve. Border guards, interior troops and Security Service
agents have been looking for him since.
	   Shootings have become frequent in the often demoralized and
poorly funded armies of the former Soviet republics, especially in
neighboring Russia.
	   Many shootings are blamed on hazing, which is common in the
armed forces of the former Soviet Union and involves physical and
psychological abuse of recruits by older servicemen.
	   In 1997, five people were killed and 44 others were disabled in
143 hazing episodes in the Ukrainian military, which has about
400,000 servicemen. In January 1998, a private at a missile base
shot two other soldiers to avenge hazing and then killed himself.
	   Shisholin, however, ruled out hazing as Sobko's driving motive
and linked the killings to his ``psychological state,'' the
Interfax news agency said.
	   Shisholin said that Sobko, who spent a month at the border
guards' base after transfer from a training unit, was an
``unbalanced, unsociable soldier who was absolutely unreceptive to
criticism.''
	   But Sobko's neighbors, speaking on Ukrainian television Friday,
had no doubts that his attack was provoked by hazing, describing
the soldier as a calm youth who was not prone to violence before
the draft.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BEIJING (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton and Chinese President
Jiang Zemin engaged in a spirited televised debate Saturday over
human rights and the Tiananmen Square crackdown, and announced a
string of agreements on arms control, energy and environmental
matters. There were no announced breakthroughs on American human
rights concerns, including Tibet, but both leaders accentuated the
positive side of an evolving U.S.-China relationship even as they
made clear they won't shy away from disagreements. (CLINTON-CHINA)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A day after a top U.S. envoy left
Kosovo with no agreement in hand, international officials were
closely watching a worsening trouble spot west of the secessionist
province's capital on Saturday. Richard Holbrooke, whose four days
of shuttle diplomacy failed to produce the cease-fire or Serb
pullback he was demanding, noted that fighting is escalating around
Kijevo, a key crossroads on the main east-west road between
Pristina and the Serb-dominated town of Pec. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Shops and businesses shut down across the Arab
sector of Jerusalem on Saturday to protest Israel's planned
expansion of the disputed city and mark the anniversary of the
annexation of the Arab part of the city. A leaflet distributed
during the week called on Palestinians to observe a general strike
``to respond to the Israeli conspiracy.'' The leaflet was signed by
``the Palestinian national forces in Jerusalem.'' The strike was
observed in the major Arab commercial areas of east Jerusalem.
Jewish commercial areas were also deserted in observance of the
Jewish Sabbath. (PALESTINIAN-JERUSALEM)
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Northern Ireland's major
Protestant party, essential to making the Belfast peace agreement
work, expects to scrape home with just enough seats in the new
cross-community government as ballot counting resumed Saturday.
About 20 seats remained up for grabs following Thursday's election
to the 108-member Belfast Assembly, the legislature that is
supposed to nominate Protestant and Catholic members to govern the
British-ruled territory after 26 years of ``direct rule'' from
London. (NORTHERN IRELAND)
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Following a one-day visit to Cambodia,
Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan said Saturday that he and
other Southeast Asian representatives were hopeful that the
country's controversial elections would go smoothly. Surin traveled
to Cambodia with a 13-member delegation from the so-called ``ASEAN
Troika,'' which includes the Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia.
The three members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
have played a mediating role among Cambodia's rival factions since
a bloody coup last year. (CAMBODIA-ELECTIONS)

Thai foreign minister hopeful as Cambodian elections near 
</HEADLINE>
By KER MUNTHIT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan
said Saturday he and other Southeast Asian representatives were
hopeful Cambodia's upcoming elections would be carried out
smoothly.
	   ``All the preparations for the elections have been going well.
The last three days of campaigning have been smooth,'' Surin said
on a one-day visit to the country. `We have been quite satisfied
with the results so far.''
	   Surin travelled to Cambodia with a 13-strong delegation from the
so-called ``ASEAN Troika,'' which includes the Philippines,
Thailand and Indonesia.
	   The three members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
have played a mediating role among Cambodia's rival factions since
a bloody coup last year.
	   Surin's delegation flew first to the northwestern province of
Siem Reap to meet King Norodom Sihanouk. They then went to Phnom
Penh to hold separate talks with Cambodian leader Hun Sen and
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the former co-prime minister deposed by
Hun Sen in the coup.
	   Critics say the elections will be a sham because Hun Sen has
used intimidation and violence _ including killings of opponents _
to ensure he wins the vote.
	   But speaking to reporters before meeting the prince, Surin said
``the international community will be rewarded with its efforts for
free, fair and credible elections in Cambodia'' if things continued
on course.
	   Although he later gave no details of the talks, he had been
expected to pass on to the two rivals views expressed on the
elections by the so-called Friends of Cambodia _ a group of Western
and Asian countries seeking an end to the country's unrest _ and
the ASEAN Troika.
	   The Friends of Cambodia endorsed the July 26 election date
during a meeting in Bangkok last week, although they acknowledged
there were still lingering concerns about the political climate,
including a failure by the government to investigate some 90
killing of Hun Sen's opponents.
	   Hun Sen Saturday countered charges that murders of opposition
figures were continuing, saying it ``did not correspond to the
reality here,'' according to Cabinet Minister Sok An.
	   The international community hopes the upcoming polls will
restore political stability while Hun Sen is eager to win back
legitimacy lost after the coup.
	   Critics say the polls are stacked in his favor. Hun Sen's
supporters control the electoral bodies charged with overseeing the
polls and the opposition has been denied access to the media.
	   Although Ranariddh has said he remains committed to taking part
in the electoral process, he has urged nations helping organize the
elections to tackle concerns over how free and fair they will be.
	   Dissident leader Sam Rainsy and the head of a small allied
opposition party, Son Soubert, also said they would decide by July
5 whether or not they will take part.

	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast(AP) _ A chartered plane carrying the United
Nations special envoy to Angola has disappeared en route to the
Ivory Coast from Togo, airport sources in Abidjan said Saturday.
	   The small Beechcraft 200 plane carrying Alioune Blondin Beye had
left from Lome, Togo Friday night after the envoy had met with
Togolese President Gnassigbe Eyadema to try to win support for his
efforts to push forward the peace process in Angola.
	   An airport source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
contact with the plane was lost late Friday night.
	   The source could not say whether or not it had crashed, but said
a search had been launched and officials were operation on the
belief that the plane had gone down.

Top Egyptian actor defies Algerian militants 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A top Egyptian actor will defy Islamic
militants in Algeria and stage his hit play, in which he portrays a
ruthless dictator overthrown by his own people, a newspaper
reported Saturday.
	   Muslim extremists have often targeted artists and intellectuals
in their campaign for an Islamic state.
	   Adel Imam said that proceeds from his week-long performance of
``Al-Zaeem'' or ``The Leader,'' will go to victims of the six-year
fight between Islamic militants and security forces in Algeria, the
London-based al-Hayat newspaper reported.
	   The staging of the show in Algeria will highlight that extremism
kills hope and free thought, the newspaper quoted Imam as saying.
The performance will be held at the invitation of the Algerian
government.
	   An estimated 75,000 people have been killed in the insurgency,
which began after the military-backed government canceled 1992
elections that the Islamic Salvation Front was expected to win.
	   Imam challenged Muslim militants in Egypt in 1988 when he staged
his play ``Al-Wad Sayed Al-Shaghal'' or ``Sayed, the Servant Boy,''
in the southern province of Assiut.
	   At the time, Assiut was a stronghold of Muslim militants, who
had attacked student plays and musical performances.
	   Imam has also tackled Egypt's militants in two movies, ``The
Terrorist,'' and ``The Birds of Darkness.''
	   In Al-Zaeem, Imam plays a ruthless Arab dictator whose people
overthrow him, giving him a lesson in democracy.
	   The play has been performed in Egypt since 1994.

New clashes reported in Berber capital after singer's slaying 
</HEADLINE>
By RACHID KHIARI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Protesters stoned police in the ethnic
Berber capital of Tizi-Ouzou for a second day Saturday, as public
anger simmered over the slaying of Berber singer-activist Lounes
Matoub.
	   Police attempting to control the new violence cordoned off
portions of Tizi-Ouzou, 100 kms (60 miles) east of Algiers, a day
after youths smashed windows, windshields and stoned public
buildings.
	   Matoub, 42, believed killed by a violent Muslim militant
movement, was shot Thursday at a fake roadblock near his hometown
after returning from exile in France.
	   The singer, a defender of Berber culture and a fierce critic of
both the military-backed government and Muslim militants, was the
latest Algerian artist to be slain during a 6-year-old Muslim
insurgency that has claimed more than 75,000 lives.
	   The slaying inflamed anger in the region against the
government's plans July 5 to put a law in effect making Arabic the
official language in this former French colony and banning the
official use of other tongues including Berber and French.
	   The move was seen as an effort of the military-backed government
to appease supporters of Islamic movements.
	   The Islamic Salvation Front, whose official banishment after
canceled 1992 elections helped spark the insurgency, condemned the
assassination ``despite the extremist positions of Lounes Matoub
and his anti-Islamic statements.''
	   ``Algerian unity is targeted'' by the slaying, the group known
by its French initials FIS said in a statement received in Paris.
``Cultures and languages contributing to the development of the
(Algerian) identity must be promoted without exclusion.''
	   The body of Matoub was being placed in the municipal sports
arena in Tizi-Ouzou, then transported to his hometown of Beni
Douala for burial there Sunday. Officials earlier Saturday delayed
the burial date to Monday but later reverted back to the initial
plans.
	   Political parties in the region called for a general strike on
Sunday, normally a work day in Muslim Algeria.
	   Reacting to the death of Matoub, an impassioned defender of
Berber culture, the opposition Socialist Forces Front called on the
public to reject the so-called ``Arabization law.''
	   While there was no claim of responsibility for the attack,
officials blamed it on the Armed Islamic Group, the insurgency's
most violent movement, which kidnapped the singer in 1994 and held
him for two weeks.
	   The insurgency began after the military-backed government in the
former French colony scrapped second-round parliamentary elections
in January 1992. The Islamic Salvation Front was expected to win
the balloting on voter discontent with corruption and high
unemployment.

Clinton to Jiang: You'd like the Dalai Lama if you talked to him listing other preconditions to talks 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS grafs 8-10 to UPDATE with Chinese government spokesman
By JOHN LEICESTER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ President Clinton urged Chinese President Jiang
Zemin to hold talks with Tibet's Dalai Lama, saying following a
summit meeting Saturday that he believed the two men would like
each other ``very much'' if they actually talked.
	   For his part, Chinese President Jiang Zemin said talks were
possible if the exiled Tibetan Buddhist leader accepts that Tibet
and the island of Taiwan are both part of China.
	   ``If he acknowledges that Tibet is an inseparable part of China
_ at the same time he also must admit that Taiwan is a province of
China _ then, as far I see it, the door to negotiation is open,''
Jiang said during a post-summit news conference.
	   ``I hope the Dalai can change positively,'' Jiang said.
	   Jiang refrained from using the label Chinese officials usually
apply to the Dalai Lama _ that of a dangerous ``splittist'' intent
on making Tibet independent.
	   The Dalai Lama, who fled his Himalayan homeland after a failed
uprising against Chinese rule in 1959, has said he seeks greater
autonomy, rather than independence, for Tibet.
	   Later, a Chinese government spokesman said that apart from
openly recognizing Tibet as Chinese territory, the Dalai Lama also
would have to renounce Tibetan independence and stop supporting
separatist activities for negotiations to begin.
	   ``Although he sometimes says he supports autonomy and not
independence, in deeds it is completely another thing. He has time
and again said China is occupying an independent nation. This is an
obstacle to negotiations,'' said Zhu Bangzao of the Chinese Foreign
Ministry.
	   ``All this has shown the Dalai Lama has no sincerity in talks
with the central government,'' Zhu said.
	   At his news conference with Jiang, Clinton agreed that Tibet was
Chinese territory and said he understood why China was insisting
the Dalai Lama acknowledge that before agreeing to hold talks.
	   At the same time, there are ``many, many Tibetans who still
revere the Dalai Lama and view him as their spiritual leader,''
Clinton said.
	   He said he had urged Jiang ``to assume a dialogue with the Dalai
Lama in return for the recognition that Tibet is a part of China,
and in recognition of the unique cultural and religious heritage of
that region.''
	   With a chuckle, Clinton later added: ``I have spent time with
the Dalai Lama. I believe him to be an honest man, and I believe
that if he had a conversation with President Jiang, they would like
each other very much.''
	   Clinton's comments, which were broadcast live on Chinese state
television, likely shocked ordinary Chinese who are used to seeing
the Dalai Lama lambasted in state media as a separatist, a
manipulator of Western public opinion and even a religious fraud.
	   China, which sent troops into Tibet in 1950, says the region has
been Chinese territory since ancient times. Tibetans contend they
were independent for centuries before the Chinese seized control.

Unrest in southern Russian village after two men killed 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Hundreds of villagers rallied Saturday to protest
the killings of two of their neighbors in a restive region of
southern Russia, news reports said.
	   The two men were killed Friday near the village of Sunzha in the
disputed Prigorodny region of North Ossetia, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   The village is near the border with neighboring Ingushetia, with
whom North Ossetia fought a short by bloody territorial and ethnic
war in 1992. Each republic claims the Prigorodny region as their
own.
	   The two men, aged 65 and 56, were cutting hay in a field when
two camouflage-wearing men came out of the woods and asked if there
were Russian soldiers around, according to a brother of one of the
victims who witnessed the incident.
	   When the men said no, the two gunmen opened fire, the brother
said, according to ORT television and the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and most ethnic Ingush were
expelled from the Prigorodny region during the 1992 conflict.
Thousands of the refugees have since returned, and there have been
clashes between the two peoples.
	   The reports did not say whether the victims belonged to a
particular ethnic group.
	   The president of North Ossetia traveled to the village late
Friday to try to quell unrest, ORT reported, while the president of
Ingushetia released a statement calling the incident an ``internal
affair'' of North Ossetia.

Taiwan disturbed by closer U.S.-China ties

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan denounced China on Saturday for
refusing to rule out military action against the island as
President Jiang Zemin ended a summit with U.S. President Bill
Clinton in Beijing.
	   Meanwhile, hundreds of Taiwanese marched through Taipei streets
to express their concern over the Jiang-Clinton meeting. They
carried a banner that read: ``Oppose Superpowers Invading Taiwan's
Sovereignty.''
	   China ``must not downgrade and suppress us or threaten the use
of force against us as it sees fit,'' Vice President Lien Chan
said. Instead, the two sides ``should exert mutual respect and
enhance exchanges,'' he said.
	   But Lien said he was pleased to see the United States did not
backtrack on its commitments to Taiwan at the summit.
	   Clinton simply reaffirmed the U.S. ``one China'' policy, which
would leave Taiwan and China to negotiate over their reunification.
And he encouraged more direct talks between the two sides.
	   Taiwan was relieved that Clinton did not specifically pledge not
to support Taiwan's independence, which would give China more
control over the fate of the island.
	   Speaking on state radio, Lien reiterated Taiwan is seeking
reunification with China but not before the mainland becomes free
and democratic.
	   But Lien cautioned Taiwan must try to avoid leaving the world an
impression that ``we tend to make troubles and tend to move toward
independence.''
	   Taiwan and China split politically in 1949, but China still
claims Taiwan a breakaway province to be reunified with it, by
force if necessary.
	   Analysts said with its improved ties with Washington, Beijing
could gain more leverage on its effort to suppress Taiwan's
campaign to gain international recognition.
	   Washington cut diplomatic relations in 1979 with Taiwan in order
to recognize China. But unofficial ties remain close, and
Washington is bound by law to ensure Taiwan can defend itself.
	   But many American scholars and former administration officials
have favored China, and see Taiwan as an obstacle to improved
U.S.-China ties.

Top Egyptian actor defies Algerian militants 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A popular Egyptian actor will defy Islamic
militants in Algeria by taking his play about a dictator overthrown
by his own people to that country, a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   Adel Imam said that proceeds from his week-long performance of
``Al-Zaeem'' or ``The Leader,'' will go to victims of the six-year
war between Islamic militants and security forces in Algeria, the
London-based al-Hayat newspaper reported.
	   Putting the show on in Algeria itself highlights how extremism
kills hope and free thought, the newspaper quoted Imam as saying.
The performance will be held at the invitation of the Algerian
government.
	   Algeria's Muslim extremists have often targeted artists and
intellectuals in their campaign for an Islamic state.
	   An estimated 75,000 people have been killed in the insurgency,
which began after the military-backed government canceled 1992
elections that the Islamic Salvation Front was poised to win.
	   Imam challenged Muslim militants in Egypt in 1988 when he staged
his play ``Al-Wad Sayed Al-Shaghal'' or ``Sayed, the Servant Boy,''
in the southern province of Assiut, then a stronghold of Muslim
militants.

Hingis reaches final 16; former champion Martinez out AP Sports Writer

Eds: LEADS with Hingis reaching final 16, Martinez out; trims
By STEPHEN WADE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Defending champion Martina Hingis
moved into the final 16 at Wimbledon with a 6-2, 6-1 victory
Saturday over unseeded Elena Likhovtseva of Russia.
	   After struggling in her first two victories, this one on Centre
Court was as comfortable as the scare England sunshine that greeted
the opening of play Saturday.
	   But it wasn't as bright for former champion and eighth seed
Conchita Martinez, who was knocked out in the third round by
Britain's Sam Smith 2-6, 6-3, 7-5 in a match continued from Friday.
	   The 26-year-old Smith became the first British woman to reach
the fourth round since two managed the feat 13 years ago.
	   The Spaniard joined seven-time champion Steffi Graff _ upset in
two sets Friday by Natasha Zvereva _ as only the second of the top
eight seeded women to lose.
	   Graf, seeded No. 4 and playing only her fifth tournament in a
year filled by knee surgery and other nagging injuries, fell to a
player she'd beaten in all 17 previous matches.
	   Zvereva of Belarus, known mostly as a doubles player _ won with
the ``best match of my life,'' she said.
	   The 29-year-old Graf fended off questions about her future and
waved politely as she left Centre Court. It's match to match now,
she said, and she hedged whether she'd return to Wimbledon.
	   ``That's another year right now,'' said Graf, whose 21 Grand
Slams stand her No. 2 behind Australian Margaret Court.
	   ``I definitely couldn't say right now. It would be nice to play
again. Hopefully, I'd be different, in different shape and enjoy
myself. But I've learned enough to take what's coming up next.''
	   Graf was upbeat after the loss, contrasted with the scene after
her first match Monday when she broke down crying _ overcome by
being back at Wimbledon after missing last year.
	   It was only Graf's sixth singles defeat at Wimbledon since she
made her first appearance in 1984 at the age of 15. She had lost
only twice at Wimbledon since 1988.
	   Graf struggled from the beginning in the rain-delayed match on
Centre Court. She double faulted six times, returned poorly and was
often a step behind Zvereva's change-of-pace shots.
	   ``For some reason I can't find the confidence playing out there
when I know I've played so few tournaments,'' Graf said. ``I
haven't been really very relaxed the last few days.
	   Graf's 17-0 record against Zvereva had been one of the most
lopsided in tennis including a 6-0, 6-0 hammering of Zvereva in the
1988 French Open final. Zvereva never recovered as a singles player
but has won 18 Grand Slam doubles titles.
	   Friday was the fifth day of Wimbledon and the third cut short by
on-and-off light showers with only a dozen singles matches
completed.
	   In other results, second-seeded Lindsay Davenport moved into the
fourth round with a 6-3, 1-6, 6-2 victory over Maria Alejandra
Vento, while No. 6 Monica Seles was leading Yayuk Basuki 6-2 when
the match was suspended.
	   Among the men, No. 6 Patrick Rafter advanced to the round of 16
by beating Magnus Gustafsson, 6-3, 6-7 (7-9), 6-2, 6-1. No. 14
Goran Ivanisevic completed a 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 6-0 third-round
win over Andrei Medvedev.
	   Defending champion and top seed Pete Sampras never got on court
for a testing third-round match against Sweden's Thomas Enqvist.

Magazine: Driver stopped train due to noise before accident in Germany 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ The driver and a conductor of the
high-speed train that crashed June 3 in northern Germany, killing
100 people, heard a grinding noise more than two hours before the
accident, a newsmagazine reported Saturday.
	   The train was stopped for 3 1-2 minutes between stations and the
two railroad employees, suspecting a transmission defect, checked
the train but found nothing wrong, Munich-based Focus said.
	   The magazine quoted unidentified sources in the border agency,
which is involved in the investigation into the derailment and
crash of InterCity Express 884, postwar Germany's worst train
disaster.
	   Prosecutors directing the probe, based in Celle, Lower Saxony,
declined to confirm the report Saturday, and the Deutsche Bahn
railroad had no comment.
	   Chief prosecutor Siegrid Kindervater said many reported
incidents have turned out to have no connection with the accident.
``This could also be the case here,'' she added.
	   Focus, in an advance of its report to appear in Monday's
edition, said Deutsche Bahn told investigators that the train was
halted, but only to pick up an extra conductor.
	   Heinz-Juergen Fischer, head of the investigation commission, was
quoted by Focus as saying it would be unusual to stop between
stations, and that details of the halt need to be cleared up.
	   Investigators have said the derailment at Eschede, 50 kilometers
(30 miles) north of Hanover, probably was caused by a wheel
failure, though they have not determined why the wheel failed.
	   A steel tire that encased the wheel and helped keep it on the
track broke off about six kilometers (3.7 miles) from the accident
scene and embedded in the train's undercarriage, investigators say.
The train later derailed, jack-knifed and crashed into the concrete
supports of an overpass.
	   Surviving passengers have reported hearing a grinding noise
minutes before the crash.

	   Beye, of Mali, had been working to advance the peace process in
Algeria, which has been torn by civil war since gaining
independence from Portugal in 1975.
	   Under a 1994 peace agreement, the rebel movement known as UNITA
agreed to return the 50 percent of the country it seized during
nearly two decades of war.
	   UNITA, known by the Portuguese acronym for the National Union

U.N. envoy's plane disappears en route to Ivory Coast

<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ A chartered plane carrying the U.N.
envoy to Angola disappeared en route to the Ivory Coast from Togo,
airport sources in Abidjan said Saturday.
	   Alioune Blondin Beye left Lome, Togo on Friday night in a small
Beechcraft 200 plane after meeting with Togolese President
Gnassigbe Eyadema in an effort to win support for his efforts to
advance the peace process in Angola.
	   An airport source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
contact with the plane was lost sometime after takeoff.
	   The source could not say whether or not the Beechcraft crashed,
but said a search had been launched and officials were operating on
the belief that it had gone down.
	   Blondin Beye has been traveling through African trying to get
support for the troubled peace process in Angola.
	   The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday agreed to give Angola's
UNITA movement five more days to comply with terms of a peace plan
after receiving assurances from the former rebels that they would
meet the new deadline.
	   Under the U.N.-brokered 1994 peace pact, UNITA _ a Portuguese
acronym for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
_ agreed to relinquish its control over more than half of the
country it seized during the two-decade-old civil war.
	   War first broke out after the country's 1975 independence from
Portugal.

	   LENS, France (AP) _ ``Is there a war in France?'' Matthew, a
young English fan asked early Saturday, as rows of riot police
armed with rubber bullets and tear gas watched the crowds after a
high-risk World Cup match attended by Prince Charles.
	   ``It really wasn't worth the trouble to bring all that out,'' he
said. ``The only problems you risk having are drunken guys angry
about getting that kind of police reception.''
	   But after repeated violence since the five-week soccer
championship began June 10, police took no chances in this town on
the Belgian border. It was feared Friday's England-Colombia match
would draw hooligans from England and competing toughs from Germany
who shook Lens last Sunday.
	   As a result, heavy police presence, a strict alcohol ban and
tougher border checks that turned away suspected hooligans appeared
to do the trick. England's 2-1 victory, and the presence of
royalty, likely had a calming effect as well.
	   Shops in Lens closed early, giant outdoor World Cup screens were
taken down and bars served non-alcoholic drinks as about 2,000
police stood ready as surveillance helicopters hovered overhead.
	   The tactics were likely to be repeated around Tuesday night's
match between England and Argentina in Saint-Etienne, in
east-central France near Lyon. The two countries fought a war over
the Falkland Islands in 1982.
	   ``Everything will be done to ensure peace for the spectators,''
Sepp Blatter, head of the international soccer federation FIFA,
said Saturday. He said English and Argentine police were working
with French authorities, who so far ``have not identified one
hooligan among the Argentines.''
	   Scattered clashes broke out in Lens Friday afternoon between
police and English fans, many of them already drunk after arriving
by train from nearby Lille, where no alcohol restrictions were
imposed. Many brought beer with them that police confiscated.
	   In nearby Lille, meanwhile, Lens-bound English fans clashed with
local North African French youths. Police boosted their forces
there to face crowds after the match.
	   Police arrested about 50 fans in Lens and a dozen people in
Lille, half of those local youths, officials said. Britain's
Foreign office reported Saturday that a total of 74 English
nationals were detained in northern France on Friday.
	   About 100 people, mostly drunken English soccer fans en route to
the match, were arrested in clashes overnight Thursday in northern
France and neighboring Belgium, police said.
	   Many suspect English nationals never made it to Lens. French
authorities reported turning away 400 of them who arrived Friday at
Calais, Lille airport and train station, and at the Belgian border.
	   Nevertheless, the high number of drunken English fans in this
town of 35,000 kept tensions high ahead of the evening match.
Prince Charles and his son, Prince Harry, were in a VIP box at the
heavily guarded stadium packed with 41,000 fans.
	   After the match, sending England to the round before the
quarterfinals, fans chanting ``England, England'' danced in the
streets. No clashes were reported.
	   It was strikingly different scene from Lens last Sunday, when
rioting by German thugs left a French policeman in a coma.
	   The newspaper Le Monde on Thursday cited an intelligence memo as
saying German extremists planned to travel to Lens ``to combat the
English enemy and try to gain the title of `best hooligans of
Europe.'''
	   But the prediction didn't materialize. German authorities had
stepped up border checks of France-bound travelers, turning back a
number of suspected hooligans.
	   Clashes outside several of the World Cup's 10 stadium across
France have left more than 100 injured. Authorities have detained
about 600 people and deported a number of English and German
hooligans.

	   MAGNY COURS, France (AP) - Mika Hakkinen held up against a
Ferrari challenge by edging Michael Schumacher for the pole
position Saturday in the qualifications for the French Grand Prix.
	   Hakkinen in a McLaren-Mercedes did 1 minute, 14.929 seconds on
the 4.25-kilometer (2.641-mile) Magny Cours circuit to average
204.193 kph (126.91 mph).
	   It was the sixth pole position of his career, fifth this season.
	   The previous four times he started from pole position this
season he won the race.
	   Schumacher did 1:15.159 in his Ferrari ahead of Hakkinen's
McLaren teammate, David Coulthard, 1:15.333.
	   Schumacher's Ferrari teammate Eddie Irvine was fourth in
1:15.527.
	   Hakkinen and Coulthard had been dominating qualifications this
year with Schumacher coming between them only twice.
	   The last time Schumacher split the McLarens, Schumacher went on
to win the race in Argentina.
	   Schumacher, a two-time Formula One champion, enters Sunday's
72-lap race on a roll. In addition to the Canadian Grand Prix
victory three weeks ago, he has won three of the last four French
races here.
	   Jacques Villeneuve, last year's Formula One champion, was fifth
in 1:15.630 in a Williams-Mecachrome. Villeneuve beat Schumacher
for the title in the last of of the 1997 season.
	   Sunday's French Grand Prix is the eighth race of the Formula One
series and begins a hectic period with four races over the next
five weeks.
	   Hakkinen, with 46 points, has a 12-point advantage over
Schumacher. Coulthard is third with 29 in the driver's standings.

Ulster Unionists coming out on top in Belfast Assembly election 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Northern Ireland's major
pro-British Protestant party expects to win just enough seats in
the new cross-community government to help implement the Belfast
peace agreement, according to latest election results Saturday.
	   About 20 seats remained up for grabs following Thursday's
election to the 108-member Belfast Assembly, the legislature that
must nominate Protestant and Catholic members to govern this
divided land after 26 years of ``direct rule'' from London.
	   David Trimble's Ulster Unionists, split over his support for
April's compromise agreement involving seven other parties, were
being projected to win 28 or 29 seats despite scoring their lowest
share of the vote _ 21.3 percent _ in Northern Ireland's 77-year
existence.
	   ``I knew there were going to be problems, that it was going to
be a bumpy journey. We've come over the bumps and we're still on
the road,'' said Trimble, who is likely to head the new multi-party
administration appointed by the Assembly.
	   With the final results expected Saturday evening, political
analysts agreed that Protestant hard-liners would fall at least one
seat short of forming a clear-cut obstructionist bloc in the
Assembly, whose decisions must be approved by majorities of both
its Protestant and Catholic members.
	   The Progressive Unionist Party, which represents an outlawed
pro-British paramilitary group, was expected to win seats in
Belfast for its two high-profile negotiators. David Ervine and
Billy Hutchinson, both paroled prisoners, will provide valuable
voting insurance for Trimble in the Assembly, since they
enthusiastically back the agreement.
	   But Trimble will remain supremely vulnerable to defections from
within his ranks on controversial votes.
	   In a shot at his many Protestant critics inside and outside his
party, he accused them of trying ``to throw away the greatest
opportunity that unionism has had in 26 years to exercise power
again within our own land.''
	   The two parties opposed to sharing power with the north's rising
Catholic minority _ Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists and Bob
McCartney's United Kingdom Unionists _ appeared on course to win 26
or 27 seats.
	   They will be joined by two political independents, both former
Ulster Unionist activists who ran on anti-Trimble tickets. One,
Denis Watson, is from Trimble's home constituency and a senior
member of the Protestant fraternal group the Orange Order.
	   Northern Ireland's rival wings of Catholic opinion, both of
which support the accord, broke personal records in Thursday's
election.
	   John Hume, the moderate Catholic architect of the successful
negotiations, saw his Social Democratic and Labor Party collect
more votes than the Ulster Unionists for the first time since the
SDLP's foundation in 1970. His 22 percent share of votes was
expected to deliver 25 seats.
	   The SDLP has actually scored higher percentages in previous
elections. Topping the poll this time owed more to the fractured
voting pattern on the Protestant side.
	   But it still carried powerful symbolic weight, since the Ulster
Unionists were instrumental in founding Northern Ireland
specifically to create a Protestant-majority state.
	   Meanwhile the SDLP's militant rival for Catholic votes, the
IRA-allied Sinn Fein party, received 17.6 percent, its highest-ever
share of the vote since first contesting elections in 1982. The
performance, buoyed by popular support for the Irish Republican
Army's 11-month-old truce, put Sinn Fein on course to take 18
seats.
	   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, who topped the poll in Catholic
west Belfast and carried three colleagues there with him to
victory, said he expected Sinn Fein's support should translate into
two seats in the new 12-member administration.
	   That prospect drove many Protestants to back Paisley's party
rather than Trimble, who has insisted he won't cooperate with Sinn
Fein unless the IRA starts disarming.
	   The Belfast agreement requires the IRA and the two pro-British
paramilitary groups observing truces, the Ulster Defense
Association and Ulster Volunteer Force, to start disarming _
otherwise their affiliated politicians could be expelled from the
Assembly.
	   While the UVF's Progressive Unionists will have two Assembly
members, none of the UDA-linked Ulster Democratic Party's
candidates were elected.
	   Some observers worried this outcome _ a product of the many
factions splitting the Protestant vote _ would encourage dissent
within the UDA, which like the UVF stopped its campaign of slaying
Catholics in 1994 in hopes of pursuing politics.

Clinton and Jiang debate human rights, announce agreements agreements, including detargeting; trims at bottom. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Grafs 4-8 NEW with toasts at state dinner, detail on
By LAURA MYERS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton and Chinese President
Jiang Zemin engaged in a spirited, televised debate Saturday over
human rights and the Tiananmen Square crackdown, and announced a
string of agreements on arms control, energy and environmental
matters.
	   There were no announced breakthroughs on American human rights
concerns, including Tibet, but both leaders accentuated the
positive side of an evolving U.S.-China relationship even as they
made clear they won't shy away from disagreements.
	   Clinton praised Jiang's government for resisting pressure to
devalue its currency, a move many fear would worsen Asia's
financial crisis. But they could not agree on terms to allow China
entry into the World Trade Organization, which sets global trade
rules.
	   The two nations agreed to stop targeting nuclear missiles at one
another, a symbolic gesture since missiles can be retargeted in a
matter of minutes. But Jiang said it ``demonstrates the United
States and China are partners, not adversaries.''
	   In other agreements, China and the United States pledged to
intensify cooperation on clean energy and monitoring of greenhouse
gas emissions believed to contribute to global warming.
	   In formal toasts at a state dinner Saturday, the presidents
cited Chinese sayings.
	   ``An ancient Chinese proverb tells us, `Be not afraid of growing
slowly, be only afraid of standing still,''' Clinton said.
	   Jiang quoted the Chinese sage, Mencius, who counseled, ``A good
citizen of the world will befriend the other citizens of the
world.''
	   It was clear that the most sensitive issues were human rights
and the continuing controversy over China's decision, nine years
ago this month, to use force in putting down student-led democracy
demonstrations in Tiananmen Square.
	   ``It is important that whatever our disagreements over past
action, China and the United States must go forward on the right
side of history for the future sake of the world,'' Clinton said at
a joint news conference with Jiang after two hours of talks at the
Great Hall of the People.
	   Later Clinton held talks over lunch with Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji. Clinton aides said Zhu reassured Clinton of his
government's firm resolve not to devalue the Chinese currency, and
they agreed Zhu would pay an official visit to Washington.
	   In an animated manner, Jiang said the fact that the U.S. and
Chinese leaders can disagree publicly is a healthy sign for
relations.
	   ``I think President Clinton is a strong defender of the American
interest, and I am a strong defender of the Chinese interest,''
Jiang said. ``But despite that, we still can have very friendly
exchanges of views and discussion. And I think that is democracy.''
	   The summit began with a short, solemn welcoming ceremony outside
the Great Hall of the People at the edge of Tiananmen Square. It
was a spectacle Clinton's critics said he should have avoided in
memory of hundreds of pro-democracy students and other
demonstrators killed by the Chinese military on surrounding streets
during the 1989 crackdown.
	   Clinton reviewed Chinese troops and received a 21-gun salute,
the cannon fire echoing across the vast square, site of pro- and
anti-government demonstrations throughout Chinese history. It was
here that Mao Tse-tung celebrated the victory of his communist
government in 1949.
	   At the joint news conference, which White House officials said
was broadcast live across China, including into Tibet, Clinton
directly addressed the Tiananmen crackdown.
	   ``For all of our agreements, we still disagree about the meaning
of what happened then,'' Clinton said. ``I believe and the American
people believe that the use of force and the tragic loss of life
was wrong.''
	   Jiang, countering with the long-standing Chinese response, said
the crackdown was necessary to maintain order and ensure a smooth
transition from a still-developing nation to a modern-day economic
force.
	   ``Had the Chinese government not taken the resolute measures,
then we could not have enjoyed the stability that we are enjoying
today,'' he told Clinton during the freewheeling 70-minute exchange
reminiscent of their October summit in Washington where Clinton
said China was ``on the wrong side of history.''
	   Jiang appeared relaxed, sometimes laughing and smiling. Clinton,
who appeared tense when he first brought up Tiananmen, also seemed
to relish the exchange. ``I think this debate and discussion today
has been a healthy thing and a good thing,'' he said.
	   The Chinese president didn't appear upset when Clinton
complained about the detaining of dissidents during his visit and
called on China to release political prisoners, including those
from 1989.
	   ``In China we have our laws,'' Jiang said bluntly.
	   He told Clinton that although their countries have different
social systems, ideologies, values and cultural traditions, ``they
should not become the obstacles in the way of the growth of
China-U.S. relations.''
	   Aides to Clinton said they were pleased by the summit,
especially China's decision to broadcast the post-summit news
conference. Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, said
it was the first time such a news event had been broadcast live in
China.
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said the
broadcast ``shows we have adopted an open attitude'' in welcoming
Clinton.

New Swiss Guards sworn in at Vatican Sunday 
</HEADLINE>
By DANIEL J. WAKIN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II evoked the recent slaying
of the Swiss Guard commander as a ``source of suffering'' a day
before the latest crop of recruits to the force were to be sworn in
Sunday.
	   The austere ceremony, where recruits raise three fingers and
shout out their allegiance to the pontiff, was to have taken place
May 6.
	   But the 37 new guards members that day were called to sadder
duty: the funeral of their just-named commander, Alois Estermann
and his wife Gladys Meza Romero.
	   The couple were found dead of gunshot wounds in their apartment
inside the Vatican walls. Laying next to them was the body of guard
member Cedric Tornay, whom the Vatican said killed the couple and
himself in a fit of madness.
	   ``We cannot forget today those who have recently left us, in the
course of a tragedy that remains for us a source of suffering, but
which also is a call to live faithful to the Lord and to be
attentive to those around us,'' the pope said Saturday in greeting
the recruits and their families in the Vatican.
	   The 100 members of the corps provide ceremonial guard duty,
assist at Vatican functions and provide protection for the pontiff.
Their halberds, crimson-plumed helmets and gold and blue uniforms
designed by Michelangelo are familiar to the millions of visitors
to the Vatican.
	   ``The great family of the Swiss Guard must continue its mission:
its history and generosity are a witness before the eyes of
Catholics and all nations,'' John Paul said.
	   Pope Julius II founded the corp in 1506 because he was so
impressed by the bravery of Swiss mercenaries. In 1527, 147 Swiss
Guards died protecting Pope Clement VII when the troops of Emperor
Charles V sacked Rome.
	   The traditional swearing-in day, May 6, marks the anniversary of
the bloody sacrifice.
	   Members of the corps who have joined during the previous year
take part in the swearing-in, shouting out the oath before their
commander.
	   This year, it will be interim commander Roland Buchs. The pope
has appointed Pius Segmueller, a Swiss army colonel, to succeed
Estermann. Segmueller is expected to arrive in August.
	   After a Mass, the private ceremony takes place before the
monument to fallen guardsmen in the Courtyard of Honor inside the
Vatican.

	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ A chartered plane carrying the U.N.
envoy to Angola disappeared en route to the Ivory Coast from Togo,
airport sources in Abidjan said Saturday.
	   Togolese Foreign Minister Koffi Panou said from Lome, Togo that
the plane was believed to have crashed into the sea shortly before
landing in Abidjan.
	   Alioune Blondin Beye left Lome on Friday night in a small
Beechcraft 200 plane after meeting with Togolese President
Gnassigbe Eyadema in an effort to win support for his efforts to
advance the peace process in Angola.
	   An airport source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
contact with the plane was lost sometime after takeoff.
	   The source could not say whether or not the Beechcraft crashed,
but said a search had been launched and officials were operating on
the belief that it had gone down.
	   Beye, who is from the West African nation of Mali, has been
traveling through African trying to get support for the troubled
peace process in Angola.

India can take care of economic sanctions, say scientists 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ India's top scientists said Saturday that
the country was quite capable of meeting the challenge posed by
U.S. economic sanctions imposed after India's nuclear tests in May.
	   ``We must get our act together,'' R. Chidambaram, chairman of
India's Atomic Energy Commission told students, teachers and
scientists at an awards function in Bombay, India's financial
capital. ``We need extensive co-operation between science,
technology, universities and industry.''
	   A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, scientific adviser to India's defense
minister, said Indian scientists had built a supercomputer that was
20 times faster than U.S.-made computers.
	   ``This could be used to design missiles or electronic warfare
systems. They are ready for export and we can sell at half the
cost,'' said Kalam.
	   The United States banned the export of high technology equipment
to India, including supercomputers and guidance technology for
missiles, years before India carried out five nuclear tests in May.
India first tested a nuclear device in 1974.
	   The United States, Germany, Japan and several other nations
imposed economic sanctions on India after its latest nuclear tests.
	   Kalam said the supercomputers made in India were used for the
nuclear system designs for the May tests.
	   The two scientists reiterated India's announcement of a
moratorium on nuclear testing. ``The yields were exactly as
calculated. Nuclear weapons are unlikely to be used. They are for
deterrence so nobody can think of using weapons against us,'' said
Chidambaram.
	   The scientists were congratulated by a local education trust as
part of India's 50th independence anniversary celebrations.

Portuguese mull over their vote on eve of abortion referendum 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The Portuguese electorate observed an
official ``day of contemplation'' on Saturday, the eve of a
referendum on whether to allow abortions on demand through the 10th
week of pregnancy.
	   The two-week campaign leading up to Portugal's first-ever
national referendum has deeply split this predominantly Roman
Catholic country asked to decide if abortion up to 10 weeks after
conception should be ''decriminalized.''
	   Parliament approved a bill relaxing abortion restrictions in
February, but opponents successfully pushed for a national ballot
on whether to overturn or ratify the legislation.
	   The campaign, that ended Friday, featured marches in major
cities and a nationwide media blitz.
	   Under existing law, women can be imprisoned for up to three
years for having an illegal abortion. Termination of pregnancy is
permitted only through the 12th week and only for strictly defined
medical reasons or in cases of rape.
	   Pro-abortion activists estimate there are at least 16,000
illegal abortions each year in Portugal, a nation of 9.5 million
people.
	   Government statistics indicate that each year about 10,000 women
are treated at hospitals following botched illegal abortions that
are the second-most common cause of maternal deaths and the main
cause of adolescent maternal deaths.
	   The anti-abortion campaign was spearheaded by the influential
Roman Catholic Church.
	   The result will be binding only if more than half of registered
voters participate.

World Cup: FIFA chief blasts violent fans, defends referees at World Cup AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By LARRY SIDDONS
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Soccer's boss condemned the thugs who have
surrounded the World Cup with street violence, saying Saturday they
were closer to mad bombers than misdirected fans.
	   FIFA president Sepp Blatter said the attacks on police and local
residents outside matches involving teams from England and Germany
were appalling reminders that even the world's biggest sports event
can't escape the world's ills.
	   While the street fights and cafe bashing by English fans over
three days in Marseille was the longest incident, Blatter expressed
special contempt for Germans who rampaged through the northern city
of Lens last week, leaving a police officer in a coma.
	   ``We have seen the incidents in Marseille and the extremely
serious incidents in Lens. They were closer to acts of terrorism
than acts of hooliganism,'' Blatter said. ``This violence is not of
football, it is of society as a whole. These people use the World
Cup as a launching pad.''
	   The newly elected head of soccer's world body praised French
authorities for their efforts to combat the violence and said the
games themselves had been free of fan troubles in the stadiums
through the first round, which ended Friday.
	   ``I hope this is what we will see from now on, with no more
individuals disrupting the event,'' Blatter said. ``I hope we will
have the same joy and enthusiasm in the stadiums that we have
had.''
	   In a 90-minute news conference, Blatter also:
	   _Defended World Cup referees against criticism of inconsistency
and incompetence. ``Leave the referees alone!'' he said. ``Leave
them to do their work, and they will do it properly.''
	   Blatter said regional soccer leaders from Africa who complained
their teams were victims of racial bias by officials should
concentrate instead on getting their players ready for
international matches. ``The decisions made must be accepted in a
sporting spirit,'' he said.
	   _Praised the level of play so far in the Cup, and predicted
there would be ``no miracles this time'' when the champion is
crowned July 12. He said he was most surprised by the play of
Paraguay, one of five Latin American teams to reach the round of
16.
	   _Encouraged African countries to come up with solid, detailed
plans for staging the World Cup in 2006. But he stopped short of
endorsing any of the African bids _ from Nigeria, Egypt, South
Africa and Morocco _ in the race.
	   _Sympathized with fans who had been duped in ticket scams but
said FIFA could do nothing to help, not even in cases involving one
of its licensed ticket outlets, Prime Sports International. The
president of the U.S.-based company, Douglas Knittle, has been
placed under investigation by French authorities for alleged fraud
involving some 15,000 missing tickets, judicial sources said.
	   _Announced a special meeting of FIFA's executive board next
month in Paris to start installing the pieces of his new regime,
including a restructuring of management to put the president and
board more in control of federation policy. The July 9 meeting also
will mark the start of the search for a successor to Blatter as
general secretary, an area Blatter said was a ``huge
questionmark.''
	   Violence by fans has followed soccer for decades, most
prevalently in Europe, where the instigators have become known as
hooligans. English and German groups are the most notorious and
grabbed the spotlight with their World Cup rampages.
	   On Friday night, however, a police show of force in Lens kept
order among some 30,000 English supporters after their team's 2-0
victory over Colombia. There were scattered troubles but nothing
like the earlier cases and Blatter said he was certain that calm
would continue when England meets Argentina in the second round
Tuesday in Saint-Etienne, a match with a history of political and
sports flashpoints.
	   ``We are very positive,'' he said. ``The police of the two
countries already have met. They want to make sure it will be a
football festival, not a stage for a bunch of hooligans. Everything
will be done to make certain the spectators can watch the game in
peace.''
	   Britain and Argentina fought a war in the early 1980s over the
Falkland Islands and reports before the Cup started said any
meeting between the teams could be a target for hooligans. There
also is lingering bitterness over the 1986 tournament, when
Argentina eliminated England with the help of Diego Maradona's
``hand of God'' goal.
	   Blatter also said that, as serious as the violence has been, it
would have no impact on the bids of England or Germany to hold the
World Cup in 2006.
	   ``That decision will not be taken until 2000, and it will partly
depend on the situation with hooligans in those countries then,''
he said.

	   VENICE, Italy (AP) _ Fire broke out on a scaffolding and lightly
damaged an 18th century church in Venice Saturday, a news agency
reported.
	   Firefighters put out the blaze quickly before it could spread to
the artworks and relics inside the church of San Geremia, the ANSA
agency said. Volunteers carried objects outside.
	   Doorway and window cornices were slightly damaged, ANSA said. No
injuries were reported.
	   The fire was a reminder of the vulnerability of the aged
buildings in this city of canals. A blaze in January 1996 gutted
the city's historic opera house, La Fenice.

<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ A chartered plane carrying the U.N.
envoy to Angola disappeared en route to the Ivory Coast from Togo,
airport sources in Abidjan said Saturday.
	   Togolese Foreign Minister Koffi Panou said from Lome, Togo that
the plane was believed to have crashed into the sea Friday night
shortly before landing in Abidjan.
	   Alioune Blondin Beye left Lome on Friday night in a small
Beechcraft 200 after meeting with Togolese President Gnassigbe
Eyadema in an effort to win support for his efforts to advance the
peace process in Angola.
	   An airport source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
contact with the plane was lost sometime after takeoff.
	   The source could not say whether the Beechcraft had crashed, but
said a search had been launched and officials were operating on the
belief that it had gone down.
	   Ivorian and French teams were searching for the plane, with the
office of the American defense attache in Abidjan working in a
support role, Western diplomats said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Beye, who is from the West African nation of Mali, has been
traveling through African trying to get support for the troubled
peace process in Angola.
	   Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali appointed Beye special
representative for Angola in 1993. Since October of that year he
has been mediating the Angolan peace process from his base in
Lusaka, Zambia.
	   Beye, 59, threatened to resign from his post last month, saying
the Angolan government and former rebel movement UNITA lacked the
``political will'' to see the peace process to its conclusion.
	   The U.N. Security Council agreed Wednesday to give Angola's
UNITA movement five more days to comply with terms of a peace plan
after receiving assurances from the former rebels that they would
meet the new deadline.
	   Under the U.N.-brokered 1994 peace pact, UNITA, a Portuguese
acronym for the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola, agreed to relinquish its control over more than half of the
country it seized during the two-decade civil war.
	   War broke out after the country's 1975 independence from
Portugal.
	   Before being named the UN envoy, Beye had served in a number of
posts in the Malian cabinet, including foreign minister, and has
been the legal counsel to the Malian president. He has also been on
the faculty of universities in France and Mali.
	   He is married and has 4 children.

Israel shuts down Palestinian security firm in Jerusalem 
</HEADLINE>
By IMAD MUSA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A private Palestinian security firm in east
Jerusalem was shut down by Israeli police after less than a month
in operation, police and company officials said Saturday.
	   Jerusalem Security Services was opened at the beginning of June
by Abdul Razzaq Ghazzawi, a former Israeli police officer, to fill
the law enforcement in Arab neighborhoods of east Jerusalem, where
Palestinian police are not allowed to operate and Israeli police
have only a small presence.
	   On June 18, Ghazzawi was detained by Israeli police for a few
hours and ordered to shut the company down.
	   Israeli police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby said the company did
not have the necessary permits from various Israeli ministries, the
Jerusalem municipality and the police.
	   But Ghazzawi's partner, Jamal Obeido, said the company had
gotten all the permits it was told it needed.
	   ``They are turning this into a political battle,'' he said.
	   Ghazzawi said that during his interrogation, police accused the
company of having links to the Palestinian Authority, which he
denied. Ben-Ruby said police had found no relationship between the
company and the Palestinian Authority.
	   The Israel-Palestinian peace agreements bar the Palestinian
Authority from operating in Jerusalem, which the Palestinians claim
as a future capital. The city's status is supposed to be determined
in negotiations on a final peace settlement.
	   Ghazzawi said he would try to reopen the security firm soon.
	   Jerusalem Security Services hired 25 men and armed them with
batons and mace to patrol the streets of Jerusalem's Arab
neighborhoods at night. Hundreds of shopkeepers paid 50 shekels
(dlrs 14) each for the service.
	   ``There is huge demand for our service,'' Obeido said. ``We took
a bite out of crime.''

German officials believe the euro will draw more crime 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Federal crime officials believe the
common European currency planned for next year will spur an
increase in robbery and counterfeiting, a magazine reported Monday.
	   The federal crime agency, based in Wiesbaden, believes criminals
will be attracted to the prospect of having money, real or fake,
that can be used throughout Europe.
	   The officials expect an increase in counterfeiting and in
robberies of banks and armored cars that deliver money, the
Munich-based Focus said in an advance of a report to appear in its
Monday edition.
	   The euro is to be introduced by 11 European nations including
Germany next January, when exchange rates among their national
currencies will be locked together.
	   The euro bills and coins don't go into circulation until 2002,
but officials believe criminals already are at work counterfeiting
the new money.
	   Equipment designed to stamp a difficult-to-reproduce hologram on
euro bills disappeared during a delivery last month from Paris to
Munich, and investigators said at the time they believed it was the
work of a counterfeiting band.

World Cup: End of an era for South American side 
</HEADLINE>
By JAIRO ANCHIQUE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ Colombia's uneven run in the World Cup has
come to an unceremonious finish and with it the end of a brilliant
but often stormy era.
	   Head coach Hernan Dario Gomez and several players who for years
were mainstays in one of Latin America's top teams have announced
they're leaving the national team.
	   After several years of top-flight soccer under Francisco
Maturana and Gomez, his pupil, Colombia is in for a revamping.
	   Gomez, a veteran of two World Cups assisting Maturana before
becoming head coach, says the team needs ``a new course and fresh
ideas.''
	   Veteran midfielders Carlos Valderrama and Freddy Rincon are
stepping aside, and striker Faustino Asprilla's future is uncertain
following his dismissal for criticizing his coach and teammates.
	   Colombia came to France hoping to improve on a disastrous
first-round elimination in the United States in 1994. But a weak
attack, internal turmoil and age wiped out those dreams.
	   Four years ago, the team suffered a 3-1 loss to Romania in its
first match and was eliminated with a shattering 2-1 defeat by the
United States. A few days after the team arrived home in Colombia,
defender Andres Escobar was dead, shot for having scored an own
goal in the U.S. game.
	   In France, Colombia's collapse again began with a loss to
Romania, this time by 1-0 in both teams' first match.
	   But even before the team arrived in France there were rumblings
that grew to a roar by the time Colombia was eliminated Friday
night with a 2-0 loss to England.
	   Furious at being benched five minutes from the finish against
Romania, striker Asprilla criticized Gomez and some of his
teammates. The Parma forward blasted the coach for ``favoring
untouchable'' players, such as the slow-footed Valderrama, 37.
	   Gomez responded by kicking Asprilla out of the team the
following day. But Colombia was unable to recover from the turmoil
or the lack of firepower, gaining only a difficult 1-0 win against
lowly Tunisia in its second match, before losing to England.
	   ``We lost against two strong teams. We beat Tunisia and we
finished where we deserved,'' Gomez said. ``That's the reality of
Colombian soccer.''
	   Now, Colombia must start anew.
	   ``I'll step aside so that someone else may reap what has been
sowed in the past ten years, may fix what's wrong and reach for
better things. I did all I could,'' Gomez said after Friday's match
against England. ``It's up to others to lay out a fresh course with
new ideas.''
	   ``Now I'm tired and sad, even sick,'' he added. ``Being in a
World Cup is supposed to be a beautiful experience, but it was
terribly hard because of all the tension and passion that whirl
around a national squad.''

Human rights assailed in Belarus, Slovakia set by source 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Embargoed for publication or broadcast after 1600 GMT, time
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Human rights conditions worsened last
year in several European countries _ dramatically in Belarus and
Slovakia, a watchdog group said Saturday.
	   The annual report by the International Helsinki Federation for
Human Rights was released in conjunction with a commemoration in
Vienna of the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights.
	   Dignitaries attending ceremonies and scheduled to speak at a
forum included U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, former U.S.
President Jimmy Carter, Nobel Peace Prize winner Desmond Tutu and
Russian human rights activist Yelena Bonner.
	   Among 41 countries covered in the human rights report, Belarus
was singled out for trampling rights in several areas, including
freedom of expression and the media, freedom of association, prison
conditions and the judicial system.
	   ``Governmental policies and tactics more and more resembled
those of Stalin, apparently aimed ... at crushing civil society,''
the group said. ``Human rights violations attained massive
dimensions in 1997 and there was no impartial judicial framework in
existence to protect individuals' rights.''
	   Trials against demonstrators revealed ``serious irregularities
in the administration of justice in Belarus,'' and those accused of
a crime were presumed guilty unless proven otherwise, the report
alleged.
	   Increasing numbers of journalists working for independent media
were harassed by police, and ``many journalists were brutally
treated,'' the human rights group said.
	   In Slovakia, the human rights situation deteriorated and was
exacerbated by public apathy, according to the 288-page report.
	   ``The government increased its efforts to influence courts,
including the Supreme Court,'' it said. ``Intolerance and
aggressive state attitudes toward minorities increased; the virtual
absence of reactions against neo-Nazi violence could be read as a
form of tacit approval.''
	   In Albania, conditions improved when a new government took over
following the nation's descent into anarchy in early 1997, and more
political opinions and freedom of expression were allowed. But the
watchdog group said the judicial system remained unprofessional and
corrupt and police violence continued.
	   Refugees and displaced people still found it impossible to
return to their homes in Bosnia, where ethnic harassment and
violence and expulsions continued and the division of the country
into three areas dominated by ethnic majorities deepened.
	   Freedom of expression and of the media were threatened in Russia
by the influence of huge corporations taking over major newspapers
and TV stations, the report said.
	   Police brutality also remained a major problem in most European
countries, the group said.
	   The records of the Helsinki human rights group are now open for
research use, the Open Society Archives announced in Budapest.

Chirac visits HIV-positive mothers at Soweto Hospital 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Chirac's trip to Soweto

By ANDREW SELSKY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SOWETO, South Africa (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac on
Saturday cuddled one baby whose mother is HIV positive and kissed
another, gestures that touched hospital workers battling an AIDS
epidemic.
	   A day after arriving in South Africa, in which he addressed
business leaders and toasted President Mandela and others at a
banquet, Chirac experienced the grittier side of the country.
	   In the sprawling black Soweto township south of Johannesburg, he
visited a memorial to black students gunned down by police in 1976.
	   Holding the hands of two young girls dressed in blue school
jackets and skirts, Chirac viewed photographs at the Hector
Peterson Memorial, set on a traffic circle amid lower middle-class
homes and scrapheaps.
	   Chirac placed a wreath at the memorial, named after the first
student killed in a student uprising against apartheid education
policies, then headed to Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital, where he
visited the ward for HIV-positive mothers.
	   Five mothers and their babies looked on as Chirac wished them
well.
	   ``I hope you will live long lives and that the people taking
care of you can continue doing so,'' Chirac said through an
interpreter.
	   He then greeted each mother. Stopping before a baby girl sitting
on her mother's lap, the French president planted a kiss on her
forehead, then lifted up another baby and cuddled her.
	   The babies have not been tested for HIV yet so it's unknown if
the disease was transmitted from their mothers, as is often the
case.
	   Whether the mothers and their babies can continue receiving care
is as uncertain as whether they will have the longevity Chirac
wished for.
	   The prenatal HIV research unit, funded by the United Nations and
the U.S. National Institutes of Health, gives counseling and,
sometimes, experimental drugs to 500 HIV-positive mothers.
	   The government provides space for the clinic but doesn't have
money to operate it, and the U.N. funds will be depleted in a few
months, said unit co-director James McIntyre.
	   Meanwhile, the number of patients is growing.
	   Every day, three HIV-infected babies are born in Soweto, and 20
percent of the mothers who come to the hospital are HIV positive,
McIntyre said. He hopes Chirac's visit will lead the French
government to help fund the unit.
	   Chirac later was to fly to Cape Town where he would meet with
retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu, head of the government's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission, which is probing apartheid-era abuses
and can give amnesty to those who make full confessions.
	   He began his six-day African trip in Namibia, and on Sunday
travels to Mozambique. He ends the trip with a stop in Angola.

Pope reminds U.S. bishops on moral bans in Catholic hospitals 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II issued a stern reminder to
a group of American bishops Saturday that carrying out abortions,
sterilization or euthanasia in Catholic hospitals is a ``grievous
sin.''
	   He recalled the church's ``absolute prohibition'' on such
procedures and described the ban as an ``expression (of) the
universal moral law inscribed on the human heart.''
	   The Vatican released the pope's remarks to prelates from Texas,
Oklahoma and Arkansas.
	   ``As bishops you must remind everyone involved -- hospital
administrators and medical personnel -- that any failure to comply
with this prohibition is both a grievous sin and source of
scandal,'' John Paul said.

Portuguese mull over their vote on eve of abortion referendum 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The Portuguese electorate observed an
official ``day of contemplation'' on Saturday, the eve of a
referendum on whether to allow abortions on demand through the 10th
week of pregnancy.
	   The two-week campaign leading up to Portugal's first-ever
national referendum has deeply split the predominantly Roman
Catholic country asked to decide if abortion up to 10 weeks after
conception should be ''decriminalized.''
	   Parliament approved a bill relaxing abortion restrictions in
February, but opponents successfully pushed for a national ballot
on whether to overturn or ratify the legislation.
	   The campaign, which ended Friday, featured marches in major
cities and a nationwide media blitz.
	   Currently, women can be imprisoned for up to three years for
having an illegal abortion. Termination of pregnancy is permitted
only through the 12th week and only for strictly defined medical
reasons or in cases of rape.
	   Abortion rights activists estimate that there are at least
16,000 illegal abortions each year in Portugal, a nation of 9.5
million people.
	   Government statistics indicate that each year about 10,000 women
are treated at hospitals following botched illegal abortions that
are the second-most common cause of maternal death and the main
cause of adolescent maternal death.
	   The anti-abortion campaign was spearheaded by the influential
Roman Catholic Church.
	   The result will be binding only if more than half of registered
voters participate.

New clashes in Berber capital after singer's slaying 
</HEADLINE>
By RACHID KHIARI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Protesters stoned riot police in the
ethnic Berber capital of Tizi-Ouzou for a second day Saturday, as
local anger simmered over the slaying of Berber singer-activist
Lounes Matoub.
	   Nearly 1,000 youths who gathered outside a hospital to view
Matoub's body tried to build barricades, then clashed with police,
who struck back with clubs and tear gas, residents in the city east
of Algiers said on condition of anonymity.
	   Several youths considered leaders of the violence were arrested,
residents said. An official source would only confirm that clashes
occurred, and Tizi Ouzou Hospital declined to say if anyone was
treated for injuries.
	   Protests began Thursday, when the 42-year-old singer was
believed killed by Muslim militants at a fake roadblock outside his
native village. Younts burned tires and tore down Arabic-language
road signs and telephone poles before dispersing on their own.
	   But clashes with police erupted Friday in Tizi-Ouzou, 100 kms
(60 miles) east of Algiers, when youths smashed windows,
windshields and stoned public buildings.
	   The singer, a defender of Berber culture and a fierce critic of
both the military-backed government and Muslim militants, was the
latest Algerian artist to be slain during a 6-year-old Muslim
insurgency that has claimed more than 75,000 lives.
	   The slaying inflamed anger in the region against the
government's plans July 5 to put a law in effect making Arabic the
official language in this former French colony and banning the
official use of other tongues including Berber and French.
	   The move was seen as an effort of the military-backed government
to appease supporters of Islamic movements.
	   The Islamic Salvation Front, whose official banishment after
canceled 1992 elections helped spark the insurgency, condemned the
assassination ``despite the extremist positions of Lounes Matoub
and his anti-Islamic statements.''
	   ``Cultures and languages contributing to the development of the
(Algerian) identity must be promoted without exclusion,'' the group
said in a statement received in Paris.
	   Matoub's body later Saturday was placed in the municipal sports
arena in Tizi-Ouzou, then was to be transported to his hometown of
Beni Douala for burial there Sunday.
	   Political parties in the region called for a general strike on
Sunday, normally a work day in Muslim Algeria.
	   While there was no claim of responsibility for the attack,
officials blamed it on the Armed Islamic Group, the insurgency's
most violent movement, which kidnapped the singer in 1994 and held
him for two weeks.
	   The insurgency began after the government scrapped second-round
parliamentary elections in January 1992. The Islamic Salvation
Front was expected to win the balloting on voter discontent with
corruption and high unemployment.

<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ A chartered plane carrying the U.N.
envoy to Angola disappeared en route to the Ivory Coast from Togo,
airport sources in Abidjan said Saturday.
	   Togolese Foreign Minister Koffi Panou said from Lome, Togo that
the plane was believed to have crashed into the sea Friday night
shortly before landing in Abidjan. He said seven people, including
three crew members, were aboard.
	   Alioune Blondin Beye left Lome on Friday night in a small
Beechcraft 200 after meeting with Togolese President Gnassigbe
Eyadema in an effort to win support for his efforts to advance the
peace process in Angola.
	   An airport source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
contact with the plane was lost sometime after takeoff.
	   The source could not say whether the Beechcraft had crashed, but
said a search had been launched and officials were operating on the
belief that it had gone down.
	   Ivorian and French teams were searching for the plane, with the
office of the American defense attache in Abidjan working in a
support role, Western diplomats said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Panou said the other passengers were Koffi Adjovi, a Togolese
foreign ministry employee, and Senegalese journalist Moktar Gueye.
	   Beye, who is from the West African nation of Mali, has been
traveling through African trying to get support for the troubled
peace process in Angola.
	   Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali appointed Beye special
representative for Angola in 1993. Since October of that year he
has been mediating the Angolan peace process from his base in
Lusaka, Zambia.
	   Beye, 59, threatened to resign from his post last month, saying
the Angolan government and former rebel movement UNITA lacked the
``political will'' to see the peace process to its conclusion.
	   In 1994, Beye mediated the peace pact signed in Lusaka. An
earlier peace accord, signed in Lisbon in 1991, collapsed the
following year when UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ rejected its defeat in
the country's first ever elections and returned to the bush.
	   Lingering hostility between the government and UNITA, which held
about half the country when the 1994 peace was signed, have stymied
the implementation of the pact, which is running more than a year
behind schedule, and the UN's patience is growing thin.
	   The U.N. Security Council agreed Wednesday to give UNITA five
more days to comply with terms of a peace plan after receiving
assurances from the former rebels that they would meet the new
deadline.
	   After June 30, the U.N. Security Council will freeze UNITA's
foreign bank accounts and ban its diamond exports unless the
movement relinquishes its central highland strongholds and takes
major steps to demobilize its armed forces.
	   But UNITA blasted the threatened sanctions in a Friday
statement, calling them ``excessive, unfair, illegal and
illegitimate'' and saying they would jeopardize the peace
agreement.
	   War broke out in Angola after the country's 1975 independence
from Portugal.

Egypt, Spain push for Middle East peace 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar
pledged Saturday to work with Egypt to advance peace in the Middle
East and said that peace agreements must be carried out without
delay.
	   Aznar arrived in Cairo Friday on the first leg of a Middle East
tour that will include visits to Israel and the Palestinian
territories.
	   ``Spain is committed to the peace process and we hope that every
agreement is implemented to the letter and spirit and without delay
or discord,'' Aznar said.
	   Arabs have repeatedly accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu of failing to implement parts of the peace agreement
signed by the previous Israeli government.
	   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak noted that there has been no
breakthrough in negotiations since Netanyahu came to power two
years ago and said the deadlock has increased frustration among the
Palestinians.
	   ``Peace and stability will not be achieved without giving the
Palestinians their rights,'' he said.
	   He said Egypt will push for an international conference on
Middle East peace if the United States fails to convince Israel to
accept a compromise plan to pull back from some 13 per cent of the
West Bank.
	   Aznar said Spain supports joint Egyptian-French efforts to
convene such a conference.
	   Aznar is accompanied by some 300 Spanish businessmen. Earlier in
the day they met with their Egyptian counterparts to discuss trade.
	   Aznar said Spain wants to double its dlrs 500 million in trade
with Egypt.
	   On Friday, Aznar visited Luxor where Muslim militants killed 58
foreign tourists and four Egyptians in a November attack at a
Pharaonic temple.
	   Aznar will fly to Israel on Sunday before traveling to Gaza to
meet Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.

Doctor banned for ``extra-marital'' in vitro fertilization 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese medical society on Saturday expelled a
member doctor for performing an in vitro fertilization with the
eggs of an unmarried woman, a news report said.
	   The Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology said Yahiro Netsu
violated the group's ethical rules by performing the operation,
Kyodo News reported. Society could not be reached late Saturday for
comment.
	   The report said Netsu conducted an in vitro fertilization for a
married couple, using the husband's sperm and the eggs of the
woman's unwed sister.
	   That violated the society's rules against ``extra-marital'' in
vitro fertilization, an operation in which eggs are fertilized in a
laboratory and transferred into the uterus.
	   Netsu practices gynecology in northern Japan, and the expulsion
will not affect his right to work. He announced earlier this week
he will leave the society in order to continue practicing similar
fertilizations, Kyodo said.
	   The ethical rules have come under scrutiny as Japan focuses
attention on its rapidly declining birthrate. The Ministry of
Health and Welfare is holding a series of hearings this year that
will touch on such restrictions.
	   Also Saturday, the medical society approved the testing of in
vitro fertilized eggs for hereditary ailments, Kyodo said.
	   Genes would be tested after the eggs had split a number of times
in the laboratory, and only the healthy ones would be returned to
the uterus.
	   Only serious, incurable hereditary illnesses would be tested,
Kyodo said.

Michael Doohan easily wins Dutch motorcycle Grand Prix

<TEXT>
	   ASSEN, Netherlands (AP) _ Four-time world champion Michael
``Mick'' Doohan of Australia easily won the Dutch motorcycle Grand
Prix Saturday, improving his overall season standings from fourth
to second place.
	   In the 500-cc class, Doohan completed the 121-kilometer
(75-mile) race in 41 minutes and 17.788 seconds.
	   With Doohan on a Honda comfortably in the lead, the race became
a battle for the second spot between Italy's Max Biaggi and Simon
Crafar of New Zealand.
	   Biaggi prevailed, finishing second with 41:18.348, while Crafar
settled for third with 41:18.939.
	   The competition in this northeastern Dutch city was the seventh
event of the 1998 World motorcycle racing Championship.
	   In overall season standings, Biaggi leads with 118 points,
followed by Doohan with 115 points and Alex Criville of Spain with
113 points.
	   In the 250-cc competition, Italy's Loris Capirossi, who started
in pole position, dropped out during the ninth lap because of an
engine problem.
	   Italy's Valentino Rossi, riding an Aprilia, won the race with
38:31.905.
	   Germany's Jurgen Fuchs took second with 38:51.089 and Haruchika
Aoki of Japan finished third with 38:51.421.
	   In the 125-cc class, it was a hair-raising sprint to the finish
line for the 15-year-old Marco Melandri of Italy who trailed behind
Japan's Kazuto Sakata the whole race _ until the final lap.
	   Melandri, who doesn't even have a driver's license, squeezed
passed Sakata just seconds before the finish, winning the race with
38:27.391. Melandri was riding a Honda.
	   Sakata finished with 38:27.419 in second place, and Tomoi Manako
of Japan finished third with 38:37.017.

First Bosnian Serb refugees return to Croat-held village 
</HEADLINE>
By MIRSAD BEHRAM
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ORTIJES, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The first group of 63 Bosnian
Serbs returned Saturday to their devastated pre-war homes in an
area under Croats' control in southern Bosnia.
	   ``It is impossible to describe the feeling,'' Radoslav Radan,
45, said as he arrived back at the rubble that was once his house
in this village 10 kilometers (6 miles) south of the city of
Mostar.
	   ``Yes these are ruins, but they are our ruins, we were born
here,'' he said.
	   The refugees arrived mainly from Bosnian Serb-held east
Herzegovina, but some also from neighboring Serbia and Montenegro.
	   No Bosnian Croat officials were on hand. But the Muslim mayor of
Mostar, Safet Orucevic, greeted them and also brought a generator
and TV set and offered the refugees the use of the city's
excavating machines, donated by international agencies.
	   Only a small percentage of refugees from the 1992-95 Bosnian war
have returned to their war-devastated homes, either because of
resistance from ethnic groups, poor conditions, or the
unwillingness of some to come back.
	   International officials have made the issue a top priority,
declared this the year of the refugee.
	   A representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees at the site Saturday said his agency had provided building
materials and household equipment for the returnees. The agency
also plans to repair a few houses for all of them to stay in until
they can fix the rest themselves, he said.
	   An elderly Serb woman who refused to give her name was among
those overwhelmed by emotions on their arrival.
	   ``This is the best feeling one can experience in their life,''
she said. ``This day I will celebrate as my second birthday.''
	   Another returnee, Vujadin Berberovic, 47, said he hoped to spend
his first night in his ruined home. The next group of returnees, he
said, will arrive next Saturday.

Vatican delegation to visit Palestinian areas and meet Arafat 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A Vatican delegation will visit autonomous
Palestinian areas next week and meet Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, the Palestinian representative to Britain and the Holy See
said Saturday.
	   The delegation, led by Vatican Undersecretary of State Monsignor
Celestino Mighore, will participate in the second meeting on Monday
and Tuesday of the Holy See-PLO joint committee which is
negotiating ``a fundamental agreement between the two sides,''
Palestinian delegate Afif Safieh said.
	   The first round of talks took place on April 27 in the Vatican,
and future sessions will be held alternately in Palestinian areas
and the Vatican, Safieh said in a statement.
	   Arafat has held six meetings with Pope John Paul II, who has
spoken out often on the need for Israel and the Palestinians to
push ahead with peace. The troubled situation has apparently held
up a papal trip to the Holy Land.

Arafat arrives in Qatar for talks on peace process 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: CORRECTS that Arafat was last in Qatar in March
<TEXT>
	   DOHA, Qatar (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat arrived in
Qatar Saturday for talks on the stalled Middle East peace process,
a Palestinian diplomat said.
	   Qatar's emir, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, met Arafat at
the airport.
	   The two leaders will discuss the peace process, a Palestinian
diplomat said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   An Israeli Cabinet decision on June 21 to extend municipal
services from Jerusalem to Jewish settlements on the West Bank has
enraged Palestinians. They fear the step will lead to the
annexation of West Bank land and the cutting off of Arab parts of
Jerusalem from other Palestinian areas.
	   Palestinians want east Jerusalem to be the capital of their
would-be state.
	   Peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel stalled after
the May 1996 election of hard-line Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
	   Qatar has no diplomatic relations with Israel, but the two
states have trade missions in each other's countries.
	   Arafat was last in Doha in March.
	   He is expected to leave later Saturday for Bahrain.

	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ A chartered plane carrying the U.N.
envoy to Angola disappeared en route to the Ivory Coast from Togo,
airport sources in Abidjan said Saturday.
	   Togolese Foreign Minister Koffi Panou said from Lome, Togo that
the plane was believed to have crashed into the sea Friday night
shortly before landing in Abidjan. He said seven people, including
three crew members, were aboard.
	   Alioune Blondin Beye left Lome on Friday night in a small
Beechcraft 200 after meeting with Togolese President Gnassigbe
Eyadema in an effort to win support for his efforts to advance the
peace process in Angola.
	   An airport source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
contact with the plane was lost sometime after takeoff.
	   The source could not say whether the Beechcraft had crashed, but
said a search had been launched and officials were operating on the
belief that it had gone down.
	   Ivorian and French teams were searching for the plane, with the
office of the American defense attache in Abidjan working in a
support role, Western diplomats said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Panou said the other three passengers were Togolese foreign
ministry employee Koffi Adjovi, Senegalese journalist Moktar Gueye
and Baendegar Dessandre, who is from Chad.

World Cup: Most expensive defender to face top strikers 
</HEADLINE>
By MIKE CORDER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LA TURBIE, Monaco (AP) _ He's the world's most expensive
defender and he wants to prove his worth in one of the world's
toughest leagues.
	   Jaap Stam, one of the rocks of the Dutch defense at the World
Cup, is already looking forward to joining Manchester United next
season following his record 35 million guilders (dlrs 17.5 million)
transfer from PSV Eindhoven.
	   But first he has to take on some of the world's top attackers in
France. Stam faces Yugoslavia's Predrag Mijatovic on Monday in the
teams' round of 16 clash in Toulouse and, if the Dutch win, either
Alan Shearer of Gabriel Batistuta is waiting in the quarterfinal.
	   He came up against a hot striker as the Netherlands drew 2-2
with Mexico in its final Group E match: ``El Matador,'' Luis
Hernandez.
	   ``I played well,'' Stam said Saturday. ``He hardly touched the
ball all game, but on one of the occasions he did, he scored.
That's the mark of a great striker.''
	   Hernandez wriggled past Stam deep in injury time to score
Mexico's equalizer after the 25-year-old defender had kept the
Mexican under wraps for virtually the entire match.
	   Once the World Cup is over for the Dutch, Stam will join his new
teammates in Manchester.
	   ``I want to prove myself in England,'' he said. ``I want to show
that they have bought a player who is of value to them.''
	   If this World Cup is anything to go by, Alex Ferguson has made a
sound investment in the softly-spoken 25-year-old.
	   So far the Dutch defense has been miserly, conceding just two
goals in its three first round matches, both in the last 20 minutes
of the Mexico match.
	   Until Hernandez' goal, Stam had not put a foot wrong.
	   Tall and strong, Stam is also deceptively quick. In training
recently, he outran even fleet-footed winger Marc Overmars in a
series of sprinting drills.
	   His pace and poise could have taken him anywhere in Europe _
clubs all over the continent were keen to sign Stam from Eindhoven.
	   ``But for me, England and Manchester United were number one,''
Stam said.
	   His first priority with his new club is to help win the Premier
League, he said. But he added that the Champions League is also a
key goal for the Old Trafford club as manager Alex Ferguson
approaches the end of his career.
	   ``Ferguson has won everything apart from that, so I'm sure they
will do everything they can to win that cup.''
	   As well as preparing for the high-pace attacking soccer of the
Premier League, Stam is also getting ready for England's
scandal-hungry tabloid press.
	   But Stam is not worried about them either.
	   ``I think they will just call me a boring man,'' he said. ``They
won't find me in a night club with another woman. I already have
one and that is enough for me.''

North Korea demands return of dead submarine crewmen

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea on Saturday blamed South
Korea for the death of nine crewmen of a submarine captured in the
South's waters, and demanded the return the vessel and the bodies
of the crew.
	   The North Korean submarine, suspected of espionage, was found
tangled in a South Korean fishing net Monday. When it was towed
ashore and searched Friday, South Korean navy commandoes found nine
bodies inside, all shot apparently to avoid capture.
	   On Saturday, North Korea said South Korea should have rescued
its submarine, which it said went adrift after developing
mechanical troubles during a training mission.
	   ``The South Korean authorities should be held responsible for
the death of the crewmen because they did not save them in time,''
said the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the
Fatherland, a North Korean government agency in charge of relations
with the rival South.
	   ``We also wonder how the crewmen died,'' said the committee's
statement carried by the North's official Korean Central News
Agency.
	   Alleging espionage, South Korea has accused the North of
committing ``a serious act of provocation'' and demanded an apology
and punishment for hardline North Korean military officials who
were responsible.
	   The 70-ton, Yugo-clas submarine was first found by South Korean
sardine fishermen Monday, with its periscope and propeller caught
in a fishing net.
	   Three crewmen were on the deck struggling to free their craft
but disappeared inside when they saw the fishermen.
	   South Korean navy sailors said they tried to communicate but the
North Korean crew did not respond. It took the navy three days to
tow the badly listing submarine to a port. At one point it dropped
the craft to the sea bottom.
	   Officials had earlier indicated that they would return the dead
North Koreans, but not the submarine, which could contain precious
military data.
	   The Koreas were divided into the communist North and the
capitalist South in 1945. They are still technically at war, since
the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.
	   President Kim Dae-jung denounced the intrusion but said the
incident would not sway his policy of expanding exchanges and
cooperation in an effort to open up the communist North's closed
society.
	   Also Saturday, South Korea said it found more evidence that the
submarine was on a spying mission.
	   The submarine left its North Korean base in Wonsan, a major east
coast port 100 kilometers (62 miles) north of the North-South
border on June 20, Defense Ministry officials said, quoting the
sub's logbook.
	   The submarine arrived off Yangyang, a South Korean port 50
kilometers (31 miles) south of the border the following day, which
was last Sunday, and ``executed the mission'' around midnight, the
officials said.
	   They suspect that the vessel was returning north after onshore
espionage or dropping or picking up spies.

Witness tells court of alleged Angola invasion plans after coup attempt 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ A former suspect in a failed Zambian coup
attempt testified that his commanding officer fabricated a story
about an invasion threat from Angola to win support from soldiers.
	   Petson Nkomeni, 31, testified on Friday in the Lusaka High Court
at the treason trial of 77 soldiers and two politicians charged
with plotting the Oct. 28 coup.
	   Nkomeni was originally held as a suspect in the coup, but
charges were dropped against him and several other soldiers in
March. He testified for the prosecution on Friday.
	   Nkomeni, an armored car driver, recounted how Capts. Steven
Lungu and Jack Chiti, two suspected coup leaders, commandeered
soldiers of his infantry brigade on Oct. 28 to drive 11 armored
cars to the city and international airports because of an invasion
threat by Angola, the Times of Zambia reported on Saturday.
	   ``We were told to be on standby as Angola was likely to invade
us,'' Nkomeni was quoted by the Times as saying.
	   Treason carries a possible death sentence under Zambian law.
Earlier this year, charges were dropped against former President
Kenneth Kaunda, who was held under house arrest for months.
	   Soldiers quelled the coup attempt within hours after rebels
seized the state broadcasting studios.

Chinese refreshed, excited about televised presidential debate 
</HEADLINE>
By JOHN LEICESTER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ For Chinese, the surprise wasn't seeing U.S.
President Bill Clinton and President Jiang Zemin differing on human
rights. It was seeing them do it openly, without rancor, on
nationwide television.
	   Chinese who watched the live broadcast Saturday said the two
presidents' spirited joint news conference had given them real hope
that China and the United States are finally learning to talk to
each other, after years when often, all they seemed to do was
shout.
	   ``You could feel that they still have differences,'' said
Michael Fan, a computer salesman. ``But you could also see that now
at least they can talk face-to-face.''
	   ``By speaking equally, rather than engaging in confrontation, we
can move things forward,'' he said.
	   Despite Jiang's obvious discomfort with a reporter's question
about the detention of four dissidents during Clinton's visit,
Chinese said they felt their leader generally held his own with
Clinton.
	   ``President Jiang made a lot of sense,'' said Xin Qingong, an
auto repairman.
	   On the other hand, Clinton, with his criticism of the Tiananmen
Square crackdown in 1989, touched on issues that shouldn't concern
him, Xin said.
	   ``Many of the things Clinton brought up, especially the upheaval
of 1989, these are internal matters,'' Xin said.``They can talk and
reach an understanding but they shouldn't interfere in each other
affairs.''
	   Clinton's appeal for Beijing to talk to Taiwan, the island China
regards as a rebel province, also rankled a young factory worker,
who gave just her surname, Miss Song.
	   ``Whether there's talks or no talks, it's still our own
affair,'' she said. ``It's best that America doesn't raise this
issue, it really has nothing to do with them.''
	   Taiwan's 50-year estrangement from Beijing is an emotive issue
for many Chinese. Likewise, Chinese often balk at U.S. criticisms
of their nation's human rights record and agree with Jiang's view
that given the enormous differences between China and the United
States, disagreements over human rights are to be expected.
	   Fan, the computer salesman, said Jiang ``made sense'' with his
argument that without the 1989 crackdown on Tiananmen, China could
not have remained stable.
	   The Chinese government's decision to broadcast the presidents'
press conference live _ a first _ was apparently taken in the hope
that many in the Chinese audience would side with their president.
	   ``For us Chinese, it really is new to see two presidents
speaking face-to-face, with reporters asking question, on live
television,'' said Andrea Yang, an insurance company staffer.
	   ``I hope we can see more of that in the future,'' she said.
``This is quite big progress.''
	   A Chinese government spokesman, Zhu Bangzao, said officials
wanted ``people to understand the different views of the different
sides.''
	   ``Chinese society is more and more open,'' he said. ``People
have their own opinions and can make their own judgements.''

Political rivals settle scores on the soccer field 
</HEADLINE>
With AP Photos
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's political opposition failed
to do on the soccer field what it also can't accomplish in
Parliament _ beat the government.
	   In a match marked more by enthusiasm than athletic prowess, the
aggressive government side scored a 4-2 victory over its political
opponents.
	   The game was organized to celebrate the official opening of the
60,000-seat Rajamangala National Stadium, venue for the opening and
closing ceremonies for the 13th Asian Games this December.
	   Attending but not taking the field were Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai and opposition leader Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, who has tried
to muster a movement to bring down the government for alleged
mismanagement of Thailand's economic crisis.
	   With few fouls and tackles, the game proved far cleaner than
Thai politics, which have been rife with corruption, vote-buying
and mud-slinging.
	   The government struck early, with two goals in the first seven
minutes of play. The first was a header by Deputy Education
Minister Arkom Angchoun. The half ended with the government ahead
2-1.
	   The opposition was able to briefly equalize the score at 2-2,
but the government responded with repeated attacks and two more
goals.
	   Although play was hardly of World Cup standard, the government
side wore the colors of Argentina while the opposition donned
uniforms akin to those worn by Brazil's national team. For good
measure, Chavalit's put a No. 9 on his uniform, the same number
carried by Brazilian star Rinaldo.
	   Earlier, a capacity crowd saw China defeat Thailand's national
soccer team 3-0 in an exhibition game at the new stadium. Free
admission helped swell attendance at both games.
	   Despite numerous organizational and financial problems,
organizers say all other venues will be ready for Dec. 6-20 Asian
version of the Olympics.
	   Before the political soccer game, the prime minister and
opposition leader were presented with statuettes of ``Chai-yo,''
the elephant who will serve as the Asian Games mascot.

Hingis reaches final 16; former champion Martinez out AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS Hingis quotes, Smith quotes
By STEPHEN WADE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Defending champion Martina Hingis
moved into the final 16 at Wimbledon with a 6-2, 6-1 victory
Saturday over unseeded Elena Likhovtseva of Russia.
	   After struggling in her first two victories, this one on Centre
Court was as comfortable as the scare England sunshine that greeted
the days' opening of play.
	   ``The more matches you play, the more confident you are,''
Hingis said.
	   ``The tennis was a lot different last year,'' the defending
champion went on. ``It was much easier for me to get through the
first couple of rounds.''
	   Things weren't as bright for former champion and eighth seed
Conchita Martinez, who was knocked out in the third round by
Britain's Sam Smith 2-6, 6-3, 7-5 in a match continued from Friday.
	   The 26-year-old Smith became the first British woman to reach
the fourth round since two managed it 13 years ago. Virginia Wade
in 1977 was the last British champion.
	   Smith is guaranteed 25,120 pounds (dlrs 41,700) for reaching the
fourth round, which is almost one-fourth of her career earnings.
	   ``I can't even _ I mean _ I can't even imagine that,'' she said.
``That's such a lot of money. I just sounds like a lot of money.''
	   Martinez, with career earning of dlrs 7 million, joined
seven-time champion Steffi Graff _ upset in two sets Friday by
Natasha Zvereva _ as only the second of the top eight seeded women
to lose.
	   Graf, seeded No. 4 and playing only her fifth tournament in a
year filled by knee surgery and other nagging injuries, fell to a
player she'd beaten in all 17 previous matches.
	   Zvereva of Belarus, known mostly as a doubles player _ won with
the ``best match of my life,'' she said.
	   The 29-year-old Graf fended off questions about her future and
waved politely as she left Centre Court. It's match to match now,
she said, and she hedged whether she'd return to Wimbledon.
	   ``That's another year right now,'' said Graf, whose 21 Grand
Slams stand her No. 2 behind Australian Margaret Court.
	   ``I definitely couldn't say right now. It would be nice to play
again. Hopefully, I'd be different, in different shape and enjoy
myself. But I've learned enough to take what's coming up next.''
	   It was only Graf's sixth singles defeat at Wimbledon since she
made her first appearance in 1984 at the age of 15. She had lost
only twice at Wimbledon since 1988.
	   Graf struggled from the beginning in the rain-delayed match on
Centre Court. She double faulted six times, returned poorly and was
often a step behind Zvereva's change-of-pace shots.
	   ``For some reason I can't find the confidence playing out there
when I know I've played so few tournaments,'' Graf said. ``I
haven't been really very relaxed the last few days.
	   Graf's 17-0 record against Zvereva had been one of the most
lopsided in tennis including a 6-0, 6-0 hammering of Zvereva in the
1988 French Open final. Zvereva never recovered as a singles player
but has won 18 Grand Slam doubles titles.
	   Friday was the fifth day of Wimbledon and the third cut short by
on-and-off light showers with only a dozen singles matches
completed.
	   In other results, second-seeded Lindsay Davenport moved into the
fourth round with a 6-3, 1-6, 6-2 victory over Maria Alejandra
Vento, while No. 6 Monica Seles was leading Yayuk Basuki 6-2 when
the match was suspended.
	   Among the men, No. 6 Patrick Rafter advanced to the round of 16
by beating Magnus Gustafsson, 6-3, 6-7 (7-9), 6-2, 6-1. No. 14
Goran Ivanisevic completed a 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 6-0 third-round
win over Andrei Medvedev.
	   Defending champion and top seed Pete Sampras never got on court
for a testing third-round match against Sweden's Thomas Enqvist.

Palestinians in Jerusalem strike on anniversary of annexation 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Arafat quote in 6th graf
By IMAD MUSA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Shops and businesses shut down across the Arab
sector of Jerusalem on Saturday to protest Israel's planned
expansion of the disputed city and mark the anniversary of the
annexation of east Jerusalem.
	   A leaflet distributed in the streets during the week called on
Palestinians to observe a general strike ``to respond to the
Israeli conspiracy.'' The leaflet was signed by ``the Palestinian
national forces in Jerusalem.''
	   The leaflet said Israel's recent decision to extend municipal
services to the Jewish West Bank settlements that ring Jerusalem
was ``a new and dangerous milestone in the Israeli policies to
surround and besiege east Jerusalem.''
	   The plan, approved last week by the Israeli Cabinet, also calls
for the annexation of Jewish suburbs inside Israel to ensure
Jerusalem's Jewish majority of 70 percent.
	   Israel is trying to ``make the Arab presence in the city
negligible and transient,'' the leaflet charged.
	   The official Palestinian news agency Wafa quoted Yasser Arafat,
head of the Palestinian Authority, as saying Friday that ``playing
with the status of Jerusalem is playing with fire.''
	   The leaflet also ordered Palestinians to boycott the Jerusalem
municipal elections scheduled for later this year. The mayor, Ehud
Olmert, is a member of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
hard-line Likud Party. Some Palestinians have already announced
plans to run for the city council.
	   Israel captured east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
War. Saturday's strike marked the anniversary of the subsequent
Knesset decision to annex the eastern sector of the city, which
Palestinians claim as a future capital.
	   The strike was observed in the major Arab commercial areas of
east Jerualem. Jewish commercial areas in the city were also
deserted in observance of the Jewish Sabbath.
	   Commercial strikes were frequent during the seven-year
Palestinian intefadeh, or uprising, but have been much less common
since the signing of the Israel-Palestinian peace accords in 1993.
	   Also Saturday, the mothers and fathers of about 20 Palestinian
prisoners held in Israeli jails held a brief protest in east
Jerusalem, chanting ``We are Palestinians _ We don't bow to
tyranny,'' and holding pictures of their sons before being
dispersed peacefully by police. There are about 2,800 Palestinian
prisoners in Israeli jails.

Floods hit much of China, expected to worsen 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Floods fed by torrential rains have inundated
thousands of towns and villages in China's southern Guangdong
province, killing seven people, the state-run Xinhua News Agency
said Saturday.
	   With downpours forecast to continue, the floods were expected to
worsen, the report said.
	   Meanwhile, many other areas from the northeast to the southwest
reported heavy flooding.
	   The latest deaths brought to at least 370 the number of people
reported killed in this summer's floods, which have stricken many
parts of south and eastern China, including Guilin, a city
President Clinton is expected to visit next Thursday.
	   In Guangdong, more than 100,000 people had been stranded, 15
highways were impassable, reservoirs were on the verge of collapse
and thousands of villages were flooded, with large areas of
cropland destroyed, Xinhua reported.
	   The floods along the Xijiang, a tributary of Guangdong's Pearl
River, were the worst in 50 years, Xinhua reported, citing the
State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters.
	   It said floods were reported along the Nenjiang in northeast
China and that Dongting and Boyang lakes, along the Yangtze River,
had reached ``increasingly dangerous conditions.''
	   In another report, Xinhua reported that almost three-quarters of
Jingdezhen, a porcelain producing center in southern Jiangxi
province, was under water, with 80,000 people stranded.
	   Deadly floods caused by seasonal rains hit China each summer.
Since March, at least 21 of China's 30 provinces, regions and major
cities have been hit by flooding and storms, including usually arid
areas in the north and northwest.
	   The government has been warning for months that heavy floods
were likely this year, partly because of the disruptive El Nino
weather effect.

Italy allows betting on single games 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy entered a new age of sports betting when
wagering was allowed on single soccer games -- starting with
Saturday's Italy-Norway World Cup matchup.
	   Bettors up until now had to try to predict the outcome of a
slate of Italian league soccer games together. The
government-sanctioned betting brings in tens of millions of dollars
each week, money which funds the Olympic sports program.
	   Now, people will be able to bet on individual contests. Betting
was to have begun last Tuesday with the Italy-Austria game, but
bureaucratic foul-ups caused a delay until Saturday.
	   Wagering also was limited to the Rome area. It was to extend to
other regions during the week. Off-track betting parlors were
taking the bets.

New clashes in Berber capital after singer's slaying 
</HEADLINE>
RETRANSMITTING to include editor's note
Eds: UPDATES with details on clashes, ADDS violence Thursday
By RACHID KHIARI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Protesters stoned riot police in the
ethnic Berber capital of Tizi-Ouzou for a second day Saturday, as
local anger simmered over the slaying of Berber singer-activist
Lounes Matoub.
	   Nearly 1,000 youths who gathered outside a hospital to view
Matoub's body tried to build barricades, then clashed with police,
who struck back with clubs and tear gas, residents in the city east
of Algiers said on condition of anonymity.
	   Several youths considered leaders of the violence were arrested,
residents said. An official source would only confirm that clashes
occurred, and Tizi Ouzou Hospital declined to say if anyone was
treated for injuries.
	   Protests began Thursday, when the 42-year-old singer was
believed killed by Muslim militants at a fake roadblock outside his
native village. Youths burned tires and tore down Arabic-language
road signs and telephone poles before dispersing on their own.
	   But clashes with police erupted Friday in Tizi-Ouzou, 100 kms
(60 miles) east of Algiers, when youths smashed windows,
windshields and stoned public buildings.
	   The singer, a defender of Berber culture and a fierce critic of
both the military-backed government and Muslim militants, was the
latest Algerian artist to be slain during a 6-year-old Muslim
insurgency that has claimed more than 75,000 lives.
	   The slaying inflamed anger in the region against the
government's plans July 5 to put a law in effect making Arabic the
official language in this former French colony and banning the
official use of other tongues including Berber and French.
	   The move was seen as an effort of the military-backed government
to appease supporters of Islamic movements.
	   The Islamic Salvation Front, whose official banishment after
canceled 1992 elections helped spark the insurgency, condemned the
assassination ``despite the extremist positions of Lounes Matoub
and his anti-Islamic statements.''
	   ``Cultures and languages contributing to the development of the
(Algerian) identity must be promoted without exclusion,'' the group
said in a statement received in Paris.
	   Matoub's body later Saturday was placed in the municipal sports
arena in Tizi-Ouzou, then was to be transported to his hometown of
Beni Douala for burial there Sunday.
	   Political parties in the region called for a general strike on
Sunday, normally a work day in Muslim Algeria.
	   While there was no claim of responsibility for the attack,
officials blamed it on the Armed Islamic Group, the insurgency's
most violent movement, which kidnapped the singer in 1994 and held
him for two weeks.
	   The insurgency began after the government scrapped second-round
parliamentary elections in January 1992. The Islamic Salvation
Front was expected to win the balloting on voter discontent with
corruption and high unemployment.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai and American law enforcement
agents have seized four Pakistanis suspected of planning to carry
out ``illegal activities'' in Thailand, a senior police officer
said Saturday.
	   The Thai Immigration Police chief, Lieut. Gen. Chidchai
Vanasatidya, denied reports that the four were linked to the
bombing of New York's World Trade Center and were planning to
assassinate the U.S. ambassador here.
	   The English-language newspaper The Nation quoted Thai sources as
saying the Pakistanis had targeted Ambassador William Itoh and the
U.S. Embassy in Bangkok. The report also linked them to the 1993
New York City bombing.
	   ``We do have reasons to believe that the four suspects were in
the process of planning to carry out illegal activities in
Thailand. I cannot elaborate,'' the police officer said in an
interview.
	   The four were seized Friday during a raid on a downtown Bangkok
apartment by Thai police and agents of the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation, Chidchai said.
	   A U.S. Embassy spokesman also said it did not appear any
Americans or U.S. interests in Thailand had been targeted.
	   ``Thus far there is no evidence of any threat to the U.S.
ambassador in Thailand. Thus far we cannot find any connection with
the World Trade Center bombing,'' the spokesman said on condition
of anonymity.
	   He confirmed that American authorities were cooperating with
Thai police in the investigation, which a reliable diplomatic
source said was focusing on suspected terrorist activities.
	   An official at the U.S. State Department in Washington said he
had heard three Pakistanis had been taken into custody instead of
four, and he did not know why they were apprehended.
	   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, also said the
department was not aware of any connection to the World Trade
Center bombing.
	   The Pakistanis were being held in Immigration Police prison but
have only been charged with overstaying their visas while the
investigation continues.
	   The Nation identified the four men as Mohamad Rahim, 30, Hadja
Pahu Sasa, 25, Hara Haj Husem, 26, and Hareef Husen, 25.
	   Thailand has been the scene of terrorist activities in the past.
	   Earlier this year, the Thai Supreme Court acquitted an Iranian
accused of plotting to bomb the Israel Embassy in Bangkok.
	   The ``truck bomb'' incident, in which a Middle Eastern-looking
man abandoned an explosives-laden truck following a minor traffic
accident, occurred in 1994.
	   The World Trade Center bombing killed six people and injured
more than 1,000. Six men were convicted in the United States
between 1994 and 1997 in connection with the attack and sentenced
to life imprisonment.
	   In November, a New York court convicted Ramzi Yousef of Pakistan
on murder and conspiracy charges. He was described as the
mastermind of the bombing at the twin 110-story buildings in
Manhattan.

	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ A chartered plane carrying the U.N.
envoy to Angola has disappeared en route to the Ivory Coast from
Togo, United Nations officials said Saturday.
	   Alioune Blondin Beye left Lome on Friday night in a small
Beechcraft 200 after meeting with Togolese President Gnassigbe
Eyadema in an effort to win support for his efforts to advance the
Angolan peace process, according to a statement released by the
U.N. Observer Mission in Angola.
	   The statement said the control tower in Abidjan lost contact
with the plane about 13 miles from the airport and that search and
rescue operations had been launched. It said eight people,
including two crew members, were on board.
	   Togolese Foreign Minister Koffi Panou said from Lome, Togo that
the plane was believed to have crashed into the sea Friday night
shortly before landing in Abidjan. He said seven people, including
three crew members, were aboard.
	   Ivorian and French teams were searching for the plane, with the
office of the American defense attache in Abidjan working in a
support role, Western diplomats said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Panou said the other three passengers were Togolese foreign
ministry employee Koffi Adjovi, Senegalese journalist Moktar Gueye
and Baendegar Dessandre, who is from Chad.
	   The Observer mission statement said Beye was accompanied by five
staff members and two crew members. It did not provide further
names.

<TEXT>
	   SEPANG, Malaysia (AP) _ Awash in glittering klieg lights and
regal ceremony, Malaysia on Saturday unveiled its sleek new
airport, designed to put the Southeast Asian nation on the map in
the new millennium.
	   Malaysia's King Tuanku Ja'afar officially opened Kuala Lumpur
International Airport Saturday night amid a dazzling laser display
and fireworks. Wide-bodied jets will begin howling across the sky
on Tuesday.
	   ``It is good for the ego,'' Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad told
the Far Eastern Economic Review when asked why his nation _ now
facing a regional economic crisis _ needed such a massive airport.
	   Once all three phases are developed, the airport's backyard will
include hiking trails for jet-lagged travelers, golf courses, a
shopping center, hotels and a track to host the 1999 Formula One
motorbike championship.
	   With a rambling roof resembling white Bedouin tents, the
five-level KLIA boasts the world's tallest air-traffic control
tower, biggest passenger lounge and capacity for 25 million people.
	   Airport authorities claim the 9 billion ringgit (dlrs 2.3
billion) airport is the world's largest, spread over 10,000
hectares (24,700 acres) of rain forest.
	   The superlatives could also bring super-duper headaches.
	   To accommodate millions more passengers and the faster jets
which require longer runways, the KLIA has been pushed 70
kilometers (42 miles) south of downtown Kuala Lumpur. That's too
far for some travelers, who liked the old airport only 30
kilometers (18 miles) outside the city.
	   Costs are also high. For the past week, for example, harried
government officials have been huddling to come up with a cheaper
fare system.
	   And outlet operators who want to hawk their array of chocolates,
silk and luggage are having second thoughts, complaining that rents
are too high.
	   Malaysia Airlines, the country's national carrier, has also
warned that it could be forced to hike its fares by as much as 80
percent to offset higher operating costs. And it will be several
years before KLIA determines whether it can lure the major Western
carriers from Singapore.
	   Meanwhile, glitches in the central computing system _ the first
in the world to link all airport functions _ could ground
operations to a halt.
	   Earlier this month, more than 3,000 volunteers found themselves
pacing the KLIA passenger lounge for hours after the airport's 600
million ringgit (dlrs 154 million) computer system crashed during a
trial run.
	   Nazri Alias, a landscape architect visiting the airport
Saturday, was concerned that once the foreigners who helped design
and build KLIA go home, things could collapse.
	   ``The PM wants the biggest this, the biggest that,'' said Nazri.
``When you want things to be gigantic, you have to have the
necessary expertise. Our people haven't reached that level of
expertise.''
	   The economic slump sweeping across Asian skies has also curbed
Asian wanderlust; tourism in the region dropped by 13 percent last
year.
	   Nevertheless, KLIA supporters say Mahathir's push to finish the
airport was opportune. Malaysia saved money, they said, by getting
the KLIA infrastructure into place before the ringgit lost nearly
40 percent of its value.

Orix defeat Nippon Ham 12-1 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Orix BlueWave thrashed the Pacific League
leading Nippon Ham Fighters 12-1 Saturday at Green Stadium in Kobe.
	   Orix slugger Troy Neel belted a two-run homer in the first
inning to ignite the scoring for the BlueWave, who rapped out 15
hits in the game.
	   BlueWave hurler Takahide Ito struck out eight over five innings
for his second win against five losses.
	   Neel, formerly with the Oakland Athletics, now has 9 homeruns
for the season.
	   At Fukuoka Dome, Seibu infielder Kazuo Matsui batted in three
runs on three hits to lead the Lions to a 9-2 victory over the
Daiei Hawks.
	   Seibu pitcher Hiroshi Shintani went the distance, striking out
nine and giving up five hits to notch his third win against one
loss.
	   In Chiba, Kintetsu slugger Takashi Muto drove in two runs off a
single in the eighth as the Buffaloes beat the Lotte Marines 3-1.
	   Lotte fell to the bottom of the Pacific League standings.
	   In the Central League, Yokohama slugger Takanori Suzuki blasted
a three-run home-run in the first to lead the BayStars to a 3-2 win
over the Yomiuri Giants.
	   Yomiuri's Mariano Duncan, formerly with the Toronto Blue Jays,
batted in a run in the eighth off Yokohama relief ace Kazuhiro
Sasaki, but the Giants couldn't add any more runs.
	   Giants starter Cho Sung-min, formerly in the South Korean
leagues, went the distance in a losing effort to slip to 7-4.
	   In Nagoya, Kenshin Kawakami gave up four hits over six innings
as the second-place Chunichi Dragons beat the Hiroshima Carp 5-3.
	   Hiroshima's Timoniel Perez of the Dominican Republic smashed his
second homerun of the season in the sixth inning.
	   Chunichi's relief ace Sun Dong-yol, formerly with the Hai Tai
Tigers in South Korea, pitched out the ninth to pick up his 15th
save of the season.
	   At Koshien Stadium, the Yakult Swallows came back from a 3-1
deficit, scoring five runs in the fifth to beat the Hanshin Tigers
6-3.

	   MAGNY COURS, France (AP) - For the winner of Sunday's French
Grand Prix, one might not have to look past the first row of the
starting grid.
	   And for good reason.
	   Mika Hakkinen has the pole position after having the fastest
time in Saturday's trials. The last four times he started from
there, he won the race in his McLaren-Mercedes this season.
	   Michael Schumacher is beside him but ahead of Hakkinen's
teammate, David Coulthard.
	   The last time Schumacher's Ferrari split the McLarens -- the
only other time this season -- Schumacher won the Argentine Grand
Prix in April. Schumacher also won the last Grand Prix in Canada
three weeks ago.
	   Hakkinen in a McLaren-Mercedes did 1 minute, 14.929 seconds on
the 4.25-kilometer (2.641-mile) Magny Cours circuit to average
204.193 kph (126.91 mph). It was his sixth pole position of his
career and fifth this year.
	   Schumacher did 1:15.159 in his Ferrari ahead of Coulthard,
1:15.333. Coulthard has taken the other three pole positions this
season for McLaren.
	   Eddie Irvine continued an improving Ferrari show by coming in
fourth, 1:15.527.
	   ``We are close, that is good for the race,'' Schumacher said.
``Therefore I am pretty confident.''
	   Schumacher has made statements since Canada that the Ferraris
are improving and ready to challenge the McLarens. Now the
performance of both red cars back him up.
	   ``This is the closest the gap has been all season,'' Schumacher
said. ``Eddie as well is close, Together we can do work and try to
give them a hard time.''
	   Schumacher, a two-time Formula One champion, enters Sunday's
72-lap race on a roll. He won the Canadian GP and he has won three
of the last four French races here.
	   Hakkinen was pleased to still stay ahead of Schumacher for the
time being.
	   ``To get the pole here is important and makes a big
difference,'' Hakkinen said. ``It is down to that time of year when
you have to get the points.''
	   Sunday's French Grand Prix is the eighth race of the Formula One
series and begins a hectic period with four races over the next
five weeks.
	   Hakkinen, with 46 points, has a 12-point advantage over
Schumacher. Coulthard is third with 29 in the driver's standings.
	   ``The championship could be very open as I think we can be close
for the rest of the season, thanks to improvements to the
aerodynamics and the tires,'' Schumacher said.
	   ``We have had signs we seem to be close. Now we are sure where
we are,'' he said.
	   Jacques Villeneuve, last year's Formula One champion, was fifth
in the trials at 1:15.630 in a Williams-Mecachrome. Villeneuve beat
Schumacher for the title in the last race of the 1997 season.
	   Villeneueve still has yet to crack into the top positions for
this season but is optimistic.
	   ``We could have gotten into the top three here but nevertheless
we should be in fighting form for tomorrow,'' Villeneuve said. ``I
think we can race well from this position.''
	   Ralf Schumacher, Michael's brother, was next in 1:15.925 in a
Jordan-Mugen Honda followed by his Jordan teammate, Damon Hill, the
1996 world champion, 1:16.245

Pakistan accuses India of more cross-border shelling; two dead 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MUZZAFARRABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Another round of shells fired by
Indian soldiers hit Pakistan-controlled Kashmir on Saturday,
killing two people and injuring 10 others, the state-run news
agency said.
	   This followed a report on Friday that Indian shells hit several
Pakistani villages in the same area, killing five people, including
a woman and her two granddaughters. Another 13 people were
seriously hurt in that attack, according to government officials in
the area.
	   There was no immediate comment from India.
	   Indian troops also fired automatic weapons across the border,
said The Associated Press of Pakistan.
	   The wounded, including a 12-year-old girl, all suffered either
shrapnel or gunshot wounds, APP reported.
	   Pakistani and Indian troops face each other along the disputed
border that divides the former Himalayan state between the two
unfriendly country.
	   Cross-border firing by soldiers from both countries is a common
occurrence, but in recent days Pakistan has been reporting an
increase in attacks as well as civilian casualties.
	   The latest attack brings to 12 the death toll in the last week.
	   India and Pakistan fought two wars over Kashmir, a dispute that
shot to international prominence after the two countries conducted
underground nuclear tests last month.
	   Many people fear that another confrontation between the two
could involve the use of nuclear weapons.

Pakistan cancels agreement with power companies 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan canceled its agreement with
a a private power company Saturday and issued notices of
cancellation to six other companies, accusing them of corruption,
Pakistan Press International reported.
	   The government canceled its agreement with Southern Electric
Power Company, a Punjab-based 1,112 megawatt company, the
semi-autonomous PPI reported, quoting Minister of Water and Power
Raja Nadir Pervaiz.
	   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has been seeking to renegotiate
several power agreements signed by his predecessor, Benazir Bhutto,
saying she accepted inflated rates in exchange for kickbacks.
	   Both Ms. Bhutto and the private power companies have denied the
claims.
	   There was no immediate comment from the Southern Electric Power
Company.
	   Although Hubco Power Company, which is heavily backed by World
Bank guarantees, was not among the six companies issued notices of
cancellation, it too has been targeted by the government and is in
the midst of an court battle with the government.
	   The feud between the government and Hubco, the country's largest
power company, has driven its stock down and caused havoc on the
Karachi Stock Exchange.

World Cup: Ticket allocation causes concern 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England's official ticket allocation for Tuesday's
World Cup match against Argentina will create a flood of demand on
the blackmarket and fresh fears of violence.
	   The allocation of 2,049 for the second round match is smaller
than for any of England's group games and could provoke problems as
frustrated fans compete for blackmarket tickets.
	   And the fact that England players are promising revenge for the
infamous loss to Argentina in 1986, when Diego Maradona's ``hand of
God'' goal led to England's exit, has increased stakes in the game.
	   England's Football Association deputy chief executive Pat Smith
said the FA was trying to negotiate more tickets for the St Etienne
match.
	   England was initially allocated 3,700 tickets for the game in
Marseille, 2,700 for Toulouse and 2,500 for Lens but the figures
rose to 7,300, 3,300 and 4,400 after FA intervention.
	   Smith said the reasons for the small allocation were the
capacity of the stadium (36,000), pre-planned security
arrangements, and increased international demand for tickets.
	   Many England fans bought black market tickets for group games
because allocations were limited following a controversial decision
to give 60 percent of the tickets to the French market.
	   FA security advisor Sir Brian Hayes said the distribution of
World Cup tickets had been a failure and he had always thought much
of the French allocation would be resold on the blackmarket.
	   ``It was always evident _ now people are paying outrageous,
inflated prices,'' he said.
	   Kevin Miles, coordinator of the Football Supporters' Association
mobile ``fans' embassy'' in France, said the ticket allocation was
in keeping with the ticket fiasco throughout the tournament.
	   ``There is clearly an exceptional demand among England fans to
get to the games, and this is not being met by their efforts to
secure tickets through the prescribed means,'' he said.
	   ``The fact that they cannot use legitimate means does not stifle
demand, and once again the vast majority of England fans cheering
on the team will have paid considerably over the odds for the
tickets _ so a lot of people are making a lot of money out of the
genuine England supporter.''

Yeltsin signs amendments to adoption bill into law 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin Saturday signed a revised
adoption law that would tighten control over foreign adoptions and
encourage more Russians to adopt children.
	   The amendments to Russia's adoption law were approved by the
lower house of parliament, the State Duma, on June 5 and passed by
the upper house, the Federation Council, on June 10.
	   The Kremlin press office said Yeltsin signed the amendments to
the law to give the state more control over adoptions and ``to
insure the rights and interests of children in adoptions.''
	   The original version of the law introduced in parliament earlier
in the year said that Russia must sign agreements with other
countries to codify adoption procedures by Sept. 1, 1999.
	   The amended version of the bill contained no time limit for the
prospective international agreements to be signed, meaning pending
adoptions will not be stalled by the measure.
	   The bill allows foreign adoption agencies to operate in Russia
only after their country signs an agreement with Russia setting out
the rules. In the interim, prospective foreign parents can use the
services of proxies as they do now.
	   According to parliamentary estimates, there are about 80 foreign
adoption agencies, mostly American, currently operating in Russia,
usually through Russian intermediaries.

Jewish jurists fight Holocaust denial 
</HEADLINE>
By DIMITRA KEHAGIA
<TEXT>
	   SALONICA, Greece (AP) _ Governments must outlaw Holocaust
revisionism in order to fight a high-tech, well financed movement
that denies the Holocaust ever occurred, a group of Jewish legal
experts said Saturday.
	   An international conference of Jewish jurists warned that the
international revisionist movement, using the internet and an
orchestrated propaganda campaign, could warp the historical memory
of younger generations.
	   ``The denial movement has a historical institute which is
reviewing history and whose real aim is to deny the Holocaust,''
said Itzhak Nener, an Israeli who is deputy president of the
International Association of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists.
	   ``They have tremendous sums of money,'' he added.
	   The legal experts gathered in Salonica, the northern Greek port
city once known as the ``Mother of Israel.'' The Nazis murdered
50,000 of Salonica's Jews during the Holocaust, destroying the
once-thriving community. Today, about 1,000 Jews live in the city.
	   During World War II, Nazi Germany rounded up about 6 million
Jews and killed them at death camps.
	   One aim of the conference is to convince more countries to pass
legislation outlawing Holocaust denial. Several European countries,
including Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France and Luxembourg
already have such legislation.
	   But Nener and his colleagues said the sentences are too lenient,
and more countries should crack down on people claiming the Nazi
slaughter of Jews never took place.
	   Holocaust revisionists have been consistently active in America
and Canada, where they have aired their views on the internet.
	   ``This growing group is using web sites to make amazingly
ridiculous claims, like that they measured the gas chambers and
found they were not big enough for people,'' said Isidor Wolfe, a
lawyer from Vancouver, Canada.
	   No one should have to prove that the Holocaust took place, the
legal experts say.
	   ``We have evidence so strong it's ridiculous,'' Wolfe said.
``But they target people who are young, who do not have a sense of
history, and they seem to be able to get some of these skin-head
types.''
	   A surge in neo-Nazi activity in Europe and America provides a
dangerous channel for misinformation about the Holocaust.
	   One organization in the U.S. regularly mails ``information
packets'' to college newspapers and takes out advertisements for
videos and books that claim Allied soldiers faked evidence of the
Holocaust.
	   Such historical manipulation has been going on for more than a
decade, the legal experts said. It's even more dangerous because
the target audience is historically ignorant, Nener said. He
pointed to a 1997 U.S. poll that showed about one-fourth of the
population had no knowledge of the Holocaust.
	   The International Association of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists will
hold conferences in more than 20 other European nations to lobby
for more anti-revisionism laws.

Solidarity criticizes naming of leftist as state TV chairman 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The rightist governing coalition
criticized the appointment of a leftist to head Poland's state
television, and lawmakers said Saturday they would fight the
decision.
	   Although the Solidarity-dominated coalition replaced a leftist
government after winning national elections last September, the
supervisory board that appoints state TV's management remains under
the control of leftists.
	   Solidarity politicians had proposed a new system requiring equal
representation in TV managemnet for the government and opposition.
	   But when four-year terms management terms expired Friday, the
leftists appointed Robert Kwiatkowski as state TV chairman and
filled four remaining management board positions with three other
leftists and one rightist.
	   ``The state television was to be public, now it is party
television,'' Solidarity member Tomasz Welnicki said.
	   ``The war about media will be continued,'' said Miroslaw Czech
of the Freedom Union, Solidarity's coalition partner.
	   Although there are a growing number of private networks in
Poland, most Poles still get their television news from state TV.

<TEXT>
	   SEPANG, Malaysia (AP) _ Awash in glittering klieg lights and
regal ceremony, Malaysia on Saturday unveiled its sleek new
airport, designed to put the Southeast Asian nation on the map in
the new millennium.
	   Malaysia's King Tuanku Ja'afar officially opened Kuala Lumpur
International Airport Saturday night amid a dazzling laser display
and fireworks. Wide-bodied jets will begin howling across the sky
on Tuesday.
	   ``It is good for the ego,'' Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad told
the Far Eastern Economic Review when asked why his nation _ now
facing a regional economic crisis _ needed such a massive airport.
	   Once all three phases are developed, the airport's backyard will
include hiking trails for jet-lagged travelers, golf courses, a
shopping center, hotels and a track to host the 1999 Formula One
motorbike championship.
	   With a rambling roof resembling white Bedouin tents, the
five-level KLIA boasts the world's tallest air-traffic control
tower, biggest passenger lounge and capacity for 25 million people
a year.
	   Airport authorities claim the 9 billion ringgit (dlrs 2.3
billion) airport is the world's largest, spread over 10,000
hectares (24,700 acres) of rain forest.
	   The superlatives could also bring super-duper headaches.
	   To accommodate millions more passengers and the faster jets
which require longer runways, the KLIA has been pushed 70
kilometers (42 miles) south of downtown Kuala Lumpur. That's too
far for some travelers, who liked the old airport only 30
kilometers (18 miles) outside the city.
	   Costs are also high. For the past week, for example, harried
government officials have been huddling to come up with a cheaper
fare system.
	   And outlet operators who want to hawk their array of chocolates,
silk and luggage are having second thoughts, complaining that rents
are too high.
	   Malaysia Airlines, the country's national carrier, has also
warned that it could be forced to hike its fares by as much as 80
percent to offset higher operating costs. And it will be several
years before KLIA determines whether it can lure the major Western
carriers from Singapore.
	   Meanwhile, glitches in the central computing system _ the first
in the world to link all airport functions _ could ground
operations to a halt.
	   Earlier this month, more than 3,000 volunteers found themselves
pacing the KLIA passenger lounge for hours after the airport's 600
million ringgit (dlrs 154 million) computer system crashed during a
trial run.
	   Nazri Alias, a landscape architect visiting the airport
Saturday, was concerned that once the foreigners who helped design
and build KLIA go home, things could collapse.
	   ``The PM wants the biggest this, the biggest that,'' said Nazri.
``When you want things to be gigantic, you have to have the
necessary expertise. Our people haven't reached that level of
expertise.''
	   The economic slump sweeping across Asian skies has also curbed
Asian wanderlust; tourism in the region dropped by 13 percent last
year.
	   Nevertheless, KLIA supporters say Mahathir's push to finish the
airport was opportune. Malaysia saved money, they said, by getting
the KLIA infrastructure into place before the ringgit lost nearly
40 percent of its value.

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ A magazine reported Saturday that the
high-speed train that crashed and killed 100 people June 3 was
stopped by the driver between stations because of a grinding noise
more than two hours before the accident.
	   But Gisela Luening, a prosecutor who is investigating the crash
of InterCity Express 884 in northern Germany, said Saturday that
the train was stopped for personnel reasons. She added that the
halt was not linked with the accident.
	   The Munich-based Focus magazine said the train had been stopped
for about 3 1-2 minutes after the driver and a conductor heard a
grinding noise. The two employees, suspecting a transmission
defect, checked the train but found nothing wrong, Focus said.
	   The magazine quoted unidentified sources in Germany's border
agency, which also is involved in the investigation into postwar
Germany's worst train disaster.
	   Focus, in an advance of a report to appear in Monday's edition,
said the Deutsche Bahn railroad told investigators that the train
was halted to pick up an extra conductor.

agencies investigating the crash, was quoted by Focus as saying it
would be unusual to stop between stations, and that details of the
halt need to be cleared up.
	   Investigators have said the later derailment at Eschede, 50
kilometers (30 miles) north of Hanover, probably was caused by a
wheel failure, though they have not determined why the wheel
failed.
	   A steel tire that encased the wheel and helped keep it on the
track broke off about six kilometers (3.7 miles) from the accident
scene and embedded in the train's undercarriage, investigators say.
The train later derailed, jack-knifed and crashed into the concrete
supports of an overpass.
	   Surviving passengers reported hearing a grinding noise before
the crash, but said it came minutes _ not hours _ before the
accident.

Body of U.S. Marine swept away in river in Japan found 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The body of a U.S. Marine swept away while swimming
in a rain-swollen river in southwestern Japan was found by U.S.
Navy divers Saturday after a week-long search, the Marine Corps
said.
	   The body of Lance Cpl. Aguado C. Perez, 20, of Muldoon, Texas,
was found in the Ozegawa River, about 40 kilometers (25 miles)
north of the Marine Corps Air Station in Iwakuni, where he was
based.
	   Perez, assigned to the Marine Wing Support Squadron-171, was
apparently swimming with two friends on June 20 when he was swept
away. The U.S. military and Japanese officials had been searching
for him since.
	   Constant rain and high water levels in the river had hampered
the week-long search, the Marine Corps said in a statement. Iwakuni
is about 700 kilometers (435 miles) southwest of Tokyo.

Saudi Arabia's top cleric approves the use of Viagra 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Muslim men may use the
anti-impotence drug Viagra if it is not harmful and does not
contain any intoxicating substances, Saudi Arabia's top cleric,
Sheik Abdul-Aziz bin Baz, said in remarks published Saturday.
	   ``Using a drug that helps sexual intercourse is permitted and
there is no legal Islamic prohibition, provided it does not contain
ingredients that may harm health or intoxicate,'' the
Arabic-language newspaper Okaz quoted the grand mufti as saying.
	   Bin Baz gave his opinion in response to a question after he
delivered a lecture on Friday evening in the Saudi capital, Riyadh.
	   Saudi newspapers have said authorities were planning to register
the drug. Viagra has been selling on the local black market at dlrs
80 a pill, eight times its price in the United States.

World Cup: Ticket allocation causes concern quotes. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Recasts lead, adds sports minister quotes, cuts FA security
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain's sports minister Tony Banks Saturday said
the government would step into the World Cup ticket allocation
fiasco if England's Football Association needed support.
	   England's ticketshare of 2,049 for Tuesday's World Cup match
against Argentina was its smallest to date, sparking fears of a
rush on blackmarket tickets creating trouble among frustrated fans.
	   Banks said England and Argentina should each have been allocated
10,000 tickets for the St Etienne match.
	   Banks, who tips England to win the World Cup if it beats
Argentina, said the government backed the FA's bid to get more
tickets.
	   ``If the FA want us to do more, then they only need to ask,'' he
said.
	   The fact that England players are promising revenge for the
infamous loss to Argentina in 1986, when Diego Maradona's ``hand of
God'' goal led to England's exit, has increased stakes in the game.
	   England's Football Association deputy chief executive Pat Smith
said the FA was trying to negotiate more tickets for the St Etienne
match.
	   England was initially allocated 3,700 tickets for the game in
Marseille, 2,700 for Toulouse and 2,500 for Lens but the figures
rose to 7,300, 3,300 and 4,400 after FA intervention.
	   Smith said the reasons for England's small allocation were the
capacity of the stadium (36,000), pre-planned security
arrangements, and increased international demand for tickets.
	   Many England fans bought black market tickets for group games
because allocations were limited following a controversial decision
to give 60 percent of the tickets to the French market.
	   Kevin Miles, coordinator of the Football Supporters' Association
mobile ``fans' embassy'' in France, said Tuesday's allocation was
typical of the ticket fiasco throughout the tournament.
	   ``There is clearly an exceptional demand among England fans to
get to the games,'' he said.
	   ``The fact that they cannot use legitimate means does not stifle
demand, and once again the vast majority of England fans will have
paid considerably over the odds for the tickets.''

Netanyahu suggests Mideast conference to discuss everything but Israel-Palestine conflict 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A multilateral conference sponsored by
Europe to discuss Mideast issues but not the Palestinian-Israeli
conflict specifically would be ``useful'', Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said in an interview published by a Spanish
daily Saturday.
	   With the United States overseeing bilateral talks, it would be
``intelligent'' if Europe ``promoted a regional dialogue on such
questions and arms limitation, water resources and the movement of
people'' Netanyahu told the newspaper ABC.
	   ``No other region has more experience in integration and
cooperation than Europe'' he said, adding that the region has long
sought a more active role in the Mideast peace process.
	   But Netanyahu also expressed resentment of what he termed the
European ``tendency to paint the situation in terms of good guys
and bad guys and put Israel on the side of the bad guys.''
	   This attitude had reduced Israel's willingness to welcome
European involvement, the prime minister said.
	   Netanyahu, a member of the Israeli delegation at the 1991
Mideast peace conference in Madrid, said the Spanish capital would
be a good place to hold the suggested regional dialogue.
	   In the interview, Netanyahu also insisted that Israel was
fulfilling its part of the Oslo peace accords and blamed
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat for blocking resolution of the
conflict by not combating terrorism within the territory under his
control.
	   ``He (Arafat) has seven times more police per inhabitant than
Israel and more armed personnel per capita than any other country
in the world...He has to chose whether he wants to seal peace with
Israel or with the terrorists from Hamas.''

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Northern Ireland's major
pro-British Protestant party expects to win just enough seats in
the new cross-community government to push forward the Belfast
peace agreement, according to latest election results Saturday.
	   About 20 seats remained up for grabs following Thursday's
election to the 108-member Belfast Assembly, the legislature that
must nominate Protestant and Catholic members to govern this
divided land after 26 years of ``direct rule'' from London.
	   David Trimble's Ulster Unionists, split over his support for
April's compromise agreement involving seven other parties, were
being projected to win 28 or 29 seats despite scoring their lowest
share of the vote _ 21.3 percent _ in Northern Ireland's 77-year
existence.
	   ``I knew there were going to be problems, that it was going to
be a bumpy journey. We've come over the bumps and we're still on
the road,'' said Trimble, who is likely to head the new multi-party
administration appointed by the Assembly.
	   ``Today marks a watershed in the history of Northern Ireland,''
Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam said, noting that
the Ulster Unionists' survival meant ``we're going to have an
Assembly that will work.''
	   ``A whole generation of politicians have missed out on the
chance to exercise real power. Today changes that. Now those
elected to the Assembly have the real prospect of taking control of
the decisions that affect the day-to-day lives of people who live
here,'' she said.
	   But the reality of sectarian bitterness in urban Belfast bubbled
to the fore even as Mowlam spoke.
	   Militant Catholics, protesting a march by Protestants along the
so-called ``peace line'' separating Catholic and Protestant areas
of west Belfast, threw rocks, bottles and bricks at riot police
pushing them back from the marchers' intended path.
	   No serious injuries were reported as the few hundred Catholics
taunted police lines by waving Irish flags and blowing whistles in
their faces, then threw stones at the passing Protestant marchers.

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SOWETO, South Africa (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac
cuddled a baby whose mother is HIV positive and kissed another
Saturday, gestures that touched South African hospital workers
battling an AIDS epidemic.
	   A day after arriving in South Africa, where he has addressed
business leaders and toasted President Nelson Mandela and others at
a banquet, Chirac saw the grittier side of the country.
	   In the sprawling black Soweto township south of Johannesburg, he
visited a memorial to black students gunned down by police in 1976.
	   Holding the hands of two girls dressed in blue school jackets
and skirts, Chirac viewed photographs at the Hector Peterson
Memorial, set on a traffic circle amid lower middle-class homes and
scrap heaps.
	   Chirac placed a wreath at the memorial, named for the first
student killed in the student uprising against apartheid education
policies, then headed to Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital, where he
visited the ward for HIV-positive mothers.
	   Later he traveled to Cape Town, where he met with Frene Jinwala,
the speaker of Parliament, and other legislative officials at the
200-year-old Tuynhuis government building.
	   Also in Cape Town, France's minister for cooperation, Charles
Josselin, signed an agreement to donate 5.2 million rand (dlrs
900,000) to help establish the Cape Peninsula National Park, to
preserve the region's unique plants and wildlife.
	   South Africa is the key stop on Chirac's six-day tour of
southern African countries, a tour meant to encourage new
relationships and bring closer political and economic ties.
	   Turning from nearly exclusive involvement with its former
colonies in West and Central Africa, the new French policy
recognizes that South Africa has become the anchor for new
investment and economic growth in the region since its first
all-race elections in 1994.
	   On Sunday, Chirac was to bestow the French Legion of Honor upon
retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu, head of the government's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission, which is probing apartheid-era abuses on
all sides.
	   He began his six-day African trip in Namibia, and was also to
visit Mozambique and Angola.
	   In Soweto, Chirac met with five HIV-positive mothers and their
babies. ``I hope you will live long lives and that the people
taking care of you can continue doing so,'' Chirac said, greeting
each woman, planting a kiss on the forehead of a baby sitting on
her mother's lap and cuddling another infant.
	   The outlook for the care of about 500 HIV-positive mothers and
their babies was uncertain, since U.N. funds for the clinic will be
depleted in a few months, said unit co-director James McIntyre.
	   Every day, three HIV-infected babies are born in Soweto, and 20
percent of the mothers who come to the hospital are HIV positive,
McIntyre said. He hopes Chirac's visit will lead the French
government to help fund the unit.

	   KHARKIV, Ukraine (AP) _ Weeping relatives watched as Ukrainian
President Leonid Kuchma and his Polish counterpart Alexander
Kwasniewski laid a capsule and foundation stone Saturday for a new
memorial to Poles killed by Soviet secret police.
	   The solemn ceremony culminated Kwasniewski's two-day visit to
this northeastern industrial town, where he also held talks with
Kuchma on bilateral relations.
	   Soldiers stood an honorary guard as the two presidents formally
launched the new memorial at the Polish-Ukrainian cemetery in
Kharkiv, the last place of rest for some 4,500 Poles killed by
Josef Stalin's secret police during World War II _ part of Stalin's
war against Polish nationalists.
	   Many graves were marked with Polish flags. Hundreds of relatives
of the killed soldiers arrived from Poland. Many were weeping as
they watched the ceremony and later laid flowers on the graves.
	   The summit began Friday with private talks between Kwasniewski
and Kuchma. They later visited the Kharkiv aviation plant and
watched flights of the new Ukrainian-designed An-74 and An-140
airplanes.
	   They also visited the Malyshev military plant, which plans to
launch joint production of Polish Bison agricultural combines. The
sides plan to increase the Ukrainian share of production and bring
it to 1,000 machines a year by 2003.
	   ``This is a good example of practical cooperation,'' Kwasniewski
said.
	   But the summit in Kharkiv, a region that is attracting growing
attention of foreign investors, was not without a sour note.
	   Ukraine has been concerned by recent statements of Polish
officials, who suggested that Warsaw may introduce visas for
Ukrainian travelers following demands from other countries in
Europe.
	   Many Ukrainians engaging in shuttle trade travel back and forth
between their country and Poland. The two nations signed an
agreement on visa-free travel in 1997.
	   Kwasniewski noted Polish plans to join the so-called Schengen
agreement on open borders and said maintaining visa-free regime for
Ukrainians ``would not be a simple task,'' the Interfax news agency
reported. ``We must do everything in order not to introduce visa
regime,'' he said.
	   Kwasniewski also described his vision of Europe's future, saying
Europe was facing ``global competition from other quickly
developing regions in the world.''
	   ``The expansion of NATO and the more integrated European Union
are the best answers of our ancient Euro-Atlantic civilization to
challenges of the future,'' he said Friday in a speech to students
of Kharkiv's National Law Academy.
	   Poland strives for good relations with Russia and at the same
time wants to see Ukraine as a strong sovereign nation, he said,
describing Ukraine as a key element of European stability.

Diana's musical friends star at concert near her grave 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Story will be led around 2200 GMT after concert ends
<TEXT>
	   GREAT BRINGTON, England (AP) _ In the 550-acre (220-hectacre)
estate where Princess Diana was born and is buried, one of her
favorite stars, Chris De Burg ,will sing ``Lady In Red,'' a song
she loved, and ``There's A New Star Up In Heaven,'' the tribute he
wrote after her death.
	   Opera singer Lesley Garrett, cellist Julian Lloyd Webber and pop
singer Sir Cliff Richard will pay their own musical tributes to the
music-loving princess, who died in a Paris car crash on Aug. 31.
	   Richard says he isn't a sentimentalist and will try not to play
on the crowd's emotions at Saturday night's open-air concert in the
grounds of Althorp House in memory of the princess. But with
Diana's brother, Earl Spencer, and two sisters, Lady Sarah
McCorquodale and Lady Jane Fellowes, expected to mingle with the
15,000 concertgoers, emotions may run high.
	   De Burg said he will imagine Diana's spirit enjoying the
concert, which will raise money for the Diana, Princess of Wales
Memorial Fund.
	   ``I believe that spirits are all around us anyway,'' the Irish
singer-songwriter said. ``So I think Diana will be there at the
biggest party in Britain, and I hope she enjoys my performance.''
	   Security around the concert arena will be tight to prevent
anyone from attempting to wander close to the island where Diana is
buried, about a mile (1.6 kms) away, an Althorp spokeswoman said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Many people have criticized the price of tickets _ 39.50 pounds
(dlrs 64.80). Some were upset that it was being held so close to
her grave. Several stars, including Phil Collins, declined to
appear. And Wet, Wet, Wet and Jimmy Nail pulled out because of
other commitments.
	   Richard said he ``could not figure out'' the controversy
surrounding the concert, which was the brainchild of Diana's
brother.
	   ``It is a charity show and I am sick and tired of people saying
there is too much charity going on,'' he told BBC Radio 5 Live on
Saturday. ``It is like saying too many people are dying on the
planet. Well, there will be even more if we don't do these shows.''
	   ``I think we should keep in our memories ... this compassionate,
fragile, rather lovely woman who did a lot of wonderful things,''
Richard said.
	   The concert is being screened on a pay-per-view basis by the
cable company Front Row. Highlights will be shown on BBC television
Wednesday night.
	   The estate, about 75 miles (120 kms) northwest of London, opens
for two months on Wednesday, which would have been Diana's 37th
birthday. Some 150,000 people are expected to tour a new museum
dedicated to her life and view the ornamental island where she is
buried.

Netanyahu suggests Mideast conference on everything but peace process 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A conference sponsored by Europe to discuss
Mideast issues but not the Palestinian-Israeli conflict
specifically would be ``useful,'' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said in an interview published in a Spanish daily
Saturday.
	   With the United States overseeing bilateral talks, it would be
``intelligent'' if Europe ``promoted a regional dialogue on such
questions and arms limitation, water resources and the movement of
people'' Netanyahu was quoted as telling the newspaper ABC.
	   ``No other region has more experience in integration and
cooperation than Europe,'' he said, adding that the region has long
sought a more active role in the peace process.
	   But Netanyahu also expressed resentment of what he termed the
European ``tendency to paint the situation in terms of good guys
and bad guys and put Israel on the side of the bad guys.''
	   This attitude reduced Israel's willingness to welcome European
involvement, the prime minister said.
	   Netanyahu, a member of the Israeli delegation at the 1991
Mideast peace conference in Madrid, said the Spanish capital would
be a good place to hold a regional dialogue.
	   In the interview, Netanyahu also insisted that Israel was
fulfilling its part of the Oslo peace accords and blamed
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat for blocking resolution of the
conflict by not combating terrorism within the territory under his
control.
	   ``He has seven times more police per inhabitant than Israel and
more armed personnel per capita than any other country in the
world. ... He has to chose whether he wants to seal peace with
Israel or with the terrorists from Hamas.''

EDS: UPDATES casualty toll, ADDS location of Adana, details
<TEXT>
	   ADANA, Turkey (AP) _ An earthquake on Saturday shook this
southern city and environs, killing 12 people and causing thousands
of people to flee their homes in panic, a television station
reported.
	   The quake struck at 16:56 p.m. (1356 GMT) and had a preliminary
magnitude of 6.3, Istanbul's Kandilli observatory said.
	   At least 12 people were reported killed, private NTV television
channel said.
	   The NTV said several houses and mosques were damaged by the
quake in Adana, 490 kilometers (306 miles) south of Ankara.
	   The quake also was felt in the southern provinces of Mersin,
Nigde, Kayseri and Antakya.
	   In the Mediterranean port city of Mersin, 68 kilometers (42
miles) west of Adana, the quake caused cracks in several buildings
and residents fled homes in panic.
	   Authorities cut power in Adana and Mersin to prevent fires.
	   Turkey's Aegean and Mediterranean coastal areas and the entire
eastern region sit atop the Anatolian fault.

Hingis reaches final 16; former champion Martinez out play AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: LEADS with minor fire breaking out near grounds, rain halting
By STEPHEN WADE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Fire and rain interrupted play
Saturday at Wimbledon, but they didn't deter Martina Hingis.
	   The defending champion moved into the final 16 with a 6-2, 6-1
victory Saturday over unseeded Elena Likhovtseva of Russia.
	   After struggling in her first two victories, this one on Centre
Court was comfortable. ``The more matches you play, the more
confident you are,'' Hingis said.
	   ``The tennis was a lot different last year,'' the defending
champion went on. ``It was much easier for me to get through the
first couple of rounds.''
	   Play was halted on Court 18 when a fire broke out on the upper
floor of a 12-story apartment building adjacent to the Wimbledon
grounds.
	   Shortly after the fire began at mid-afternoon, play was halted
on all the other courts when predicted showers moved in and halted
play after four hours of tennis under bright sunshine.
	   Officials cleared hundreds of people from the area around the
court as smoke billowed over it with ash and cinders falling on to
an adjoining picnic area.
	   There were no immedaite reports of injury and the fire was
brought under control.
	   Todd Martin and Todd Woodbridge were at 2-2 in the fourth set of
their third-round match when play was stopped.
	   In other early play Saturday former champion and eighth seed
Conchita Martinez was knocked out in the third round by Britain's
Sam Smith 2-6, 6-3, 7-5 in a match continued from Friday.
	   The 26-year-old Smith became the first British woman to reach
the fourth round since two managed it 13 years ago. Virginia Wade
in 1977 was the last British champion.
	   Smith is guaranteed 25,120 pounds (dlrs 41,700) for reaching the
fourth round, which is almost one-fourth of her career earnings.
	   ``I can't even _ I mean _ I can't even imagine that,'' she said.
``That's such a lot of money. I just sounds like a lot of money.''
	   Martinez, with career earning of dlrs 7 million, joined
seven-time champion Steffi Graff _ upset in two sets Friday by
Natasha Zvereva _ as only the second of the top eight seeded women
to lose.
	   Graf, seeded No. 4 and playing only her fifth tournament in a
year filled by knee surgery and other nagging injuries, fell to a
player she'd beaten in all 17 previous matches.
	   Zvereva of Belarus, known mostly as a doubles player _ won with
the ``best match of my life,'' she said.
	   The 29-year-old Graf fended off questions about her future and
waved politely as she left Centre Court. It's match to match now,
she said, and she hedged whether she'd return to Wimbledon.
	   ``That's another year right now,'' said Graf, whose 21 Grand
Slams stand her No. 2 behind Australian Margaret Court.
	   ``I definitely couldn't say right now. It would be nice to play
again. Hopefully, I'd be different, in different shape and enjoy
myself. But I've learned enough to take what's coming up next.''
	   It was only Graf's sixth singles defeat at Wimbledon since she
made her first appearance in 1984 at the age of 15. She had lost
only twice at Wimbledon since 1988.
	   Graf struggled from the beginning in the rain-delayed match on
Centre Court. She double faulted six times, returned poorly and was
often a step behind Zvereva's change-of-pace shots.
	   Graf's 17-0 record against Zvereva had been one of the most
lopsided in tennis including a 6-0, 6-0 hammering of Zvereva in the
1988 French Open final. Zvereva never recovered as a singles player
but has won 18 Grand Slam doubles titles.
	   Friday was the fifth day of Wimbledon and the third cut short by
on-and-off light showers with only a dozen singles matches
completed.
	   In other results, second-seeded Lindsay Davenport moved into the
fourth round with a 6-3, 1-6, 6-2 victory over Maria Alejandra
Vento, while No. 6 Monica Seles was leading Yayuk Basuki 6-2 when
the match was suspended.
	   Among the men, No. 6 Patrick Rafter advanced to the round of 16
by beating Magnus Gustafsson, 6-3, 6-7 (7-9), 6-2, 6-1. No. 14
Goran Ivanisevic completed a 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 6-0 third-round
win over Andrei Medvedev.
	   Defending champion and top seed Pete Sampras never got on court
for a testing third-round match against Sweden's Thomas Enqvist.

Jordan want Lloyds inspectors to leave the country 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan wants U.N.-hired shipping inspectors
to leave the country, Transportation Minister Sami Gammo said
Saturday.
	   The inspectors from Britain's Lloyds Register are charged with
checking that goods landing at the Jordanian port of Aqaba do not
violate U.N. sanctions against Iraq.
	   ``We have suffered enough financial burdens and we feel we
should not be responsible for paying Lloyds to carry out
inspections of cargo destined for Iraq,'' Gammo said. He was
referring to the more than dlrs 5 billion that Jordan estimates it
lost in trade and relief given to refugees during the 1990-91 Gulf
crisis over Kuwait.
	   Gammo declined to say how much Jordan paid Lloyds, but
government officials say it is about dlrs 2 million a year.
	   The minister said the inspectors should be based in Iraq,
``since their mission is to inspect Iraqi and not Jordanian
cargo.''
	   Jordan has allowed Lloyds inspectors to monitor cargo at Aqaba _
which is a lifeline to Iraq and Jordan's only sea outlet _ since
1994. They were brought in under an agreement with the United
Nations that was brokered after widespread accusations that
contraband was arriving in Iraq via Jordan.
	   The United Nations has maintained a sweeping embargo on Iraq
since its troops invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   In the past few years, Jordanian businessmen have complained of
delays in processing their goods because of the Lloyds inspections
at Aqaba.

	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Protesters stoned riot police in the
ethnic Berber capital of Tizi-Ouzou for a second day Saturday, as
local anger simmered over the slaying of Berber singer-activist
Lounes Matoub.
	   Nearly 1,000 youths who gathered outside a hospital to view
Matoub's body tried to build barricades, then clashed with police,
who struck back with clubs and tear gas, residents in the city east
of Algiers said on condition of anonymity.
	   One demonstrator was killed and one was injured in the clashes,
France's LCI television said. The report could not be immediately

Jewish jurists fight Holocaust denial 
</HEADLINE>
By DIMITRA KEHAGIA
<TEXT>
	   SALONICA, Greece (AP) _ Governments must outlaw Holocaust
revisionism in order to fight a high-tech, well financed movement
that denies the Holocaust ever occurred, a group of Jewish legal
experts said Saturday.
	   An international conference of Jewish jurists warned that the
international revisionist movement, using the Internet and an
orchestrated propaganda campaign, could warp the historical memory
of younger generations.
	   ``The denial movement has a historical institute which is
reviewing history and whose real aim is to deny the Holocaust,''
said Itzhak Nener, an Israeli who is deputy president of the
International Association of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists. ``They
have tremendous sums of money.''
	   The legal experts gathered in Salonica, the northern Greek port
city once known as the ``Mother of Israel.'' The Nazis murdered
50,000 of Salonica's Jews during the Holocaust, destroying the
once-thriving community. Today, about 1,000 Jews live in the city.
	   During World War II, Nazi Germany rounded up and killed some 6
million Jews and hundreds of thousands of other people, including
gays, Gypsies, disabled people and political opponents.
	   One aim of the conference is to convince more countries to pass
legislation outlawing Holocaust denial. Several European countries,
including Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France and Luxembourg,
already have such legislation.
	   But Nener and his colleagues said the sentences are too lenient,
and more countries should crack down on people claiming that the
Nazi slaughter of Jews never took place.
	   Holocaust revisionists have been consistently active in America
and Canada, where they have aired their views on the Internet.
	   ``This growing group is using Web sites to make amazingly
ridiculous claims, like that they measured the gas chambers and
found they were not big enough for people,'' said Isidor Wolfe, a
lawyer from Vancouver, Canada.
	   No one should have to prove that the Holocaust took place, the
legal experts say.
	   ``We have evidence so strong it's ridiculous,'' Wolfe said.
``But they target people who are young, who do not have a sense of
history, and they seem to be able to get some of these skin-head
types.''
	   A surge in neo-Nazi activity in Europe and America provides a
dangerous channel for misinformation about the Holocaust.
	   One organization in the U.S. regularly mails ``information
packets'' to college newspapers and takes out advertisements for
videos and books that claim Allied soldiers faked evidence of the
Holocaust.
	   Such historical manipulation has been going on for more than a
decade, the legal experts said. It's even more dangerous because
the target audience is historically ignorant, Nener said. He
pointed to a 1997 U.S. poll that showed about one-fourth of the
population had no knowledge of the Holocaust.
	   The International Association of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists will
hold conferences in more than 20 other European nations to lobby
for more anti-revisionism laws.

	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   Partly cloudy skies prevailed across the U.S. Virgin Islands and
Puerto Rico during the overnight hours. Widely scattered showers
were noted, mainly along the north and east coasts of Puerto Rico

Police block fundamentalists' protest march to Indian embassy 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Police used bamboo sticks to disperse
nearly 2,000 Muslim fundamentalists marching to the Indian embassy
to protest what they say are plans by India's right-wing Hindu
nationalist leaders to build a temple on the site of a demolished
mosque.
	   Police said the protesters were supporters of a local Muslim
religious leader, Ameer Syed Fazlul Karim.
	   After a brief scuffle with police near the Indian embassy, the
protesters ended their march.
	   Earlier, Karim accused India's Bharatiya Janata Party of making
preparations for the construction of a temple at Ayodha, 500
kilometers (300 miles) southeast of New Delhi.
	   The BJP, which leads India's 20-party coalition government, has
been linked to the destruction of the mosque in 1992. The
demolition triggered Hindu-Muslim rioting in Bombay and several
other Indian cities that killed more than 3,000 people.

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ A magazine reported Saturday that the
high-speed train that crashed and killed 100 people June 3 was
stopped by the driver between stations because of a grinding noise
more than two hours before the accident.
	   But Gisela Luening, a prosecutor who is investigating the crash
of InterCity Express 884 in northern Germany, said Saturday that
the train was stopped for personnel reasons. She added that the
halt was not linked with the accident.
	   The Munich-based Focus magazine, quoting unnamed sources in
Germany's border agency, said the train had been stopped for about
3 1-2 minutes after the driver and a conductor heard a grinding
noise. The two employees, suspecting a transmission defect, checked
the train but found nothing wrong, Focus said.
	   The Deutsche Bahn railroad declined to comment on the report.
	   Focus, in its advance of a report to appear in Monday's edition,
said Deutsche Bahn told investigators that the train was halted to
pick up an extra conductor.
	   Heinz-Juergen Fischer, head of a joint commission of several
agencies investigating the crash, was quoted by Focus as saying it
would be unusual to stop between stations, and that details of the
halt need to be cleared up.
	   Investigators have said the later derailment at Eschede, 50
kilometers (30 miles) north of Hanover, probably was caused by a
wheel failure, though they have not determined why the wheel
failed.
	   A steel tire that encased the wheel and helped keep it on the
track broke off about six kilometers (3.7 miles) from the accident
scene and embedded in the train's undercarriage, investigators say.
The train later derailed, jack-knifed and crashed into the concrete
supports of an overpass.
	   Surviving passengers reported hearing a grinding noise before
the crash, but said it came minutes _ not hours _ before the
accident.

<TEXT>
	   THIMPU, Bhutan (AP) _ Television is banned in Bhutan _ except
when the World Cup is on.
	   It seems King Jigme Singhe Wangchuk is an avid soccer fan, so
soccer enthusiasts in the tiny Himalayan kingdom are being allowed
to watch the matches on giant mounted screens.
	   In Thimpu, the Bhutanese capital, the Bhutan Olympic Association
has put up a screen in a sports stadium, according to Kinley Dorji,
editor of the government-owned newspaper.
	   The government also has allowed some private institutions to
show the matches in three other towns, Dorji said.
	   Television has been long forbidden and mass tourism is
discouraged in Bhutan to avoid outside influence on its Buddhist
way of life.
	   Bhutan, wedged between India and China, is a developing country
of 600,000 people where Buddhist tradition remains strong and
serious crime is rare.

	   PARIS (AP) _ He's a 1.93-meter (6-foot-4) midfielder with a
forceful kick and a face that could sell insurance. The first time
Jostein Flo played in the World Cup, it did not go unnoticed.
	   Flo was named ``cutie of the week'' by French sports daily
L'Equipe Saturday. The newspaper invited Nathalie Egli, an agent at
Marilyn Sports that represents top athletes such as boxer Evander
Holyfield, to review players in the World Cup.
	   This week Egli went for a wholesome approach by choosing the
eldest of the Norwegian Flo brothers.
	   ``He's not a very beautiful boy,'' Egli said. ``You wouldn't
look twice if you crossed him in the street, but he seems friendly
and very normal.''
	   Egli gave some ideas as to what kind of commercials she would
choose to enhance Flo's star quality.
	   ``He looks healthy, raised on grains,'' Egli said. ``That's the
perfect profile for a commercial for food, insurance, cars or
pasta.''

	   LONDON (AP) _ An English soccer fan died in a traffic accident
near Calais, France, late Friday following the England-Colombia
World Cup game in nearby Lens.
	   Thirty-eight-year-old Roy Chapman of Chelmsford was walking on
the shoulder of an expressway near the port town after 11 p.m. when
he was hit by a car driven by a Frenchman on his way home from
work, French police and the British Foreign Office said.
	   ``It is a very unfortunate accident and the police in France
will be investigating,'' a Foreign Office spokesman said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   RABAT, Morocco (AP) _ Though he wasn't able to take Morocco to
the second round of the World Cup, coach Henri Michel did well
enough to earn a special honor from King Hassan II.
	   ``As of today you will be an honorary citizen of Morocco,''
Hassan II told the Frenchman at a special homecoming ceremony at
the royal palace Friday.
	   The king was clearly emotional during the ceremony in which he
thanked the Moroccan players for their ``very brilliant'' results
in the first round. Morocco finished with one victory, one draw and
one loss in three games.
	   The king gave Michel a decoration ``that very few non-Moroccans
have.''
	   ``We are not an ungrateful people,'' the king said, ``and we
won't forget what you did for us.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   TOULON, France (AP) _ An English fan has been jailed for two
months for setting fire to a World Cup hotel room.
	   Shaun Hutchinson, 29, from Newcastle, was also ordered to pay
10,000 francs (about dlrs 1,700) in compensation for the damage.
	   Hutchinson, who was charged with willful damage, appeared before
a court in Toulon, a spokesman for the British consulate said.
	   The incident took place June 13.
	   ____ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ A record home viewing audience of 24.2 million
watched England beat Colombia in the World Cup on Friday night, and
untold millions more watched in bars and clubs.
	   The figures revealed that three out of four viewers _ about half
the population _ were glued to the match.
	   The previous record for a televised match was 23.5 million
viewers for the 1996 European Championship showdown between England
and Germany.
	   Another record could fall Tuesday when England meets Argentina
in the second round.

	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ A chartered plane that disappeared
while carrying the U.N. Angola envoy to the Ivory Coast has been
found in a swamp outside Abidjan, a French diplomat said Saturday.
	   The plane was spotted by helicopter near the town of
Bingerville, about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Abidjan, said the
diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said rescuers had
so far been unable to get to the aircraft. He had no further
details.
	   But townspeople in Akoure, about 15 kilometers beyond
Bingerville, said the plane had gone down in a swampy area nearer
to them.
	   ``The town is full of soldiers'' trying to get to the plane,
said Samuel Oura, an employee of the Ivory Coast's national water
company, speaking in a brief telephone interview. He said both
French and Ivorian soldiers were involved in the operation.

Smith becomes first British woman in fourth round since '85 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ For the last several years, British
men Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski have been the local story at
Wimbledon.
	   Now a British woman _ Samantha Smith _ has broken through.
	   Smith, 26, ousted No. 8 seed and former champion Conchita
Martinez 2-6, 6-3, 7-5 on Saturday to become the first British
woman to advance to the fourth round since Anne Hobbs and Jo Durie
in 1985.
	   She's also the first British woman since Virginia Wade in 1977
to beat a top 10 opponent at Wimbledon. Wade won Wimbledon that
year, the last British singles champion.
	   Smith will face 16th seeded Nathalie Tauziat of France in the
fourth round.
	   ``It was a great match,'' said Smith, who admitted she was
inspired by England's overnight 2-0 victory over Colombia in the
World Cup, which moved England into the second round. ``I played
some of my best tennis I've ever played.''
	   Last year at the U.S. Open, Smith won just one game from the
Spaniard. So what happened?
	   ``I'd qualified, and to go from playing people ranked around 100
to suddenly playing someone in the top 10 is such a shock,'' she
explained. ``The last few weeks I've been playing people around 50,
40, 20, and it doesn't seem so much of a jump.''
	   Smith, who won three straight games to level the match after
play had been suspended overnight by rain, also won the last three
games of the deciding set, dropping just three points.
	   So what went wrong for Martinez?
	   ``Pretty much everything,'' Martinez said. ``I played really,
really badly today. I didn't return well and I couldn't break her
serve. I was really rushed and just couldn't play.''
	   ``I was rushed the whole morning and that showed in my whole
mood,'' she added. ``I didn't feel I was there. She played well,
but I didn't do much today.''
	   Now Smith has the chance to play on a major showcourt at
Wimbledon,. She also gains valuable ranking points to put herself
into the top 60.
	   And the money. Smith earned the biggest pay check of her career.
To many of the millionaire players, the 25,120 pounds (dlrs 41,700)
for reaching the fourth round is loose change. But not for Smith.
	   ``I can't even _ I can't even imagine that,'' she exclaimed.
``That's such a lot of money. I can't think what I would do with
it.''
	   Smith may have also boosted the sagging women's game in Britain,
where she is the only player ranked in the top 100. Three others
are ranked above 200.
	   ``I think that my win will really give women's tennis a boost in
this country,'' Smith said. ``If people can see that I can do it,
they're going to go out there and think that they can do it too.''

Spanish build fence around enclave in Morocco

<TEXT>
	   MELILLA, Spain (AP)_ Illegal immigrants seeking entry into the
Spanish north African enclave of Melilla will soon have to scale
two high fences.
	   The three-meter (9-feet) fences are being put up along Melilla's
10-kilometer (6-mile) frontier with Morocco in order to discourage
would be immigrants from entering the Spanish territory, the
national news agency EFE reported Saturday.
	   Melilla, located on north Africa's northern coast, attracts
thousands of illegal immigrants every year. Some seek to make the
short but dangerous boat trip over the Mediterranean to southern
Spain, while others remain in the enclave city.
	   Immigration into Melilla was cut dramatically several months ago
because the Spanish government sent troops to support the Civil
Guard border controls.
	   The perimeter fence will allow the troops to withdraw, EFE
quoted the local Interior Ministry representative Enrique Beamud as
saying.
	   Construction began in April and should be finished by the end of
the year costing about 1.5 billion pesetas (dlrs 100 million),
Beamud said according to EFE.
	   The two fences are separated by five meters (yards) of no-mans
land where only Civil Guards will be permitted to be, EFE reported.

World Cup: Kluivert back but not sure of a place in Dutch lineup 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Sports-Soccer-Netherlands-Stam.
By MIKE CORDER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LA TURBIE, Monaco (AP) _ AC Milan striker Patrick Kluivert is
available again for the Netherlands. Now he has to hope coach Guus
Hiddink will select him for the second round match against
Yugoslavia.
	   ``My form has been good in training,'' Kluivert said Saturday.
``I really want to play.''
	   Kluivert was handed a two-match suspension for elbowing Belgian
defender Lorenzo Staelens in the Netherlands' opening Group E match
in Paris.
	   In his absence, Hiddink shunted defensive midfielder Phillip
Cocu into a striking role and he scored a goal in each game _
against South Korea and Mexico.
	   Juventus star Edgar Davids, who filled Cocu's midfield spot,
also played well, making it difficult for Hiddink to alter his
lineup for Monday's match in Toulouse.
	   Hiddink Saturday refused to say who would play. But he has
praised the way Kluivert has worked hard to stay in shape since the
red card against Belgium.
	   The Dutch were training behind closed doors Saturday before
leaving for Toulouse Sunday.
	   Midfielder Ronald de Boer believes Kluivert should be in the
side.
	   ``He has got much better in the week and a half (since his red
card),'' De Boer said.
	   ``Patrick is in great form. In our World Cup warm-ups and in
training he has looked really sharp. You must have a striker who
scores and Patrick can do that.''
	   Kluivert was hoping to use the World Cup to showcase his talents
to potential buyers as he seeks a transfer from Milan, where he has
had an unhappy time and has become a target for abuse from the
fans. English clubs including Manchester United and Arsenal
reportedly are interested in him.
	   Kluivert, who turns 22 next week, shot to fame when he scored
the only goal in 1995's European Cup final as Ajax Amsterdam beat
AC Milan 1-0.
	   But since then his career and private life have been in a
downward spiral. He was convicted in 1996 of vehicular homicide and
accused _ but never charged _ in an alleged gang rape in Amsterdam
last year.

Precede PRISTINA Fighting intensifies in Kosovo amid signs of Serb buildup guerrillas, color, other new material throughout; changes dateline.

	   PANTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav army guns bombarded rebel
positions in central Kosovo on Saturday in escalated fighting
accompanying an apparent buildup of government forces in the
violence-stricken Serbian province.
	   A day after U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke ended four days of
shuttle diplomacy in the region, there were signs the conflict may
be intensifying _ amid fears of another Serb offensive.
	   Despite Holbrooke's warning to Serb forces and ethnic Albanian
guerrillas that their next major clash could have ``tragic
consequences,'' a new round of fighting erupted in this central
town of 1,000, with other skirmishes reported elsewhere.
	   And in a move that shows Kosovo's Albanians are increasingly
supportive of fighting the Serbs, several top politicians founded a
new movement intended to serve as the political wing of the
once-isolated guerrillas.
	   More than 300 people have died in Kosovo since early March in
stepped-up fighting that began after Serbian police launched a
crackdown against secessionist militants, led by the shadowy Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   International officials are particularly concerned about the
worsening trouble spot of Kijevo, southwest of Pristina. Fighting
has increased in recent days around the village, a key crossroads
on the main east-west road between Pristina and the city of Pec.
	   Access to Kijevo was limited Saturday due to the clashes. But a
new flashpoint was erupting to the north in Pantina, a mixed town
of Serbs and Albanians which houses a Yugoslav army base.
	   Explosions and the rattle of heavy machine-gun fire and small
arms could be heard on two sides of Pantina from Friday afternoon
to Saturday afternoon. At least six columns of smoke rose from the
edge of the town, just 25 kilometers (15 miles) west of the
provincial capital Pristina.
	   Green infantry fighting vehicles armed with anti-tank missiles
and double-barreled anti-aircraft guns fired periodic barrages into
the town from a ridge surrounding Pantina.
	   Ethnic Albanians, armed with shotguns and hunting rifles,
control at least half the town.
	   Sentries who denied access to the town to journalists said a
column of KLA fighters was battling the army less than a kilometer
(half-mile) southwest of the village.
	   Two Albanian villagers trying to lead reporters within sight of
what they said were military vehicles were arrested Saturday by
police. The men, in their mid-20s, were forced into an abandoned
building and reporters were told to leave immediately.
	   The latest fighting comes amid reports the Yugoslav army is
bolstering the Serb-led force in Kosovo _ already estimated at a
combined 45,000 to 50,000 including Serb police. Western diplomats
speaking on condition of anonymity say the latest concentrations of
tanks near rebel strongholds and movement of troops could foretell
another crackdown.
	   The province's majority ethnic Albanians have become more
supportive of the KLA in the face of increased Serb firepower, and
more dissatisfied with Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, who favors a
pacifist approach to gain independence.
	   On Saturday, several officials once loyal to Rugova _ including
his former top aide Hidajet Hiseni and prominent activist Rexhep
Qosja _ founded the Albanian Democratic Movement with the aim of
uniting radicals.
	   Rugova has admitted having no influence over the KLA.
	   ``Albanians in Kosovo can now be proud that our sons on the
ground defend their people and fight for a Kosovo where Albanians
would no longer be prosecuted but can decide themselves about their
destiny,'' Qosja said at the founding convention in Pristina.
	   The convention stopped short of calling itself the KLA's
political wing. But Adem Demaci, already leader of the radical
Parliamentary party, said as a guest at the convention that ``our
boys on the ground who fight and shed blood for freedom should
serve as an example to us.''
	   ``We will help them if we unite,'' Demaci said. ``Serbia will
have to chose whether it wants to negotiate or make war with
Albanians.''
	   Western nations blame the Serbs for this year's upturn in
violence, which has driven tens of thousands of Albanians from
their homes, but also oppose independence for Kosovo for fear it
would trigger a wider Balkan war.
	   They want Milosevic to give back the autonomy he took away from
Kosovo in 1989.

Spanish build fences around enclave in Morocco

	   MELILLA, Spain (AP)_ Illegal immigrants seeking entry into the
Spanish north African enclave of Melilla will soon have to scale
two high fences.
	   The three-meter (9-feet) fences are being put up along Melilla's
10-kilometer (6-mile) frontier with Morocco to discourage would-be
immigrants from entering the Spanish territory, the national news
agency EFE reported Saturday.
	   Melilla, on Africa's northern coast, attracts thousands of
illegal immigrants every year. Some seek to make the short but
dangerous boat trip over the Mediterranean to southern Spain, while
others remain in the enclave city.
	   Immigration into Melilla was cut dramatically several months ago
because the Spanish government sent troops to support the Civil
Guard border controls.
	   The perimeter fence will allow the troops to withdraw, EFE
quoted local Interior Ministry representative Enrique Beamud as
saying.
	   Construction began in April and should be finished by the end of
the year. The cost is about 1.5 billion pesetas (dlrs 100 million),
Beamud was quoted as saying.
	   The two fences are separated by five meters (yards) of no-man's
land where only Civil Guards will be permitted, EFE reported.

	   LENS, France (AP) _ ``Is there a war in France?'' Matthew, a
young English fan asked early Saturday, as rows of riot police
armed with rubber bullets and tear gas watched the crowds after a
high-risk World Cup match attended by Prince Charles.
	   ``It really wasn't worth the trouble to bring all that out,'' he
said. ``The only problems you risk having are drunken guys angry
about getting that kind of police reception.''

Sepp Blatter, head of the international soccer federation FIFA,

hooligan among the Argentines.''

Jamaica prepares to welcome home its Reggae Boyz 
</HEADLINE>
By LLOYD WILLIAMS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Jamaicans prepared to welcome home
their Reggae Boyz Saturday, still buoyant over the nation's first
appearance at the World Cup and their win Friday over Japan.
	   ``The Reggae Boyz have done us proud,'' said Prime Minister P.J.
Patterson. ``No country with a population of our size has ever
qualified for World Cup. They have been a credit to our country.''
	   The people of the Caribbean island have taken an emotional
roller-coaster ride on the successes and failures of their soccer
team. Euphoria took over when the popular Reggae Boyz clinched a
berth in France in a home match tie with Mexico in November.
Patterson declared the following day a national holiday and players
on the team were each given a plot of land for a home site.
	   Those same spirits sagged when Jamaica lost to Croatia and
Argentina, the two teams from its group that advanced. But
happiness returned with a 2-1 victory Friday over Japan.
	   Celebrants filled the streets, tooting car horns and flashing
lights.
	   ``The entire nation shared in the moments of defeat. We are now
elated by this victory and proudly share their moment of triumph
and glory,'' the Prime Minister said.
	   Not only did the Jamaica team defeat an island nation much
larger and wealthier, but it also served as good ambassadors for
the country with their conduct on and off the field, Patterson
said.
	   Jamaica was the first Caribbean team to qualify for the World
Cup in 24 years.
	   A crowd is expected to greet the team when it arrives home
Saturday night.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Prince Charles marveled at the design of
a new 17-kilometer (10-mile) suspension bridge over Lisbon's River
Tagus on Saturday, the first day of his weekend visit to Portugal.
	   The sleek, white bridge, named Vasco da Gama as part of this
year's 500th anniversary celebrations of the Portuguese
adventurer's discovery of a sea route to India, was designed by
British company Trafalgar House.
	   The prince's motorcade stopped halfway across to take in the
panoramic view of Lisbon on the north bank, said a spokeswoman for
the Portuguese Foreign Ministry who was accompanying him.
	   Prince Charles, who was traveling alone, also visited a
refurbished Roman Catholic church in the riverside town of
Alcochete where he was greeted by the town band and children with
flowers.
	   Later, he was due to have dinner with President Jorge Sampaio at
Lisbon's Coach Museum.
	   On Sunday, Prince Charles was scheduled to attend the United
Kingdom national day at the Expo 98 world's fair in the Portuguese
capital.

Campbell snatches lead in French Open golf AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By ALAN PAGE
<TEXT>
	   GUYANCOURT, Paris (AP) _ Michael Campbell emerged from a
two-year slump to roll in a four-meter (thirteen-foot) eagle putt
at the 18th and grab a share of the lead in the dlrs 800,000 French
Open on Saturday.
	   The resurgent 29-year-old New Zealander shot a three-under-par
69 over the 6,510-meter (7,112-yard) National Golf track to tie
overnight leader Sam Torrance from Scotland on 10-under overall at
206.
	   Torrance had a 72.
	   ``Surprisingly after all I've been through I feel very
comfortable, '' Campbell said. '' This is a huge step for me. It's
all a question of perseverance.''
	   The young Maori whose great-great-great grandfather Sir Logan
Campbell emigrated from Edinburgh, Scotland to become mayor of
Aukland, New Zealand, led the 1995 British Open in Saint Andrews
after three rounds only to tie third.
	   ``I was already dreaming of getting my hands on the
claret-jug,'' Campbell now admits.
	   He suffered tendinitis in his left wrist at the end of 1995 and
subsequently lost confidence and forfeited his Tour Card in 1996.
	   ``I was beating my head against a wall for two years and
thinking about having to sell golf-balls for a living,'' Campbell
said. ``But things have turned round. I've got a new coach and the
bad times are behind me.''
	   Overnight leader Torrance was still upbeat. ``To still lead
after two double-bogeys isn't bad. I'm still swinging great and
feel good about Sunday.''
	   England's David Howell and Australian Matthew Goggin both shot
69s to tie third slot two shots back at 208.
	   Germany's Bernhard Langer made a move with a 68 which pulled him
into a four-way tie for fifth a further shot back at 209.
	   Tom Gillis from Lake Orio, Michigan shot a 66 to jump into a
share of fifth at 209.
	   Gillis had seven birdies and only one bogey in his 66.
	   Colin Montgomerie who boasted Friday he could shoot two 64s to
win trailed in with a 73 Saturday to tie 37th at 215, nine shots
off the pace.
	   ``It's too little, too late isn't it?'' Montgomerie said.

Bosnian Croats inaugurate new party 
</HEADLINE>
By AIDA CERKEZ
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnian Croat politicians
who recently split with the ruling Croat Democratic Union
inaugurated their own party Saturday, just in time to register for
September elections.
	   The New Croat Initiative, a party formed by mainly Croats from
the central and northern parts of Bosnia, will offer the Bosnian
Croat population a political alternative to the so-far monopolistic
Croat Democratic Union.
	   The Croat Democratic Union is a branch of the ruling party in
neighboring Croatia, run by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman,
which wants the southern Herzegovina region to secede and join
Croatia.
	   Such a splintering of Bosnia would contradict the war-ending
Dayton peace agreement. It also would leave Croats elsewhere in
Bosnia as a minority among Muslims and Serbs.
	   Those Croats, led by Kresimir Zubak, a member of the country's
joint presidency, turned their back on Tudjman a few weeks ago and
changed their goals.
	   The new party's political platform envisages ``the development
of love toward the homeland,'' this time Bosnia instead of Croatia.
	   It also supports free media, fair privatization, refugee returns
and equal rights throughout the country _ views shared by
international officials.
	   Hanns Schumacher, the deputy to Bosnia's top international
official Carlos Westendorp, was present at the inauguration session
and expressed support for the new initiative, which is ``speeding
up the democratic process among Croats.''
	   He said the establishment of the new party comes at an important
moment for Bosnia.
	   September elections will determine where the country will go for
the next four years. So far, it has been run by nationalist parties
which by definition could not bring unity to the people.
	   When he announced his intention to form a new party a few weeks
ago, Zubak said it would be ``a Croat national, but not
nationalistic party, and will not be closed for other nations in
Bosnia.''
	   International officials welcome every move that drives local
politics away from nationalism and supports the peace agreement
accords.

Jiang stands ground as Clinton participates in Tiananmen ceremony With Clinton-China An AP News Analysis AP Special Correspondent 
</HEADLINE>
By WALTER R. MEARS
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ It lasted only 11 minutes _ the boom of the
saluting cannon, the flashing bayonets and cadenced shouts of
troops as they fast-marched in review _ but the image of U.S.
President Bill Clinton's disputed welcome to China in Tiananmen
Square will linger politically.
	   Clinton sought to deal with the complaints back home by giving a
human rights lecture to his Chinese host, invoking the haunted past
of the square, saying that the Beijing government was wrong to set
troops against democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen nine years ago.
	   Chinese President Jiang Zemin seemed to relish another
opportunity to explain and defend the decision to confront
pro-Democracy activists, causing the death of hundreds or thousands
of Chinese. Civil stability was at risk, said Jiang, and resolute
action was necessary.
	   So the leaders debated human rights, again, as they had after
their Washington summit in 1997. Their joint statement Saturday
agreed on human rights in principal, but the words didn't cover
their differences on what that means.
	   The Tiananmen welcome had become a symbol of those differences
long before Clinton arrived here.
	   At first word of Beijing's summit welcoming plans, complaints
came from liberals and rebukes from Republicans over White House
agreement to the Chinese ceremony in the sprawling square, vast
theater for the democracy movement crushed by the army on and after
June 4, 1989.
	   The United States invoked sanctions that remain in force, and
diplomatic relations suffered for years. Clinton's is the first
presidential visit since.
	   Republicans said he shouldn't go, because of congressional
investigations into technology dealings with China. And that he
certainly shouldn't go to Tiananmen. The House overwhelmingly
adopted a resolution against the ceremony in the square. The
critics said Clinton was too compliant, too willing to bow to
Beijing's wishes.
	   Clinton replied that it was only protocol, that he cared more
about substance and that he would take the occasion to press
Chinese leaders in the cause of human rights. And that he did.
	   There was plenty of irony for the occasion.
	   As a candidate, Clinton accused President George Bush of
coddling tyrants with his China policy, of caring more about aging
dictators than about the fallen democracy demonstrators. As
president, Clinton tied normal trade relations with China to human
rights there, then reversed himself and ended the legal link,
saying other avenues of persuasion would be more effective.
	   The detractors said it was only talk, with nothing to back it.
	   Not that they have come up with a clear formula on something to
do instead. The annual debate on China's trade status _ one is
coming up in July _ stirs congressional complaints about human
rights abuses but ends with renewal, as is virtually certain again.
	   While Clinton defended his appearance in the square, White House
sensitivity on the subject showed in an official schedule that
avoided mentioning the site. It said the state arrival ceremony was
at the East Plaza, Great Hall of the People. It was, indeed: That
is the edge of Tiananmen Square.
	   Clinton and Jiang stood on a small platform 50 yards in front of
the Great Hall, with a military band to the right, massed troops
before them, Chinese soldiers, sailors and airmen striding across,
rifles at the ready, from the left. Clinton was solemn, jaw set, as
he walked with Jiang along red carpet to review the troops. Then
they entered the Great Hall for their summit session, concluded
with a statement that included a joint affirmation of a
``commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights and
fundamental freedoms,'' with an acknowledgment of differences on
the issue.
	   In other words, that means one thing to Clinton, another to
Jiang.
	   ``As China and the United States have different social systems,
ideologies, values and cultural traditions, we have some difference
of views on certain issues,'' said Jiang in explaining why it was
so easy for Clinton and him to agree to disagree. ``However, they
should not become the obstacles in the way of the growth of
China-U.S. relations. ... The development paths of the countries of
the world should be chosen by the peoples of the countries
concerned.''
	   In Tiananmen Square, Clinton said, he had thought of the echoes
of China's past there, and of the people who raised their voices
there for democracy.
	   ``I believe, and the American people believe, that the use of
force and the tragic loss of life was wrong,'' he said as Jiang
listened at the lectern beside his. ``I believe, and the American
people believe, that freedom of speech, association and religion
are ... the rights of people everywhere and should be protected by
their governments.''
	   His words were broadcast on Chinese television, but meant as
well for another audience, in America. In response, Jiang was
unyielding. ``Had the Chinese government not taken the resolute
measures then, we could not enjoy the stability that we are
enjoying today,'' he said.
	   Nothing settled, dialogue gained, which Clinton said was in
itself a mark of progress in relations with China. And an answer,
in advance, to American critics of the China policy that took him
to Tiananmen.

Precede PRISTINA Fighting intensifies in Kosovo amid signs of Serb buildup movement linked to guerrillas, color, other new material.

	   PANTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Yugoslav army bombarded rebel
positions in central Kosovo on Saturday in escalated fighting
alongside an apparent buildup of government forces in the
violence-stricken Serbian province.
	   A day after U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke ended four days of
shuttle diplomacy in the region, there were signs that the conflict
may be intensifying amid fears of another Serb offensive.
	   Despite Holbrooke's warning to Serb forces and ethnic Albanian
guerrillas that their next major clash could have ``tragic
consequences,'' a new round of fighting erupted in the central town
of 1,000, Pantina, with other skirmishes reported elsewhere.
	   And in a move that shows Kosovo's ethnic Albanians are
increasingly supportive of fighting the Serbs, several top
politicians founded a new movement intended to serve as the
political wing of the once-isolated guerrillas.
	   More than 300 people have died in Kosovo since early March in
stepped-up fighting that began after Serbian police cracked down on
secessionist militants led by the shadowy Kosovo Liberation Army.
Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs in Kosovo 9-to-1, but the Serbs
consider the province the cradle of their culture.
	   Western nations blame the Serbs for the upturn in violence,
which has driven tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians from their
homes, but oppose independence for Kosovo for fear of triggering a
wider Balkan war. They want Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
to give back the autonomy he took away from Kosovo in 1989.
	   International officials are particularly concerned about the
worsening trouble spot of Kijevo, southwest of Pristina. Fighting
has increased in recent days around the village, a key crossroads
on the main east-west road between Pristina and the city of Pec.
	   Access to Kijevo was limited Saturday by the clashes. But a new
flashpoint was erupting to the north in Pantina, a mixed town of
Serbs and ethnic Albanians which houses a Yugoslav army base.
	   Explosions and the rattle of heavy machine-gun fire and small
arms could be heard on two sides of Pantina from Friday afternoon
to Saturday afternoon. At least six columns of smoke rose from the
edge of the town, just 25 kilometers (15 miles) west of Pristina,
the provincial capital.
	   Green infantry fighting vehicles armed with anti-tank missiles
and double-barreled anti-aircraft guns fired periodic barrages into
the town from a ridge surrounding Pantina.
	   Ethnic Albanians, armed with shotguns and hunting rifles,
control at least half the town.
	   Sentries who denied access to the town to journalists said a
column of KLA fighters was battling the army less than a kilometer
(half-mile) southwest of the village.
	   Two Albanian villagers trying to lead reporters within sight of
what they said were military vehicles were arrested Saturday. The
men, in their mid-20s, were forced into an abandoned building and
reporters were told to leave immediately.
	   The latest fighting comes amid reports the Yugoslav army is
bolstering the Serb-led force in Kosovo _ already estimated at a
combined 45,000 to 50,000 including Serb police. Western diplomats
speaking on condition of anonymity say the latest concentrations of
tanks near rebel strongholds and movement of troops could foretell
another crackdown.
	   The province's majority ethnic Albanians have become more
supportive of the KLA in the face of increased Serb firepower, and
more dissatisfied with Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, who favors a
pacifist approach to gain independence.
	   On Saturday, several officials once loyal to Rugova _ including
his former top aide Hidajet Hiseni and prominent activist Rexhep
Qosja _ founded the Albanian Democratic Movement with the aim of
uniting radicals.
	   Rugova has admitted having no influence over the KLA.
	   ``Albanians in Kosovo can now be proud that our sons on the
ground defend their people and fight for a Kosovo where Albanians
would no longer be prosecuted but can decide themselves about their
destiny,'' Qosja said at the founding convention in Pristina.
	   The convention stopped short of calling itself the KLA's
political wing. But Adem Demaci, already leader of the radical
Parliamentary party, said as a guest at the convention that ``our
boys on the ground who fight and shed blood for freedom should
serve as an example to us.''
	   ``We will help them if we unite,'' Demaci said. ``Serbia will
have to chose whether it wants to negotiate or make war with
Albanians.''

World Cup: Everybody loves their own team _ and Brazil AP Special Correspondent 
</HEADLINE>
By MORT ROSENBLUM
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Everybody at the World Cup, it seems, has two
favorite teams: their own and Brazil. Whether its their flashy
football or the carnival behind it, Brazilians are the stars.
	   ``French people especially always smile and want to talk soccer
when I say I'm from Brazil,'' said Frida Baranek, a sculptor living
in Paris. ``They love our team. Everyone does.''
	   No doubt about that.
	   France's authoritive sports newspaper, ``L'Equipe,'' devoted a
116-page special edition magazine to the country that has won four
World Cups and shuts down whenever its team plays a game.
	   Ronaldo, the hot young striker seen as a successor to Pele,
appears in ads, on magazine covers, on posters, on T-shirts. So do
a handful of his teammates.
	   Paris is turning over its streets this week for a Brazilian
Festival, complete with Chico Buarque and Gilberto Gil. A radio
station offers a selection of Ronaldo's favorite music.
	   And every time Brazil plays, the stadium is an impromptu party.
	   A small band of women in tanga string bikinis and glitter who
samba through the crowds make the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders seem
ready for the convent. Drums and tambourines follow behind.
	   ``Brazil is always a party,'' said Henri Michel, the French
coach whose team eliminated Brazil in 1986. The ultimate French
dream is a France-Brazil final.
	   Even when they lose, Brazilians manage to find fun in soccer.
Opponents call them good sports in a game where competition is
fierce.
	   When Norway beat Brazil, 2-1, in Marseille last week, the
jubilant victors toured the field to bask in applause. Brazilians
cheered almost as loud as the Norwegians.
	   Afterward, Luciana Alvez, 26, a Sao Paulo lawyer ablaze in green
and yellow, could barely speak after all the screaming. She showed
no sign of the wounded pride that is common after matches.
	   ``We deserved to lose,'' she said, launching into a detailed
technical explanation of what she called strategic errors. ``Every
Brazilian knows this except our (expletive deleted) coach.''
	   Brazilians love soccer, she said, because everyone understands
something about it. Poor kids can kick a ball around their favelas
and dream of glory. And, mostly, it's an excuse to party.
	   Antonio Vasconcelos, who owns a radio station in Parana, sat
alone with a smile on his face. Brazil had already qualified for
its next round. What difference did a loss make?
	   ``Football is for having fun, not just to attack,'' he said.
``For us, football and samba and music are all mixed together. We
like to have fun, and the feeling is infectious.''
	   The Norwegians, meantime, had gone into a frenzy. It was not so
much that they won a game. They had beaten Brazil at the World Cup.
	   Erik Strand, a 28-year-old student with wild hair, swayed back
and forth in a doorway, flapping his Norway scarf in the air and
grinning. ``Can you imagine?'' he said. ``Brazil.''
	   Frida Baranek, who does not particularly like soccer, loves to
watch her team play. Beyond a feeling of national pride, she likes
the moves.
	   ``They have a special way of playing, like dancing,'' she
explained. ``There is a way you move your waist, your body. It is
beautiful to watch.''
	   Foreigners appreciate this, she added, but there is more.
	   ``Brazil is so far away, and we're a neutral country,'' she
said. ``No one is against Brazil. You see all this trouble with the
English, the Germans. We just have a good time.''
	   Most others seem to as well.
	   When Jeannette Hermann, an American astrologer, looked for a
World Cup present at a sports store in the Provence city of
Draguignan, she found only T-shirts for France, Italy and Brazil.
	   She asked the French salesclerk for advice on which to buy, and
the woman answered without a pause: ``Brazil, of course.''

Guinea-Bissau rebels execute army base commander 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BISSAU, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ Troops loyal to Guinea-Bissau's
breakaway military have executed an army base commander in the
central town of Bafata, witnesses and a rebel military officer said
Saturday.
	   The commander, whose name was not immediately available, was
shot and killed when he failed to pledge support for former army
chief of staff Brig. Ansumane Mane's renegade forces, a rebel
officer said on condition of anonymity.
	   Guinea-Bissau's army is split between troops aligned with
besieged President Joao Bernardo Vieira and Mane's rebellion.
	   About half of the 200 soldiers at Bafata's military base have
sided with Mane, while the other half apparently have remained
neutral, the rebel officer said.
	   Bafata is about 140 kilometers (85 miles) northeast of the
embattled capital of Bissau.
	   The commander, shot with an assault rifle near the base, was
reportedly trying to convince the neutral troops to side with
Vieira.
	   A coup attempt by Mane earlier this year has degenerated into
virtual civil war in and around Bissau.
	   With peace talks making little progress, the fighting has become
a slug match as both sides exchange daily artillery and rocket
fire.
	   Loyalist forces control the city center, while the rebels are
dug in around the airport and a key military garrison on the city's
northern limits.
	   Vieira, encamped in Bissau, is relying on the support of troops
from neighboring Senegal and the Republic of Guinea.
	   On Friday, Vieira said he would be willing to accept additional
help from other West African countries, including a coalition
intervention force fighting under the banner of the Economic
Community of West African States.
	   Known as ECOMOG and typically led by Nigeria, similar coalition
armies have intervened to stop fighting in recent years in Sierra
Leone and Liberia.

Prescott latest to swap allegiance to Ireland 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HULL, England (AP) _ Hull Sharks fullback Steve Prescott will
bolster the Irish rugby league reprentative stocks after a switch
of allegiance Saturday.
	   Prescott, who made two appearances for England in 1996, has
decided to play for Ireland against France and Scotland in
November.
	   Prescott, who made his name in rugby league playing for St
Helens, qualifies to play for Ireland under the League's
grandparent ruling.
	   He joins a list of players including Gary Connolly, Adrian
Morely, Tommy Martyn and Mick Cassidy, who have played for Ireland
after representing England.
	   Ireland coach Steve O'Neill said Prescott's defection would
strengthen the Irish squad for the triangular tournament.

World Cup: Italy defeats Norway 1-0 in second round 
</HEADLINE>
By PIERO VALSECCHI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Christian Vieri scored his
tournament-high fifth goal in the 18th minute as Italy defeated
Norway 1-0 Saturday to advance to the quarterfinals of the World
Cup.
	   Italy, which will face either France or Paraguay at Saint-Denis
on Friday, advanced by choking the high-ball, set-piece attack that
had earned the Norwegians their best-ever World Cup showing.
	   Defenders Fabio Cannavaro and Giuseppe Bergomi kept a body on
tall striker Tore Andre Flo, and goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca made
a great diving save on Flo's header in the 71st minute to preserve
the lead.
	   The goal came on a classic Italian counterattack. Luigi Di
Biagio sent a long through ball ahead to Vieri, who out-paced
defender Dan Eggen and fought off the defender's clutches to drive
a right-footed shot past goalkeeper Frode Grodas.
	   The five goals for the 24-year-old Vieri, who had only two goals
in eight career appearances for Italy before the start of the World
Cup, moved him ahead of Argentina's Gabriel Batistuta as the
tournament's leading scorer.
	   On a very hot day at the Stade Velodrome _ spectators were
warned before kickoff to keep themselves well hydrated _ Norway's
best shot on goal in the first half came when Havard Flo's 20-meter
drive was pushed away by Pagliuca in the 14th minute.
	   But Pagliuca saved his best moment for the second half, diving
to the right to gather Tore Andre Flo's close-range header off a
cross from Erik Mykland in the 71st minute.
	   Grodas made three fine saves for Norway, one off Dino Baggio's
header following a corner kick in the 37th minute and two off
Alessandro Del Piero on counterattacks in the 41st and in
first-half injury time.
	   Italy is 3-0 against Norway in World Cup play, including a 1-0
victory in the 1994 World Cup in the United States.

World Cup: Ticket allocation causes concern quotes. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Recasts lead, adds sports minister quotes, cuts FA security
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain's sports minister Tony Banks Saturday said
the government would step into the World Cup ticket allocation
fiasco if England's Football Association needed support.
	   England's ticketshare of 2,049 for Tuesday's World Cup match
against Argentina was its smallest to date, sparking fears of a
rush on blackmarket tickets creating trouble among frustrated fans.
	   Banks said England and Argentina should each have been allocated
10,000 tickets for the St Etienne match.
	   Banks, who tips England to win the World Cup if it beats
Argentina, said the government backed the FA's bid to get more
tickets.
	   ``If the FA want us to do more, then they only need to ask,'' he
said.
	   The fact that England players are promising revenge for the
infamous loss to Argentina in 1986, when Diego Maradona's ``hand of
God'' goal led to England's exit, has increased stakes in the game.
	   England's Football Association deputy chief executive Pat Smith
said the FA was trying to negotiate more tickets for the St Etienne
match.
	   England was initially allocated 3,700 tickets for the game in
Marseille, 2,700 for Toulouse and 2,500 for Lens but the figures
rose to 7,300, 3,300 and 4,400 after FA intervention.
	   Smith said the reasons for England's small allocation were the
capacity of the stadium (36,000), pre-planned security
arrangements, and increased international demand for tickets.
	   Many England fans bought black market tickets for group games
because allocations were limited following a controversial decision
to give 60 percent of the tickets to the French market.
	   Kevin Miles, coordinator of the Football Supporters' Association
mobile ``fans' embassy'' in France, said Tuesday's allocation was
typical of the ticket fiasco throughout the tournament.
	   ``There is clearly an exceptional demand among England fans to
get to the games,'' he said.
	   ``The fact that they cannot use legitimate means does not stifle
demand, and once again the vast majority of England fans will have
paid considerably over the odds for the tickets.''

	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ A chartered plane that disappeared
while carrying the U.N. Angola envoy to the Ivory Coast crashed
into a swamp outside Abidjan, a French diplomat said Saturday.
	   The plane was spotted from a helicopter near the town of
Bingerville, about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Abidjan, said the
diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said rescuers had
so far been unable to get to the aircraft but they could see no
signs of life. He had no further details.

Dominican president continues string of meetings on drug issue 
</HEADLINE>
By JOSE P. MONEGRO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Colombia and the
Dominican Republic expected to sign agreements to fight drug
trafficking and encourage tourism during a 24-hour visit by
Colombian President Ernesto Samper.
	   Samper and Dominican President Leonel Fernandez also planned to
sign a deal that will send Colombian oil to the Caribbean island
nation at preferential prices, according to Dominican Foreign
Relations Secretary Eduardo Latorre.
	   Samper was scheduled to arrive in Santo Domingo Saturday
afternoon and leave Sunday. For Fernandez, it will be his third
meeting with another president in the last month to discuss the
drug issue.
	   In addition to meeting with Fernandez, Samper had an appointment
with former president Joaquin Balaguer.
	   While Fernandez was preparing to sign an agreement to fight drug
trafficking, the chief of the Dominican National Drug Control
Office said Saturday that more than 10 businesses were being
examined as part of a broad investigation into money-laundering.
	   ``In the case we are investigating there are various types of
businesses,'' said Luis Alberto Hemeau Hidalgo. ``There are
importers, lumber companies, and legal betting houses that all
belong to an international narco-trafficking network.''
	   Laundering of drug profits has become a big business in the
Dominican Republic, Hemeau said.
	   Fernandez has kept a high profile on the drug issue lately,
meeting last week with Haitian President Rene Preval to agree to
reinforce patrols on the border between the two countries that
share the island of Hispaniola. Two weeks ago, Fernandez met with
U.S. President Bill Clinton and won promises of cooperation and
assistance in anti-trafficking operations.

Peking University: A glimpse at China's future, and its past With Clinton-China 
</HEADLINE>
By ELAINE KURTENBACH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Peking University is so eager to hold to its
tradition as a world-class university that it clings to the
outdated English version of its name: ``Peking'' instead of the now
commonly used ``Beijing.''
	   President Clinton plans to escape the city Monday for the
university's rustic campus and quiet talks with students destined
to be China's future leaders.
	   Peking University has been the incubator for China's
intellectual and political elite since its founding as the
country's first state-supported college in 1898. Its 24,000
undergraduate students are among the country's brightest.
	   But as it celebrates its centennial, Peking University is
transforming itself to suit the competitive, business-oriented
needs of today's China.
	   ``There are many good universities in China, but they aren't
that good,'' university Vice President Min Weifang said in an
interview. ``Our goal is to establish a first-class university in
the world. We want to be one of the best.''
	   The university has retained its original name out of concern it
might be mistaken for a lesser, newer college, university officials
say.
	   After delivering a speech Monday to a gathering of students and
scholars, Clinton will meet with students on the lawn outside the
university's new dlrs 1.2 million library, one of dozens of
construction projects intended to renew crumbling, overcrowded
campus facilities.
	   To build up its own economic base, Peking University has set up
profitable computer software firms and has solicited support from
wealthy overseas Chinese donors.
	   At the same time, the university boasts a proud classical
heritage: the ivy-covered, Confucian-style lecture halls built
during the Qing dynasty are carefully preserved. An elegant
pavilion stands beside a lake that, in late summer, is redolent of
lotus blossoms.
	   In its early years, the students and faculty of Peking
University were encouraged to revitalize China's Confucian politics
and scholarship by borrowing progressive ideas from the West.
	   Intellectuals associated with Peking University, among them
revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung, were among the founders of the
Chinese Communist Party.
	   The intellectual tumult inside Peking University's high walls
from time to time has spilled out into society.
	   Peking University students were the driving force behind the May
Fourth movement, which began with a May 4, 1919, gathering of some
3,000 students on Tiananmen Square to protest foreign domination.
	   In 1989, 80 years later, students once again marched from Peking
University's campus on the northwestern outskirts of the city into
Tiananmen Square, joined by thousands of students from other
schools and later by millions of workers, to demand more democracy
and an end to corruption.
	   It wasn't the first time Peking University students and faculty
had suffered for being in the vanguard of dissent.
	   Many intellectuals who took up Mao's dare to let a ``hundred
flowers bloom'' by criticizing the Communist Party in the late
1950s ended up in jails and labor camps _ branded as rightists.
	   During the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, when Mao unleashed the
youth of the nation in an ultra-leftist rampage against ``feudal''
traditions, the university became a seething cauldron of
contention. Professors customarily treated with great deference
were paraded through the streets in white dunce caps.
	   The upheavals of the past seem almost unimaginable amid the
tranquil landscaped grounds and willow-swept lakes of today's
Peking University.
	   But the ferment of ideas continues. In lecture halls and in
coffee shops, students and professors debate China's future _ and
the need for greater political freedoms. The exchange of ideas is
the liveliest since the crackdown on dissent that followed the
suppression of the 1989 protests.
	   This time, however, the dialogue is a quiet one, confined by
threat of arrest and harassment to academic circles.
	   ``We have free discussions on academic and policy ideas, but we
let students know where national interests lie,'' says university
official Min.

World Cup volunteer arrested for selling VIP tickets 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A World Cup volunteer worker has been arrested
after selling about 50 premium tickets for the England-Colombia
match, official sources said Saturday.
	   The tickets' buyers, wearing T-shirts in the usually
well-dressed ``presidential section,'' were the giveaway that
tipped off officials to the illegal sales at Friday's match, French
radio reported.
	   The volunteer for the World Cup's French organizing committee
CFO, was arrested in the northern border city of Lens where the
match took place, the sources said on condition of anonymity.
	   The man, who was not identified, was among 1,000 volunteers who
worked at the stadium in Lens.
	   France's World Cup has been plagued by ticket scandals involving
agencies that allegedly oversold tickets or failed to deliver them.
	   On Friday, the head of a U.S. ticket agency for the World Cup
was placed under formal investigation _ one step short of being
charged _ for alleged fraud. He reported the theft of thousands of
tickets officials said were already sold, judicial sources said.
	   Douglas Knittle, president and general manager of Prime Sports
International, was placed under judicial controls, preventing him
from leaving the country, the sources said on customary anonymity.
	   Critics have also said distribution plans were unfairly weighted
toward French fans and sponsors. Of the 2.6 million tickets
printed, more than 962,000 were earmarked for supporters in France,
while commercial partners snapped up 436,000.

Strong quake kills scores in southern Turkey doctor in Mersin, details, background

<TEXT>
	   ADANA, Turkey (AP) _ An earthquake on Saturday shook this
southern city and environs, killing at least 54 people and injuring
some 100 others, reports said.
	   The quake struck at 16:56 p.m. (1356 GMT) and had a preliminary
magnitude of 6.3, Istanbul's Kandilli observatory said.
	   At least 30 people were reported in the nearby town of Ceyhan,
site of an oil terminal, the Anatolia news agency said.
	   Twenty-four more were killed in slum areas of Adana, Gov.
Ardahan Totuk told private NTV television. ``There is no damage in
downtown but panic persists,'' he said.
	   First pictures from the earthquake scene appearing on state
television showed badly damaged houses and rescue teams pulling a
young girl out of the debris.
	   Incirlik air base is located on the outskirts of Adana, a city
of about 1 million 490 kilometers (306 miles) south of Ankara.
	   The base hosts some 45 U.S. and British jets which patrol a
no-fly zone above the 36th parallel in northern Iraq. Some 1,400
personnel are part of the mission.
	   Phone lines to the base had fallen, but a U.S. Embassy spokesman
reported no injuries or damages.
	   The quake sent thousands of people fleing their homes in panic,
NTV said. Several houses and mosques were damaged by the quake in
Adana, it said.
	   In the neighboring Mediterranean port city of Mersin, about 20
people were treated for shock, Nedim Ince, a doctor at the state
hospital, the NTV.
	   ``I felt a tremendous shake,'' said Ince. ``It was something
fearful.'''
	   The quake shattered windows and caused cracks in several
buildings in Mersin, 68 kilometers (42 miles) west of Adana, the
channel said.
	   The quake also was felt in several southern provinces and
Mediterranean island of Cyprus, off Turkey's southern coast.
	   Authorities cut power in Adana and Mersin to prevent fires and
advised people to spend the night outside their homes, anticipating
aftershocks.
	   Turkey's Aegean and Mediterranean coastal areas and the entire
eastern region sit atop the Anatolian fault.

World Cup: Latin America, the big surprise 
</HEADLINE>
By PABLO ELIAS GIUSSANI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Europe's World Cup has acquired a distinct Latin
flavor.
	   Played in France, in the heart of Europe, this was expected to
be a World Cup by the Europeans, for the Europeans.
	   But so far, with the second round set to start Saturday, it's
the teams from the other side of the Atlantic that have made it
their tournament, placing five of their six berths in the second
round.
	   Colombia is the only one missing from the Latin American
entries, having lost to Romania and England. The United States and
Jamaica, the other American teams, also were eliminated in the
first round.
	   Brazil and Argentina, winners of six of the 15 World Cups, were
widely expected to reach the round of 16. But... Chile, Paraguay
and Mexico?
	   None of them were expected to advance, grouped with much tougher
European teams in the first round. Chile had the best showing ever
among the trio, having reached the semifinals in 1962 when it
hosted the championship.
	   However, all three have advanced, and without a single loss.
	   Chile drew its three games, including two in which it led much
of the way before giving up late goals. Mexico beat South Korea and
then managed 2-2 draws against Belgium and the Netherlands, both
after falling behind 2-0 and playing with 10 men. Paraguay was the
only unbeaten team in the ``Group of Death.'' It held favorite
Spain and Bulgaria to scoreless draws before defeating Nigeria, the
Group D winner, 3-1.
	   Argentina was the most impressive, defeating all of its three
opponents without conceding a goal.
	   The only qualified Latin American team that lost a game was none
other than four-time world champion Brazil, beaten 2-1 by Norway in
a meaningless game after it had won Group A.
	   But South American success ``should not come as a surprise. We
had a very tough qualifying tournament,'' Argentina's coach Daniel
Passarella said.
	   The region's teams ``play well and have good players and good
tactics. The tough qualifying tournament enabled them to reach the
World Cup in top form and to do well here.''
	   Argentina led the Latins in the first round, dominating all
three of its matches, including a 1-0 victory against a talented
Croatia.
	   ``Argentina confirmed it big ambitions,'' Croatian coach
Miroslav Blazevic said.
	   Argentina relied on striker Gabriel Batistuta, who scored four
goals, flashes of brilliance by midfielder Ariel Ortega, and a
solid defense.
	   Paraguay also made it to the next stage on the strenght of its
defense, led by goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert, who conceded just
one goal in what many consider the tournaments toughest group.
	   ``We have the best defense in the world,'' Chilavert said.
	   The back line includes Francisco Arce and Carlos Gamarra, who
play in Brazil, as well as Celso Ayala, key on Argentina's River
Plate.
	   FIFA president Joseph Blatter rated Paraguay as probably the
biggest surprise in the tournament.
	   After saying that no miracle teams should be expected in this
World Cup, Blatter admitted ``maybe the surprise is Paraguay,
although not if you look at the way they played in qualfying.''
	   Paraguay led the South American qualifying before finishing
second, one point behind Argentina.
	   Chile has shown a well-balanced team with two powerful strikers,
Marcelo Salas, who scored three goals, and Ivan Zamorano.
	   ``Chile has one of the most efficient and feared front lines in
the Cup,'' claimed Brazilian midfielder Leonardo.
	   Brazil, a perennial candidate to win the title, has been an
enigma. It advanced to the second round after only two games, but
hasn't fallen short of expectations in a mediocre group, and
two-time FIFA Player of the Year Ronaldo has scored only once.
	   Coach Mario Zagallo claims that the defeat by Norway was the
wake-up call the team needed.
	   ``We lost a game we had won. It will serve as a lesson, so we
don't lose our concentration again,'' he said after Brazil conceded
two goals in the final seven minutes, including a penalty in the
89th.
	   The Mexicans, meanwhile, managed five points in another
difficult group. Little was expected from them after a disastrous
run-up to the Cup, one in which their own media dubbed the team
``El Tritanic'' as a mocking tribute to their nickname of ``El
Tricolor.''
	   But the team has rallied from a defict in each of its games, and
Luis Hernandez is among the scoring leaders with three goals.
	   ``I told my players not to lose faith,'' coach Manuel Lapuente
said. ``With faith you move mountains. They have a big heart and
they displayed that all over the field.''

Balloon crashes, TV presenter breaks her leg 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ A hot-air balloon has crashed in eastern
Lebanon, breaking the leg of a well-known television presenter, a
TV channel reported Saturday.
	   Mimi Abu Maashar of Future TV and two men were flying over the
Mount Lebanon range into the Bekaa Valley on Friday evening when
their balloon developed a ``technical problem'' at an altitude of
1,000 feet (300 meters), Future said.
	   The balloon basket's fall was cushioned by bushes and trees, but
Abu Maashar broke her leg and was rushed to hospital, where she was
operated on.
	   Her colleague Kamal Hinnawi, a program director, and the
balloon's pilot, Hisham Faris, suffered cuts and bruises, the
private channel said.
	   The balloon came down outside the town of Qab Elias near the
Beirut-Damascus highway.
	   Abu Maashar is one of the presenters on Future's morning talk
show, which is popular in the Gulf states.
	   A private channel effectively controlled by Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri, Future is widely watched in the Arab world via satellite.
	   The flight was arranged for ``Ushuaia,'' a French-language TV
program about outdoor activities.

Two suspects questioned in Germany in beating of French policeman 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ESSEN, Germany (AP) _ Two German suspects in the severe beating
of a police officer during a World Cup match in France have been
questioned but released for lack of evidence, police said Saturday.
	   A 23-year-old man in Hamburg, identified from media photos of
post-game rioting June 22 in Lens, was arrested Friday. He denied
involvement in the beating and was later relased, Hamburg police
said.
	   Another suspect, a 27-year-old man from Essen, gave himself up
to police, and also was later released for lack of evidence, police
there said.
	   Three German suspects have been arrested in France and placed
under formal investigation in the attack on French policeman Daniel
Nivel, who remained in a coma Saturday.
	   The officer was hit on the head with an iron bar in clashes
between German soccer hooligans and police during the June 22 match
between Germany and Yugoslavia.
	   Nivel was on life support but in stable condition Saturday,
hospital spokeswoman Annie Evrard said.

Diplomat: U.N. envoy's plane crashed in swamp outside Abidjan foreign minister. 
</HEADLINE>

By TIM SULLIVAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ A chartered plane that disappeared
while carrying the U.N. Angola envoy crashed into a swamp as it
approached the airport in Abidjan, the Ivory Coast's commercial
capital, a French diplomat said Saturday.
	   The plane was spotted from a helicopter near the town of
Bingerville, about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Abidjan, said the
diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said rescuers had
so far been unable to get to the aircraft but they could see no
signs of life. He had no further details.
	   But townspeople in Akoure, about 15 kilometers beyond
Bingerville, said the plane went down Friday night in a swampy area
nearer to them.
	   ``The town is full of soldiers'' trying to get to the plane,
said Samuel Oura, an employee of the Ivory Coast's national water
company, speaking in a brief telephone interview. He said both
French and Ivorian soldiers were involved in the operation.
	   The plane's main passenger was Alioune Blondin Beye, a highly
respected politician, diplomat and scholar from the West African
nation of Mali. Beye left Lome, Togo on Friday night in a small
Beechcraft 200 after meeting with Togolese President Gnassigbe
Eyadema in an effort to win support for his efforts to advance the
Angolan peace process, said a statement from the U.N. Observer
Mission in Angola.
	   The control tower in Abidjan lost contact with the plane about
13 miles (20 kilometers) from the airport, and search-and-rescue
operations were launched, the U.N. mission said. Eight people,
including two crew members, were aboard, the statement said.
	   Togolese Foreign Minister Koffi Panou said in Lome that seven
people, including three crew members, were aboard.
	   There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy in
reports on the number of people aboard.
	   Panou said the other three passengers were Togolese foreign
ministry employee Koffi Adjovi, Senegalese journalist Moktar Gueye
and Baendegar Dessandre, who is from Chad.
	   The mission statement said Beye was accompanied by five staff
members and two crew members. It did not provide names.
	   Beye has been traveling through Africa _ including stops in Togo
and the Ivory Coast _ trying to get support for the troubled peace
process in the southern African country of Angola.
	   News of the crash came as a shock in the Malian capital of
Bamako, where Beye has been a well-known figure for years.
	   ``This is a crisis we're living through,'' said Amidou Diabate,
the Malian minister of Justice, who had been a student of Beye's
while at university. ``Beye is a ray of hope for Mali.''
	   Beye was named envoy to Angola in 1993 by then-U.N.
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. Since then he has been
mediating the Angolan peace process from his base in Lusaka,
Zambia. War broke out in Angola after the country's 1975
independence from Portugal.
	   Beye, 59, threatened to resign last month, saying the government
and former rebel movement UNITA lacked the ``political will'' to
see the peace process to its conclusion.
	   Beye mediated the 1994 peace pact signed in Lusaka. An earlier
peace accord, signed in Lisbon in 1991, collapsed a year later when
UNITA, the Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, rejected its defeat in the country's
first-ever elections and returned to the bush.
	   Lingering hostility between the government and UNITA have
stymied implementation of the pact, which is running more than a
year behind schedule, and the U.N.'s patience is growing thin.
	   The U.N. Security Council agreed Wednesday to give UNITA five
more days to comply with terms of the plan.
	   After June 30, the U.N. Security Council will freeze UNITA's
foreign bank accounts and ban its diamond exports unless the
movement relinquishes its central highland strongholds and takes
major steps to demobilize.
	   UNITA criticized the threatened sanctions Friday, calling them
illegal and saying they would jeopardize the peace agreement.
	   Before being named U.N. envoy, Beye served in a number of posts
in the Malian cabinet, including foreign minister, and has been
legal counsel to the Malian president. He has also been on the
faculty of universities in France and Mali.
	   He is married and has 4 children.

Plaque unveiled for Holocaust victims in Transylvania 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Authorities in the Transylvanian city
of Cluj unveiled a plaque Saturday commemorating 18,000 local Jews
deported to the Auschwitz death camp in World War II.
	   The Jews _ comprising a third of the city's population and
including 4,000 children _ were deported in May and June 1944. Only
1,200 survived, Nicolae Callos, president of the local Jewish
community in Cluj, said by telephone.
	   One of those attending the unveiling of the plaque, on the brick
wall of a factory that was transformed 53 years ago into a waiting
room for Auschwitz, was Eva Mariana Maiorovici, 74.
	   She was imprisoned for a month in the ghetto in Clug, 325
kilometers (200 miles) northwest of the capital Bucharest, then
moved to Auschwitz in Poland in May 1944. Because of the torture
she underwent at the Nazi concentration camp, she was unable to
ever become a mother.
	   ``This event takes me back to such painful memories,''
Maiorovici said by phone. She returned to Romania in June 1945 and
married another Holocaust survivor.
	   Northern Translyvania, under Hungarian rule until 1944, was
occupied by the Hortyst regime from 1940-44. During their
occupation, 130,000 Jews out of a total 165,000 in Transylvania
were killed in the Holocaust.
	   In Cluj, only 450 Jews remain among a population of half a
million.

Guinea-Bissau rebels execute army base commander

	   BISSAU, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ Troops loyal to Guinea-Bissau's
breakaway military shot and killed an army base commander in the
town of Bafata, witnesses and a rebel military officer said
Saturday.
	   The commander, whose name was not immediately available, was
slain when he failed to pledge support to renegades led by former
army chief of staff Brig. Ansumane Mane, a rebel officer said on
condition of anonymity.
	   Guinea-Bissau's army is split between troops aligned with
besieged President Joao Bernardo Vieira and those following Mane.
	   About half of the 200 soldiers at the Bafata base sided with
Mane, while the other half were apparently neutral, the rebel
officer said. The commander was reportedly trying to convince the
neutral troops to side with Vieira.
	   Bafata is about 140 kilometers (85 miles) northeast of Bissau,
the embattled capital of the West African country.
	   A coup attempt by Mane earlier this year has degenerated into
virtual civil war in and around Bissau. With little progress in
peace talks, both sides exchange daily artillery and rocket fire.
	   Loyalist forces control the city center, while the rebels are
dug in around the airport and a key military garrison on the city's
northern limits.
	   Vieira, encamped in Bissau, is relying on the support of troops
from neighboring Senegal and the Republic of Guinea.
	   On Friday, Vieira said he would be willing to accept additional
help from other West African countries, including a coalition
intervention force fighting under the banner of the Economic
Community of West African States.
	   Known as ECOMOG and typically led by Nigeria, similar coalition
armies have intervened to stop fighting in recent years in Sierra
Leone and Liberia.

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ A bus packed with passengers plummeted off a
400-foot (120-meter) cliff Saturday, killing 18 and injuring 32,
firefighters said.
	   Rescuers hauled the dead and injured up the steep, rocky slope
44 miles miles (73 kms) east of Lima on Peru's Central Highway.
	   The bus was heading to Lima from the city of Tingo Maria, 200
miles (325 kms) northeast of Lima in Peru's central jungle, and the

New clashes in Berber capital after singer's slaying one injured; TRIMS 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with smoke, damage, hospital source saying one killed,
By RACHID KHIARI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Protesters clashed with riot police in
the ethnic Berber capital of Tizi-Ouzou for a second day Saturday,
leaving one person dead, as local anger simmered over the slaying
of Berber singer-activist Lounes Matoub.
	   Nearly 1,000 youths who gathered outside a hospital to view
Matoub's body tried to build barricades then stoned police, who
struck back with clubs and tear gas, residents in the city east of
Algiers said on condition of anonymity.
	   Smoke from burning tires and trash shrouded the city where
youths a day earlier attacked a dozen state buildings, sacking or
burning five of them including an airline office, welfare agency
and gasoline station.
	   One demonstrator was shot and killed and another suffered a head
wound, a hospital source said on condition of anonymity.
	   Several youths considered as leaders of the violence were
arrested, but no figures were available, said residents in the city
100 kms (60 miles) east of Algiers.
	   Protests began Thursday, when the 42-year-old singer was
believed killed by Muslim militants at a fake roadblock outside his
native village. Youths burned tires and tore down Arabic-language
road signs and telephone poles before dispersing on their own.
	   The singer, a defender of Berber culture and a fierce critic of
both the military-backed government and Muslim militants, was the
latest Algerian artist to be slain during a 6-year-old Muslim
insurgency that has claimed more than 75,000 lives.
	   The slaying inflamed anger in the region against the
government's plans July 5 to put a law in effect making Arabic the
official language in this former French colony and banning the
official use of other tongues including Berber and French.
	   The move was seen as an effort of the military-backed government
to appease supporters of Islamic movements.
	   Matoub's body later Saturday was placed in the municipal sports
arena in Tizi-Ouzou, then was to be transported to his hometown of
Beni Douala for burial there Sunday.
	   Political parties in the region called for a general strike on
Sunday, normally a work day in Muslim Algeria.
	   While there was no claim of responsibility for the attack,
officials blamed it on the Armed Islamic Group, the insurgency's
most violent movement, which kidnapped the singer in 1994 and held
him for two weeks.
	   The Islamic Salvation Front, whose official banishment after
canceled 1992 elections helped spark the insurgency, condemned the
assassination.
	   The insurgency began after the government scrapped the
second-round parliamentary elections in January 1992. The Front was
expected to win the balloting on voter discontent with corruption
and high unemployment.

Summit leaders air their differences - direct to the people of China AP White House Correspondent

By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ In a gripping summit debate beamed to hundreds of
millions of homes across this vast country, U.S. President Bill
Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin treated China to an
uncensored airing of differences Saturday on human rights, freedom,
trade and Tibet.
	   The leaders gave no ground in their 70-minute news conference,
eagerly jumping in after each other to get the last word.
	   It was spirited but cordial. ``You can see that neither one of
us are shy about being strong about how we believe,'' Jiang said.
	   Bringing attention to a key area of difference _ religious
freedom _ Clinton planned to worship Sunday at Chongwenmen Church,
China's largest Protestant church.
	   Human rights groups say dozens of Protestant and Catholic
leaders are imprisoned or held in Chinese labor camps for refusing
to bow to government control. Clinton and Jiang agreed to exchange
visits of religious leaders to further understanding on spiritual
matters.
	   After church, the president and his family head off on a day of
sightseeing at the palaces of the Forbidden City and China's most
famous landmark, the Great Wall.
	   American officials applauded China's willingness to broadcast
Saturday's news conference across the land, from the temple-dotted
capital of Tibet in Chinese Central Asia to the flashy financial
center of Shanghai at the mouth of the Yangtze River.
	   The exchange also was telecast in America, but for China, it was
an unprecedented look at their leader standing side by side with
the American president, both men unflinching on areas of
controversy and disagreement.
	   Speaking afterwards, many Chinese expressed satisfaction with
the summit and the televised appearance.
	   ``For us Chinese, it really is new to see two presidents
speaking face-to-face, with reporters asking question, on live
television,'' said Andrea Yang, an insurance company employee in
Beijing. ``I hope we can see more of that in the future. This is
quite big progress.''
	   Clinton's critics back home weren't so happy with his
performance.
	   ``He reduced it to a disagreement. It's more than a
disagreement,'' said Republican Rep. Chris Smith, who chaired a
hearing on human rights in China on the eve of Clinton's welcome in
Beijing.
	   Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi, a longtime critic of Clinton on
China, said he treated the massacre around Tiananmen Square as a
``historical episode.''
	   Jiang credited his counterpart for a tougher stance.
	   ``I think President Clinton is a strong defender of the American
interest, and I am a strong defender of the Chinese interest,''
Jiang said. ``But despite that, we still can have very friendly
exchanges of views and discussion.'' Switching languages, he added
in English, ``And I think that is democracy.''
	   Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, said the
exchange between Clinton and Jiang demonstrated the wisdom of
engagement with China. He said Jiang ``not only was willing to
engage but seemed almost eager to engage in that dialogue.''
	   Both Clinton and Jiang played to their domestic audience as well
as one another.
	   Clinton said the United States and China still disagree about
the Tiananmen crackdown nine years ago and that ``the use of force
and the tragic loss of life was wrong.'' He said some of the
pro-democracy advocates arrested then for nonviolent activities are
still in prison.
	   ``Is there something that could be done there,'' Clinton
wondered.
	   Jiang did not answer that point but said _ as he has in the past
_ that ``resolute measures'' were necessary in 1989 to insure
China's stability.
	   Clinton and Jiang spent 11 minutes in Tiananmen Square,
reviewing military troops and standing at attention for national
anthems. Clinton said that in his brief visit ``I could hear and
see the many echoes of China's past and the call of its promising
future.''
	   On Tibet, Clinton gently pressed Jiang to open a dialogue with
the Dalai Lama _ the spiritual leader criticized by China's
government as a religious charlatan and a political tool of
anti-China foreign forces.
	   ``Let me say something that will perhaps be unpopular with
everyone,'' Clinton said. ``I have spent time with the Dalai Lama.
I believe him to be an honest man and I believe if he had a
conversation with President Jiang, they would like each other very
much.'' Jiang broke into a smile at this.	   
	   The two leaders agreed not to aim nuclear missiles at each
other's country _ a move Clinton said eliminates the possibility of
an accidental launch toward American soil. Jiang said the pact
demonstrated that China and America ``are partners, not
adversaries.''
	   The leaders also announced a string of accords on energy,
environmental matters, arms control and American and Chinese
exchanges. Clinton praised China for resisting pressure to devalue
its currency, a move many fear would worsen Asia's financial
crisis. But the leaders could not agree on terms to allow China
entry into the World Trade Organization, which sets global trade
rules.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Nikhil Chakravarty, one of India's best
known journalists, has died. He was 74.
	   Chakravarty was suffering from brain cancer and died in hospital
on Saturday, his family said.
	   Politics was his forte and his columns appeared in leading
Indian newspapers and magazines.
	   Chakravarty also started a weekly news magazine, ``Mainstream,''
in 1962 and edited it for more than three decades.
	   Last year, the government appointed him chief of Prasar Bharati,
an autonomous corporation set up to end government control of radio
and television.
	   Chakravarty declined a top government award in 1990, saying no
journalist should be identified with the governing establishment.
	   He graduated from Calcutta University and studied at Oxford
University's Merton College in England.
	   Chakravarty taught history at Calcutta University in the 1930s
before taking to journalism as correspondent of a weekly brought
out by the Communist Party of India.
	   He later joined the CPI and remained a member until 1978.
	   He closed the Mainstream weekly for a while when Prime Minister
Indira Gandhi imposed emergency rule in India 1975-77, jailing
political opponents and imposing censorship on newspapers and
magazines.
	   Chakravarty was born November 3, 1913, in India's northeastern
state of Assam.

World Cup volunteer arrested for selling VIP tickets

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A World Cup volunteer worker has been arrested
after selling about 50 premium tickets for the England-Colombia
match, official sources said Saturday.
	   The tickets' buyers, wearing T-shirts in the usually
well-dressed ``presidential section,'' were the giveaway that
tipped off officials to the illegal sales at Friday's match, French
radio reported.
	   The volunteer for the World Cup's French organizing committee
CFO, was arrested in the northern border city of Lens where the
match took place, the sources said on condition of anonymity.
	   The man, who was not identified, was among 1,000 volunteers who
worked at the stadium in Lens.
	   France's World Cup has been plagued by ticket scandals involving
agencies that allegedly oversold tickets or failed to deliver them.
	   On Friday, the head of a U.S. ticket agency for the World Cup
was placed under formal investigation _ one step short of being
charged _ for alleged fraud. He reported the theft of thousands of
tickets officials said were already sold, judicial sources said.
	   Douglas Knittle, president and general manager of Prime Sports
International, was placed under judicial controls, preventing him
from leaving the country, the sources said on customary anonymity.
	   Critics have also said distribution plans were unfairly weighted
toward French fans and sponsors. Of the 2.6 million tickets
printed, more than 962,000 were earmarked for supporters in France,
while commercial partners snapped up 436,000.

World Cup: Italy defeats Norway 1-0 in second round unbeaten streak; optional upcoming 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Maldini, Olsen quotes; ADDS detail of Norway's
By PIERO VALSECCHI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Christian Vieri scored his
tournament-high fifth goal in the 18th minute as Italy defeated
Norway 1-0 Saturday to advance to the quarterfinals of the World
Cup.
	   Italy, which will face either France or Paraguay at Saint-Denis
on Friday, advanced by choking the high-ball, set-piece attack that
had earned the Norwegians their best-ever World Cup showing.
	   Defenders Fabio Cannavaro and Giuseppe Bergomi kept a body on
tall striker Tore Andre Flo, and goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca made
a great diving save on Flo's header in the 71st minute to preserve
the lead.
	   The goal came on a classic Italian counterattack. Luigi Di
Biagio sent a long through ball ahead to Vieri, who out-paced
defender Dan Eggen and fought off the defender's clutches to drive
a right-footed shot past goalkeeper Frode Grodas.
	   The five goals for the 24-year-old Vieri, who had only two goals
in eight career appearances for Italy before the start of the World
Cup, moved him ahead of Argentina's Gabriel Batistuta as the
tournament's leading scorer.
	   Italian coach Cesare Maldini called the victory ``well deserved
against a tough team'' and said Italy suffered ``beyond the
acceptable'' in the last 25 minutes as the Norwegians pressed
steadily for the equalizer.
	   Maldini also praised Vieri and the full team effort.
	   ``His teammates helped to provide him good balls and to preserve
the advantage,'' Maldini said.
	   Norway coach Egil Olsen said he was not impressed with Italy's
play.
	   ``Our performance was too low today,'' Olsen said. ``We were
unable to take advantage of good chances in the second part of the
second half when Italy was visibly tired. I'm disappointed as we
had hoped to go father in the tournament.''
	   On a very hot day at the Stade Velodrome _ spectators were
warned before kickoff to keep themselves well hydrated _ Norway's
best shot on goal in the first half came when Havard Flo's 20-meter
drive was pushed away by Pagliuca in the 14th minute.
	   But Pagliuca saved his best moment for the second half, diving
to the right to gather Tore Andre Flo's close-range header off a
cross from Erik Mykland with 19 minutes to play.
	   Grodas made three fine saves for Norway, one off Dino Baggio's
header following a corner kick in the 37th minute and two off
Alessandro Del Piero on counterattacks in the 41st and in
first-half injury time.
	   By ending Norway's unbeaten streak of 17 matches _ including two
wins in a year against world champion Brazil _ Italy moved 3-0
against the Norwegians in World Cup play, including a 1-0 victory
in the 1994 World Cup in the United States.

World Cup: Semifinalists four years ago slink home 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Humiliated by its tournament-ending 6-1
loss to Spain, Bulgaria's World Cup squad arrived home before dawn
Saturday, greeted by unwelcoming headlines, relatives, reporters
and one fan.
	   ``Shame'' _ was the most frequently used word by the local
newspapers to describe the poor performance, which included only
one goal in three games.
	   The 5 a.m. arrival at Sofia's airport via chartered plane also
heard coach Hristo Bonev reiterate his resignation.
	   ``My morale didn't allow me to stay any longer around,'' the
51-year-old Bonev said.
	   Bonev accumulated a record of 9-1-8 since taking over the team
in August 1996.
	   That was in the wake of Dimitar Penev, the most successful
Bulgarian coach who took the side to the semifinals in USA '94. He
was fired for a 1-1-1 performance at the 1996 European Championship
and a first-round exit.
	   The federation's decision to sack Penev caused Hristo Stoichkov
to boycott the national team for 10 months, which involved him in a
bitter conflict with some of his teammates.
	   Most reports in the Bulgarian press during the first stage of
France '98 suggested dissension among the team members, mostly
between Stoichkov and central defender Trifon Ivanov.
	   Both were demanding to take over the captain's duties from
reserve goalkeeper Borislav Mihailov. Stoichkov apparently lost the
batlle, having never received support from Bonev.
	   The ex-Barcelona striker, who shared the top scoring honors at
the last World Cup with six goals, had said before the tournament
that he would remain with the team through the 2000 European
Championship.
	   In 225 minutes in France, Stoichkov appeared as probably the
most dangerous on Bulgaria's teams, creating several chances but
missing his six shots on goal, including one off the post against
Paraguay.
	   ``It is very difficult to say if the generation that played in a
World Cup semifinal in 1994, will give way to a new younger
generation,'' said fellow stirker Kostandinov, who scored the only
goal for Bulgaria in France '98. ``That will be for the new coach
to decide, but I still feel a desire to play and I am ready to help
if he calls me.''
	   The new coach will have to prepare quickly. Bulgaria's first
European qualifier against Poland is scheduled for Sept. 5. The
other teams in the qualifying group are England, Sweden and
Luxembourg.

Smith becomes first British woman in fourth round since '85 that Smith was first since 1977 to beat former champion

	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ For the last several years, British
men Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski have been the local story at
Wimbledon.
	   Now a British woman _ Samantha Smith _ has broken through.
	   Smith, 26, ousted No. 8 seed and former champion Conchita
Martinez 2-6, 6-3, 7-5 on Saturday to become the first British
woman to advance to the fourth round since Jo Durie in 1985. in
1985.
	   She's also the first British woman since Virginia Wade in 1977
to beat a former champion at Wimbledon. Wade won Wimbledon that
year, the last British singles champion.
	   Smith will face 16th seeded Nathalie Tauziat of France in the
fourth round.
	   ``It was a great match,'' said Smith, who admitted she was
inspired by England's overnight 2-0 victory over Colombia in the
World Cup, which moved England into the second round. ``I played
some of my best tennis I've ever played.''
	   Last year at the U.S. Open, Smith won just one game from the
Spaniard. So what happened?
	   ``I'd qualified, and to go from playing people ranked around 100
to suddenly playing someone in the top 10 is such a shock,'' she
explained. ``The last few weeks I've been playing people around 50,
40, 20, and it doesn't seem so much of a jump.''
	   Smith, who won three straight games to level the match after
play had been suspended overnight by rain, also won the last three
games of the deciding set, dropping just three points.
	   So what went wrong for Martinez?
	   ``Pretty much everything,'' Martinez said. ``I played really,
really badly today. I didn't return well and I couldn't break her
serve. I was really rushed and just couldn't play.''
	   ``I was rushed the whole morning and that showed in my whole
mood,'' she added. ``I didn't feel I was there. She played well,
but I didn't do much today.''
	   Now Smith has the chance to play on a major showcourt at
Wimbledon,. She also gains valuable ranking points to put herself
into the top 60.
	   And the money. Smith earned the biggest pay check of her career.
To many of the millionaire players, the 25,120 pounds (dlrs 41,700)
for reaching the fourth round is loose change. But not for Smith.
	   ``I can't even _ I can't even imagine that,'' she exclaimed.
``That's such a lot of money. I can't think what I would do with
it.''
	   Smith may have also boosted the sagging women's game in Britain,
where she is the only player ranked in the top 100. Three others
are ranked above 200.
	   ``I think that my win will really give women's tennis a boost in
this country,'' Smith said. ``If people can see that I can do it,
they're going to go out there and think that they can do it too.''

By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	   Status on abortion in some European countries:
	   ITALY: Abortion on demand through the 12th week became legal in
1978. A 1981 referendum backed the law. Ninety-nine percent of the
Italian population is Catholic.
	   __
	   IRELAND: Abortion is illegal in this predominately Roman
Catholic nation. The last referendum on abortion in 1993 rejected
legalization, but made it legal to advertise foreign abortion
services and allowed people to travel overseas to receive them.
	   ___
	   POLAND: A 1993 law allows abortion only for strict medical
reasons, ending decades of abortion on demand. In 1996, parliament
introduced more liberal rules, allowing women to get abortions in
the first 12 weeks of pregnancy if it was deemed they would face
financial or emotional difficulties if they had the child. But a
high court ruled the provision unconstitutional. Poland is 90
percent Roman Catholic.
	   ___
	   SPAIN: Since 1985, abortion has been allowed during the first 12
weeks of pregnancy, but only in cases of rape, fetus malformation
or danger to the mother's life or mental health. However, women
seeking abortions find it relatively easy to find psychiatrists
willing to authorize a termination on the grounds of endangered
mental health, and there are numerous private abortion clinics
advertised in the national newspapers. Almost all the country's 40
million people are Catholic.
	   ___
	   BRITAIN: In England, Scotland and Wales, abortion was legalized
in 1967 and is available for up to 24 weeks. The population is 10
percent Catholic. In the British province of Northern Ireland,
where the population is 40 percent Catholic, the 1967 Abortion Act
was never applied. Thus abortion is not legal, although there is no
specific law prohibiting it. In practice, it is very rare.
	   ___
	   SWITZERLAND: Abortion is illegal, unless the mother's life is in
danger. A 1977 referendum that would have allowed abortion within
the first 12 weeks was rejected. But 1988 vote that would have
strictly forbid abortions also was defeated. The Swiss population
is 46 percent Roman Catholic.
	   ___
	   GERMANY: Abortion is legal but the woman must present a
certificate showing she has consulted a counselor _ through church
groups, the Red Cross or the state. About one-third of Germany's 82
million people are Roman Catholic.
	   ___
	   SWEDEN
	   Abortion is legal in Sweden, where about two percent of the
population is Roman Catholic.
	   ___
	   DENMARK
	   Abortion until the 12th week of pregnancy has been a right since
the passage of a 1973 law. Some 18,000, or about 20 percent, of all
pregnancies end in abortion in the country of 5.2 million people,
less than 2 percent of whom are Roman Catholic.
	   ___
	   ROMANIA
	   Abortion is legal through the 12th week and is the most
widely-used form of contraception. Contraception and abortion were
banned under former dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. Some 7 percent of
the country is Roman or Eastern Rite Catholic, both of which have
allegiance to Rome.

State dinner in Beijing: President Clinton leads China's army band With Clinton-China 
</HEADLINE>
By RENEE SCHOOF
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ First the grand entry up a white marble
staircase, the toasts to friendship, and the ``superb shark's fin
in soy sauce'' and other banquet dishes.
	   Then, a little fun. Before the evening was over, Jiang Zemin was
playing a bamboo flute and Bill Clinton was leading the People's
Liberation Army band.
	   Just after the last plate of sliced watermelon and oranges was
cleared away from the banquet tables on Saturday in the Great Hall
of the People, the American and Chinese presidents walked across
the enormous banquet hall to toast the band.
	   Band leader Fan Siting urged Jiang to direct a song. Jiang
hesitated.
	   ``You can do it. You do it!'' Clinton goaded him with a grin.
``Go for it.''
	   So Jiang did, leading the band in a few bars of ``A Song for the
Motherland'' while Clinton beamed and stood with his arm around his
wife, Hillary.
	   Then Jiang handed the baton to Clinton, who directed for several
minutes as band members in green PLA uniforms played an American
march, ``Hands Across the Sea.''
	   The evening began with President and Mrs. Clinton walking hand
in hand up the red-carpeted marble stairway lined by cut-glass
lamps on the balustrades.
	   Mrs. Clinton wore a bright yellow suit with flowing trousers and
a lustrous jacket with upturned collar and cuffs. She and Jiang's
wife, Wang Yeping, who wore a long black velvet dress and sequined
jacket, chatted before entering the banquet hall.
	   Attire for the men was dark business suits.
	   Before the food was served, the two presidents each offered
toasts. Clinton spoke of American admiration for the ``great
strides China has taken.'' Jiang said he hoped Clinton would
experience China's ``splendid culture,'' its economic advances and
friendship for Americans.
	   Then the meal was served, a simplified take on old-style Chinese
banquets of dish after dish. Along with the shark, there was
coconut-flavored chicken soup with bean curd, grilled beefsteak,
mushrooms and mustard greens, thick pea soup with walnuts, pastries
and fruit.
	   The army band in the back of the hall played Chinese music and
American folk songs including ``The Yellow Rose of Texas'' and
``Home on the Range.''
	   Afterward, a large orchestra, the Chinese Musical Ensemble,
played Chinese traditional and Western instruments under huge
American and Chinese flags.
	   One of the numbers was a swinging version of ``Chelsea Morning''
set to traditional Chinese instruments, including a solo on the
suona, a small horn.
	   ``On behalf of all the Americans here we thank you for this
incredible variety of beautiful music,'' Clinton said, adding that
``Chelsea Morning,'' by Joni Mitchell, inspired his daughter's
name.
	   Jiang, who seemed relaxed and jovial all evening, played two
short pieces, one on the two-stringed erhu and the other on the
bamboo flute.
	   Outside, the hot night was thick with a haze of Beijing
pollution. Large colored bulbs lighted the pines alongside the
Great Hall, and white bulbs outlined the roof of the nearby Gate of
Heavenly Peace, between the imperial palace, known as the Forbidden
City, and Tiananmen Square.

Embattled Trimble ready to `carry the burden' atop Belfast Assembly With NIreland-Results 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: AMs; NEW throughout; one Assembly seat still undecided
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ For Ulster Unionist leader
David Trimble, Saturday's confirmation that his Protestant party is
the largest in the new Northern Ireland Assembly feels more like a
burden than a triumph.
	   Faced now with leading Northern Ireland's deeply divided
majority community farther down the road to compromise with
Catholics, Trimble's fractured party will hold a vulnerable 27 or
28 seats in the new 108-member government-in-waiting. That, plus
the support of two members from another pro-agreement party,
provide a bare minimum for the Ulster Unionists to help implement
the agreement.
	   And a vital handful of those newly elected Ulster Unionists are
fair-weather supporters of the agreement. If they jump ship on
votes to the Assembly's confirmed anti-agreement camp of 28
Protestants, they could block implementation of parts of the accord
they don't like.
	   Trimble appealed to his party to stop ``inflicting damage on
itself by squabbling in public'' over the merits of the accord,
which he defends as securing Northern Ireland's union with Britain.
	   ``I don't have any baseball bats with nails in them to deal with
dissidents,'' Trimble said. ``We must have self-discipline within
the party.''
	   Mindful of the potential for Protestant obstruction, the April
agreement struck among eight parties and the British and Irish
governments contained a ``self-destruct'' clause for the Assembly.
	   It specified that the Assembly by October must appoint a
multi-party administration to run different government departments.
To the alarm of many Protestants, this new 12-member Executive will
be required to cooperate with the neighboring Irish Republic _ and
include members of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party.
	   If Protestants try to block this agenda, the British government
reserved the right to pull the Assembly's plug, just as it did to
Northern Ireland's last local parliament in 1972.
	   That's not an option Britain wants to take. The Assembly, and
the new administration, were intended to secure the cease-fires
called by both Catholic and Protestant gunmen, and to provide
normal democratic mechanisms for resolving deep differences that
fueled three decades of violence.
	   Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam, whose
governor-style powers would mostly be transferred to the Executive
next year if the plan succeeds, said ``the results mean that we're
going to have an Assembly that will work.''
	   The election produced a 43-strong Catholic bloc in the Assembly,
united and bearing a long list of demands, among them that
traditional Protestant Orange Order parades be rerouted if they go
through or near hostile Catholic areas.
	   That issue has sparked widespread rioting for the past two
summers _ and on Saturday a minor skirmish broke out between
Catholic protesters and riot police guarding an Orange march in
west Belfast.
	   Trimble, a 53-year-old former law lecturer, was elected Ulster
Unionist leader in 1995 after championing the rights of Orangemen
to march in Portadown, where Northern Ireland's most imflammatory
parade will take place July 5.
	   The moderate Catholic leaders of the Social Democratic and Labor
Party _ which got more first-preference votes than the Ulster
Unionists for the first time in Northern Ireland history and won 24
seats _ are sensitive to the need to help their erstwhile opponent.
	   ``We're looking for a new type of politics here _ the politics
of consensus, of cooperation between the two main traditions in the
north of Ireland,'' said Alban Maginness, a newly elected SDLP
Assemblyman who recently served as Belfast's first Catholic mayor.
	   ``I know the Ulster Unionist Party agrees with that type of
approach, because that's the essence of the agreement.''
	   Sinn Fein, which won 18 seats with its best-ever share of the
vote, rarely expresses sympathy for Trimble, who calls Sinn Fein
leaders ``unconstructed terrorists'' and refuses to talk to the
party leader, Gerry Adams.
	   But even Sinn Fein knows that pushing Trimble too hard, too
early, will only strengthen the hand of those Protestants who are
scheming for Trimble's scalp and dream of gridlocking the Assembly.
	   The Assembly meets for the first time Wednesday, and the first
order of business will be to elect a ``first minister'' to head the
new administration.
	   Virtually everyone in the pro-agreement camp expects it to be
Trimble.
	   Asked if he was looking forward to the job, Trimble answered
obliquely: ``I have shouldered, since I came into public life,
whatever responsibilities have been thrust upon me. I've carried
that burden.''

Police busy with bomb threats in 10th day of telephone strike 
</HEADLINE>
By MANUEL ERNESTO RIVERA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Police handled dozens of bomb
threats Saturday as a protest strike against the privatization of
the Puerto Rico Telephone Company entered its 10th day.
	   In some cases, police found packages containing clocks and
cables or bottles of liquid that were rigged up to appear to be
bombs but were not, said police spokeswoman Maria del Pilar Bon.
	   Meanwhile, the FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms joined the local police investigation of a bomb that
injured a police officer in the south coast town of Santa Isabel in
the early morning hours Thursday. The policeman lost a finger when
he picked up a flashlight that contained a bomb outside a branch of
Banco Popular.
	   Opponents of the government's plans to sell the telephone
company have targeted the bank, the largest in Puerto Rico and the
largest Hispanic-owned bank in the United States, because it plans
to buy a minority share in the privatized telephone company.
	   Gov. Pedro Rossello signed legislation Wednesday to sell a
controlling share in the company to a consortium led by U.S.
telecommunications giant GTE for dlrs 1.9 billion.
	   A total of 215 of the 750 automatic teller machines belonging to
all the banks on the island were out of service, a spokesman for
Banco Popular said Saturday. Most of the machines were not working
because phone lines were out of service, but others had been
vandalized.
	   The two unions representing 6,400 workers at the telephone
company went on strike June 18. An umbrella organization of groups
against the sale plans to meet Sunday to consider joining an
island-wide protest strike.

Eds: UPDATES with no injuries in fire; ADDS Seles, Henman, Korda
By STEPHEN WADE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Defending champion Martina Hingis and
former runner-up Monica Seles moved comfortably into the final 16
Saturday at Wimbledon as fire and more rain interrupted play.
	   Hingis reached the fourth round with a 6-2, 6-1 victory over
unseeded Elena Likhovtseva of Russia.
	   Sixth-seeded Seles, the surprising French Open finalist, make
the fourth round at Wimbledon for the first time since finishing
second in 1992.
	   They'll both be heavy favorites in those matches as Hingis faces
unseeded Tamarine Tanasugarn and Seles _ in the weaker bottom half
_ goes against 16th seeded Sandrine Testud.
	   After four hours Saturday of tennis under rare sunshine, play
was halted twice by rain, guaranteeing Monday will be filled with
left-over third round matches _ a day traditionally dedicated to
the fourth round.
	   Sunday is a day off.
	   Play on Court 18 was also suspended _ just moments before rain
hit _ when a fire broke out on the top floors of a 12-story
apartment building adjacent to the Wimbledon grounds.
	   American Todd Martin and Australian Todd Woodbridge were at 2-2
in the fourth set of their third-round match when play was stopped.
	   Officials cleared hundreds of people from the area around the
court as smoke billowed over it with ash and cinders falling on to
an adjoining picnic area.
	   One woman was taken from the apartment building and treated for
smoke inhalation, but no other injuries were reported.
	   For Hingis, it was an easy victory after struggling in her first
two matches.
	   ``The more matches you play, the more confident you are,''
Hingis said.
	   ``The tennis was a lot different last year,'' the defending
champion went on. ``It was much easier for me to get through the
first couple of rounds.''
	   Seles admitted the delays Saturday _ the fourth day of six that
rain has hit Wimbledon _ was distracting, not to mention the fire,
visible as she was playing on Court 1.
	   ``I think I had about 10 warmup yesterday... today about three
or four,'' she said. ``And with the fire in the beginning, it was
just so strange.''
	   ``We've seen everything today.''
	   That included former champion and eighth seed Conchita Martinez
going out to Britain's Sam Smith 2-6, 6-3, 7-5 in a match continued
from Friday.
	   The 26-year-old Smith became the first British woman to reach
the fourth round since 1985. Virginia Wade in 1977 was the last
British champion.
	   Martinez joined seven-time champion Steffi Graff _ upset 6-4,
7-5 Friday by Natasha Zvereva _ as only the second of the top eight
seeded women to lose. Graf had beaten Zvereva in their previous 17
match, which included a landslide 6-0, 6-0 win in the 1988 French
Open finals.
	   In other completed matches Saturday, No. 3 seed and Australian
Open champion Petr Korda reached the final 16, beating Jerome
Golmard of France 4-6, 7-5, 7-5, 7-5.
	   No. 12 seed Tim Henman of Britain also reached the fourth round,
beating Byron Black 6-4, 6-4, 3-6, 7-5.
	   Henman will face U.S. Open champion Pat Rafter.
	   No. 11 seed Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden also fell, losing to Jan
Siemerink of the Netherlands in five sets 7-6 (8-6), 5-7, 2-6, 6-4,
7-5.
	   Germany's Tommy Haas, who beat Andre Agassi in the second round,
was ousted by John Van Lottum of the Netherlands 6-3, 6-3, 6-3.

Strong quake kills scores in southern Turkey aftershocks; RECASTS, no pickup

Eds: UPDATES throughout with higher casualty toll, ADDS
<TEXT>
	   ADANA, Turkey (AP) _ An earthquake rumbled through southern
Turkey on Saturday, killing at least 83 people and injuring more
than 600 others, reports said.
	   Many of the dead lived in the slums of Adana, a Mediterranean
city of 1 million near strategic Incirlik air base and the oil
terminal town of Ceyhan.
	   ``There is no damage in downtown but panic persists,'' Adana
Gov. Ardahan Totuk told private NTV television. He said 27 people
died there.
	   At least 21 people were reported dead in the nearby town of
Ceyhan, site of an oil terminal, and others died in surrounding
villages, the Anatolia news agency said. Ceyhan is about 60
kilometers (37 miles) east of Adana.
	   It was not clear whether there was damage to oil facilities.
Phone lines were down.
	   Nor was it possible to make contact with Incirlik, which is
located on the outskirts of Adana. The base hosts 45 U.S. and
British jets which patrol a no-fly zone above the 36th parallel in
northern Iraq. Some 1,400 personnel are part of the mission.
	   A U.S. Embassy spokesman in Ankara reported no injuries or
damages there.
	   The quake struck at 16:56 p.m. (1356 GMT) and had a preliminary
magnitude of 6.3, Istanbul's Kandilli observatory said. At least 11
aftershocks were registered.
	   State television footage from the scene showed badly damaged
houses and rescue teams pulling a young girl out of the debris.
	   The quake sent thousands of people fleeing their homes in panic,
NTV said. Several houses and mosques were damaged by the quake in
Adana, it said.
	   In the neighboring Mediterranean port city of Mersin, about 20
people were treated for shock, Nedim Ince, a doctor at the state
hospital, the NTV.
	   ``I felt a tremendous shake,'' said Ince. ``It was something
fearful.'''
	   The quake shattered windows and caused cracks in several
buildings in Mersin, 68 kilometers (42 miles) west of Adana, the
channel said.
	   The quake also was felt in several southern provinces and
Mediterranean island of Cyprus, off Turkey's southern coast.
	   Authorities cut power in Adana and Mersin to prevent fires and
advised people to spend the night outside their homes, anticipating
aftershocks.
	   Turkey's Aegean and Mediterranean coastal areas and the entire
eastern region sit atop the Anatolian fault.

ticket problems, Blatter speaks out over violence; CHANGES byline AP Sports Writer

Eds: NEW throughout with Italy advancing to the quarterfinals, more
By ROBERT MILLWARD
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Italy became the first team to reach the World Cup
quarterfinals after a 1-0 victory over Norway on Saturday as peace
and normality returned to the competition after Friday's tension
and violence at Lens and Lille.
	   Christian Vieri, who plays in Spain for Atletico Madrid, went to
the top of the goalscorers' list with his fifth of the tournament
and the only goal of the game at Marseille as the three-time Cup
winner and losing finalist last time out moved smoothly into the
last eight.
	   Italy plays either France or Paraguay on Friday for a place in
the semifinals.
	   The first game of the second round was a triumph for Italian
goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca. Playing against Norway four years ago
at Giants Stadium, he became the first goalkeeper to be sent off at
the World Cup finals when he was penalized for a foul early in the
game.
	   Against the Norwegians this time, Pagliuca, who regained his
place after a pre-World Cup injury to first choice Angelo Perruzi,
made a reflex-action save on the line to deny Tore Andre Flo 19
minutes from the end to ensure an Italian victory at the Stade
Velodrome.
	   Brazil, which beat Italy in the 1994 final to complete a record
fourth triumph, faced South American rival Chile later Saturday at
the Parc des Princes in Paris.
	   A Brazilian victory to go with an Italian triumph was just the
sort of normality the World Cup organizers wanted after yet another
day of unwanted intrusion by the hooligans.
	   A huge turnout of 2,000 police stood by as thousands of English
fans, many of them defying a ban on alcohol and arriving without
tickets, broke into sporadic acts of violence on the streets of
Lens, where the shops were closed even on a usually busy Friday
afternoon.
	   The fans' mood and actions gave the citizens of Lens a reminder
of the grim events of a week ago, when a local policeman was left
in a coma after being attacked by an iron bar-wielding German fan.
	   And in Bordeaux, two Argentines were arrested Saturday for
allegedly attacking Croat fans who refused to hand over their
tickets to Friday's Argentina-Croatia game.
	   The events of Lens and Lille, where English fans fought with
local French youths on Friday, and the background of earlier
violence in Marseille prompted a new attack on the violence by new
FIFA president Sepp Blatter.
	   ``We have seen the incidents in Marseille and the extremely
serious incidents in Lens. They were closer to acts of terrorism
than acts of hooliganism,'' Blatter said. ``This violence is not of
football, it is of society as a whole. These people use the World
Cup as a launching pad.''
	   Meanwhile, the long-running tickets fiasco took two new twists
Saturday.
	   Sources said that a volunteer for the World Cup's French
organizing committee, CFO, had been arrested in Lens after the
England-Colombia game for allegedly selling about 50 premium
tickets in the VIP section.
	   Officials became suspicious when fans wearing T-shirts were
spotted among the suit-cladded VIPs.
	   It was the latest problem involving tickets for World Cup
organizers. Most have involved travel agencies that allegedly
oversold tickets or failed to deliver them.
	   On Friday, the head of a U.S. ticket agency for the World Cup
was placed under formal investigation _ one step short of being
charged _ for alleged fraud. He reported the theft of thousands of
tickets which officials said were already sold, judicial sources
said.
	   Douglas Knittle, president and general manager of Prime Sports
International, was placed under judicial controls, preventing him
from leaving the country, the sources said.
	   Critics have also said distribution plans were unfairly weighted
toward French fans and sponsors and the situation has led to
another headache leading up to the England-Argentina game at
Saint-Etienne on Tuesday.
	   The English Football Association complained Saturday that
England's official ticket allocation for the game was only 2,049.
With something like 10 times that figure likely to show up from
England for the game there likely will be a flood of demand on the
black market and fresh fears of violence.
	   FA deputy chief executive Pat Smith said the association was
trying to negotiate more tickets for the game match.

Panama pardons cop for misconduct conviction in U.S. soldier case 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PANAMA CITY (AP) _ Panamanian President Ernesto Perez Balladares
has pardoned a former police director convicted of misconduct in
the case of politician's son acquitted in the shooting death of a
U.S. soldier.
	   Jaime Abad, who led the investigation into the 1992 death of
soldier Zak Hernandez on a Panamanian highway, was convicted of
removing evidence from case files that appeared to exonerate Pedro
Miguel Gonzalez, who was a suspect in the killing.
	   The U.S. State Department condemned the prosecution of Abad,
saying that Gonzalez' father, a prominent politician, had used his
influence to unfairly tilt Abad's trial.
	   Abad was fined for removing the results of a ballistics test. He
paid the fine but appealed.
	   The pardon, issued Friday, said Abad's actions were ``related to
the political crisis that gripped Panama in the late 1980s,'' when
U.S. troops invaded the country. At least 300 Panamanian civilians
were killed.
	   Gonzalez and two other Panamanians were found innocent in
November 1997 of killing Hernandez, a 22-year-old sergeant and
native of Puerto Rico.
	   U.S. officials criticized that verdict.
	   Hernandez died on the eve of a visit by then-U.S. President
George Bush, when AK-47 rifle fired from a passing car sprayed the
military vehicle in which he and other soldiers were riding.

Vatican calls for greater freedom for Chinese Catholics 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ The Vatican on Saturday called for greater
religious freedom for Roman Catholics in China.
	   ``It is hoped that the difficulties which impede all Chinese
Catholics to practice their religious faith in full freedom will be
overcome soon,'' said papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls.
	   The statement came in response to reports it had received that
Chinese church members have been arrested.
	   Navarro-Valls said there was no confirmation of the arrests. If
true, he said, they would be the source of ``profound grief and
bitter observations.''
	   The Chinese government bans the Roman Catholic Church and has
established a government-sanctioned Catholic Church. Catholics who
maintain allegiance to Rome are subjected to persecution and
operate clandestinely.

<TEXT>
	   CUMERE, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ It's quiet in this shady little
hamlet, abandoned but for a lone figure shuffling from empty house
to empty house in search of scraps of food. It's the kind of quiet
that hums in your ears and heightens a queasy sense of dread.
	   His shirt in tatters, eyes wide open and desperate, G'badne
Quade is alone in Cumere, a village a few miles (kilometers) from
Guinea-Bissau's embattled capital. Too old to run, gaunt and frail,
hunger overcomes his fear of the daily onslaught of rockets and
artillery.
	   The barrage is aimed at a nearby rebel army base, but day by
day, shell by shell, it's destroying a little more of Quade's
world.
	   ``It's because of hunger that I stay,'' Quade said. ``Yes, I'm
afraid, but the only thing I'm feeling is hunger.''
	   For almost three weeks, this little community of farmers has
been in the direct line of fire in a blundering war of inaccurate
shelling between loyalist army troops and this West African
nation's breakaway military factions.
	   Most everyone fled from Cumere and the capital, Bissau, at the
start of the conflict June 7, when army Brig. Ansumane Mane tried
to oust President Joao Bernardo Vieira in a coup attempt. As many
as 300,000 people driven from their homes have converged on the
nearby towns of Mansoa, Bafata and Canchungo.
	   Aid workers say without food and medical assistance, it's a
humanitarian crisis in the making.
	   For Quade, the crisis is here and now.
	   Quade, somewhere in his 70s, knows terror. Here, he has seen the
moment of death, when a person just stops.
	   His world torn apart, his family gone, he is in solitude as he
struggles to stay alive. He takes no sides in the fighting. He is
caught in the middle.
	   ``I'm here at my house. I'm in my country. I can't move,'' he
says. ``I'm just here to pick my apples.''
	   A cashew tree in the center of the hamlet, with its apple-like
fruit, is his only source of food, save for the handful of rice he
found in a neighbor's house.
	   The war arrived with an abrupt burst of gunfire. Senegalese
troops in the first few days of fighting tried to wrest control of
Cumere and the base from Mane's rebels. Machine-gun fire shattered
the quiet for hours.
	   The Senegalese driven back, six of this community's 200
villagers lay dead in their homes or on the dirt paths. After that,
everyone else fled, leaving Quade to fend for himself.
	   Walk down the dusty lane that leads from the rebel base and you
pass Cumere's only restaurant, the Bolama. A month ago, Quade says,
music and lively chatter from the Bolama filled the air, as
villagers swapped stories at the end of the day.
	   Now, its doors are torn away and its weaved-grass roof has
collapsed. A slight breeze rustles through the abandoned building.
A pig forages just outside amid a clutter of overturned chairs.
	   Every day since that first battle, rebel forces have launched
artillery strikes at Bissau from the Cumere base.
	   The response, from nearby patrol ships and heavy guns across the
water, is eating away at Cumere.
	   A land mine, its trigger in full view, rests menacingly in the
center of the road in front of the base _ about 200 yards (meters)
from the hamlet.
	   Little more than a mile (two kilometers) away, the tail fins of
an unexploded rocket jut out from the road, its nose bored into the
pavement. Refugees fleeing another nearby town plod past the
waiting bomb that landed just hours earlier.
	   The war here comes in spurts, usually in the morning and late
afternoon. The lull in between seems fleeting.
	   A soldier from the base warns that a patrol boat loyal to the
government has navigated to within firing range. So close is the
boat that its engines can be heard whining in the distance.
	   Quade continues his search for food, despite mounting tension
and the soldier's warning.
	   Within 15 minutes, the roar of a cannon, muffled by distance,
echoes in Cumere. It takes about two minutes for the shell to
arrive.
	   For the next 20 minutes, the area is showered with deadly
artillery rounds that explode with a gust of dirt, fire and a hail
of shrapnel.
	   Somewhere in the chaos, Quade struggles to live.
	   ``The bombs come and shake the ground,'' he said. ``I just lie
down behind a house or a tree.''

Congress Party says it would consider replacing Vajpayee government 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's Congress Party said Saturday it
would consider replacing the three-month-old Hindu nationalist-led
government in the event of its collapse.
	   ``If the government falls due to its inner contradictions, we
will not shirk responsibility to form a government,'' Press Trust
of India news agency quoted party President Sonia Gandhi as saying.
	   Gandhi's statement during her visit to a southern Indian state
came as three top leaders of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's
20-party coalition stayed away from a meeting in New Delhi to
review the government's performance during its first 100 days.
	   Jaswant Singh, a Bharatiya Janata Party spokesman, said the
three leaders had informed Vajpayee of their inability to attend
the meeting.
	   Earlier this week, an opposition block urged the Congress Party
to try to replace the Hindu nationalist-led government.
	   The BJP and its allies control 249 of 545 seats in Parliament,
the Congress Party and its partners 191 and the United Front 75.
The rest are controlled by independents.
	   Last week, former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar, who heads a
small political group, also urged the Congress Party to try to put
together a coalition to replace Vajpayee's government.
	   H.D. Deve Gowda, former prime minister, also pledged his United
Front's support to the Congress Party.
	   The Congress Party, which led India to freedom from the British
rule in 1947, has governed India for more than four decades.
	   There was no immediate threat to the BJP-led government. But
Vajpayee has in recent days faced sharp criticism from a member of
his uneasy coalition.
	   Jayaram Jayalalitha is hinting she will withdraw support if
Vajpayee does not dismiss the state government led by her rivals in
her southern home state of Tamil Nadu. Jayalalitha controls 30
lawmakers and the survival of the BJP-led government depends on
their support.
	   Vajpayee has so far resisted her demands. The two were scheduled
to meet on Saturday, but Jayalalitha decided against visiting New
Delhi.
	   She is based in Madras, the capital of southern Tamil Nadu
state.

World Cup: Italy chokes Norway 1-0 to advance to quarters

	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Italy beat the team that beat Brazil.
	   That's all coach Cesare Maldini had to say to gauge the
magnitude of Saturday's 1-0 second round victory over Norway, a
team that had been riding a 17-game unbeaten streak that included
two wins over the reigning World Cup champions.
	   ``We have the merit to have defeated the team which had stunned
the world champions, the great Brazil,'' Maldini said.
	   Christian Vieri scored the game-winner, his tournament-high
fifth goal, and the Italian defenders choked Norway's dangerous
high-ball attacks as the ``Azzurri'' earned a berth in the
quarterfinals. They will play either France or Paraguay at
Saint-Denis on Friday.
	   The Norwegians had qualified for the second round with a 2-1
upset over Brazil, and they also beat the Brazilians in an
exhibition match last year. Perhaps because he's faced such lofty
opposition, Norway coach Egil ``Drillo'' Olsen wasn't full of
praise for the Italians after the game.
	   ``I was not impressed by Italy,'' Olsen said. ``Our performance
was too low today. We were unable to take advantage of the good
chances in the second part of the second half when Italy was
visibly tired. I'm disappointed as we had hoped to go father in the
tournament and we had the opportunity today if we played at our
limit.''
	   Vieri, who groomed his soccer talent growing up in Australia,
scored in the 18th minute on a classic Italian counterattack. Luigi
Di Biagio sent a long through ball ahead to Vieri, who out-paced
defender Dan Eggen and fought off the defender's clutches to drive
a right-footed shot past goalkeeper Frode Grodas.
	   The five goals for the 24-year-old Vieri, who had only two goals
in eight career appearances for Italy before the start of the World
Cup, moved him ahead of Argentina's Gabriel Batistuta as the
tournament's leading scorer.
	   ``I'm happy. I'll will try to keep on scoring in the next
matches,'' said Vieri, who has scored in all four of Italy's games.
``It doesn't matter if it's France or Paraguay in the
quarterfinals. For sure it will be as tough as today's match.''
	   Norway, in the World Cup second round for the first time, had
built its success on a high-ball, set-piece attack. But Italian
defenders Fabio Cannavaro and Giuseppe Bergomi kept a body on tall
striker Tore Andre Flo all game, and goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca
made a great diving save on Flo's header in the 71st minute to
preserve the lead.
	   Although the Norwegians had seven corner kicks, they managed
only took five shots on goal.
	   After striker Alessandro Del Piero spoiled two clear chances to
make it 2-0, Italy struggled in the last part of the match with
defenders kicking the ball away to gain time and breath on an
afternoon when the temperature reached 30 degrees Celsius (86 F).
	   Maldini called the victory ``well deserved against a tough
team'' and said that Italy suffered ``beyond the acceptable'' in
the last 25 minutes as the Norwegians pressed steadily on the
attack to achieve the equalizer.
	   Norway's best shot on goal in the first half came when Havard
Flo's 20-meter drive was pushed away by Pagliuca in the 14th
minute.
	   But Pagliuca saved his best moment for the second half, diving
to the right to gather Tore Andre Flo's close-range header off a
cross from Erik Mykland in the 71st minute.
	   Del Piero, still unable to play a full match after recovering
from a thigh strain, was replaced by Enrico Chiesa in the 77th to
the disappointment of Italian fans who had hoped to see veteran
Roberto Baggio play the final minutes.
	   ``It's my business, it was a tactical choice,'' said Maldini,
when asked why he had not fielded Baggio, who scored two goals in
the first round.
	   Italy moved to 3-0 against Norway in World Cup play, including a
1-0 victory in the 1994 World Cup in the United States.

Tens of thousands turn out for funeral for Hezbollah guerrillas

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Tens of thousands of Lebanese turned out
Saturday for a funeral of 28 Hezbollah guerrillas whose corpses had
been returned by Israel.
	   Hezbollah's leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, wearing a black
turban and robes, conducted the ceremony in a south Beirut soccer
field where his own 18-year-old son lay in one of the coffins
before the podium.
	   As the crowd, including about a dozen members of parliament, sat
on chairs in the 28 degrees Celsius (82 F) heat, Nasrallah said the
exchange Thursday and Friday of prisoners and body parts with
Israel would not lead to negotiations between the two countries.
	   ``This is purely a humanitarian operation and has no political
link whatsoever with the Israeli enemy,'' Nasrallah said, in an
apparent answer to Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai who
had expressed hopes that the swap would pave the way for peace
talks.
	   ``With this enemy, we use only the language of bullets, blood,
resistance and martyrdom,'' Nasrallah said.
	   Hezbollah supporters replied with a chant of ``Death to
Israel.''
	   But Nasrallah went out of his way to answer another Israeli
legislator, Yossi Beilin, who had expressed fears that the lopsided
exchange _ the body parts of one Israeli soldier for 60 Lebanese
prisoners and 40 corpses _ would allow the guerrillas to think they
could ``get the same price'' for only a body.
	   ``Any soldier who is taken prisoner will not be in danger ... We
will look after his soul and life like his mother and father,''
Nasrallah said.
	   The crowd rose to its feet as Nasrallah led a 15-minute prayer.
	   After the two-hour service, Hezbollah cadres in black uniforms
carried the coffins, each wrapped in the party's yellow flag and
bearing a bouquet of yellow and red flowers, out of the field.
Fifteen coffins were loaded into vehicles to be taken to hometowns
across the country.
	   The thirteen others were carried through the streets of Sfeir to
a cemetery, followed by thousands of relatives, friends, Hezbollah
supporters and Shiite Muslim clerics in black robes.
	   Nasrallah's son, Hadi, was killed in a clash with Israeli troops
in southern Lebanon in September.
	   Of the 40 bodies handed over by Israel on Thursday, nine
belonged to members of the pro-Syrian Amal group and three belonged
to the communist party.

World Cup: No more comebacks by Norway With Sports-Soccer-Italy-Norway AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHAN NASSTROM
<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ There were no last-minute heroics this
time. No more comebacks from a team that rallied three times from
one-goal deficits, including the shocker against Brazil.
	   ``I'm disappointed for several reasons,'' said coach Egil
``Drillo'' Olsen after Norway's 1-0 defeat to Italy in Saturday's
opening second-round match at the World Cup.
	   ``We didn't play up to our limit and I felt if we had done that,
we would have beaten Italy. In fact, I wasn't impressed by Italy
either. It was more because we didn't play very well that we lost
the match.''
	   Norway, which had a 17-match unbeaten streak snapped by the 1994
finalists, had never before reached the second round in two
previous World Cup appearances. Not only did the team come from 1-0
down to beat Brazil 2-1 in the first round, it also overcame two
one-goal deficits to salvage a vital 2-2 with Morocco.
	   ``Our goal was to to go through and be among the last 16,''
Olsen said. ``We reached that. But when you are there, you want to
go further. We had a good chance today.
	   ``But our performance was not too good and we didn't take the
chance we had in the second half. Italy was tired and we had a good
chance in the last part of the second half.''
	   That chance was striker Tore Andre Flo's brilliant header in the
71st minute off a cross from Erik Mykland. But Gianluca Pagliuca
made a tremendous one-handed save.
	   Pagliuca was sent off last time the teams met in the 1994 Cup.
But the Italians won 1-0 despite playing one man short for 68
minutes, and the Norwegians went home. Italy also won the teams'
only other World Cup meeting, a 2-1 victory at Marseille's Stade
Velodrome in 1938.
	   The match was played in 30-degree Celsius (86F) heat, but Olsen
didn't use that as an excuse.
	   ``Maybe, it's difficult to say,'' Olsen said. ``But the heat
also affected the Italian team, too, because they looked more tired
than us in the last minutes of the game.''
	   Saturday's match _ the most important of his career _ was
Olsen's 88th and last as Norwegian coach. He's retiring after the
tournament and has been linked to the vacant manager's job at
Glasgow Celtic in Scotland.
	   Mykland also played his last game for Norway, having announced
his retirement earlier this week.

Hingis, Seles reach final 16; Sampras rained out; AP Sports Writer

Eds: UPDATES with play abandoned due to rain
By STEPHEN WADE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Defending champion Martina Hingis and
former runner-up Monica Seles moved comfortably into the final 16
Saturday at Wimbledon as fire and more rain interrupted play.
	   Hingis reached the fourth round with a 6-2, 6-1 victory over
unseeded Elena Likhovtseva of Russia.
	   Sixth-seeded Seles, the surprising French Open finalist, made
the fourth round at Wimbledon for the first time since finishing
second in 1992, beating Yayuk Basuki of Indonesia 6-2, 6-3.
	   They'll both be heavy favorites in those matches as Hingis faces
unseeded Tamarine Tanasugarn and Seles _ in the weaker bottom half
_ goes against 16th seeded Sandrine Testud.
	   After four hours of tennis under rare sunshine, play was halted
twice by rain with only 16 singles matches completed. That means 13
third-round singles matches will be set for Monday, a day
traditionally dedicated to the fourth round.
	   However, the forecast for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday calls
for more showers.
	   ``There's pretty horrible weather to come,'' said the duty
forecaster Saturday at the London Weather Centre. ``It's a pity
you're not playing Sunday. It may be the best day of the next four
or five. Tuesday might be a total washout.''
	   Sunday _ called ``Middle Sunday'' _ is a day off.
	   Last season _ the wettest in history _ Wimbledon official were
forced to use the day for only the second time to catch up. This
year, though four of the first six days have been damp, officials
say they're far enough along not to need it. However, play into the
third week is possible, particularly in doubles.
	   Just before rain halted play Saturday, a fire broke out on the
top floors of a 12-story apartment building adjacent to the
Wimbledon grounds.
	   Officials cleared hundreds of people from the area around Court
18 _ and stopped play there _ as smoke billowed over the court and
ash and cinders fell on to an adjoining picnic area.
	   American Todd Martin and Australian Todd Woodbridge were at 2-2
in the fourth set of their third-round match when play was stopped.
	   One woman from the building was treated for smoke inhalation,
but no other injuries were reported.
	   For Hingis, it was an easy victory after struggling in her first
two matches.
	   ``The more matches you play, the more confident you are,''
Hingis said.
	   ``The tennis was a lot different last year,'' the defending
champion went on. ``It was much easier for me to get through the
first couple of rounds.''
	   Seles admitted the delays Saturday _ the fourth day of six that
rain has hit Wimbledon _ was distracting, not to mention the fire,
visible as she was playing on Court 1.
	   ``I think I had about 10 warmup yesterday... today about three
or four,'' she said. ``And with the fire in the beginning, it was
just so strange.''
	   ``We've seen everything today.''
	   That included former champion and eighth seed Conchita Martinez
going out to Britain's Sam Smith 2-6, 6-3, 7-5 in a match continued
from Friday.
	   The 26-year-old Smith became the first British woman to reach
the fourth round since 1985. Virginia Wade in 1977 was the last
British champion.
	   Martinez joined seven-time champion Steffi Graff _ upset 6-4,
7-5 Friday by Natasha Zvereva _ as only the second of the top eight
seeded women to lose. Graf had beaten Zvereva in their previous 17
match, which included a landslide 6-0, 6-0 win in the 1988 French
Open finals.
	   Defending champion Pete Sampras was ahead 6-3, 5-5 and up 15-0
on serve when rain washed out his match with Sweden's Thomas
Enqvist.
	   In other completed matches Saturday, No. 3 seed and Australian
Open champion Petr Korda reached the final 16, beating Jerome
Golmard of France 4-6, 7-5, 7-5, 7-5.
	   No. 12 seed Tim Henman of Britain also reached the fourth round,
beating Byron Black 6-4, 6-4, 3-6, 7-5.
	   Henman will face U.S. Open champion Pat Rafter.
	   No. 11 seed Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden also fell, losing to Jan
Siemerink of the Netherlands in five sets 7-6 (8-6), 5-7, 2-6, 6-4,
7-5.
	   Germany's Tommy Haas, who beat Andre Agassi in the second round,
was ousted by John Van Lottum of the Netherlands 6-3, 6-3, 6-3.

Russia's Larisa Mikhaylova best in outdoor track season 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ Russia's Larisa Mikhaylova
Saturday ran the 800-meter event in 1 minute 58.01 in the this
season's best outdoor track showing at the European Cup track and
field meet.
	   Ten European teams are competing for the Cup of Florence in the
men's program and the Silver Maid in the women's events.
	   Fiona May of Italy leaped 14.65 meters in the women's triple
jump to set a new Italian record.
	   In the men's 100-meter, Stephane Gali of France was fastest with
a time of 10.32 seconds. In the women's competition, Irina
Privalova of Russia came in first with a time of 11.04. The event
had to be run twice due to a problem with the electronic timing
equipment.
	   Olga Kuzenkova of Russia failed to better her hammer throw
record of 73.10 meters, but cleared 65.89 meters to win the event.
	   At the end of the first day of the two-day competition,
Britain's men's team led with 53 points, while Russia tallied 68
points in the women's division. About 4,000 spectators were on hand
to watch the competition on a mild, cloudless day.

Diane Blood, victor in legal battle over dead husband's sperm, is pregnant 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The woman who won a two-year legal battle over the
right to her dead husband's sperm, announced Saturday that she is
pregnant.
	   Diane Blood, whose husband, Stephen, died of meningitis in 1995,
was at first barred from using the sperm for artificial
insemination because it was taken when he was comatose and unable
to give his permission.
	   Her case won wide public sympathy, even from people instrumental
in drafting Britain's 1991 Human Fertilization and Embryology Act,
which requires written consent from the donor.
	   The Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority, the government
regulatory agency, barred the use of the sperm in Britain and
denied her permission to take it abroad because it did not want to
create a legal precedent. The High Court upheld both decisions.
	   The Court of Appeal, in February 1997, ruled that the authority
rightly had banned her insemination in Britain, but it had not been
properly advised that under European Union laws Mrs. Blood was
entitled to be treated in another member country. The court then
turned the final decision over to the government authority, which
decided she could take the sperm abroad for treatment.
	   In a statement issued to Press Association, the national news
agency, Mrs. Blood confirmed Saturday that she was ``absolutely
delighted'' to be in the early stages of pregnancy and thanked her
family, doctors, lawyers and the news media for their support.
	   Mrs. Blood's father, speaking on her behalf, would not say where
she had received treatment, but confirmed Stephen Blood's sperm had
been used.

Human rights declaration feted at 50th anniversary gathering trims. Adds byline.

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ It's a document small enough to fit
inside a passport, but for thousands of people across the world the
United Nations declaration on human rights remains largely nebulous
or unknown.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, actor Michael Douglas, former
U.S. President Jimmy Carter and other dignitaries gathered Saturday
to honor the 50th anniversary of the declaration, which outlines
people's basic rights to freedom and justice across the globe.
	   ``The world community should not and will not accept any
dilution or delay in the observance of human rights and fundamental
freedoms,'' Annan told thousands gathered at the ceremony at the
Austria Center.
	   But according to the International Helsinki Federation, a
watchdog organization for Europe, human rights conditions worsened
last year in several European countries alone.
	   Other places singled out for human rights abuses by participants
at the ceremony included Angola, Liberia, Palestinian refugee camps
and the United States.
	   ``The greatest, most pervasive, most troubling human rights
abuse is the difference between rich people and poor people,''
Carter said in his speech. Until everyone in the world has equal
rights to health care, education and a decent home, he said, we
will be struggling for equal human rights.
	   Douglas, who is to be appointed a U.N. messenger for human
rights in the coming months, gave a solemn reading of the
declaration.
	   ``This should be taught to every child,'' he said before
launching into the treatise that demands ``recognition of the
inherent dignity and ... equal and inalienable rights of all
members of the human family.''
	   The Helsinki report, also marking the 50th anniversary of the
declaration, singled out 41 countries where people are still denied
human rights. Belarus was pointed out for trampling rights in
several areas. ``Governmental policies and tactics more and more
resembled those of Stalin, apparently aimed ... at crushing civil
society,'' the group said of Belarus.
	   In Slovakia, the human rights situation also deteriorated
notably and was exacerbated by public apathy, according to the
288-page report.
	   ``Intolerance and aggressive state attitudes toward minorities
increased; the virtual absence of reactions against neo-Nazi
violence could be read as a form of tacit approval,'' it said.
	   In Albania, despite improved conditions following a new
government, the judicial system remained unprofessional and corrupt
and police violence continued.
	   Yet, as Nobel Peace Prize winner Desmond Tutu pointed out at the
conference, human rights have improved in some places _ including
his home country of South Africa, which is shaking off decades of
apartheid.
	   Summing up why the fight for human rights continues, both
diplomatically and on the ground, he said: ``When freedom comes,
it's like falling in love. Suddenly the sunset you always saw is
even more glorious.''

	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat held
talks with Qatar's and Bahrain's emirs Saturday on the stalled
Middle East peace process.
	   Arafat arrived first in Qatar where he discussed the peace
process with its emir, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, a
Palestinian diplomat told The Associated Press in the Qatari
capital, Doha.
	   Later the Palestinian leader flew to Manama where he held
similar talks with the Bahraini leader, Sheik Isa bin Salman Al
Khalifa, the state's official Gulf News Agency reported.
	   During the talks, Sheik Khalifa condemned Israel's behavior
toward the Palestinians, especially the decision to extend
Jerusalem's municipal authority, the agency said.
	   The two leaders also discussed the possibility of holding an
Arab summit on the peace process, the agency added.
	   An Israeli Cabinet decision on June 21 to extend municipal
services from Jerusalem to Jewish settlements on the West Bank has
enraged Palestinians. They fear the step will lead to the
annexation of West Bank land and the cutting off of Arab parts of
Jerusalem from other Palestinian areas.
	   Palestinians want east Jerusalem to be the capital of their
would-be state.
	   Peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel have been
stalled since March 1997 when the Israeli government ordered the
construction of a Jewish housing estate in traditionally Arab east
Jerusalem.
	   Qatar has no diplomatic relations with Israel, but the two
states have trade missions in each other's countries. Bahrain has
no relations with Israel.

Fire, rain halt Wimbledon play AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Smoke from an apartment-building fire
Saturday forced Wimbledon officials to evacuate hundreds of fans
from one court and a picnic area.
	   The match on Court 18 between Todd Martin and Todd Woodbridge
was suspended because of thick smoke blown over the court by a
strong wind. Then rain began to fall, washing out play for the rest
of the day.
	   No play is scheduled Sunday, so the match will be concluded
Monday with Martin leading 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (7-1), 2-2.
	   The fire started in an apartment on the ninth floor of the
12-story building. No one was seriously hurt.
	   Monica Seles, playing Yayuk Basuki on Court 1, said she smelled
the smoke.
	   ``It was pretty bad,'' she said. ``Both Yayuk and I felt we
should stop. ... I was wondering if it's OK to breathe this air in.
But in the end the rain came. In some ways it was a good time for
that.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; HAAS DEMOLISHED: &LR;  In a result that doesn't speak well for the
state of Andre Agassi's game, Tommy Haas was eliminated 6-3, 6-3,
6-3 in the third round by unseeded John Van Lottum.
	   After upsetting Agassi in the second round, Haas had little left
against van Lottum.
	   ``That's life. It was a great week,'' Haas said. ``I had an
experience against Agassi that I'll not forget, and I'll take it
with me for the rest of my life, beating him here on Centre
Court.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; HINGIS' FUTURE: &LR;  Top-ranked Martina Hingis, 17, isn't sure
whether she'll be playing five years from now.
	   ``I don't know what is going to happen,'' she said, adding with
a laugh, ``Maybe I will be a mother already. No, I hope not. I want
to enjoy my life first.
	   ``I don't really think I could see myself still on the court.''
	   Hingis realizes that many veteran players have said the same
thing.
	   ``They were 16 or 17 and they said, `In 10 years I'm not going
to play for sure,' and you still see them running around the court.
Who knows?''
	   Hingis beat Elena Likhovtseva 6-2, 6-1 to reach the fourth
round.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; BIASED FOR BRITAIN? &LR;  Byron Black was concerned that England's
Tim Henman might get the best of the officiating during their match
on Centre Court.
	   ``This guy always gets the close calls,'' Black complained to
chair umpire Bruno Rebeuh following one disputed point.
	   Black, a Zimbabwean, said he was concerned about the possibility
of the partial crowd influencing Rebeuh.
	   ``I'm feeling pretty alone out there,'' Black said. ``Obviously
Tim is the British hope. I just wanted to remind (Rebeuh) to not
back down and to be fair on both sides. But that one point didn't
change the match.''
	   Henman won 6-4, 6-4, 3-6, 7-5 to reach the fourth round, where
he'll play Patrick Rafter.
	   --- &QC; 
	    &UR; RUTHLESS RUSEDSKI?: &LR;  U.S. Open runner-up Greg Rusedski, dumped
this week by coach Tony Pickard, is now being criticized by former
coach Brian Teacher.
	   Teacher says he ended a 16-month association with Rusedski after
the Open last September. A dispute about how much money Rusedski
owed Teacher led to their split.
	   ``People say Greg is ruthless. Well, I recognize that too,''
Teacher said. ``He did not do business in an honorable way.''
	   A feud between Pickard and Rusedski, Britain's top-ranked
player, has made headlines the past several days in the London
papers after Pickard dropped Rusedski.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; MORE, MORE RAIN: &LR;  Four of the first six days have been wet, and
there's more to come. The forecast for Monday, Tuesday and
Wednesday calls for more showers with Tuesday likely to be the
worst day.
	   ``There's pretty horrible weather to come,'' said the duty
forecaster at the London Weather Centre. ``It's a pity you're not
playing Sunday. It may be the best day of the next four or five.
Tuesday might be a total washout.'
	   Sunday _ called ``Middle Sunday'' _ is a day off.
	   Last season _ the wettest in history _ Wimbledon official were
forced to use the day for only the second time to catch up. This
year, officials say they're far enough along not to need it.
However, play into the third week is possible, particularly in
doubles.

	   CUMERE, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ It's quiet in this shady little
hamlet, abandoned but for a lone figure shuffling from empty house
to empty house in search of scraps of food. It's the kind of quiet
that hums in your ears and heightens a queasy sense of dread.
	   His shirt in tatters, eyes wide open and desperate, G'badne
Quade is alone in Cumere, a village a few miles (kilometers) from
Guinea-Bissau's embattled capital. Too old to run, gaunt and frail,
hunger overcomes his fear of the daily onslaught of rockets and
artillery.
	   The barrage is aimed at a nearby rebel army base, but day by
day, shell by shell, it's destroying a little more of Quade's
world.
	   ``It's because of hunger that I stay,'' Quade said. ``Yes, I'm
afraid, but the only thing I'm feeling is hunger.''
	   For almost three weeks, this little community of farmers has
been in the direct line of fire in a blundering war of inaccurate
shelling between loyalist army troops and this West African
nation's breakaway military factions.
	   Most everyone fled Cumere and the capital, Bissau, at the start
of the conflict June 7, when army Brig. Ansumane Mane tried to oust
President Joao Bernardo Vieira. As many as 300,000 people driven
from their homes have converged on the nearby towns of Mansoa,
Bafata and Canchungo.
	   Aid workers say without food and medical assistance, it's a
humanitarian crisis in the making.
	   For Quade, the crisis is here and now.
	   Quade, somewhere in his 70s, knows terror. Here, he has seen the
moment of death, when a person just stops.
	   His world torn apart, his family gone, he is in solitude as he
struggles to stay alive. He takes no sides in the fighting. He is
caught in the middle.
	   ``I'm here at my house. I'm in my country. I can't move,'' he
says. ``I'm just here to pick my apples.''
	   A cashew tree in the center of the hamlet, with its apple-like
fruit, is his only source of food, save for the handful of rice he
found in a neighbor's house.
	   The war arrived with an abrupt burst of gunfire. Senegalese
troops in the first few days of fighting tried to wrest control of
Cumere and the base from Mane's rebels. Machine-gun fire shattered
the quiet for hours.
	   The Senegalese driven back, six of this community's 200
villagers lay dead in their homes or on the dirt paths. After that,
everyone else fled, leaving Quade to fend for himself.
	   Walk down the dusty lane that leads from the rebel base and you
pass Cumere's only restaurant, the Bolama. A month ago, Quade says,
music and lively chatter from the Bolama filled the air, as
villagers swapped stories at the end of the day.
	   Now, its doors are torn away and its woven-grass roof has
collapsed. A slight breeze rustles through the abandoned building.
A pig forages just outside amid a clutter of overturned chairs.

Strong quake kills scores in southern Turkey at the air base, updated death toll 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with U.S. announcement about the casulties
<TEXT>
	   ADANA, Turkey (AP) _ An earthquake rumbled through southern
Turkey on Saturday, killing at least 101 people and injuring more
than 650 others, an official said.
	   Among the victims, 34 lived in the slums of Adana, a
Mediterranean city of 1 million near strategic Incirlik air base
and the town of Ceyhan, site of an oil terminal, Deputy Gov.
Ardahan Totuk said. Ceyhan is about 60 kilometers (40 miles) east
of Adana.
	   Twenty-five people suffered from minor injuries, according to an
announcement from the headquarters of the U.S. Air Forces in
Europe.
	   A U.S. Embassy spokesperson told The Associated Press that a
dozen U.S. citizens working at the base suffered from slight
injuries. ``There were only minor injuries caused by falling
objects,'' the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said.
	   The base, located 20 kilometers (10 miles) west of Adana, hosts
45 U.S. and British jets which patrol a no-fly zone above the 36th
parallel in northern Iraq. Some 1,400 personnel are part of the
mission. It was not possible to contact the base as the phone lines
remained down.
	   The brief U.S. statement also said the earthquake caused a loss
of power and structural damage to buildings on base.
	   The quake struck at 16:56 p.m. (1356 GMT) and had a preliminary
magnitude of 6.3, Istanbul's Kandilli observatory said. At least 11
aftershocks were registered.
	   State television footage from the scene showed badly damaged
houses and rescue teams pulling a young girl out of the debris.
	   The quake sent thousands of people fleeing their homes in panic,
NTV said. Several houses and mosques were damaged by the quake in
Adana, it said.
	   In the neighboring Mediterranean port city of Mersin, about 20
people were treated for shock, Nedim Ince, a doctor at the state
hospital, according to NTV.
	   ``I felt a tremendous shake,'' said Ince. ``It was something
fearful.'''
	   The quake shattered windows and caused cracks in several
buildings in Mersin, 70 kilometers (40 miles) west of Adana, the
channel said.
	   The quake also was felt in several southern provinces and
Mediterranean island of Cyprus, off Turkey's southern coast.
	   Authorities cut power in Adana and Mersin to prevent fires and
advised people to spend the night outside their homes, anticipating
aftershocks.
	   Turkey's Aegean and Mediterranean coastal areas and the entire
eastern region sit atop the Anatolian fault.

World Cup: Nigeria, Denmark aim for first quarterfinal 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Amokachi missing practice Saturday
By HOWARD FENDRICH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Nigeria, carrying the World Cup hopes
of a continent, and Denmark both aim to erase painful memories from
past trips to the second round when they square off at France '98.
	   Neither has ever reached the quarterfinal stage, but that will
change after their meeting Sunday at the Stade de France.
	   Just 60 seconds and Roberto Baggio stood between Nigeria and the
quarterfinals four years ago, but the Super Eagles' suspect defense
let a 1-0 lead slip away. Denmark's only other trip to the round of
16 _ in 1986 _ ended in humiliation with a 5-1 loss to Spain.
	   ``They are playing for themselves, for Nigeria and also for
Africa,'' Nigeria coach Bora Milutinovic said of his talented
squad, which topped Group D. ``These types of games bring out their
best.''
	   The African contingent here of five teams was the highest ever,
but only Nigeria is left in the draw. It could become just the
second team from the continent, after Cameroon in 1990, to reach
the quarters.
	   The confident players are thinking even bigger.
	   ``We are now one of the favorites,'' defender Taribo West said.
``Denmark plays an English style, which is an advantage for us. We
know that tactic.''
	   Denmark scraped through Group C, managing only a 1-1-1 record
and a total goals tally of 3-3.
	   But built around the get-to-everything goalkeeping of Manchester
United's Peter Schmeichel and the solid play of the Laudrup
brothers, Denmark is precisely the type of squad that could give
Nigeria fits. If the Scandinavians play a down-tempo, ball-control
style, it might disrupt the Super Eagles, who prefer free-flowing
soccer.
	   ``They have good tactical discipline and that could be a
problem,'' Nigeria winger Mutiu Adepoju said. ``We'll have to try
to push the pace.''
	   His teammates do that as well as anyone in the tournament,
turning up the volume on a bop-'til-you-drop brand of attacking
play. Milutinovic, the only man to coach four teams into the second
round, has a wealth of weapons and Nigeria's five goals so far have
been scored by five different players.
	   ``We're going to try to play our football,'' said captain Uche
Ukechukwu, a central defender who missed Nigeria's final group game
_ a half-hearted 3-1 loss to Paraguay _ through suspension. ``We
always do, no matter who we play. Schmeichel is very good but you
have to win as a team, not as individuals.''
	   Nigeria should take that to heart.
	   The team's weak point, aside from defensive inconsistency, is a
tendency to look too often for the pretty one-on-one play.
	   ``In the course of a game, a team like Nigeria will always be
tempted to exaggerate its playing with the ball. That is exactly
where we should enter the game,'' said Brian Laudrup, captain
Michael's younger brother.
	   Milutinovic, who previously guided Mexico (1986), Costa Rica
(1990) and the United States (1994) to the round of 16, has just
one injury doubt: striker Daniel Amokachi, who has a twisted knee.
Amokachi almost certainly won't face Denmark after missing every
practice since Thursday, including Saturday evening's session under
the rain at the Stade de France.
	   Given the luxury of a meaningless match _ Nigeria had clinched
first place in Group D after two opening wins _ Milutinovic rested
the bulk of his starters against Paraguay.
	   Denmark coach Bo Johansson has to worry about ailing defenders
Marc Rieper (back) and Michael Schjoenberg (knee) and midfielder
Allan Nielsen (ankle). In addition, reserve forward Miklos Molnar
is suspended.

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Tens of thousands of Lebanese turned out
Saturday for a funeral of 28 Hezbollah guerrillas whose corpses had
been returned by Israel.
	   The leader of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, Sheik Hassan
Nasrallah, wearing a black turban and robes, conducted the ceremony
in a south Beirut soccer field where his own 18-year-old son lay in
one of the coffins before the podium.
	   As the crowd, including about a dozen members of parliament, sat
on chairs in the 28 degrees Celsius (82 F) heat, Nasrallah said the
exchange Thursday and Friday of prisoners and body parts with
Israel would not lead to negotiations between the two countries.
	   ``This is purely a humanitarian operation and has no political
link whatsoever with the Israeli enemy,'' Nasrallah said, in an
apparent answer to Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai who
had expressed hopes that the swap would pave the way for peace
talks.
	   ``With this enemy, we use only the language of bullets, blood,
resistance and martyrdom,'' Nasrallah said.
	   Hezbollah supporters replied with a chant of ``Death to
Israel.''
	   But Nasrallah went out of his way to answer another Israeli
legislator, Yossi Beilin, who had expressed fears that the lopsided
exchange _ the body parts of one Israeli soldier for 60 Lebanese
prisoners and 40 corpses _ would allow the guerrillas to think they
could ``get the same price'' for only a body.
	   ``Any soldier who is taken prisoner will not be in danger ... We
will look after his soul and life like his mother and father,''
Nasrallah said.
	   The crowd rose to its feet as Nasrallah led a 15-minute prayer
from the stand, which was flanked by photographs of Iran's
spiritual leader, Ali Khamenei, and his predecessor, Ruhollah
Khomeini.
	   After the two-hour service, Hezbollah cadres in black uniforms
carried the coffins, each wrapped in the party's yellow flag and
bearing a bouquet of yellow and red flowers, out of the field.
Fifteen coffins were loaded into vehicles to be taken to hometowns
across the country.
	   The thirteen others were carried through the streets of Sfeir
district to a cemetery, followed by thousands of relatives,
friends, Hezbollah supporters and Shiite Muslim clerics in black
robes.
	   Nasrallah's son, Hadi, was killed in a clash with Israeli troops
in southern Lebanon in September.
	   Of the 40 bodies handed over by Israel on Thursday, nine
belonged to members of the pro-Syrian Amal group and three belonged
to the communist party.

Radical Basque nationalists march demanding a negotiated end to violence 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BILBAO, Spain (AP) _ Thousands of sympathizers of the radical
Basque political coalition Herri Batasuna demonstrated Saturday
demanding a negotiated solution to the violence in the northern
Basque region, news reports said.
	   Marchers shouted slogans in favor of Basque independence and
improved conditions for prisoners from the armed separatist group
ETA, a reporter from the El Correo newspaper based in this
industrial city said.
	   Herri Batasuna, considered ETA's political wing, wins about 14
percent in elections held in the northern Basque region.
	   The demonstration came two days after Manuel Zamarreno, a
governing party councilor from the small Basque town of Renteria,
was killed by a bomb blamed on ETA.
	   After Zamarreno's funeral on Friday, thousands demonstrated in
silence in the nearby coastal city of San Sebastian to repudiate
ETA violence.
	   While not directly supporting ETA attacks, Herri Batasuna leader
Jon Idigoras told Saturday's marchers that ``the repression'' of
radical Basque nationalism by the government, ``only lengthens the
conflict unnecessarily and causes unnecessary victims,'' the
national news agency EFE reported.
	   ETA, an acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom, has killed
close to 800 people during its 30-year campaign for an independent
Basque state straddling the Spanish-French border.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar has ruled out negotiations with
Herri Batasuana unless it distances itself from ETA, or ETA lays
down its arms.
	   The coalition was forced to elect a new leadership in February
after its entire 23-member executive board was jailed for using an
ETA video calling for peace talks during an election broadcast.

Violent protests over singer's slaying widen in Berber region 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with protests in other Berber cities
By RACHID KHIARI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Violent protests widened in Algeria's
mountainous eastern Berber region Saturday, leaving at least one
person dead, as anger simmered over the slaying of Berber
singer-activist Lounes Matoub.
	   The assassination of Matoub by Muslim militants on Thursday set
off what was believed the largest unrest in the Berber region since
the so-called Berber Spring uprising of 1980. Local politicians
called for a general strike Sunday.
	   Like many Berbers, Matoub was critical of both the Algiers
government and the militants, and the slaying came just days before
a law takes effect making Arabic the only official language.
	   While the regional capital Tizi Ouzou saw a third day of
violence, protests also erupted Saturday in several cities
including the port city of Bejaia.
	   In the mountain city of Akbou, 180 kms (110 miles) east of
Algiers, protesters on Saturday sacked public buildings and offices
belonging to parties in the governing coalition, state radio
reported.
	   A day after protesters attacked a dozen state offices in Tizi
Ouzou, 100 kms (60 miles) east of Algiers, nearly 1,000 youths who
gathered outside the city's hospital to view Matoub's body Saturday
tried to build barricades and stoned police.
	   Officer struck back with clubs and tear gas, residents in the
city east of Algiers said on condition of anonymity.
	   One demonstrator was shot and killed and three were injured,
including one with a severe head wound, a hospital source said on
condition of anonymity.
	   The Interior Ministry said an 18-year-old man was fatally shot,
but authorities said security forces weren't to blame.
	   Several youths considered as leaders of the violence were
arrested, residents said, but no figures were available.
	   By late Saturday, smoke from burning tires and trash shrouded
the city where youths a day earlier sacked or burned five state
establishments including an airline office, welfare agency and
gasoline station.
	   Protests began Thursday, when the 42-year-old singer was killed
by Muslim militants at a fake roadblock outside his native village.
Youths burned tires and tore down Arabic-language road signs and
telephone poles before dispersing on their own.
	   The singer, a defender of Berber culture, was the latest
Algerian artist to be slain during a 6-year-old Muslim insurgency
that has claimed more than 75,000 lives.
	   The slaying inflamed anger in the region against the
government's plans July 5 to put a law in effect making Arabic the
official language in this former French colony and banning the
official use of other tongues including Berber and French.
	   The move was seen as an effort of the military-backed government
to appease supporters of Islamic movements.
	   Matoub's body on Saturday was placed in the municipal sports
arena in Tizi-Ouzou, then was transported in the evening to his
hometown of Beni Douala for burial there Sunday.
	   Political parties in the region called for a general strike on
Sunday, normally a work day in Muslim Algeria.
	   While there was no claim of responsibility for the attack,
officials blamed it on the Armed Islamic Group, the insurgency's
most violent movement, which kidnapped the singer in 1994 and held
him for two weeks.
	   The insurgency began after the government scrapped the
second-round parliamentary elections in January 1992. The Islamic
Salvation Front was expected to win the balloting on voter
discontent with corruption and high unemployment.

No surprise: Lecavalier the top pick at NHL Draft AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By BUCKY GLEASON
<TEXT>
	   BUFFALO, New York (AP) _ As expected, the Tampa Bay Lightning
made Vincent Lecavalier the No. 1 pick at Saturday's NHL Entry
Draft.
	   Rated as the top prospect by the NHL's Central Scouting Service,
the 6-foot-4 (192-centimeter), 180-pound (82-kilo) center from the
Quebec Major Junior Hockey League certified his ranking when his
name was the first one announced at the Marine Midland Arena.
	   Following right behind was David Legwand, a center from the
Ontario Hockey League, who was made the No. 2 overall pick by the
Nashville Predators. Legwand, the top-ranked American prospect was
also rated No. 2 by the scouting service.
	   The Predators, who had 26 picks in Friday's expansion draft,
drafted second on Saturday after a switch of picks in a deal with
the San Jose Sharks.
	   With the third overall pick in the draft, the Sharks selected
Brad Stuart, a 6-foot-2 (189 centimeter), 215-pound (97 1/2-kilo)
defenseman from the Western Hockey League.
	   The 18-year-old Lecavalier was challenged as the No. 1 prospect
all season by Legwand. Legwand, 17, had 105 points (54-51) with
Plymouth of the OHL.
	   Legwand spent much of his season working out with Sergei
Fedorov, who was in a contract dispute and practiced with Legwand's
team outside Detroit. Legwand, a Red Wings fan, was the OHL's first
rookie in 24 years to be named most valuable player.
	   ``You have to be patient,'' Legwand said. ``You have to take
your time because if you rush it, you could harm your development.
Hopefully, it will all work out.''
	   General managers and scouts from around the league have said a
dropoff exists after the first two picks.
	   ``There are a couple of guys at the top of everybody's list,''
general manager Jack Ferreira of the Anaheim Mighty Ducks said,
``and then eight or nine not quite at that level.''

Opposition party vows to step up protests in racially tense Guyana 
</HEADLINE>

	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ A fire that destroyed a three-story
building at the Ministry of Finance last week was the work of
arsonists, the government said Saturday.
	   Meanwhile, the top political opposition leader called for
supporters to stay away from their jobs Monday and march in a
protest against the government of President Janet Jagan.
	   The opposition People's National Congress issued a statement
Friday quoting party leader Desmond Hoyte asking ``people to
assemble at the Square of the Revolution Monday for a march of
defiance.''
	   The capital, Georgetown, remained tense but calm in recent days,
with no repeats of the disorganized clashes with police that have
disrupted the normal life of the city's business district. But
National Security Advisor Roger Luncheon said he was concerned
Monday's march could begin a new round of violence.
	   Last week, police detonated a bomb at their headquarters and the
fire at the Ministry of Finance on Monday destoyed a building and
left two Canadian consultants injured after they lept from a window
to escape the flames. Fire Chief Tulsie John said evidence from the
fire supported reports of an explosion that started the blaze.
	   The protests initially began when Hoyte lost to U.S.-born Jagan,
the widow of former president Cheddi Jagan, in the Dec. 15
presidential election and his party claimed fraud. But two
international groups examined the vote and declared it fair.
	   Hoyte now says his followers are protesting racism, government
corruption and alleged dismissals of officials believed to support
his party.
	   The dispute has racial as well as political overtones because
members of Hoyte's party are mostly blacks of African descent while
Jagan's People's Progressive Party is backed mainly by Guyanese of
East Indian descent.

Seles, Hingis win amid fire and rain AP Tennis Writer

EDS: AMS; RECASTS with new material throughout
By STEVE WILSTEIN
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Monica Seles welcomed the latest
deluge at Wimbledon on Saturday. At least it cleared the air of
choking smoke hovering above the stadium from a flat afire.
	   Nor were Todd Martin, Todd Woodbridge and fans watching them put
off much by the evacuation of Show Court 18, the one closest to the
blaze in a 12-story building across the street, as a precaution
against cascading cinders. After all, within a few minutes every
court was empty and covered with puddles on top of the tarps.
	   Thunder rocked Wimbledon louder than any applause, and the
prettiest sight was not a lob or a volley but a gorgeous double
rainbow arching across the sky. It was that kind of day at the All
England Club.
	   In the interludes between showers _ seven or eight, by
unofficial count, that kept the tarp crews busy _ some tennis did
get squeezed in before play was abandoned with defending champion
Pete Sampras up 6-3, 5-5 against Thomas Enqvist, and Venus and
Serena Williams waiting to play on different courts.
	   Defending women's champ Martina Hingis floated easily into the
round of 16, 6-2, 6-1 against Elena Likhovtseva, and the No. 6
Seles did the same, 6-2, 6-3 against Yayuk Basuki.
	   Former champion Conchita Martinez, seeded No. 8, was less lucky
in the resumption of a match suspended Friday as she fell 2-6, 6-3,
7-5 to England's Samantha Smith, a 26-year-old who had never gone
beyond the first round in five previous Wimbledons.
	   Martinez called the loss the most disappointing of her career.
	   ``I didn't feel that I could get ready for a match because the
courts did not open until 10 a.m., and then they give you a call,''
she said. ``I was rushed the whole morning and that showed in my
whole mood ... I should have won that in two sets easy.''
	   For the exhilarated Smith, the match was the thrill of a
lifetime and the biggest victory by a British woman in a decade.
	   ``I played some of the best tennis I think I've ever played at
the right time,'' Smith said. ``She got a litle bit tentative, a
little bit nervous, and I just went for it and took my chances.''
	   In men's play, Australian Open champion and No. 3 seed Petr
Korda advanced 4-6, 7-5, 7-5, 7-5 past Jerome Golmard, and No. 12
Tim Henman beat Byron Black 6-4, 6-4, 3-6, 7-5.
	   On a day when the play was unspectacular, and the results not at
all unusual except for Martinez's defeat, the fire, showers and
rainbow drew most of the attention. No one was injured in the
ninth-floor apartment where the blaze began, but several residents
of the building were treated for smoke inhalation and shock. No one
was injured at Wimbledon, where a picnic area near the building
also was evacuated.
	   Seles, for one, was relieved to take refuge after her match.
	   ``I think I had yesterday about 10 warmups when we thought we
would go on, but they said we had to wait,'' she said. ``Today (we
had) about three or four. And with the fire in the beginning, it
was just so strange to be out there. I was hoping it's OK to
breathe the air in. But in the end the rain came, and it was a good
time for that.''
	   Seles said the smell of the smoke was ``pretty bad,'' enough so
that ``both Yayuk and I felt we should stop. But at the end it was
probably better to just go on because it doesn't matter. We've seen
everything today.''
	   Seles reached the Wimbledon final in 1992, the year before she
was stabbed in Germany, and she's in good position to make another
run for the title this year now that seven-time champion Steffi
Graf is gone from her half of the draw.
	   Seles, who reached the French Open final earlier this month a
few weeks after her father's death from cancer, is playing with
increasing confidence and less on her mind. She plays next against
Sandrine Testud, who beat her last year at Wimbledon and this year
on clay at the Italian Open.
	   ``I just have a peace of mind in terms of I'm happy where I am
right now,'' Seles said. ``I don't have doubts and I don't feel
guilt on my part that I'm not where I feel I should have been. So
that makes it a lot easier. I just know what my day is about, and I
have my schedule back like I used to, and that gives me peace of
mind. I think that translates out on the court, too.''

World Cup: Brazil leads 3-0 at halftime 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Cesar Sampaio returned from suspension to score
twice and Ronaldo fired home a penalty as defending champion Brazil
took a 3-0 halftime lead over Chile Saturday to look well on course
for a place in the World Cup quarterfinal.
	   Supposedly a defensive midfielder, Japanese-based Cesar Sampaio
player headed the Brazilians ahead after only 11 minutes and then
fired a low shot home from the edge of the penalty area in the 27th
after a Roberto Carlos free kick had been deflected to him.
	   Ronaldo hit the third in the second minute of injury time after
he had been felled by 'keeper Nelson Tapia on a run towards goal.
	   After 10 minutes of enterprising play by underdog Chile, Brazil
scored with its first real attack of the game,
	   After a foul on the left on Rivaldo, Dunga curled a free kick
over a slow-moving Chilean defense and Cesar Sampaio arrived
unmarked to head powerfully past Tapia from barely eight meters
(yards).
	   Two minutes later, Roberto Carlos powered one of his trademark
left-foot drives just to high as Brazil threatened again and the
defending champion hit the target again in the 27th minute.
	   Ronaldo was fouled by two Chilean markers 30 meters from goal
and Roberto Carlos powered the low free kick into the danger area.
	   The ball was deflected wide and hit Bebeto, who inadvertently
directed in to Cesar Sampaio who was lurking on the edge of the
area.
	   The midfielder calmly side-footed it low past Tapia and Brazil
looked in control.
	   Six minutes before halftime Ivan Zamorano and Fernando Cornejo
combined well to open up the left side of the Brazilian defense but
Cornejo's final shot, with only Taffarel to beat, was pitifully
weak and straight at the 'keeper.
	   Lineups:
	   Brazil _ Taffarel; Cafu, Junior Baiano, Aldair, Roberto Carlos;
Dunga, Cesar Sampaio, Leonardo, Rivaldo; Ronaldo, Bebeto
	   Chile _ Nelson Tapia; Ronaldo Fuentes, Javier Margas, Pedro
Reyes, Miguel Ramirez; Mauricio Aros, Fernando Cornejo, Clarence
Acuna, Jose Sierra; Ivan Zamorano, Marcelo Salas
	   Referee _ Marc Batta, France.

Fighting intensifies in Kosovo amid signs of Serb buildup evacuated, reports of buildup, Holbrooke comments 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS with more from Kijevo, civilians reported

By ADAM BROWN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PANTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav army guns bombarded rebel
positions and Serb civilians were airlifted from a besieged village
Saturday in central Kosovo, where fighting is escalating despite
diplomatic efforts.
	   A day after U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke ended four days of
shuttle diplomacy in the region, there were several signs the
conflict is intensifying, and that the Serbs are building up their
forces for a possible new offensive.
	   ``We are only a few steps away from a general war,'' Holbrooke
said at a forum of political and economic leaders in Switzerland.
	   A new round of fighting erupted Friday and Saturday in this
central town of 1,000, with other skirmishes reported elsewhere.
The Albanians' Kosovo Information Center reported heavy
reinforcement of government troops near Pristina airport, including
58 tanks.
	   In a move that shows Kosovo's Albanians are increasingly
supportive of fighting the Serbs, several top politicians founded a
new movement intended to serve as the political wing of the
once-isolated Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The focus of Holbrooke and other international officials was on
a dangerous standoff at Kijevo, southwest of the provincial capital
Pristina. Fighting has increased in recent days around the village,
surrounded by the KLA at a crossroads on Kosovo's main east-west
road.
	   On Saturday, with Serb police and civilians cut off for 10 days,
police said four women and a child were flown out by helicopter and
food and medicines were brought in.
	   An influential ethnic Albanian politician, Adem Demaci, said he
was asked by Holbrooke to mediate with the Albanian militants in
Kijevo on Friday, but his efforts produced no reaction.
	   According to TV Tirana in neighboring Albania, the rebels said
they would let the Serbs go if the police and Yugoslav army
withdraw from three vital positions in the area west of Pristina.
	   Holbrooke, speaking in Switzerland, said Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic believes he has the right to open the road by
force if necessary.
	   ``If he opened the checkpoint at Kijevo by force, there would be
tremendous bloodshed and you would know about Kijevo as a place
that could have triggered a wider war,'' he said.
	   More than 300 people have died in Kosovo since early March in
stepped-up fighting that began after Serbian police launched a
crackdown against secessionist militants, led by the shadowy KLA.
	   Holbrooke issued another warning that it could soon worsen.
	   ``The search for a peaceful solution to the Kosovo problem is
indispensable to the West,'' he said. ``If we fail, and the
situation spirals out of control into a general war across
international borders, affecting Albania, Macedonia and other
countries, perhaps Greece, the danger to European stability will be
even greater than it was in Bosnia.''
	   Access to Kijevo was limited Saturday due to the clashes. But a
new flashpoint was erupting to the north in Pantina, a mixed town
of Serbs and Albanians which houses a Yugoslav army base.
	   Explosions and the rattle of heavy machine-gun fire and small
arms could be heard on two sides of Pantina from Friday afternoon
to Saturday afternoon. At least six columns of smoke rose from the
edge of the town, just 25 kilometers (15 miles) west of the
provincial capital Pristina.
	   Green infantry fighting vehicles armed with anti-tank missiles
and double-barreled anti-aircraft guns fired periodic barrages into
the town from a ridge surrounding Pantina.
	   Sentries who denied access to the town to journalists said a
column of KLA fighters was battling the army less than a kilometer
(half-mile) southwest of the village.
	   The province's majority ethnic Albanians have become more
supportive of the KLA in the face of increased Serb firepower, and
more dissatisfied with Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, who favors a
pacifist approach to gain independence.
	   On Saturday, several officials once loyal to Rugova _ including
his former top aide Hidajet Hiseni and prominent activist Rexhep
Qosja _ founded the Albanian Democratic Movement with the aim of
uniting radicals.
	   ``Albanians in Kosovo can now be proud that our sons on the
ground defend their people and fight for a Kosovo where Albanians
would no longer be prosecuted but can decide themselves about their
destiny,'' Qosja said at the founding convention in Pristina.

Embattled Trimble ready to `carry the burden' atop Belfast Assembly With NIreland-Results 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES graf 2 with final result showing 28 seats for Ulster
Unionists; CORRECTS to 42 in graf 10
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ For Ulster Unionist leader
David Trimble, Saturday's confirmation that his Protestant party is
the largest in the new Northern Ireland Assembly feels more like a
burden than a triumph.
	   Faced now with leading Northern Ireland's deeply divided
majority community farther down the road to compromise with
Catholics, Trimble's fractured party will hold a vulnerable 28
seats in the new 108-member government-in-waiting. That, plus the
support of two members from another pro-agreement party, provide
the minimum for Ulster Unionists to implement the agreement.
	   But a vital minority of those newly elected Ulster Unionists are
either fair-weather supporters or closet opponents of the
agreement. If they jump ship on votes to the Assembly's unambiguous
anti-agreement camp of 28 Protestants, they could block
implementation of parts of the accord they don't like.
	   Trimble appealed to his party to stop ``inflicting damage on
itself by squabbling in public'' over the merits of the accord,
which he defends as securing Northern Ireland's union with Britain.
	   ``I don't have any baseball bats with nails in them to deal with
dissidents,'' Trimble said. ``We must have self-discipline within
the party.''
	   Mindful of the potential for Protestant obstruction, the April
agreement struck among eight parties and the British and Irish
governments contained a ``self-destruct'' clause for the Assembly.
	   It specified that the Assembly by October must appoint a
multi-party administration to run different government departments.
To the alarm of many Protestants, this new 12-member Executive will
be required to cooperate with the neighboring Irish Republic _ and
include members of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party.
	   If Protestants try to block this agenda, the British government
reserved the right to pull the Assembly's plug, just as it did to
Northern Ireland's last local parliament in 1972.
	   That's not an option Britain wants to take. The Assembly, and
the new administration, were intended to secure the cease-fires
called by both Catholic and Protestant gunmen, and to provide
normal democratic mechanisms for resolving deep differences that
fueled three decades of violence.
	   Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam, whose
governor-style powers would mostly be transferred to the Executive
next year if the plan succeeds, said ``the results mean that we're
going to have an Assembly that will work.''
	   The election produced a 42-strong Catholic bloc in the Assembly,
united and bearing a long list of demands, among them that
traditional Protestant Orange Order parades be rerouted if they go
through or near hostile Catholic areas.

Diana's musical friends star at concert near her grave 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with rain, concert under way
<TEXT>
	   GREAT BRINGTON, England (AP) _ A musical tribute to Princess
Diana opened under a cloud on Saturday, but a downpour failed to
dampen the spirits of many rainsoaked concertgoers at the Althorp
estate where the princess is buried.
	   When the choir of New College, Oxford, opened the charity
open-air concert, the clouds cleared and the sun began to shine.
	   Diana's brother, Earl Spencer, watched from a tented area with
their mother, Frances Shand-Kydd. But he wandered into the arena
and joined the crowd near the front of the stage to listen to
Julian Lloyd Webber perform Faure's ``Elegy.''
	   Then, carrying his 3-year-old son, Louis, on his shoulders, he
went backstage to chat with some of the performers.
	   About an hour before the 7 p.m. start, the 15,000 fans crowded
in the arena had been soaked by a 15-minute downpour. The field
grew soggy and quickly turned into a sea of umbrellas. But many
fans refused to let the weather get them down.
	   ``In a funny way I think the rain and the bad weather will
contribute to the atmosphere of the occasion,'' said Janet
Depledge, a teacher from Huddersfield, Yorkshire in northern
England . She and her husband and their two friends brought smoked
salmon, champagne and a candelabra with them for a picnic.
	   ``We're determined not to let it put us off and I'm sure it will
be a night we will remember for ever. I think it's wonderful,'' she
said.
	   The princess, who was killed Aug. 31 in a car crash, is buried
on an island about a mile (1.6 km) away from the concert arena.
	   Many people have criticized the price of tickets and some were
upset that the concert was being held so close to her grave.
Several stars, including Phil Collins, declined to appear. And Wet,
Wet, Wet and Jimmy Nail pulled out because of other commitments.
	   At least 13 pounds (dlrs 21.60) of each 39.50 pounds (dlrs 64.80
)full-price ticket will go to the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial
Fund, an Althorp spokeswoman said anonymously.

there is too much charity going on,'' singer Sir Cliff Richard told
BBC Radio earlier in the day. ``... I think we should keep in our
memories ... this compassionate, fragile, rather lovely woman who
did a lot of wonderful things.''
	   Irish singer-songwriter Chris De Burg said he would imagine
Diana's spirit enjoying the concert.
	   ``I believe that spirits are all around us anyway,'' he said.
``So I think Diana will be there at the biggest party in Britain,
and I hope she enjoys my performance.''
	   The estate, about 75 miles (120 kms) northwest of London, opens
Wednesday for two months, Some 150,000 people are expected to tour

<TEXT>
	   AKOURE, Ivory Coast (AP) _ A small chartered plane carrying the
U.N. envoy to Angola crashed into a swamp as it approached the
airport in Abidjan, Ivorian officials said Saturday. There were no
signs of survivors.
	   The plane carrying Alioune Blondin Beye, a highly respected
politician, diplomat and scholar from the West African nation of
Mali, had left from Lome, Togo, on Friday night. Beye, 59, had met
with Togolese President Gnassigbe Eyadema in an effort to win
support for the peace process in Angola, according to a statement
from the U.N. Observer Mission in that southern African country.
	   Rescuers have been unable to reach the wreckage of the
Beechcraft 200 because of the terrain. However, the jet was spotted
from a helicopter a few kilometers (miles) from the small town of
Akoure, about 20 miles (35 kilometers) from the Ivorian commercial
capital of Abidjan, Commander Mouton, the head of the Ivorian
emergency rescue service, told state radio.
	   ``The terrain is very difficult. We hope to get in there
tomorrow,'' said Mouton, whose full name was not immediately
available.
	   People in Akoure said they first thought the crash was a bomb.
	   ``I saw a big light and then later there was a roar,'' said
Elvistere Anane, a 16-year-old village boy.
	   Hundreds of soldiers, both Ivorian and French, were in the
Akoure region Saturday afternoon to help in the operation.
	   News of the crash came as a shock in the Malian capital of
Bamako, where Beye has been a well-known figure for years.
	   ``This is a crisis we're living through,'' said Amidou Diabate,
the Malian minister of justice, who had been a student of Beye's
while at university. ``Beye is a ray of hope for Mali.''
	   The control tower in Abidjan lost contact with the plane about
13 miles (20 kilometers) from the airport, and search-and-rescue
operations were launched, the U.N. mission said. Eight people,
including two crew members, were aboard, the statement said.
	   Togolese Foreign Minister Koffi Panou said in Lome that seven
people, including three crew members, were aboard.
	   There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy.
	   Panou said the other three passengers were Togolese foreign
ministry employee Koffi Adjovi, Senegalese journalist Moktar Gueye
and Baendegar Dessandre, who is from Chad.
	   The mission statement said Beye was accompanied by five staff
members and two crew members. It did not provide names.
	   Beye, whose name is pronounced Ali-OON Blond-AHN Bay, was named
envoy to Angola in 1993 by then-U.N. Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali. Since then he has been mediating the Angolan peace
process from his base in Lusaka, Zambia. War broke out in Angola
after the country's 1975 independence from Portugal.
	   Beye, 59, threatened to resign last month, saying the government
and former rebel movement UNITA lacked the ``political will'' to
see the peace process to its conclusion.
	   Beye mediated the 1994 peace pact signed in Lusaka. An earlier
peace accord, signed in Lisbon in 1991, collapsed a year later when
UNITA, the Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, rejected its defeat in the country's
first-ever elections and returned to the bush.
	   Lingering hostility between the government and UNITA has stymied
implementation of the pact, which is running more than a year
behind schedule, and the U.N.'s patience is growing thin.
	   The U.N. Security Council agreed Wednesday to give UNITA five
more days to comply with terms of the plan.
	   After June 30, the U.N. Security Council will freeze UNITA's
foreign bank accounts and ban its diamond exports unless the
movement relinquishes its central highland strongholds and takes
major steps to demobilize.
	   UNITA criticized the threatened sanctions Friday, calling them
illegal and saying they would jeopardize the peace agreement.
	   Before being named U.N. envoy, Beye served in a number of posts
in the Malian cabinet, including foreign minister, and has been
legal counsel to the Malian president. He has also been on the
faculty of universities in France and Mali.

South Africa's newest party elects leaders 
</HEADLINE>
By PAT REBER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The United Democratic
Movement, an amalgam of former pro-and anti-apartheid activists,
elected a black president on Saturday to lead the country's newest
party into next year's elections.
	   The UDM's 1,200 delegates elected former African National
Congress leader Bantu Holomisa to lead the party and named Rolf
Meyer, a former apartheid Cabinet member, deputy national chairman.
	   ``We must begin the election fight,'' Holomisa said.
	   The gathering also chose a controversial figure as its national
secretary _ Sifiso Nkabinde, another ANC renegade who earlier this
year was acquitted of charges that he killed 16 people in ongoing
political violence in KwaZulu-Natal Province.
	   In South Africa's first all-race election in 1994 which ended
apartheid, the ANC won 62 percent of the vote, while Meyer's
National Party won 20 percent.
	   The UDM hopes to attract multiracial voters dissatisfied with
both parties and interested in breaking the ANC's grip on power.
	   Meyer and Holomisa, co-leaders since they founded the UDM last
year, have called for national referendums on abortion, legalized
by the ANC government, and reintroduction of the death penalty,
which was banned in the post 1994 constitution.
	   Both issues would be discussed later this year, Meyer said.
	   While the UDM was likely to attract some black followers, the
ANC is expected to maintain its overwhelming support among the
black majority in 1999 elections.
	   Holomisa said the UDM will appeal for government funding that
other parties receive. Only political parties currently represented
in Parliament qualify for election funding.
	   Holomisa also urged big business to help the party.
	   ``Fighting an election without money is difficult, even given
the level of commitment of our supporters,'' he said.

China will train Zambian troops 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ China will provide military training to
Zambia, a Chinese military officer said Saturday.
	   Chinese Maj. Sung Xhien, who led a three-member delegation on a
three-day official visit to Zambia, said at a press briefing that
his country would cooperate with Zambia in various technical fields
of modern military training.
	   China has opened its first commercial bank in Africa, in Lusaka,
to handle its increased business and commercial activities in the
region.
	   On Sunday, a Chinese firm, Non-Ferrous Metal Corporation, is to
seal the purchase of the Chambeshi copper mine. Reports of the sale
price have varied from dlrs 20 million to dlrs 150 million.
	   Last year, Chinese Premier Li Peng visited Zambia on a
seven-nation African tour aimed at bolstering his nation's economic
ties with the continent.
	   Since the early 1970s, China has built a 2,000-kilometer
(1,259-mile) railroad from eastern Zambia to the Tanzanian port of
Dar es Salaam, sold military hardware to Zambia and helped develop
Zambia's now-ailing textile industry.
	   After a partial Western aid freeze last year to protest the
exclusion of former President Kenneth Kaunda from national
elections in November, China increased its aid by dlrs 3 million,
saying it wanted to cushion the impact of reduced Western aid.

World Cup: Brazil wins 4-1 to reach quarterfinal 
</HEADLINE>
By PETER MUELLO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Ronaldo and Cesar Sampaio each fired two goals as
defending champion Brazil brushed aside Chile 4-1 Saturday to make
the World Cup quarterfinal.
	   The four-time titlist, their form building ominously as the
championship progresses, created many more chances against the
Chileans and now faces either Nigeria or Denmark for a place in the
semifinal.
	   Supposedly a defensive midfielder, Japanese-based Cesar Sampaio
player returned from suspension to head the Brazilians ahead after
only 11 minutes and then fired a low shot home from the edge of the
penalty area in the 27th after a Roberto Carlos free kick had been
deflected to him.
	   Ronaldo hit the third in the second minute of injury time after
he had been felled by 'keeper Nelson Tapia on a run towards goal.
The Inter striker slid home the fourth 20 minutes from the end and
also hit the post and the bar.
	   After 10 minutes of enterprising play by underdog Chile, Brazil
scored with its first real attack of the game,
	   After a foul on the left on Rivaldo, Dunga curled a free kick
over a slow-moving Chilean defense and the suspiciously offside
Cesar Sampaio arrived unmarked to head powerfully past Tapia from
barely eight meters (yards).
	   Two minutes later, Roberto Carlos powered one of his trademark
left-foot drives just too high as Brazil threatened again and the
defending champion hit the target again in the 27th minute.
	   Ronaldo was fouled by two Chilean markers 30 meters from goal
and Roberto Carlos powered the low free kick into the danger area.
	   The ball was deflected wide and hit Bebeto, who inadvertently
directed it to Cesar Sampaio, lurking on the edge of the area.
	   The midfielder calmly side-footed it low past Tapia and Brazil
looked in control.
	   Six minutes before halftime Ivan Zamorano and Fernando Cornejo
combined well to open up the left side of the Brazilian defense.
But Cornejo's final shot, with only Taffarel to beat, was pitifully
weak and straight at the 'keeper.
	   Ronaldo's penalty came after he'd taken the ball at speed and
raced past the last defender. He had Leonardo with him as he tried
to move the ball past the advancing 'keeper, who grabbed his legs
as he went by and hauled the Inter Milan striker down.
	   Tapia, who received a yellow card for the foul, got his fingers
to the penalty but the shot had too much power.
	   Facing elimination, Chile sent on Fabian Estay and Marcelo Vega
to shake up the midfield in the second half but still looked likely
to concede more goals.
	   Brazil replaced Bebeto with Denilson and he immediately started
the move that led to Cesar Sampaio finding Ronaldo with a
defense-splitting pass in the 67th minute. The Inter striker hit
the ball first time and the ball beat Tapia but hit the post.
	   Chile pulled a goal back a minute later but then fell 4-1
behind.
	   Zamorano climbed above a Brazilian defender to head a through
ball goalwards but Taffarel, off his line, blocked the effort.
Salas was perfectly placed to head the rebound into an empty net.
	   The Chilean celebrations were silenced by a fourth Brazilian
goal in the 70th minute when Cafu put Ronaldo in the clear and the
striker waited, drew Tapia well off his line, and prodded the ball
past him from 16 meters.
	   Denilson should have hit the fifth in the 73rd minute when
Rivaldo burst past three Chilean tackles in midfield and found the
substitute unmarked in front of goal. Denilson failed to control
the ball properly, eventually fed the ball back to Cafu who lobbed
it over the top with Tapia well off his line.
	   Ronaldo, criticized before the game for not scoring often enough
at the championship, almost scored his third five minutes before
the end when Roberto Carlos found him with a cross from the left
but the striker fired first time against the underside of the bar.
	   Lineups:
	   Brazil _ Taffarel; Cafu, Junior Baiano, Aldair (Goncalves,
77th), Roberto Carlos; Dunga, Cesar Sampaio, Leonardo, Rivaldo;
Ronaldo, Bebeto (Denilson, 65th).
	   Chile _ Nelson Tapia; Ronaldo Fuentes, Javier Margas, Pedro
Reyes, Miguel Ramirez (Fabian Estay, 46th); Mauricio Aros, Fernando
Cornejo, Clarence Acuna (Luis Musrri, 80th), Jose Sierra (Marcelo
Vega, 46th); Ivan Zamorano, Marcelo Salas.
	   Referee _ Marc Batta, France.

	   PANTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav army guns bombarded rebel
positions and Serb civilians were airlifted from a besieged village
Saturday in central Kosovo, where fighting is escalating despite
diplomatic efforts.
	   A day after U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke ended four days of
shuttle diplomacy in the region, there were several signs the
conflict is intensifying, and that the Serbs are building up their
forces for a possible new offensive.
	   ``We are only a few steps away from a general war,'' Holbrooke
said at a forum of political and economic leaders in Switzerland.
	   A new round of fighting erupted Friday and Saturday in this
central town of 1,000, with other skirmishes reported elsewhere.
The Albanians' Kosovo Information Center reported heavy
reinforcement of government troops near Pristina airport, including
58 tanks.
	   In a move that shows Kosovo's Albanians are increasingly
supportive of fighting the Serbs, several top politicians founded a
new movement intended to serve as the political wing of the
once-isolated Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The focus of Holbrooke and other international officials was on
a dangerous standoff at Kijevo, southwest of the provincial capital
Pristina. Fighting has increased in recent days around the village,
surrounded by the KLA at a crossroads on Kosovo's main east-west
road.
	   On Saturday, with Serb police and civilians cut off for 10 days,
police said four women and a child were flown out by helicopter and
food and medicines were brought in.
	   An influential ethnic Albanian politician, Adem Demaci, said he
was asked by Holbrooke to mediate with the Albanian militants in
Kijevo on Friday, but his efforts produced no reaction.
	   According to TV Tirana in neighboring Albania, the rebels said
they would let the Serbs go if the police and Yugoslav army
withdraw from three vital positions in the area west of Pristina.
	   Holbrooke, speaking in Switzerland, said Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic believes he has the right to open the road by
force if necessary.
	   ``If he opened the checkpoint at Kijevo by force, there would be
tremendous bloodshed and you would know about Kijevo as a place
that could have triggered a wider war,'' he said.
	   More than 300 people have died in Kosovo since early March in
stepped-up fighting that began after Serbian police launched a
crackdown against secessionist militants, led by the shadowy KLA.
	   Holbrooke issued another warning that it could soon worsen.
	   ``The search for a peaceful solution to the Kosovo problem is
indispensable to the West,'' he said. ``If we fail, and the
situation spirals out of control into a general war across
international borders, affecting Albania, Macedonia and other
countries, perhaps Greece, the danger to European stability will be
even greater than it was in Bosnia.''
	   Access to Kijevo was limited Saturday due to the clashes. But a
new flashpoint was erupting to the north in Pantina, a mixed town
of Serbs and Albanians which houses a Yugoslav army base.
	   Explosions and the rattle of heavy machine-gun fire and small
arms could be heard on two sides of Pantina from Friday afternoon
to Saturday afternoon. At least six columns of smoke rose from the
edge of the town, just 25 kilometers (15 miles) west of the
provincial capital Pristina.
	   Green infantry fighting vehicles armed with anti-tank missiles
and double-barreled anti-aircraft guns fired periodic barrages into
the town from a ridge surrounding Pantina.
	   Sentries who denied access to the town to journalists said a
column of KLA fighters was battling the army less than a kilometer
(half-mile) southwest of the village.
	   The province's majority ethnic Albanians have become more
supportive of the KLA in the face of increased Serb firepower, and
more dissatisfied with Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, who favors a
pacifist approach to gain independence.
	   On Saturday, several officials once loyal to Rugova _ including
his former top aide Hidajet Hiseni and prominent activist Rexhep
Qosja _ founded the Albanian Democratic Movement with the aim of
uniting radicals.
	   ``Albanians in Kosovo can now be proud that our sons on the
ground defend their people and fight for a Kosovo where Albanians
would no longer be prosecuted but can decide themselves about their
destiny,'' Qosja said at the founding convention in Pristina.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Finalists four years ago, Brazil and Italy became
the first two teams to reach the World Cup quarterfinals on
Saturday as peace and normality returned to the competition after
Friday's tension and violence at Lens and Lille.
	   Ronaldo and Cesar Sampaio hit two goals each as four-time
titlist and defending titlist Brazil outplayed Chile 4-1 at the
Parc des Princes.
	   The Brazilians, who beat the Italians in a penalty shootout
after the 1994 final ended 0-0, will meet either Olympic champion
Nigeria or Denmark for a place in the semifinal of World Cup '98.
	   Ahead after only 11 minutes through Cesar Sampaio's header, the
Brazilians should have scored more goals against the outplayed
Chileans. Ronaldo hit the post and the bar in the second half and
Denilson missed an easy chance.
	   Christian Vieri, who plays in Spain for Atletico Madrid, went to
the top of the goalscorers' list with his fifth of the tournament
and the only goal of the game at Marseille as Italy, a three-time
Cup winner and losing finalist last time out, downed Norway 1-0.
	   Cesare Maldini's team plays either France or Paraguay on Friday
for a place in the semifinals.
	   While the famed Brazilian strikeforce took the honors in Paris,
the first game of the second round was a triumph for Italian
goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca.
	   Playing against Norway four years ago at Giants Stadium, he
became the first goalkeeper to be sent off at the World Cup finals
when he was penalized for a foul early in the game.
	   Against the Norwegians this time, Pagliuca, who regained his
place after a pre-World Cup injury to first choice Angelo Perruzi,
made a reflex-action save on the line to deny Tore Andre Flo 19
minutes from the end to ensure an Italian victory at the Stade
Velodrome.
	   Victories for Brazil and Italy provided just the sort of
normality the World Cup organizers wanted after yet another day of
unwanted intrusion by the hooligans.
	   A huge turnout of 2,000 police stood by as thousands of English
fans, many of them defying a ban on alcohol and arriving without
tickets, broke into sporadic acts of violence on the streets of
Lens, where the shops were closed even on a usually busy Friday
afternoon.
	   The fans' mood and actions gave the citizens of Lens a reminder
of the grim events of a week ago, when a local policeman was left
in a coma after being attacked by an iron bar-wielding German fan.
	   And in Bordeaux, two Argentines were arrested Saturday for
allegedly attacking Croat fans who refused to hand over their
tickets to Friday's Argentina-Croatia game.
	   The events of Lens and Lille, where English fans fought with
local French youths on Friday, and the background of earlier
violence in Marseille prompted a new attack on the violence by new
FIFA president Sepp Blatter.
	   ``We have seen the incidents in Marseille and the extremely
serious incidents in Lens. They were closer to acts of terrorism
than acts of hooliganism,'' Blatter said. ``This violence is not of
football, it is of society as a whole. These people use the World
Cup as a launching pad.''
	   Meanwhile, the long-running tickets fiasco took two new twists
Saturday.
	   Sources said that a volunteer for the World Cup's French
organizing committee, CFO, had been arrested in Lens after the
England-Colombia game for allegedly selling about 50 premium
tickets in the VIP section.
	   Officials became suspicious when fans wearing T-shirts were
spotted among the suit-cladded VIPs.
	   It was the latest problem involving tickets for World Cup
organizers. Most have involved travel agencies that allegedly
oversold tickets or failed to deliver them.
	   On Friday, the head of a U.S. ticket agency for the World Cup
was placed under formal investigation _ one step short of being
charged _ for alleged fraud. He reported the theft of thousands of
tickets which officials said were already sold, judicial sources
said.
	   Douglas Knittle, president and general manager of Prime Sports
International, was placed under judicial controls, preventing him
from leaving the country, the sources said.
	   Critics have also said distribution plans were unfairly weighted
toward French fans and sponsors and the situation has led to
another headache leading up to the England-Argentina game at
Saint-Etienne on Tuesday.
	   The English Football Association complained Saturday that
England's official ticket allocation for the game was only 2,049.
With something like 10 times that figure likely to show up from
England for the game there likely will be a flood of demand on the
black market and fresh fears of violence.
	   FA deputy chief executive Pat Smith said the association was
trying to negotiate more tickets for the game match.

<TEXT>
	   GREAT BRINGTON, England (AP) _ A musical tribute to Princess
Diana began under a cloud on Saturday, but a downpour failed to
dampen the spirits of many rainsoaked concertgoers at the Althorp
estate where the princess is buried.
	   Spirits rose steadily and before it was over, people were
dancing to the music.
	   ``It has been a night we will remember for ever,'' said Annwen
Smalley, 41, from Wales. ``The weather has been bad but we are
British and we get over these things.''
	   About an hour before the 7 p.m. start, the 15,000 fans crowded
in the arena had been soaked by a 15-minute downpour. The field
grew soggy and quickly turned into a sea of umbrellas.+
	   But when the choir of New College, Oxford, opened the charity
open-air concert, the clouds cleared and the sun began to shine.
	   Diana's brother, Earl Spencer, watched from a tented area with
their mother, Frances Shand-Kydd. But he wandered into the arena
and joined the crowd near the front of the stage to listen to
Julian Lloyd Webber perform Faure's ``Elegy.''
	   Then, carrying his 3-year-old son, Louis, on his shoulders, he
went backstage to chat with some of the performers.
	   The stars wandered into the arena to join the crowds after their
performances.
	   ``In a funny way I think the rain and the bad weather will
contribute to the atmosphere of the occasion,'' said Janet
Depledge, a teacher from Huddersfield, Yorkshire in northern
England .
	   The princess, who was killed Aug. 31 in a Paris car crash, is
buried on an island about a mile (1.6 km) from the concert arena.
	   Many people have criticized the price of tickets and some were
upset that the concert was held so close to her grave. Several
stars, including Phil Collins, declined to appear. And Wet, Wet,
Wet pulled out because of other commitments.
	   At least 13 pounds (dlrs 21.60) of each 39.50 pounds (dlrs 64.80
) ticket will go to the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund, an
Althorp spokeswoman said anonymously.
	   ``It is a charity show and I am sick and tired of people saying
there is too much charity going on,'' singer Sir Cliff Richard told
BBC Radio the morning before his performance. ``... I think we
should keep in our memories ... this compassionate, fragile, rather
lovely woman who did a lot of wonderful things.''
	   Irish singer-songwriter Chris De Burgh said he would imagine
Diana's spirit enjoying the concert.
	   ``I believe that spirits are all around us anyway,'' he said.
``So I think Diana will be there at the biggest party in Britain,
and I hope she enjoys my performance.''
	   The estate, about 75 miles (120 kms) northwest of London, opens
Wednesday for two months. Some 150,000 people are expected to tour
a new museum dedicated to her life.

Strong quake causes casualties, damage in southern Turkey

	   ADANA, Turkey (AP) _ An earthquake rattled this southern city on
Saturday, killing at least 104 people and injuring about 1,000
others, officials said.
	   Among those killed in the magnitude 6.2 quake were 37 people who
lived in the slums of Adana, a city of 1 million, said Deputy Gov.
Ardahan Totuk.
	   He said a total of 104 people had been reported killed. The
number of injured had reached about 1,000, said Gov. Oguz Koksal.
	   At least 30 people also were reported dead in the nearby town of
Ceyhan, site of an oil terminal, the Anatolia news agency said.
Ceyhan is about 60 kilometers (40 miles) east of Adana. It was not
clear whether the oil pipeline linking Iraq to Turkey had suffered
any damage.
	   According to an announcement from the headquarters of the U.S.
Air Forces in Europe, 25 people at Incirlik air base sustained
minor injuries.
	   A U.S. Embassy spokesperson, speaking on condition of anonymity,
told The Associated Press that a dozen U.S. citizens were lightly
injured by falling objects.
	   A brief U.S. statement also said the earthquake caused
substantial structural and electrical damage to buildings on base.
Because the phone lines were knocked out in the quake, it was
impossible to call the base directly for further details.
	   The quake struck at 16:56 p.m. (1356 GMT) and had a preliminary
magnitude of 6.3, according to Istanbul's Kandilli observatory. The
U.S. Geological Survey put the preliminary magnitude at 6.2 and
said the quake rattled the neighboring provinces of Mersin, Nigde
and Kayseri, as well as the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, off
Turkey's southern coast.
	   Thousands of people fled their homes in panic, NTV said. The
quake shattered windows and caused cracks in several buildings, as
well as damaging some mosques. In the port city of Mersin, about 20
people were treated for shock, Nedim Ince, a doctor at the state
hospital, told NTV.
	   ``I felt a tremendous shake,'' said Ince. ``It was something
fearful.''
	   State television footage from the scene showed badly damaged
houses and rescue teams pulling a young girl out of the debris,
while others tried to clear the rubble with their hands hoping to
find more people alive.
	   Television news broadcasts speculated that poor construction of
housing was responsible for the high death toll.
	   Officials urged people not to return to their damaged houses and
the Turkish Red Crescent, the Muslim equivalent of the Red Cross,
was setting up tents. Hospital beds were placed in the streets and
calls were made for blood donations.
	   Authorities cut power in Adana and Mersin to prevent fires and
advised people to spend the night outside their homes, anticipating
aftershocks.
	   Rescue teams were being hindered in their work by the masses of
people crowding the streets. Many tried to leave Adana causing
heavy traffic jams.
	   Adana, where the quake was centered, is only 20 kilometers (10
miles) from Incirlik, which serves as a staging ground for some 45
U.S. and British jets that patrol a no-fly zone above the 36th
parallel in northern Iraq. Some 1,400 personnel are part of the
mission.
	   Much of Turkey sits atop the Anatolian fault and quakes are
relatively frequent in the country.

Nigerian military leader meets with opposition delegation 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Representatives from Nigeria's largest
pro-democracy group met Saturday with the country's new military
leader and demanded freedom for the country's most famous political
prisoner.
	   ``Our position is as constant as the northern star,'' Abraham
Adesanya, the vice chairman of the National Democratic Coalition,
said after the meeting with Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar. The general
``asked our advice on the way forward and we presented our
position,'' he said.
	   The group has long demanded the release of Moshood Abiola, the
apparent winner of 1993's annulled presidential elections. They
have put new emphasis on those demands since Abubakar became the
junta leader following the death three weeks ago of Nigeria's
former dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha.
	   Abiola, who has been in prison since he declared himself
president in 1994, has met with Abubakar a number of times over the
past few weeks.
	   His imminent release is widely rumored, and Nigerian officials
say he may be released soon, but no announcements have been made.
	   Abubakar, for his part, released a brief statement in which he
said he had ``useful discussions with members of the delegation on
a broad range of issues,'' and reiterated his belief that there is
``a need for determined national reconciliation.''
	   Nigeria became an international pariah during Abacha's five-year
dictatorship because of its abysmal human rights record.
	   Abubakar, however, seems to be making a concerted effort to
change that, releasing political prisoners and meeting with
opposition leaders and foreign delegations.

Dominican president continues string of meetings on drug issue 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Samper's arrival
By JOSE P. MONEGRO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Colombia and the
Dominican Republic expected to sign agreements to fight drug
trafficking and encourage tourism during a 24-hour visit by
Colombian President Ernesto Samper.
	   Samper and Dominican President Leonel Fernandez also planned to
sign a deal that will send Colombian oil to the Caribbean island
nation at preferential prices, according to Dominican Foreign
Relations Secretary Eduardo Latorre.
	   Samper arrived in Santo Domingo Saturday afternoon to military
honors and was scheduled to leave Sunday. For Fernandez, it will be
his third meeting with another president in the last month to
discuss the drug issue.
	   In addition to meeting with Fernandez, Samper had an appointment
with former president Joaquin Balaguer.
	   While Fernandez was preparing to sign an agreement to fight drug
trafficking, the chief of the Dominican National Drug Control
Office said Saturday that more than 10 businesses were being
examined as part of a broad investigation into money-laundering.
	   ``In the case we are investigating there are various types of
businesses,'' said Luis Alberto Hemeau Hidalgo. ``There are
importers, lumber companies, and legal betting houses that all
belong to an international narco-trafficking network.''
	   Laundering of drug profits has become a big business in the
Dominican Republic, Hemeau said.
	   Fernandez has kept a high profile on the drug issue lately,
meeting last week with Haitian President Rene Preval to agree to
reinforce patrols on the border between the two countries that
share the island of Hispaniola. Two weeks ago, Fernandez met with
U.S. President Bill Clinton and won promises of cooperation and
assistance in anti-trafficking operations.

World Cup: Ronaldo, Cesar Sampaio star as Brazil wins 4-1 to reach quarterfinal 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Optional, recasts with detail, color
By PETER MUELLO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS, France (AP) _ Everyone knew it was a question of time
before Ronaldo would wake up to kick-start Brazil's offense. Cesar
Sampaio may be the secret weapon.
	   The 21-year-old ``phenomenon'' of soccer and a journeyman
midfielder scored a pair of goals each to lead Brazil to a 4-1
victory over Chile on Saturday.
	   Marcelo Salas got a late goal of honor for the Chileans, but
they now go home while Brazil heads to the quarterfinals.
	   Ronaldo, who had promised all week to ``break the spell'' that
had allowed him just one goal in three games, had a penalty kick in
injury time of the first period and a clean goal in the 70th
minute, as well as shots on the post and crossbar in his best
showing in the Cup to date.
	   But the surprise of the night was Sampaio. The 30-year-old
defensive specialist opened the floodgates with two goals that
dismantled Chile, relaxed his teammates and tied him with Ronaldo
for team scoring honors with three.
	   ``He was perfect,'' said Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo.
``Everything, not just the goals. Defense. He was complete.''
	   Brazil looked tense and cautious at first on the rain-slicked
field at Parc des Princes stadium. Still smarting from a 2-1 loss
to Norway earlier in the week, they were not about to get surprised
by twin threats Salas and Ivan Zamorano.
	   But in the 11th minute, a foul on Rivaldo set up a free kick on
the left side. Dunga curled his shot toward the goal box, and
Sampaio broke in unchallenged for the header to make it 1-0.
	   Chile was without three starters, suspended with two yellow
cards. And the vaunted front line of Salas and Zamorano had little
success against Brazil's double coverage.
	   With Chile's defense keying implacably on Ronaldo, the two-time
FIFA Player of the Year had trouble staying on his feet. On a foul
by Javier Margas in the 27th minute, Brazil made them pay.
	   Roberto Carlos sent a long free kick that bounced off the
defense, caromed off Bebeto and found Sampaio. His shot caught
goalie Nelson Tapia on his off-foot and found the left corner for a
2-0 lead.
	   It was injury time when Leonardo sent Ronaldo in up the middle,
and Tapia leapt out to smother the ball at his feet. Ronaldo went
over, and French referee Marc Batta whistled a penalty. Ronaldo
took the shot and it was 3-0 at halftime.
	   ``We started nervous,'' said Zagallo. ``We were lucky to get a
goal by Cesar Sampaio and this gave morale to the team. Then, in
the second half, we played our best football of the Cup.''
	   Zamorano called the loss ``the end of a dream, not a
nightmare.''
	   ``We played with dignity and showed we can play on even terms
with anybody. Unfortunately we made some childish mistakes because
of lack of concentration.
	   ``I think we were playing very well until Brazil scored the
first goal,'' said Zamorano. ``When a team has players like Ronaldo
and Cesar Sampaio, anything might happen, as it happened today.''
	   Chile began the second half with two changes. Fabian Estay came
in for Miguel Ramirez, and Marcelo vega replaced Jose Sierra.
	   In the 54th minute, Dunga took a free kick that crossed the goal
box and Sampaio nearly got a hat trick, but the ball bounced off
his foot just wide of the post.
	   Ronaldo found an avenue on the left side of the Chilean defense,
and roared up it for a shot on the post in the 57th.
	   Chile finally connected in the 69th minute. A dead-on header by
Zamorano bounced off Taffarel, but Salas immediately collected the
rebound with a header to make it 3-1.
	   A minute later, though, it was Ronaldo again on the wing, taking
a pass from Cafu and hesitating just an instant before shooting
across the sprawling Tapia for a 4-1 lead.
	   Denilson came in for Bebeto in the 65th minute, and Goncalves
replaced Aldair at 77 minutes while Chile sent Luis Mussri in for
Clarence Acuna.
	   Leonardo and Cafu drew yellow cards, as did Tapia and Ronaldo
Fuentes for Chile.
	   Lineups:
	   Brazil _ Taffarel; Cafu, Junior Baiano, Aldair (Goncalves,
77th), Roberto Carlos; Dunga, Cesar Sampaio, Leonardo, Rivaldo;
Ronaldo, Bebeto (Denilson, 65th).
	   Chile _ Nelson Tapia; Ronaldo Fuentes, Javier Margas, Pedro
Reyes, Miguel Ramirez (Fabian Estay, 46th); Mauricio Aros, Fernando
Cornejo, Clarence Acuna (Luis Musrri, 80th), Jose Sierra (Marcelo
Vega, 46th); Ivan Zamorano, Marcelo Salas.
	   Referee _ Marc Batta, France.

World Cup: Latin America, the big surprise leaders through Sunday's games. 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: UPDATES with Latin America having five of top seven scoring
By PABLO ELIAS GIUSSANI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Europe's World Cup has acquired a distinct Latin
flavor.
	   Played in France, in the heart of Europe, this was expected to
be a World Cup by the Europeans, for the Europeans.
	   But so far, with the second round set to start Saturday, it's
the teams from the other side of the Atlantic that have made it
their tournament, placing five of their six berths in the second
round.
	   More convincingly, after Sunday's games, five of the top seven
goal scorers are from Latin America.
	   After the five goals by Italy's Christian Vieri, Argentina's
Gabriel Batistuta and Chile's Marcelo Salas had four each while
Mexico's Luis Hernandez, and Brazilians Ronaldo and Cesar Sempaio
had three each.
	   Colombia is the only one missing from the Latin American
entries, having lost to Romania and England. The United States and
Jamaica, the other American teams, also were eliminated in the
first round.
	   Brazil and Argentina, winners of six of the 15 World Cups, were
widely expected to reach the round of 16. But... Chile, Paraguay
and Mexico?
	   None of them were expected to advance, grouped with much tougher
European teams in the first round. Chile had the best showing ever
among the trio, having reached the semifinals in 1962 when it
hosted the championship.
	   However, all three have advanced, and without a single loss.
	   Chile drew its three games, including two in which it led much
of the way before giving up late goals. Mexico beat South Korea and
then managed 2-2 draws against Belgium and the Netherlands, both
after falling behind 2-0 and playing with 10 men. Paraguay was the
only unbeaten team in the ``Group of Death.'' It held favorite
Spain and Bulgaria to scoreless draws before defeating Nigeria, the
Group D winner, 3-1.
	   Argentina was the most impressive, defeating all of its three
opponents without conceding a goal.
	   The only qualified Latin American team that lost a game was none
other than four-time world champion Brazil, beaten 2-1 by Norway in
a meaningless game after it had won Group A.
	   But South American success ``should not come as a surprise. We
had a very tough qualifying tournament,'' Argentina's coach Daniel
Passarella said.
	   The region's teams ``play well and have good players and good
tactics. The tough qualifying tournament enabled them to reach the
World Cup in top form and to do well here.''
	   Argentina led the Latins in the first round, dominating all
three of its matches, including a 1-0 victory against a talented
Croatia.
	   ``Argentina confirmed it big ambitions,'' Croatian coach
Miroslav Blazevic said.
	   Argentina relied on striker Gabriel Batistuta, who scored four
goals, flashes of brilliance by midfielder Ariel Ortega, and a
solid defense.
	   Paraguay also made it to the next stage on the strenght of its
defense, led by goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert, who conceded just
one goal in what many consider the tournaments toughest group.
	   ``We have the best defense in the world,'' Chilavert said.
	   The back line includes Francisco Arce and Carlos Gamarra, who
play in Brazil, as well as Celso Ayala, key on Argentina's River
Plate.
	   FIFA president Joseph Blatter rated Paraguay as probably the
biggest surprise in the tournament.
	   After saying that no miracle teams should be expected in this
World Cup, Blatter admitted ``maybe the surprise is Paraguay,
although not if you look at the way they played in qualfying.''
	   Paraguay led the South American qualifying before finishing
second, one point behind Argentina.
	   Chile has shown a well-balanced team with two powerful strikers,
Marcelo Salas, who scored three goals, and Ivan Zamorano.
	   ``Chile has one of the most efficient and feared front lines in
the Cup,'' claimed Brazilian midfielder Leonardo.
	   Brazil, a perennial candidate to win the title, has been an
enigma. It advanced to the second round after only two games, but
hasn't fallen short of expectations in a mediocre group, and
two-time FIFA Player of the Year Ronaldo has scored only once.
	   Coach Mario Zagallo claims that the defeat by Norway was the
wake-up call the team needed.
	   ``We lost a game we had won. It will serve as a lesson, so we
don't lose our concentration again,'' he said after Brazil conceded
two goals in the final seven minutes, including a penalty in the
89th.
	   The Mexicans, meanwhile, managed five points in another
difficult group. Little was expected from them after a disastrous
run-up to the Cup, one in which their own media dubbed the team
``El Tritanic'' as a mocking tribute to their nickname of ``El
Tricolor.''
	   But the team has rallied from a defict in each of its games, and
Luis Hernandez is among the scoring leaders with three goals.
	   ``I told my players not to lose faith,'' coach Manuel Lapuente
said. ``With faith you move mountains. They have a big heart and
they displayed that all over the field.''

Mexican rights commission says 1996 massacre not fully investigated 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ On the third anniversary of a police massacre
of 17 farm workers, Mexico's governmental human rights commission
said investigators failed to probe claims about the role of some
top officials.
	   The June 28, 1995 massacre remain one of the most visible stains
on Mexico's human rights record, and may have helped spark a
guerrilla uprising in southern Guerrero state that continues to
claim lives.
	   There has been no criminal investigation of the former governor
of Guerrero, site of the massacre of Aguas Blancas, the National
Human Rights Commission said Saturday.
	   The commission's recommendations ``have only partially been
fulfilled,'' according to the statement, which called for
investigation of three other former state officials.
	   Many of the state's top officials resigned after the massacre,
including then-Gov. Ruben Figueroa Alcocer, and 10 police officers
were jailed.
	   Figueroa admitted sending police to dissuade peasants from
marching in a nearby town to demand fertilizer and farm credits.
But he said he never anticipated violence. State lawmakers absolved
him of wrongdoing.
	   Witnesses said as many as 300 state policemen stopped the 17
peasants in two trucks and opened fire without warning. Videotapes
showed the officers placing guns in the victims' hands.
	   Three years after the killings, peace has yet to return to the
poverty-stricken state.
	   In June 1996, on the first anniversary of the massacre,
guerrillas of the Popular Revolutionary Army, or EPR, made their
first appearance at memorial services for the 17 victims in Aguas
Blancas, not far from the resort city of Acapulco.
	   In scattered attacks in Guerrero and neighboring Oaxaca in 1996,
the EPR rebels killed 26 soldiers and police.
	   Most recently, the government said the EPR was responsible for a
June 22 ambush that killed three Mexican soldiers in a northern
Guerrero town.
	   The attack came two weeks after an army patrol clashed with
rebels in another Guerrero village, El Charco, killing 11 people
said to be members of a breakaway EPR group, the Insurgent People's
Revolutionary Army.
	   On Saturday, prosecutors announced that four Indians and two
suspected rebels involved in that clash had been held over for
trial on charges of rebellion, conspiracy and incitement to rebel.
	   Investigators said the army acted correctly in the clash,
despite claims by some witnesses that the army fired first and that
some of those killed were not rebels.

Human rights declaration feted at 50th anniversary gathering 
</HEADLINE>

By MELISSA EDDY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ It's a document small enough to fit
inside a passport, but for thousands of people across the world the
United Nations declaration on human rights remains largely nebulous
or unknown.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, exiled Nigerian dissident
Wole Soyinka, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and other
dignitaries gathered Saturday to honor the 50th anniversary of the
declaration, which outlines people's basic rights to freedom and
justice across the globe.
	   ``The world community should not and will not accept any
dilution or delay in the observance of human rights and fundamental
freedoms,'' Annan told thousands gathered at the ceremony at the
Austria Center.
	   According to the International Helsinki Federation, a watchdog
organization for Europe, human rights conditions worsened last year
in several European countries alone. Other places singled out for
human rights abuses by participants at the ceremony included
Angola, Liberia, Palestinian refugee camps and the United States.
	   ``The greatest, most pervasive, most troubling human rights
abuse is the difference between rich people and poor people,''
Carter said in his speech. Until everyone in the world has equal
rights to health care, education and a decent home, he said, the
struggle for equal human rights will continue.
	   U.S. actor Michael Douglas, who is to be appointed a U.N.
messenger for human rights in the coming months, gave a solemn
reading of the declaration.
	   ``This should be taught to every child,'' he said before
launching into the treatise that demands ``recognition of the
inherent dignity and ... equal and inalienable rights of all
members of the human family.''
	   The Helsinki report, also marking the 50th anniversary of the
declaration, singled out 41 countries where people are still denied
human rights. Belarus was singled out for trampling rights in
several areas. ``Governmental policies and tactics more and more
resembled those of Stalin, apparently aimed ... at crushing civil
society,'' the group said of Belarus.
	   In Slovakia, the human rights situation also deteriorated
notably and was exacerbated by public apathy, according to the
288-page report.
	   ``Intolerance and aggressive state attitudes toward minorities
increased; the virtual absence of reactions against neo-Nazi
violence could be read as a form of tacit approval,'' it said.
	   In Albania, despite improved conditions following a new
government, the judicial system remained unprofessional and corrupt
and police violence continued.
	   Yet, as Nobel Peace Prize winner Desmond Tutu pointed out at the
conference, human rights have improved in some places _ including
his home country of South Africa, which is shaking off decades of
apartheid.
	   Summing up why the fight for human rights continues, he said:
``When freedom comes, it's like falling in love. Suddenly the
sunset you always saw is even more glorious.''

Radical Basque nationalists march demanding a negotiated end to violence 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BILBAO, Spain (AP) _ Thousands of sympathizers of the radical
Basque political coalition Herri Batasuna demonstrated Saturday to
demand a negotiated solution to the violence in the northern Basque
region, news reports said.
	   Marchers shouted slogans in favor of Basque independence and
improved conditions for prisoners from the armed separatist group
ETA, a reporter from the El Correo newspaper based in this
industrial city said.
	   Herri Batasuna is considered ETA's political wing.
	   The demonstration came two days after Manuel Zamarreno, a
governing party councilor from the small Basque town of Renteria,
was killed by a bomb.
	   Although no group claimed responsibility for Zamarreno's death,
authorities immediately blamed ETA, the armed Basque separatist
group that has killed nearly 800 since 1968 in its campaign for an
independent Basque state straddling the Spanish-French border.
	   After Zamarreno's funeral on Friday, thousands demonstrated in
silence in the nearby coastal city of San Sebastian to repudiate
violence by ETA, an acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom.
	   While not directly supporting ETA attacks, Herri Batasuna leader
Jon Idigoras told Saturday's marchers that ``the repression'' of
radical Basque nationalism by the government, ``only lengthens the
conflict unnecessarily and causes unnecessary victims,'' the
national news agency EFE reported.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar has ruled out negotiations with
Herri Batasuana unless it distances itself from ETA, or ETA lays
down its arms.
	   The coalition was forced to elect a new leadership in February
after its entire 23-member executive board was jailed for using an
ETA video calling for peace talks during an election broadcast.

Brazilians celebrate victory over Chile 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilians celebrated the victory
of their national soccer team over Chile Saturday with a mixture of
fireworks and samba that allowed them to forget their defeat at the
hands of Norway earlier this week.
	   Brazil beat Chile 4-1 in a game that allows them to advance to
the quarterfinals of the World Cup in France.
	   ``The game was marvelous. It was a victory which shows we can
make it to the final,'' said one crazed fan as he pounded on a drum
and danced with his friends in the streets of Rio.
	   Brazilians were especially proud of the performance of
Ronaldinho, the star forward who scored two of Brazil's four goals
on Saturday.
	   ``The game showed that any (Brazilian) player can score, but
particularly Ronaldinho,'' said Renato Gaucho, a television
commentator for Manchete television network.
	   Brazil's passion for soccer reaches a fevered pitch every time

Brazilians celebrate victory over Chile

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilians celebrated the victory
of their national soccer team over Chile Saturday with a mixture of
fireworks and samba that allowed them to forget their defeat at the
hands of Norway earlier this week.
	   Brazil beat Chile 4-1 in a game that allows them to advance to
the quarterfinals of the World Cup in France.
	   ``The game was marvelous. It was a victory which shows we can
make it to the final,'' said one crazed fan as he pounded on a drum
and danced with his friends in the streets of Rio.
	   Brazilians were especially proud of the performance of
Ronaldinho, the star forward who scored two of Brazil's four goals
on Saturday.
	   ``The game showed that any (Brazilian) player can score, but
particularly Ronaldinho,'' said Renato Gaucho, a television
commentator for Manchete television network.
	   Brazil's passion for soccer reaches a fevered pitch every time
its national team plays in France, bringing the country to a halt
with pre- and post-game festivities.
	   Brazilian soccer fans even partied after its national team lost
its final game in the opening round of play to Norway 2-1, although
the festivities were not as merry as before.
	   Saturday's game received blanket coverage in all Brazilian
media. The popular daily newspaper O Dia led with a front page
headline ``Win or Return Home;''
	   Police were out in force to keep the festivities from becoming
violent. Last week several bars in the fashionable district of
Leblon were trashed during post-game celebrations.
	   No incidents were immediately reported after Saturday's game.

World Cup: Everybody loves their own team _ and Brazil AP Special Correspondent 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS result of Saturday's game
By MORT ROSENBLUM
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Everybody at the World Cup, it seems, has two
favorite teams: their own and Brazil. Whether its their flashy
football or the carnival behind it, Brazilians are the stars.
	   ``French people especially always smile and want to talk soccer
when I say I'm from Brazil,'' said Frida Baranek, a sculptor living
in Paris. ``They love our team. Everyone does.''
	   No doubt about that.
	   France's authoritive sports newspaper, ``L'Equipe,'' devoted a
116-page special edition magazine to the country that has won four
World Cups and shuts down whenever its team plays a game.
	   Like on Saturday when Brazil outplayed Chile 4-1 to reach the
quarterfinals of World Cup '98.
	   Ronaldo, the hot young striker seen as a successor to Pele,
appears in ads, on magazine covers, on posters, on T-shirts. So do
a handful of his teammates.
	   Paris is turning over its streets this week for a Brazilian
Festival, complete with Chico Buarque and Gilberto Gil. A radio
station offers a selection of Ronaldo's favorite music.
	   And every time Brazil plays, the stadium is an impromptu party.
	   A small band of women in tanga string bikinis and glitter who
samba through the crowds make the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders seem
ready for the convent. Drums and tambourines follow behind.
	   ``Brazil is always a party,'' said Henri Michel, the French
coach whose team eliminated Brazil in 1986. The ultimate French
dream is a France-Brazil final.
	   Even when they lose, Brazilians manage to find fun in soccer.
Opponents call them good sports in a game where competition is
fierce.
	   When Norway beat Brazil, 2-1, in Marseille last week, the
jubilant victors toured the field to bask in applause. Brazilians
cheered almost as loud as the Norwegians.
	   Afterward, Luciana Alvez, 26, a Sao Paulo lawyer ablaze in green
and yellow, could barely speak after all the screaming. She showed
no sign of the wounded pride that is common after matches.
	   ``We deserved to lose,'' she said, launching into a detailed
technical explanation of what she called strategic errors. ``Every
Brazilian knows this except our (expletive deleted) coach.''
	   Brazilians love soccer, she said, because everyone understands
something about it. Poor kids can kick a ball around their favelas
and dream of glory. And, mostly, it's an excuse to party.
	   Antonio Vasconcelos, who owns a radio station in Parana, sat
alone with a smile on his face. Brazil had already qualified for
its next round. What difference did a loss make?
	   ``Football is for having fun, not just to attack,'' he said.
``For us, football and samba and music are all mixed together. We
like to have fun, and the feeling is infectious.''
	   The Norwegians, meantime, had gone into a frenzy. It was not so
much that they won a game. They had beaten Brazil at the World Cup.
	   Erik Strand, a 28-year-old student with wild hair, swayed back
and forth in a doorway, flapping his Norway scarf in the air and
grinning. ``Can you imagine?'' he said. ``Brazil.''
	   Frida Baranek, who does not particularly like soccer, loves to
watch her team play. Beyond a feeling of national pride, she likes
the moves.
	   ``They have a special way of playing, like dancing,'' she
explained. ``There is a way you move your waist, your body. It is
beautiful to watch.''
	   Foreigners appreciate this, she added, but there is more.
	   ``Brazil is so far away, and we're a neutral country,'' she
said. ``No one is against Brazil. You see all this trouble with the
English, the Germans. We just have a good time.''
	   Most others seem to as well.
	   When Jeannette Hermann, an American astrologer, looked for a
World Cup present at a sports store in the Provence city of
Draguignan, she found only T-shirts for France, Italy and Brazil.
	   She asked the French salesclerk for advice on which to buy, and
the woman answered without a pause: ``Brazil, of course.''

Sons to visit Princess Diana's grave 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Princess Diana's sons will visit her grave at the
Spencer family estate, which is to open to the public next week, a
spokeswoman for Diana's brother said Saturday.
	   Shelley-Anne Claircourt denied a report in early editions of The
Sunday Times that Earl Spencer had called off a long-planned visit
to the grave last weekend and that Prince William, 16, and Prince
Harry, 13, were upset about it.
	   The newspaper said Spencer couldn't be present and didn't want
his nephews to visit the grave without him there.
	   Ms. Claircourt said Prince Charles' office at St. James's Palace
had suggested a date, giving 36 hours' notice, and the earl
suggested a number of alternatives when he could be present.
	   ``A visit has now been arranged,'' she said.
	   She would not say what date was chosen.
	   ``The Spencer family have never discussed the boys' movements
despite constant speculation, and do not to intend to do so now,''
she said.
	   Princess Diana, who died in Paris car crash Aug. 31, was buried
on an island at Althorp, her family's estate about 75 miles (120
kms) northwest of London. After a Westminster Abbey funeral watched
on television by millions, she was buried privately with only 10
people present, including William, Harry and Prince Charles.
	   On Wednesday, Althorp will open to ticket-holding visitors who
will see a museum exhibition about Diana's life. The estate will be
open until Aug. 30. The following day, the anniversary of Diana's
death, the Spencer family will hold a graveside service. Prince
Charles, his sons and other members of the royal family will attend
a service near Balmoral, their estate in Scotland.

Sorenstam surges to lead in ShopRite LPGA Classic AP Golf Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By RON SIRAK
<TEXT>
	   ABSECON, New Jersey (AP) _ Annika Sorenstam showed her U.S.
Open-winning form again Saturday, shooting a course record-tying 65
to take the second-round lead in the ShopRite LPGA Classic at
11-under-par 131.
	   Sorenstam had only one bogey on the Bay Course at the Seaview
Marriott Resort _ that coming on a three-putt green _ and moved two
strokes ahead of Juli Inkster going into Sunday's final round. Tina
Barrett was four back at 135.
	   ``I feel very comfortable,'' Sorenstam said. ``Especially around
the greens. I had some birdie putts today where I had no doubt what
the line was.''
	   Kelly Robbins and Lorie Kane both made moves with 67s to get to
6-under-par 136. Donna Andrews, the leading money winner on the
LPGA this year who has finished second on her last four
tournaments, shot a 68 along with Rosie Jones and they were also at
136.
	   Among those missing the cut for the final round were Nancy
Lopez, Laura Davies and defending champion Michelle McGann.
	   At one point, Sorenstam, Inkster and Barrett were in a three-way
tie at 8-under par. Sorenstam sprinted away down the stretch,
making birdies on Nos. 15, 16 and 18.
	   Barrett was unable to match Sorenstam's power. While Sorenstam
was able to get a two-putt birdie on the 481-yard (meter) 16th
hole, Barrett couldn't reach the green in two and settled for par.
	   She made her only bogey of the day on No. 17 when she missed the
green right, pitched 12 feet past the hole and left the putt short.
	   Inkster made a bogey on No. 14 when she missed the green so far
right she was lucky to be able to chip to 15 feet (5 meter). She
got that back with a three-foot (one-meter) birdie putt on No. 17
and matched Sorenstam's birdie on the last hole.
	   Balancing birdies with bogeys down the stretch is not the way to
stay close to Sorenstam. Her 65 matched the tournament course
record set by Sherri Turner in 1987.
	   With the U.S. Open next week in Wisconsin, Sorenstam seems to be
serving notice that she intends to reclaim the crown she won two
consecutive times before missing the cut last year when she tried
for an unprecedented triple.
	   She has been a rock of consistency this year, finishing in the
top 10 in nine out of 10 tournaments. Her one flaw _ erratic
putting _ seems somewhat under control and she has been charging
birdie putts boldly past the hole all week.
	   ``Everything has kind of come together in the last month,''
Sorenstam said. ``I've put in a lot of work and it has paid off.'
	   Sorenstam and Inkster were in the same threesome, one group
ahead of Barrett, and waged a spirited match-play style
competition.
	   Inkster, who won the ShopRite when it was called the Atlantic
City Classic in 1986 and '88, matched Sorenstam's birdie on the
third hole, then made birdies on Nos. 8, 9 and 11 to get to
8-under. The birdie on No. 11 came when she chipped in from 30 feet
(10 meters).
	   Sorenstam picked up two birdies on the front nine, the first on
the par-5 third hole and the second when she ran in a 15-footer
(5-meter shot) on No. 5. She then started the back nine with two
consecutive birdies, the second coming when she hit her tee shot to
4{ feet (1 1/2 meter) on the 187-yard (meter) hole to get to
9-under.
	   Her only bogey came on the 12th hole when she three-putted after
hitting her approach shot above the hole and running her first putt
eight feet (2 1/2 meter) past coming downhill.
	   Sorenstam got back to 9-under on No. 15 when her 15-foot
(5-meter) putt from the fringe caught the side of the hole, went
all the way around the cup and dropped in for a birdie.
	   Then came the two-putt birdie on No. 16, a feat that seemed so
matter-of-fact it raised questions whether anyone would be able to
stay with Sorenstam on Sunday _ or in the U.S. Open.

Diana's musical friends star at charity concert near her grave

<TEXT>
	   GREAT BRINGTON, England (AP) _ A musical tribute to Princess
Diana began under a cloud on Saturday, but a downpour failed to
dampen the spirits of many rainsoaked concertgoers at the Althorp
estate where the princess is buried.
	   Spirits rose steadily and before it was over, people were
dancing to the music.
	   The crowd held up hundreds of candles, matches and lanterns, and
many fans wept when Chris De Burgh sang his song to the princess:
``There's a New Star in Heaven Tonight.''
	   ``Earlier today I walked around the lake where Princess Diana
has been laid to rest and I listened to the beautiful music coming
from the stage and across to that beautiful resting place,'' De
Burgh told the crowd. ``I know she is with us here in spirit.''
	   ``It has been a night we will remember for ever,'' said Annwen
Smalley, 41, from Wales. ``The weather has been bad but we are
British and we get over these things.''
	   About an hour before the 7 p.m. start, the 15,000 fans crowded
in the arena had been soaked by a 15-minute downpour. The field
grew soggy and quickly turned into a sea of umbrellas.
	   But when the choir of New College, Oxford, opened the charity
open-air concert, the clouds cleared and the sun began to shine.
	   Diana's brother, Earl Spencer, watched from a tented area with
their mother, Frances Shand-Kydd. But he wandered into the arena
and joined the crowd near the front of the stage to listen to
Julian Lloyd Webber perform Faure's ``Elegy.''
	   Then, carrying his 3-year-old son, Louis, on his shoulders, he
went backstage to chat with some of the performers.
	   The stars wandered into the arena to join the crowds after their
performances.
	   ``In a funny way I think the rain and the bad weather will
contribute to the atmosphere of the occasion,'' said Janet
Depledge, a teacher from Huddersfield, Yorkshire in northern
England .
	   The princess, who was killed Aug. 31 in a Paris car crash, is
buried on an island about a mile (1.6 km) from the concert arena.
	   Many people have criticized the price of tickets and some were
upset that the concert was held so close to her grave. Several
stars, including Phil Collins, declined to appear. And Wet, Wet,
Wet pulled out because of other commitments.
	   At least 13 pounds (dlrs 21.60) of each 39.50 pounds (dlrs 64.80
) ticket will go to the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund, an
Althorp spokeswoman said anonymously. -	   The estate, about 75 miles (120 kms) northwest of London, opens
Wednesday for two months. Some 150,000 people are expected to tour
a new museum dedicated to her life.

Opposition party vows to step up protests in racially tense Guyana 
</HEADLINE>
By BERT WILKINSON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ A top political opposition leader in
Guyana has called for supporters to stay away from their jobs on
Monday and march to protest the government of President Janet
Jagan.
	   The opposition People's National Congress issued a statement
Friday quoting party leader Desmond Hoyte asking ``people to
assemble at the Square of the Revolution Monday for a march of
defiance.''
	   National Security Adviser Roger Luncheon said he was concerned
Monday's march could begin a new round of violence.
	   Last week, police destroyed a bomb at their headquarters, and a
fire destroyed a three-story building at the Ministry of Finance,
injuring two Canadian consultants who jumped from a window to
escape the flames. Evidence from the fire supported reports that an
explosion started the blaze, national Fire Chief Tulsie John said.
	   The capital, Georgetown, has remained tense but calm in recent
days, with no repeats of the clashes with police that disrupted
life of the city's business district.
	   The unrest began when Hoyte lost to U.S.-born Jagan, the widow
of former president Cheddi Jagan, in the Dec. 15 presidential
election and his party claimed fraud. Two international groups
examined the vote and declared it fair.
	   Hoyte now says his followers are protesting racism, government
corruption and alleged dismissals of officials believed to support
his party.
	   The dispute has racial as well as political overtones because
members of Hoyte's party are mostly blacks of African descent,
while Jagan's People's Progressive Party is backed mainly by
Guyanese of East Indian descent.

 &UR; DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: Colombian, Dominican presidents meet
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Colombia and the
Dominican Republic expected to sign agreements to fight drug
trafficking and encourage tourism during a 24-hour visit by
Colombian President Ernesto Samper.
	   Samper and Dominican President Leonel Fernandez also planned to
sign a deal that will send Colombian oil to the Caribbean island
nation at preferential prices, according to Dominican Foreign
Relations Secretary Eduardo Latorre.
	   Samper arrived Santo Domingo Saturday afternoon to military

discuss the drug issue.
 &UR; PANAMA: Ex-police director pardoned in death of Puerto Rican
soldier
	   PANAMA CITY (AP) _ Panamanian President Ernesto Perez Balladares
has pardoned a former police director convicted of misconduct in
the case of politician's son acquitted in the shooting death of a
U.S. soldier.
	   Jaime Abad, who led the investigation into the 1992 death of
soldier Zak Hernandez on a Panamanian highway, was convicted of
removing evidence from case files that appeared to exonerate Pedro
Miguel Gonzalez, who was a suspect in the killing.
	   The U.S. State Department condemned the prosecution of Abad,
saying that Gonzalez' father, a prominent politician, had used his
influence to unfairly tilt Abad's trial.
	   Gonzalez and two other Panamanians were found innocent in
November 1997 of killing Hernandez, a 22-year-old sergeant and
native of Puerto Rico.
	   U.S. officials criticized that verdict.
	   Hernandez died on the eve of a visit by then-U.S. President
George Bush, when AK-47 rifle fired from a passing car sprayed the
military vehicle in which he and other soldiers were riding.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Rash of bomb threats marks 10th day of strike
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Police handled dozens of bomb
threats Saturday as a protest strike against the privatization of
the Puerto Rico Telephone Company entered its 10th day.
	   In some cases, police found packages containing clocks and
cables or bottles of liquid that were rigged up to appear to be
bombs but were not, said police spokeswoman Maria del Pilar Bon.
	   Meanwhile, the FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms joined the local police investigation of a bomb that
injured a police officer in the south coast town of Santa Isabel in
the early morning hours Thursday. The policeman lost a finger when
he picked up a flashlight that contained a bomb outside a branch of
Banco Popular.
	   Opponents of the government's plans to sell the telephone
company have targeted the bank, the largest in Puerto Rico and the
largest Hispanic-owned bank in the United States, because it plans
to buy a minority share in the privatized telephone company.
 &UR; DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: Enthusiastic crowds attend music festival
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ They screamed for
Puerto Rican Ricky Martin.
	   They sang along with Spanish group Azucar Moreno.
	   They danced to the rhythm of the Colombian group Niche.
	   More than 40,000 people gathered Friday night at the Olympic
Center for the first night of the Presidente Latin Music Festival,
	   In just its second year, the music festival has become one of
the principal artistic events in the country, with 120,000 people
expected to attend during the three-day event.
 &UR; JAMAICA: Fans prepare to welcome home their Reggae Boyz
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Jamaicans prepared to welcome home
their Reggae Boyz Saturday, still buoyant over the nation's first
appearance at the World Cup and their win Friday over Japan.
	   ``The Reggae Boyz have done us proud,'' said Prime Minister P.J.
Patterson. ``No country with a population of our size has ever

	   The people of the Caribbean island have taken an emotional
roller-coaster ride on the successes and failures of their soccer
team.
	   Spirits sagged when Jamaica lost to Croatia and Argentina, the
two teams from its group that advanced. But happiness returned with

	   ``The entire nation shared in the moments of defeat. We are now

Jordan says he won't stick around if Bulls rebuild 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GREENVILLE, North Carolina (AP) _ Michael Jordan is taking Phil
Jackson's departure as a sign the Chicago Bulls are rebuilding. And
he wants no part of that.
	   ``I don't want to start over. I'm pretty sure losing Phil is a
sign of that,'' Jordan said Saturday at a news conference before
teeing off at the Michael Jordan Celebrity Golf Classic. ``So I can
tell you where my mind is leaning in some respects. ... I don't
want a rebuilding process.''
	   Jordan once said he would only play for Jackson, though he
softened that stance toward the end of the season. And when the
coach made good Monday on his season-long threat to leave, Jordan
said his decision also depended on the future of teammates Scottie
Pippen and Dennis Rodman.
	   Jordan, Pippen and Rodman are free agents, as are six other
players on Chicago's 12-man playoff roster. Pippen, believing he
has been undervalued and underappreciated by Chicago management,
has said repeatedly that he wouldn't return to the Bulls. But he,
too, has wavered, saying after Chicago won its sixth championship
that he would be open-minded if everyone else came back.
	   Rodman wants to return, but only if Jordan and Pippen do.
	   While Jordan said Saturday he might be leaning one way, he wants
to weigh his options and hasn't reached a final decision.
	   ``My decision is coming very quickly. And I know this time I
want to evaluate all options, and I don't want to make a rush
judgment,'' he said. ``Yes, I've said all along that if Phil is not
my coach there's no way I can play. And I'm pretty firm with that.
	   ``But before I make that decision ... I've got to see what the
team is going to do in terms of their choices. But I've felt
strongly, I still feel strongly about it, but I just don't want to
make a rush judgment or career-ending decision.''
	   Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf said during the NBA Finals that he
wants to keep the same team as long as its winning championships,
and general manager Jerry Krause repeated that Saturday.
	   ``It's like I've said before, we want to try and bring the team
back. But we don't control that,'' Krause said during a rookie-free
agent camp at the Bulls' practice facility.
	   Jordan's decision could be swayed by whom the Bulls hire as a
coach, but Krause said that move could be at least two weeks away.
And before the Bulls hire anyone, Krause said Jordan will be
consulted.
	   While former Seattle coach George Karl and Iowa State coach Tim
Floyd have been mentioned, Krause has not ruled out keeping the
current coaching staff, with Frank Hamblen as head coach.
	   Krause has also made it clear that Chicago's decision to draft
Corey Benjamin _ the first shooting guard the Bulls have drafted
since Jordan in 1984 _ doesn't mean they're getting ready for life
after Jordan. Benjamin, who left Oregon State as a sophomore, has a
lot of learning to do and will be brought along slowly, Krause
said.
	   Jordan said he has not discussed his future with Bulls
management since the team won its sixth NBA title.
	   ``Once we won the championship, I kind of broke all ties to
mentally relax and get away from the tension and all the pressures
we have dealt with all season long,'' Jordan said. ``And I've
heard, and I've talked to some of the people who told me about Phil
and his decision, which is honestly his decision and I can respect
that.''

	   ADANA, Turkey (AP) _ An earthquake rattled this southern city on
Saturday, killing at least 104 people and injuring about 1,000
others, officials said. Among those killed in the were 37 people
who lived in the slums of Adana, a city of 1 million, said Deputy
Gov. Ardahan Totuk. The quake struck at 16:56 p.m. (1356 GMT) and
had a preliminary magnitude of 6.3, according to Istanbul's
Kandilli observatory. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake
rattled the neighboring provinces of Mersin, Nigde and Kayseri, as
well as the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, off Turkey's southern
coast. Thousands fled their homes in panic, NTV said. The quake
shattered windows and caused cracks in several buildings, as well

	   BEIJING (AP) _ After an uncensored airing of differences with
his Chinese counterpart, U.S. President Bill Clinton planned Sunday
to bring attention to religious freedom by worshipping at the
country's largest Protestant church. In a gripping summit debate
beamed to hundreds of millions of homes across the vast country,
Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin gave no ground Saturday
in their 70-minute news conference that addressed the controversial
issues of human rights, freedom, trade and Tibet. It was spirited
but cordial. ``You can see that neither one of us are shy about
being strong about how we believe,'' Jiang said. After attending
services at Chongwenmen Church on Sunday, the U.S. president and
his family were to visit the palaces of the Forbidden City and
China's most famous landmark, the Great Wall. (CLINTON-CHINA)
	   AKOURE, Ivory Coast (AP) _ A small chartered plane carrying the
U.N. envoy to Angola crashed into a swamp as it approached the
airport in Abidjan, officials said Saturday. There were no signs of
survivors. The plane carrying Alioune Blondin Beye, a highly
respected politician, diplomat and scholar from the West African
nation of Mali, had left from Lome, Togo, on Friday night. Beye,
59, had met with Togolese President Gnassigbe Eyadema in an effort
to win support for the peace process in Angola, according to a
statement from the U.N. Observer Mission in that southern African
country. While rescuers have been unable to reach the wreckage of
the Beechcraft 200 because of the terrain, the jet was spotted from
a helicopter a few kilometers (miles) from the small town of
Akoure, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the Ivorian commercial
capital of Abidjan, Commander Mouton, the head of the Ivorian
emergency rescue service, told state radio. (IVORY COAST-PLANE)
	   PANTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav army guns bombarded rebel
positions and Serb civilians were airlifted from a besieged village
Saturday in central Kosovo, where fighting is escalating despite
diplomatic efforts. A day after U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke ended
four days of shuttle diplomacy in the region, several signs
indicated that the conflict is intensifying and that the Serbs are
building up their forces for a possible new offensive. ``We are
only a few steps away from a general war,'' Holbrooke said at a
forum of political and economic leaders in Switzerland. A new round
of fighting erupted Friday and Saturday in this central town of
1,000, with other skirmishes reported elsewhere. The Albanians'
Kosovo Information Center reported heavy reinforcement of
government troops near Pristina airport, including 58 tanks.

	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Violent protests over the slaying of a
popular singer expanded in Algeria's mountainous eastern Berber
region on Saturday, leaving at least one person dead. The
assassination of Lounes Matoub on Thursday set off what is believed
to be the largest unrest in the Berber region since an uprising in
1980. Local politicians called for a general strike Sunday. The
regional capital Tizi-Ouzou saw a third day of violence, and
protests erupted Saturday in several cities. One demonstrator was
shot and killed and three were injured, a hospital source said on
condition of anonymity. Protests began Thursday, when the
42-year-old singer was killed at a fake roadblock outside his
native village. (ALGERIA-VIOLENCE)

	   LONDON (AP) _ Princess Diana's sons will visit her grave at the
Spencer family estate, which is to open to the public next week, a
spokeswoman for Diana's brother said Saturday.
	   Shelley-Anne Claircourt denied a report in early editions of The
Sunday Times that Earl Spencer had called off a long-planned visit
to the grave last weekend and that Prince William, 16, and Prince
Harry, 13, were upset about it.
	   The newspaper said Spencer couldn't be present and didn't want
his nephews to visit the grave without him there.
	   Ms. Claircourt said Prince Charles' office at St. James's Palace
had suggested a date, giving 36 hours' notice, and the earl
suggested a number of alternatives when he could be present.
	   ``A visit has now been arranged,'' she said, refusing to
elaborate.
	   Princess Diana, who died in Paris car crash Aug. 31, was buried
on an island at Althorp, her family's estate about 75 miles (120
kms) northwest of London.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Frank Sinatra was a friend to presidents, movie
stars and _ one Christmas season _ to the homeless in New York
City's Harlem neighborhood.
	   Late one night in the mid-1980s while drinking with friend Jilly
Rizzo at one of his favorite hangouts, Jimmy Weston's supper club,
Sinatra got a craving for pizza, so he enlisted maitre d' Dino
Pavlou to give him and Rizzo a ride to Patsy's pizza parlor in
Harlem.
	   ``It's about four in the morning, we order pizza and beer, and
as we're eating Frank looks out the window and sees a couple of
homeless guys staring in at us,'' Pavlou writes in the August issue
of Men's Journal magazine. ``They looked hungry, so he tells Jilly
to bring them inside.
	   ``Frank buys them pizza and beer, and then he says, `What the
hell, it's Christmas,' and he tells these homeless guys to go get
their friends. Within 15 minutes the place is packed.
	   ``Frank hands Patsy a roll of hundreds and tells her to keep the
free pizza and beer coming until the day after New Year's. `This
isn't going to be enough,' he says, `but let me know and I'll be
back with more.'''

	   ABINGDON, Virginia (AP) _ Gregory Peck is coming home to a tiny
theater in the Virginia mountains where he learned to act and
accepted food for pay.
	   The Barter Theatre considers Peck _ who also drove a truck when
the cast hit the road _ its most famous alumnus. He returns Monday
to discuss the stage and film career that took root here.
	   ``I've said this before, but it's the most valuable experience
that I've ever had,'' Peck said. ``Getting those shows on, and
trucking the scenery around and setting up the lights _ you were
part of real theater for the summer. It was good groundwork and
good training.''
	   The red-brick theater, 370 miles (600 kms) southwest of
Washington, takes its name from the hard times in which it was
founded. During the Depression, the theater would barter tickets
for food.
	   Other stars who honed their skills at the Barter include Ernest
Borgnine, Ned Beatty, Patricia Neal, Hume Cronyn, Kevin Spacey and
Frances Fisher.
	   Playwrights Noel Coward, Tennessee Williams and Thornton Wilder
accepted Virginia ham as royalty payments. George Bernard Shaw
bartered for spinach because he was a vegetarian.
	   Peck was 24 when he performed in five plays in the summer of
1940, two years before he got his break on Broadway and three years
before his film debut in ``Days of Glory.''
	   The admission price was 40 cents or its equivalent in food. A
pig was worth a season pass.

	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ Entertainer Harry Belafonte led several
hundred people in a chorus of ``Day-O'' on Saturday after Mayor
Edward G. Rendell presented him with the city's first Marian
Anderson Award for humanitarian efforts.
	   Belafonte, 71, a singer, actor and civil rights activist who has
won Tony, Grammy and Emmy awards, received a crystal sculpture and
a dlrs 100,000 check in the name of Anderson, the late opera
singer.
	   The award pays tribute to artists whose leadership benefits
humanity.
	   Belafonte has served as host of the World Summit for Children at
the United Nations and as a Goodwill ambassador for UNICEF. He
spearheaded efforts to benefit African famine relief in 1985,
including the ``We Are the World'' concert.
	   Anderson, a Philadelphia native who died in 1993 at age 96, was
the first black soloist to sing at New York's Metropolitan Opera
and the first black performer to sing at the White House.
	   ``The world wanted her gift and she gave it to them, but in
return, they had to accept who she was,'' Belafonte said at an
awards ceremony.
	   ___
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ What transit strike? Mayor Edward G. Rendell
has had other things to worry about with the Spice Girls coming to
town.
	   Since tickets to the British pop group's show sold out in 21
minutes two months ago, Rendell has been the most popular guy in
town. He controlled 14 box seats for Saturday's show.
	   ``I've had every single person come out of the woodwork asking
for tickets, from heads of corporations to people from our cleaning
service,'' said Eden Kratchman, Rendell's scheduling secretary.
``People say, `I need 15 tickets.'''
	   She whittled the list to 35. Rendell, who has had his hands full
with the city's long-running transit strike, made the final cut
Monday. The lucky 14 include executives, a radio talk-show host and
someone who bought a ticket at a charity auction.
	   The mayor also gave two tickets to a 12-year-old girl he met a
few weeks ago.
	   ``I just walked up and asked him,'' Ciana Brown said Thursday.
``I knew he was the only important person in Philadelphia that
probably might have them.''

	   _ Mark Kellogg's last dispatch, June 1876.
 &UR; By DAVID FOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   HARDIN, Montana (AP) _ The director wanted Mark Kellogg to die
well.
	   ``I'll assign you a killer,'' Julie Luther said, surveying a
field full of Indian warriors. ``I want a good one for you.''
	   She needn't have worried. A day later, I am surrounded by
willing assassins. A brave with his face painted half-black is
racing toward me on horseback, waving a war club.
	   I frantically urge old Jack the mule away, but the warrior
quickly overtakes me and wallops me in the back. I slump across
Jack's neck, and another warrior runs up and yanks me down from the
saddle.
	   The fight is valiant but brief. Another blow from a club sends
me to the ground, where I lie writhing until two Indian boys appear
over me, whooping with glee. One pummels me with his club, then
they scalp me and run off.
	   Mark Kellogg is most assuredly dead.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   The Battle of the Little Bighorn, in which Lt. Col. George
Armstrong Custer and more than 200 soldiers were killed by Sioux
and Cheyenne warriors on June 25, 1876, was the biggest thing that
ever happened in the rolling hills of southeastern Montana.
	   But the annual re-enactment of Custer's Last Stand, performed
each June for tourists, comes a close second.
	   In four performances this weekend, on a grassy slope 20 miles
(about 30 kms) from the actual battleground, a cast of more than
200 Indian warriors, cavalry troopers, white settlers and Indian
villagers are portraying the battle and the events that led up to
it: the westward march of settlers, the signing of treaties, the
breaking of treaties.
	   For residents of Hardin and the surrounding Crow Indian
Reservation, it's a chance to cash in on their common history. For
participants, it's a chance to recreate the West's glory days.
	   ``I do living history all around the West,'' said Joe Desson,
who plays Lt. William W. Cooke, one of Custer's officers. ``I try
to give people a chance to touch the past.''
	   I am here for the same reason.
	   This year is the 150th anniversary of The Associated Press _ a
fitting occasion, my bosses decided, to honor the 23 AP reporters
killed in pursuit of the news.
	   The first to fall was Mark Kellogg, the only journalist to
accompany Custer's ill-fated campaign. Kellogg's dispatches to The
Bismarck Tribune and New York Herald were picked up by the AP and
distributed to papers around the country.
	   Kellogg, 43 when he died, had muttonchop sideburns, angular
features and an intense gaze that seemed forever to point him
toward a new frontier town: La Crosse, Wisconsin, Council Bluffs,
Iowa, Brainerd, Minnesota, and finally Bismarck, in the Dakota
Territory.
	   Kellogg pursued many occupations _ grocer, telegraph operator,
jailer _ but he always returned to journalism.
	   He was a shameless booster of the rough prairie towns, and when
Gen. Alfred Terry and the 7th Cavalry left Bismarck for a campaign
to clear the countryside of ``hostile'' Indians, Kellogg eagerly
went along.
	   Like many others of his time, he was enamored of one officer
under Terry's command: Custer. Through today's lens of journalistic
objectivity, Kellogg was almost worshipful of the flamboyant Custer
_ and downright racist toward the Indians.
	   Custer ``is full of perfect readiness for a fray with the
hostile red devils,'' Kellogg wrote in one dispatch, ``and woe to
the body of scalplifters that comes within reach of himself and
brave companions in arms.''
	   It's unfair to judge him by today's journalistic standards, said
Sandy Barnard, a journalism professor at Indiana State University
and author of ``I Go With Custer,'' a Kellogg biography.
	   ``If he wasn't a journalist in the modern sense of the word, he
was a journalist in the 1870s sense of the word,'' Barnard said.
``He had a great eye for detail, and he was very curious.''
	   Add courageous. Unlike the soldiers, Kellogg could have turned
around at any time. Instead, when his horse got tired, he mounted a
gray mule and borrowed spurs to urge on his slow mount.
	   ``He wanted to be with the troops,'' Barnard said. ``He paid for
his journalistic initiative with his life.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   Would I do the same?
	   The question arises with some urgency as I sit atop Jack the
mule, who's braying nervously as we hide behind the ridge above the
re-enactment site, awaiting the cavalry's cue.
	   A thunderstorm has already scared Jack and soaked me to the
skin. My seat is sore, and my mouth is dry. A novice rider, I'm
about to gallop wildly down a hill toward death, before more than
2,000 spectators.
	   I fear that this re-enactment will be too authentic.
	   Then someone yells ``Charge!'' and the moment carries us all
downhill. My hat flies off, the ground blurs beneath Jack's hooves,
and the spectators disappear.
	   All I see are cavalry and Indians _ especially the warrior with
the black-painted face, waving his war club.
	   In a few minutes, Custer and Crazy Horse will joke with
camera-clicking tourists and sign autographs. (No one will ask for
mine.) Indians and troopers will get up and shake hands, then go
into town and have a beer.
	   But not yet. I'm sprawled on the ground. Raindrops splatter my
flushed face, but I do not move. I must lie here while Custer and
his men race back up the hill for their last stand.
	   It gives me a chance to ponder the significance of a battle that
suddenly seems too real.
	   The original battle was a glorious triumph for the Plains
Indians _ one of their last. It was Custer's ticket to legendary
status. But for Kellogg, frontier reporter, it was not a good day
to die.
	   If there is glory in death for the soldier, there is only a
sense of unfinished business for the fallen journalist. The Battle
of the Little Bighorn may have been the defining event of Kellogg's
short life, but it was also the biggest story he never wrote.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Vytautas Jarutis, wearing thick canvas gloves
and a wide-brimmed straw hat over his spectacles and steel-gray
beard, pulled the iron rod from the fire and hammered the glowing
red metal into a circular shape on an anvil.
	   The 62-year-old Lithuanian blacksmith, asked through a
translator what the finished product would be, pointed to an
intricate sun-shaped iron cross that hung next to other examples of
his traditional handiwork. To his left, a visitor could look up the
National Mall to the Capitol. To his right was the Washington
Monument.
	   This year's Smithsonian Folklife Festival, starring food, music
and handicrafts from the U.S. state of Wisconsin, also features the
cultures of the Philippines and the Baltic countries of Estonia,
Latvia and Lithuania. The festival runs this weekend and July 1-5.
	   Among the exhibits are their versions of traditional loom-woven
and hand-crafted goods, including Philippine straw baskets and
bamboo instruments, fleecy Estonian stocking caps and Jarutis' iron
crosses, which mix symbols from paganism and Christianity.
	   Then there's the food:
	   Roasted pig with rice and coconut pudding from the Philippines,
Latvian dark rye bread and sausage, Estonian potato pancakes,
Lithuanian beer; and from the U.S. state of Wisconsin, a menu of
sweet corn, battered pork tenderloin, Milwaukee-style bratwurst and
fried cheese.
	   The Wisconsin exhibit includes gospel singers, Croatian folk
songs and the Polish polkas of Norm Dombrowski and the Happy Notes.
	   Nearly every display or performance, from the state's Hmong
community's religious chants to the wood-carved dolls and fiddles,
is labeled ``traditional,'' just as the lemonade sold at stands
throughout the fair is, of course, ``old fashioned.''
	   The festival also features a smaller cultural sampling from the
Rio Grande River basin, spanning from Colorado through New Mexico,
Texas and the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Durango and others. Its
bilingual booths and lectures include a history of Texan
accordionist Amadeo Flores and wooden planters growing green
peppers, yellow corn and Indian melon tomatoes.

White lions take filming in stride

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ It was hardly your typical Hollywood sound
stage. And the main characters certainly weren't from central
casting.
	   On one side of a wide porch, Pride, a majestic 550-pound
(250-kilogram) white lion, waited with his handlers to take his
cue.
	   Down the stairs, Vision, a slightly trimmer member of this rare
species, rolled in the grass, his coat shining in the moonlight.
	   The setting was Little Bavaria, a private 100-acre (40-hectare)
enclave that illusionists Siegfried and Roy have carved for
themselves from the Nevada desert over the past quarter-century.
	   The occasion was the filming of a new Imax 3-D movie about the
world famous pair, tracing their boyhood years in Germany, their
chance meeting while working on a cruise ship, and their
record-breaking years headlining at The Mirage resort.
	   The film is scheduled to open in July 1999 in theaters around
the world. Bernie Yuman, longtime manager for the pair and
executive producer of the film, said special premieres are planned
in New York City, Paris, Munich, Berlin and Tokyo.
	   Siegfried and Roy will be the leading characters, but the magic
behind the movie will likely be the rare white lions and tigers the
famous Las Vegans are helping save from extinction.
	   The star factor was evident Thursday night as cameras rolled and
Pride swept into the living room of the Bavarian-styled cabin,
filled with 18th-century magic memorabilia.
	   Pride, who will top out at about 750 pounds (340 kilograms) in a
couple of years, plopped down on a divan as Siegfried and Roy
watched, his furry frame filling the six-foot (1.8-meter) fixture.
It was two years ago that the illusionists introduced Pride and
sister Joy to the world, each holding one of the tiny 15-pound
(7-kilogram) cubs in their hands.
	   This secluded retreat is where the rare white lions and tigers
spend much of their early years. It is here where Roy bonds with
the animals, meditating with the young cubs.
	   ``This is their kindergarten,'' Roy said, gazing across a lake
and towering pines during a break in filming.
	   Across the cabin deck, Pride showed little excitement about his
pending role on the big screen, opting to catch some snooze time
while a handler scratched his head. Vision _ when she could stay
awake _ pestered her handler for meat treats. Occasionally the
handler would plant a kiss on her forehead.
	   Michael V. Lewis, co-chairman and chief executive officer of
L-Squared Entertainment, the Santa Monica, Califrnia-based company
producing the film, believes it will be unique.
	   ``The animals are the biggest part of this,'' Lewis said between
takes. ``What the audiences are going to see is something audiences
do not normally see. And Siegfried and Roy are the only guys who
can pull this off.
	   ``We're kind of trying to push the limits on this,'' he said,
standing beside a dlrs 1 million camera in the cabin's living room.
	   With 170 Imax theaters worldwide, and the number expected to
double in the next four years, there is a growing need for product,
Lewis said.
	   Sean Phillips, director of photography, said the high-tech
camera and its whirring noise have been a special attraction to the
inquisitive cats, who get up close and personal to inspect it.
	   The curiosity will yield scenes in which the majestic lions and
tigers walk up and look into the audience, Leonard said.
	   ``Siegfried and Roy's harmony with their animals have gone
beyond my expectations,'' Leonard said. ``This film is going to
show the heart that goes into bringing these beautiful animals back
from extinction. Their story tells you if you dream big enough and
hard enough, anything can happen.''
	   One of the more dramatic segments comes when six of the white
lions come to meditate with Siegfried and Roy atop a mound.
	   ``It was the most emotional thing I've ever seen in my life,''
said Yuman, the pair's manager.
	   Siegfried called the long hours of filming ``very intense, but
very fulfilling.''
	   ``When you do a show and it's finished, it's finished,''
Siegfried said. ``But when you have it on film, it's forever.''
	   Roy said he hopes the film will capture what he sees as the
duo's greatest achievement: ``That we were an instrument of the
return of the white tigers and white lions.''
	   The pair has gained international attention for the efforts to
save endangered white lions and tigers, and now raise 62 of the
animals at Little Bavaria and a dlrs 10 million estate here known
as the jungle palace.
	   The cost of the film is expected to exceed dlrs 13.5 million,
Yuman said.

Paralyzed `Superman' still rescuing people

<TEXT>
	   POUND RIDGE, New York (AP) _ Christopher Reeve is on the
speakerphone, talking patiently but firmly to a 24-year-old athlete
partially paralyzed in a recent trampoline fall. The young man is
so depressed that he's refusing to eat, and his doctor has asked
Reeve to intervene.
	   ``By no means is your life over,'' Reeve says, then pauses as a
ventilator refills his lungs. ``We're just a few years away from
human trials on spinal cord regeneration. I want you to eat, stay
fit and be ready.''
	   Twenty minutes later, the doctor rings back. ``The kid I called
decided to eat,'' Reeve announces.
	   Superman, it seems, is still rescuing people.
	   Three years after he fell from a horse and became a
quadriplegic, the movie star who played the Man of Steel _ and was
a pilot, sailor and equestrian _ has somehow turned that disaster
into a still-active life that seems focused on helping other
people.
	   But inevitably, there are reflections on what might have been.
	   ``I do feel a sense of satisfaction when I can do something like
help this kid we've been talking about today or give a speech that
motivates people,'' Reeve, 45, says in an interview at his home.
``But through it all there is the longing for a return, and regret
for the years that I've missed of doing things that I particularly
enjoy.''
	   Reeve is most visible these days as a champion for research into
a cure for injuries such as his. His Christopher Reeve Foundation
raises hundreds of thousands of dollars for the American Paralysis
Association.
	   He believes that new nerve-regenerating treatments will be ready
for human trials in a few years and that by keeping fit he could be
among the first subjects. He talks confidently of one day embracing
his wife again.
	   ``I'm not going to sit in this wheelchair,'' he vows, his face
animated above his tall, quiet body.
	   His paralysis certainly doesn't keep him from leaving home, a
gracious gray-shingled house in Westchester County's horse country
surrounded by woods, a meadow and a neighbor's goats and chickens.
	   With his high-tech chair, ventilator and a couple of nurses and
aides, Reeve travels regularly to accept awards and make speeches,
seeking public and political support for spinal cord research.
	   ``I consider myself a spokesman for people who can't call the
president or a senator or testify before Congress,'' Reeve says.
	   When he received an honorary degree last month from Pace
University in White Plains, New York, graduates stood and cheered
wildly as he rolled his wheelchair onto the stage by puffing into a
tube. They screamed again at the mention of ``Superman,'' a movie
nearly as old as they are, and every time Reeve spoke of a cure for
spinal-cord paralysis.
	   ``Sometimes these events go very well,'' Reeve admits.
	   His hot-selling memoir, ``Still Me,'' which Reeve dictated to an
assistant, has led to even more appearances. But Reeve says, ``I'm
easing off a little bit. ... Between now and the end of July I have
a trip to Chicago and a trip to Philadelphia and that's it.''
	   He was not including the 10 days or so he is spending in
Massachusetts this month at the Williamstown Theater Festival,
where his wife, actress Dana Reeve, is performing. Reeve is on the
festival's board of directors.
	   ``It's a little hard because I appeared on the stage there for
15 seasons and it's hard to be just an audience member,'' he says.
	   The day before Reeve left for Massachusetts, his 5-year-old son,
Will, gave him an early Father's Day present: a crayon portrait,
with ``I love you Dad'' printed beneath. The boy casually climbed
up the side of his father's wheelchair to plant a kiss on his
cheek, then hopped off and said, ``Bye, Dad.''
	   ``Bye, sweetie,'' Reeve replied.
	   The actor is wealthy enough to afford the help he needs, and
counts among his greatest achievements that his family doesn't see
him as a burden.
	   ``My son goes off to school every morning in the carefree state
of mind that every 5- or 6-year-old is entitled to,'' says Reeve,
who has two teen-age children in England from an earlier
relationship. ``He doesn't worry about me. My wife is free to
accept a role in a play and rehearse and perform without having to
feel guilty. This is something I feel I must give. I have to set
them free.''
	   He is also intent on continuing his own career. His stardom
declined after the four ``Superman'' movies, but he had meaty parts
on Broadway and such films as ``Sleuth.'' He also had a role in the
acclaimed movie ``The Remains of the Day.''
	   ``I looked forward in my 40s to playing a greater range,'' he
says, ``and then suddenly I got sidelined by the accident. Now the
list of things I can do has been so curtailed, I choose what I do
very carefully.''
	   He undertook directing, and won an Emmy nomination for the 1997
HBO drama ``In the Gloaming.'' Later this year, he plans to act in
and direct a remake of ``Rear Window,'' in which the hero will be
much worse off than Jimmy Stewart was with his broken leg.
	   ``The reason I want to do `Rear Window' is because I want to
show a severely disabled person as a hero in a movie,'' he says.
``We'll all see the cutting-edge assistance technology that allows
me to survive.''

With critics crying `Snuff it!', tobacco issue smolders in Hollywood AP Entertainment Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL FLEEMAN
<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ When producer-writer Chris Carter needed to
create a villain for ``The X-Files,'' he opened a pack of smokes.
Cigarette Smoking Man was born to puff his way through one sinister
plot after another, from television to the big screen.
	   When writer-director Don Roos needed a villain for ``The
Opposite of Sex,'' he came up Christina Ricci's tart-tongued,
chain-smoking character, someone who tossed a cigarette butt into
her father's grave at his funeral.
	   Julia Roberts lighting up in ``My Best Friend's Wedding.''
Passengers taking drags in ``Titanic.''
	   American movies continue to reek of cigarettes even as courts,
states and politicians take aim at the tobacco industry.
	   Oddly, the cinematic puffing comes while tobacco is said to be
playing a lesser role on the business side of Hollywood. Although
the northern state of Minnesota's recent dlrs 6 billion settlement
with the tobacco industry included a ban on cigarette product
placement deals in the movies, producers contend they haven't
entered into such deals for years.
	   A Federal Trade Commission report to Congress found that tobacco
companies have spent no money on film product placement since 1989.
By contrast, other product-placement deals have flourished with
everything from automakers to a video chain scrambling to get
screen time.
	   Still, the smoking issue smolders in Hollywood.
	   Filmmakers insist they have a constitutional artistic right to
use cigarettes for character development. Activists say filmmakers
wield a powerful influence over young and impressionable audiences
and therefore have a social responsibility not to glamorize
smoking.
	   ``I'd like to get rid of smoking on the screen,'' said Jack
Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America.
``I've talked to a number of directors and producers, but they tell
me that even though many of the actors and actresses don't smoke,
they still use cigarettes for character development.
	   ``In 20 seconds, with a cigarette, you can show nervousness,
arrogance, anxiety.''
	   But critics like Stanton Glantz, a professor of medicine at the
University of California, San Francisco, aren't convinced.
	   ``The amount of smoking going on in movies has skyrocketed, and
I haven't seen any big change in the overall plot lines of films
that somehow made this desperately necessary to be creative.''
	   Glantz's study of top-grossing movies found that movie smoking
has returned to 1960s levels after three decades of decline. Only
about 14 percent of on-screen tobacco use is contextually linked to
``adverse social or health effects.''
	   Another study, by the American Lung Association last year,
surveyed 133 movies and found that 77 percent had at least one
scene in which a character smoked. Eleven percent had more than 50
smoking incidents.
	   The increase has come despite years of complaints about screen
smoking. Last December, Vice President Al Gore contended that
Hollywood was partly to blame for teen-age smoking.
	   In April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said
the number of teen-age smokers is steadily rising and that 25
percent of U.S. adults smoke, a proportion that has held steady in
recent years after large drops since the 1970s.
	   The latest pressure on Hollywood to change came in May from
Minnesota, where tobacco companies agreed in a settlement to ban
payments for tobacco products in movies nationally.
	   Although said by Hollywood to have no practical economic impact,
the provision, Minnesota prosecutors argue, put movie people on
notice.
	   ``Am I saying that we have evidence that producers were paid
money? We don't have that evidence,'' said Minnesota Assistant
Attorney General Doug Blanke. ``But there have been a lot of films
lately that would cause one to wonder.''

Hemingway spoofers good and true: `Dow Also Rises,' `Old Man and the PC' AP Special Correspondent 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photos NY362-NY363
By HUGH A. MULLIGAN
<TEXT>
	   RIDGEFIELD, Connecticut (AP) _ When it comes to writing really
bad Hemingway, Liz Otto and Jack Schmidt are good and true.
	   Truly good, the best of the worst. The husband and wife writing
team has won the International Imitation Hemingway Competition the
past two years. They were finalists the year before that among
5,000 rival Papa parodists, and in 1985 Jack was a finalist on his
own.
	   If you think this would make Ernest Hemingway proud as a prize
Andalusian bull, you don't know him like they do.
	   ``In truth,'' confides Jack, ``Papa abhorred parodies. In his
own words, he called them `a step up from writing on the wall over
a urinal.'''
	   But alas, at the moment of truth in the arena, the tormented
bull can only snort at the matador's sword-and-cloak choreography.
So Liz and Jack skewer Papa's terse prose.
	   This year's 500-word winning entry was ``The Dow Also Rises,'' a
sand and sex saga of a Wall Street bull wiped out when the Federal
Reserve blocks a leveraged takeover that was neither good nor true.
But their macho stock manipulator hangs in there, flips open his
cell phone and keeps trading.
	   ``It is not for me whom the closing bell tolls,'' he cries
defiantly. ``I trade right past the Wall Street bell, onto the
Nikkei in Tokyo and the Hang Sen in Hong Kong and then on to the
DAX in Germany. I have conquered and it is good and they award me
the ears of Alan Greenspan.''
	   Like last year's computer-induced mauling of the Nobel laureate,
``Across the Modem and Into the Net,'' the winning spoof won them a
flight to Italy and dinner at Harry's Bar and American Grill in
Florence.
	   ``And that's it,'' says Liz with a frown. ``Just the plane
ticket and the one meal, which is wonderful. Anything and
everything on the menu, including wine and drinks, even Hemingway's
17-l martinis that would fell a bull elephant. But the plane dumps
you in Milan, then you're on your own to get to Florence and
wherever else you choose in Italy.''
	   Adds Jack, citing the rules of the contest sponsored by PEN
Center USA West, the writers' rights organization, and Harry's Bar
in Century City, California: ``If you want big bucks, go on Wheel
of Fortune'' _ the popular American TV game show.
	   Neither Liz nor Jack is a writer by profession. Both are in
theater.
	   They met in Jack's native San Francisco. She was starring as
sultry Lola in a touring company of ``Damn Yankees.'' He was doing
character roles in films and TV series, while holding down an
accounting job as a ``budget weenie, riding herd on costs in
missile projects for Philco and Ford Aeronautics.''
	   In TV credits, he invariably was listed among the bad guys: ``I
always played the corrupt doctor, patching up hoodlums.''
	   They married in New York, where type-casting brought Jack to
Broadway as the sinister doctor in ```Something's Afoot,'' a
musical version of Agatha Christie's ``Ten Little Indians.''
	   ``It lasted all of three months,'' Jack laments, but it still
plays in regional theater.
	   When not on tour, Liz did TV commercials: ``Zillions of them.
Avon, Wisk, all the dish-washing and laundry stuff.''
	   Jack, a Hemingway buff since high school, first entered the
competition in 1983 after seeing an ad in The New Yorker. Liz was
appearing at a theater in Allentown, Pennsylvania. He was ``between
hits'' and borrowed a typewriter in the stage manager's office to
hammer out his entry.
	   ``I was disqualified for writing a couple of thousand words,
great words. I hadn't read the instructions.''
	   In 1985, Jack finished among the top dozen with ``The Old Man
and the PC,'' a spoof on video games.
	   ``Let's win this thing and go to Italy,'' Liz recalls his
challenge a couple of years later. Their collaboration began when
they sold their Manhattan brownstone and moved across the river and
into the trees to a converted barn on a lake in Ridgefield.
	   Liz describes the fermentation process: ``It takes about a month
of research. Jack steeps himself in Hemingway. We go through four
or five versions, but the real writing is done two weeks before
deadline. Jack hunches over his computer, and I write in longhand
on yellow legal pads.''
	   She usually supplies ``the general idea and the punch line,''
while both strive for ``laughs with a sexual spin.''
	   Both admit the general idea often dies at dawn, but the sun also
rises on new ways of lampooning dead Ernest in dead earnest. Then
like the bulls running through Pamplona, they are on a rampage,
trampling Papa in pulsating staccato sentences meant to melt the
snows of Kilimanjaro and make the Earth move.
	   ``Macho, macho, macho. That's the game,'' quoth Liz.
	   Their first winning effort, last year, ``almost broke up the
marriage,'' says Jack.
	   Liz explains: ``Once we had the theme, we worked separately and
were mightily convinced our own way was the best.''
	   Jack suggested flipping a coin. He won. Or as Liz prefers to put
it: ``we entered Jack's version and we won anyway.''
	   A battery of English professors culls the thousands of entries.
Then on ``Judgment Night,'' at a fund-raising banquet for PEN, the
final judging is done by a panel of writers like Ray Bradbury,
Barnaby Conrad, Paul Keye and Digby Diehl.
	   Jack almost dropped the phone into their rustic fireplace when
Bradbury came on the line to announce the verdict. ``I've been a
Bradbury fan forever, too. All I could say was, `I love you,
Ray.'''
	   This year, Liz had final say on the tone and phrasing that would
make their prose deathless in the afternoon.
	   ``I shaped it my way,'' Liz says with a laugh, ``and we won
anyway.''
	   Come September, it will be another good and true dinner for two
in Florence, courtesy of a twice well-gored Papa.
	   The ghosts of Oscar Wilde and Brendan Behan had better beware.
The parodist pair now dreams of winning an Irish pub, grand prize
in a Guinness doggerel contest.

Singh's putter puts him in Western Open lead AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
	   LEMONT, Illinois (AP) _ Vijay Singh gives his caddy all the
credit for helping turn around his putting. So the least Singh
could do was pay him back with a 5-under-par birthday present.
	   Singh shot a 67 Saturday to take a two-shot lead in the Western
Open with a 15-under-par 201 after the third round on Cog Hill's
Dubsdread course.
	   ``He told me to make sure I played good today,'' Singh said of
caddie Dave Renwick. ``I said, `Why?' and he said, `Because it's my
birthday.'''
	   Greg Kraft, the first-round leader, shot a 66 and was two
strokes back at 13-under 203 in the dlrs 2.2 million,
Motorola-sponsored event. Joe Durant, the leader after the second
round, was at 11-under 205 after shooting a 70, and U.S. Open
winner Lee Janzen was five strokes back at 206 after bogeying the
18th to finish with a 69.
	   Tiger Woods, in danger of missing the cut after a dismal first
round, had a second good round yet lost ground. He shot a 3-under
69 for 212, 11 strokes behind Singh.
	   ``If the leaders can stay around 10 or 11, I've got a shot at
it. If it's 14 or 15, it's out of reach.'' said Woods, the
defending champion. ``You have to hang in there and hang in there
and grind it out. You might get hot and get back in the ball
game.''
	   With the temperature in the 30s Celsius (upper 90s Fahrenheit)
and humidity making it feel like it was 42 degrees Celsius (107
degrees Fahrenheit), everyone struggled to keep cool Saturday. The
caddies, lugging around heavy bags for 4 1/2 hours, had it
especially bad, and Mark Hensel, Kraft's caddie, collapsed with
heat stroke after the 17th hole.
	   A marshal carried Kraft's bag the last hole and Hensel was taken
to a hospital for IV fluids. He's expected to be back Sunday.
	   Singh, who started the day a stroke behind Durant, got birdies
on Nos. 5 and 7 on the front nine. As soon as he hit the back nine,
his game took off. He sank a 2.4-meter (8-foot) putt for birdie on
the par-5 11th to go 11-under, then picked up another stroke with a
birdie on the par-3 No. 14.
	   His drive on the long par-5 No. 15 was high and short, so Singh
went with a 3-wood for his second shot and put it within 6 meters
(20 feet) of the pin. Using his new putter and new cross-hand grip,
he made the putt for an eagle and went 14-under.
	   ``I stood there for awhile and it was so hot that time of day,
and my caddy said, `Just go ahead and hit the 3-wood and see what
happens,''' Singh said. ``It just came out perfect. And the putt
was a good putt.''
	   After struggling with his putting the past six weeks, Singh has
finally found his rhythm. Using an easy, fluid stroke, he had 28
putts Saturday.
	   Never a fantastic putter, Singh said that was the first thing
Renwick told him he needed to focus on when the two began working
together a year ago this week.
	   Singh got a little help from Kraft, too. Kraft, who didn't find
out until Monday that he had a sponsor's exemption to enter the
tournament, went to the top of the leader board with an eagle on
the par-4 No. 4.
	   Using a 6-iron from 51 meters (168 feet), he hit his second shot
right into the flag, denting the pin as the ball dropped into the
hole.
	   ``That was pretty special,'' he said.
	   A birdie on No. 5 put Kraft at 11-under and he picked up two
more strokes with birdies on Nos. 11 and 12. But he ran into
trouble on the 13th hole.
	   His second shot on the par-4 hole hit a bunker on the left side
of the green, and his chip shot rolled past the cup and almost off
the green. He two-puuted for his first bogey of the day.
	   He had another bogey on No. 14 but, despite picking up a stroke
with a birdie on the 15th, couldn't catch Singh.
 &UR; Divots: &LR;  Singh is one of only six players to shoot below 70 in the
opening three rounds since the Western Open moved to Cog Hill in
1991. The tournament scoring record at Cog Hill is Nick Price's 269
in 1993. ... Steve Stricker, the 1996 Western Open champion, shot a
67 Saturday to put him six strokes back at 9-under-207. ... Woods
and Phil Mickleson are the only players averaging better than 300
yards (meters) per drive this week. ... Attendance was 41,652, more
than 3,000 fewer people than last year.

	   LEMONT, Illinois (AP) _ Vijay Singh gives his caddy all the
credit for helping turn around his putting. So the least Singh
could do was pay him back with a 5-under-par birthday present.
	   Singh shot a 67 Saturday to take a two-shot lead in the Western
Open with a 15-under-par 201 after the third round on Cog Hill's
Dubsdread course.
	   ``He told me to make sure I played good today,'' Singh said of
caddie Dave Renwick. ``I said, `Why?' and he said, `Because it's my
birthday.'''
	   Greg Kraft, the first-round leader, shot a 66 and was two
strokes back at 13-under 203 in the dlrs 2.2 million,
Motorola-sponsored event. Joe Durant, the leader after the second
round, was at 11-under 205 after shooting a 70, and U.S. Open
winner Lee Janzen was five strokes back at 206 after a birdie to
finish with a 69.
	   Tiger Woods, in danger of missing the cut after a dismal first
round, had a second good round yet lost ground. He shot a 3-under
69 for 212, 11 strokes behind Singh.
	   ``If the leaders can stay around 10 or 11, I've got a shot at
it. If it's 14 or 15, it's out of reach.'' said Woods, the
defending champion. ``You have to hang in there and hang in there
and grind it out. You might get hot and get back in the ball
game.''
	   With the temperature in the 30s Celsius (upper 90s Fahrenheit)
and humidity making it feel like it was 42 degrees Celsius (107
degrees Fahrenheit), everyone struggled to keep cool Saturday. The
caddies, lugging around heavy bags for 4 1/2 hours, had it
especially bad, and Mark Hensel, Kraft's caddie, collapsed with
heat stroke after the 17th hole.
	   A marshal carried Kraft's bag the last hole and Hensel was taken
to a hospital for IV fluids. He's expected to be back Sunday.
	   Singh, who started the day a stroke behind Durant, got birdies
on Nos. 5 and 7 on the front nine. As soon as he hit the back nine,
his game took off. He sank a 2.4-meter (8-foot) putt for birdie on
the par-5 11th to go 11-under, then picked up another stroke with a
birdie on the par-3 No. 14.
	   His drive on the long par-5 No. 15 was high and short, so Singh
went with a 3-wood for his second shot and put it within 6 meters
(20 feet) of the pin. Using his new putter and new cross-hand grip,
he made the putt for an eagle and went 14-under.
	   ``I stood there for awhile and it was so hot that time of day,
and my caddy said, `Just go ahead and hit the 3-wood and see what

Starting to look like World Cup of old, Ronaldo, Brazil start to shine 
</HEADLINE>
By BRIAN TRUSDELL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ It's beginning to look like a real World Cup we all
know.
	   No more dreadlocked Jamaicans, no more copper-haired Japanese _
and no more Chile or Norway.
	   On top of that, Italy and Brazil, two of only six teams to win
soccer's Holy Grail, began to fill France '98's quarterfinal field
Saturday: Italy with a 1-0 victory over Norway, and Brazil with a
4-1 thrashing of Chile.
	   Their round-of-eight opponents were to be determined Sunday,
with the winner of France-Paraguay to play Italy and whoever
emerged from Nigeria-Denmark to face Brazil.
	   After 2 1-2 weeks of preliminaries, the World Cup many expected
and predicted began. Christian Vieri scored his tournament-leading
fifth goal for Italy, and two-time FIFA Player of the Year Ronaldo
scored twice, hit the post and the crossbar and generally began to
entertain the way many had hoped.
	   ``We're going all the way,'' Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo said.
``It doesn't make any difference who we play in the quarterfinals _
we're going to play to win. We're going all the way.''
	   After promising to ``break the spell'' that limited to a mere
goal in three games, Ronaldo broke out of his slump with a penalty
kick in the second minute of first-half injury time after being
hauled down by Chilean keeper Nelson Tapia.
	   The goal, combined with two by Cesar Sampaio _ including one in
the 11th minute, gave Brazil a 3-0 halftime lead and complete
control of a game that it dominated.
	   ``We started nervous,'' said Zagallo. ``We were lucky to get a
goal by Cesar Sampaio and this gave morale to the team. Then, in
the second half, we played our best football of the Cup.''
	   Sampaio's pair of goals gave him _ like Ronaldo _ three for the
tournament.
	   It was part of a display that should send tremors through the
rest of the World Cup field, especially Denmark and Nigeria.
	   ``I think we were playing very well until Brazil scored the
first goal,'' said Chilean forward Ivan Zamorano. ``When a team has
players like Ronaldo and Cesar Sampaio, anything might happen, as
it happened today.''
	   Marcelo Salas scored a 69th-minute header, pouncing a ball that
deflected all over the penalty area before going into the net.
	   If Brazilian flair flourished in Paris, Italian defense
dominated in Marseille.
	   Vieri gave the Azzurri the lead in the 18th minute and Italy
smothered Norway's set pieces and long-ball game to reach the
round-of-eight.
	   ``We have the merit to have defeated the team which had stunned
the world champions, the great Brazil,'' Italian coach Cesare
Maldini said, referring to Norway's 2-1 first-round victory over
Brazil in the group finale.
	   The goal came on a classic Italian counter, with Vieri latching
on to a long Luigi Di Biagio through and outracing defender Dan
Eggen before firing a low right-footer across the face of the goal
and past keeper Frode Grodas.
	   ``I'm happy. I'll will try to keep on scoring in the next
matches,'' said Vieri, who has scored in all four of Italy's games.
``It doesn't matter if it's France or Paraguay in the
quarterfinals. For sure it will be as tough as today's match.''
	   Off the field, World Cup and government officials began to make
headway in their ticket fraud problems.
	   They got wise when casually dressed fans showed up in the VIP
section at a game in Lens. Further investigation led to the arrest
of one of the thousand or so volunteers that worked the stadium.
	   But more serious problems related to tickets could be just
around the corner.
	   Already trying to handle violence problems involving English and
German fans, French organizers were bracing for Tuesday's
second-round match between England and Argentina in Saint-Etienne.
	   Only 2,049 tickets had been allocated to the English Football
Association, fewer than for any of England's group games. Although
FA deputy chief executive Pat Smith said the association was trying
to negotiate for more, the shortage could provoke problems as
frustrated fans compete for black market tickets.

Victims of one of ex-Yugoslavia's largest mass graves laid to rest

<TEXT>
	   VUKOVAR, Croatia (AP) _ Not too far from the latest Balkan
flashpoint of Kosovo, a trumpet bellowed farewell to the last 56
victims unearthed from one of the largest mass graves in the former
Yugoslav conflict.
	   The solemn sendoff Saturday, attended by senior government and
church officials, ended a nine-week ritual of exhumations and mass
funerals in an overgrown field surrounded by woods in the eastern
corner of Croatia.
	   Workers with shovels and picks turned up 938 bodies in all,
almost half reportedly civilians. But the number conveys only part
of the horror of Vukovar.
	   Some of the victims were found with hands bound behind their
backs by rope or wire. Others revealed bullet wounds to the rear of
the skull _ an indication of summary-style executions.
	   Many were women or children. Of the total, 230 have yet to be
identified.
	   Vera Novakovic, 54, painfully recollected being driven out of
Vukovar when it fell to Serb forces. Her husband's body recently
was pulled from one of 14 trenches where many were hastily buried
next to an old cemetery. On Saturday, he was interred again before
2,500 mourners.
	   Her son is still listed as missing.
	   ``I can still see the uncontrolled weeping, the shattered stares
of the old and helpless as we exited the inferno,'' she said. ``My
whole life was stuffed in three bags and my son and husband were
left behind.''
	   Unable to return to her ruined home, she lives on the Croatian
island of Losinj in the upper Adriatic with relatives who took her
in after the siege.
	   It was here in Vukovar, seven years ago, that the gruesome
Balkan scenes the world now associates with Bosnia _ and
increasingly, with Kosovo _ first surfaced: shelling, scorched
earth, desperate trails of escaping refugees.
	   Tens of thousands of people were killed in the six-month
Serb-Croat war that came after Croatia declared independence from
Serb-dominated Yugoslavia in 1991.
	   Perhaps the bloodiest fighting took place in this
once-picturesque Danube River town, which is now little more than
bricks and mortar. Over three months in late 1991, Serb forces
systematically shelled Vukovar, killing thousands.
	   On Saturday, 56 coffins bearing recently found victims of that
fighting, wrapped in the red-white-and-blue of the Croatian flag,
were lowered one by one into the ground, to the careful roll of a
drum and toll of a bell.
	   Even after Saturday's burial, the grim exhumations are not over.
They're just moving elsewhere.
	   The discovery of mass graves in the area has barely abated since
the government regained control of the region in January from rebel
Serbs.
	   Three former Yugoslav army officers and a local Serb mayor have
been indicted by the U.N. War Crimes Tribunal on charges of
slaughtering 261 patients from a hospital. Those bodies were buried
in a mass grave at Ovcara, a ravine on the outskirts of Vukovar.
	   In Kosovo on Saturday, Yugoslav army guns bombarded rebel
positions as fighting spread to new areas of the Serbian province
despite stern warnings by a U.S. diplomat.

Backdrop for 300 westerns rises from arson's ashes

<TEXT>
	   TUCSON, Arizona (AP) _ Some mighty nasty villains have menaced
the dusty streets of Old Tucson, but there always seemed to be a
John Wayne or Clint Eastwood to run them out of town or put them in
Boot Hill.
	   No one in a white hat, however, rode in and saved this Old West
movie location and theme park from a real-life culprit: an arsonist
who destroyed nearly half of Old Tucson in 1995 and put it out of
business for 18 months.
	   Now, after a dlrs 13 million renovation, Old Tucson is working
hard to lure back tourists and to bring in the next ``Rio Bravo,''
``Gunfight at the OK Corral'' or ``The Three Amigos,'' a major
motion picture that can bring in major money.
	   ``Movies are two to three years in the making,'' general manager
Tom Moulton says. ``And I think we're still one year away from the
big boom.''
	   The old Old Tucson was the backdrop for some 300 movies and
television shows since 1939. The new one has an added focus:
historic storytelling and concerts featuring such performers as the
50s-style group Sha Na Na and rocker Eddie Money.
	   Sixteen buildings have gone up, including the Grand Palace Hotel
and Saloon, a 450-seat opera house. The makeover includes ponds, a
waterfall and other water attractions and shaded areas for visitors
to sit and picnic.
	   Visitors look at a new exhibit of harnesses once owned by Wayne,
replacing others lost in the fire, and Frank Sinatra's long
underwear from ``Dirty Dingus Magee.'' They watch stagecoaches
rolling along Main Street and take in staged gunfights.
	   On a recent day, however, visitor Lee Piepenbrink found the
rejuvenated park has less of an 1880s feel than the original.
	   ``I think they've done a good job of generally rebuilding some
of the portions of Old Tucson, but to me it seems an awful lot
different from what it was before the fire, and I think the spirit
is not quite the same here,'' says Piepenbrink of Maple Grove,
Minnesota, a Tucson native who has visited the park some 20 times.
	   With paying customers back now for 18 months, it's not exactly
high noon for Old Tucson. But the tourist count last year was
390,000, compared with the 459,000 the park drew in 1994.
	   No big-budget movies have been booked, though location scouts
are regular visitors. The best Old Tucson has done lately is a real
estate company's industrial video and some commercials, says
Moulton, the park's general manager.
	   ``Everything is off this year,'' says Linda Peterson Warren,
director of the Arizona Film Commission.
	   More movie productions are staying in Los Angeles or going to
New York for specifically scripted films, she says.
	   ``We've not had a lot of calls for westerns,'' says Sheri Davis,
director of the Inland Empire Film Commission for California's San
Bernardino and Riverside counties, with rival locations often used
by filmmakers.
	   ``It's a down period,'' she says. ``When it's going to turn, I
have no idea.''
	   Old Tucson was built for William Holden's 1939 movie ``Arizona''
and grew over the years as other movie sets were added. It opened
to the public in 1960.
	   Among the fixtures lost in the fire, which remains unsolved, was
its soundstage; it won't be replaced.
	   Other things can't be replaced, including nearly all of Old
Tucson's 10,000-square-foot wardrobe and props collection, ranging
from Wayne's pants to Michael Landon's belongings from TV's
``Little House on the Prairie.''
	   But restoration continues. For example, The Reno, an 1872 steam
locomotive whose passengers included Presidents Ulysses Grant and
Theodore Roosevelt, was badly damaged in the fire. But it will be
taken to Nevada as a prop for the movie ``The Wild, Wild West,''
before it is refurbished, Moulton says.
	   The front of Old Tucson's mission, considered its signature
building prominent in such movies as Steve Martin's ``The Three
Amigos,'' has been rebuilt.
	   The Victorian-style town hall will showcase Indian artifacts,
gems and minerals, a pictorial story of famous lawmen and badmen,
and a photographic history of locally-made movies.
	   Old Tucson's focus as a park is moving toward living history,
including gunfights, Moulton says, but it will never forget its
movie-set heritage.
	   ``That's why we're here,'' he says.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Venezuela's defense minister is
investigating whether a former coup leader has formed committees of
retired military officials to defend his votes in December's
presidential election.
	   A local TV station aired a video last week in which retired Lt.
Col. Hugo Chavez was supposedly swearing in members of the groups,
El Nacional newspaper reported Saturday.
	   Defense Minister Tito Rincon Bravo did not specifiy whether
officials believe the groups might act violently if Chavez, the
front-runner, loses the election.
	   A spokesperson for Chavez said the accusation was part of a
smear campaign engineered by his political enemies. Most candidates
have teams of observers at election sites to try to limit fraud.
	   Chavez, the leader of a failed 1992 coup attempt, is leading
former Miss Universe and local mayor Irene Saez in opinion polls.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ A hepatitis outbreak is threatening
the Yanomamis, one of the world's last ``Stone Age'' tribes,
scientists said Saturday.
	   A study by the Central University of Venezuela found that 30
percent of the tribe in Venezuela is suffering from hepatitis B,
and 40 percent from hepatitis Delta. Both are transmitted through
sexual activity, blood or saliva, and can be deadly.
	   While the university researchers said the hepatitis could
devastate the tribe, other scientists note its population has
stabilized during the last several years despite other outbreaks of
disease.
	   The Yanomamis were virtually untouched by modern civilization
until recent decades. But disease among the tribe has increased
sharply in the last decade, largely because of contact with
thousands of illegal gold miners in the Amazon jungle.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The governor of Mexico's southern Chiapas
state has denied allegations by Indian refugees refusing to return
home that pro-government paramilitary groups had threatened them.
	   ``I have no knowledge or precise information that paramilitary
groups exist'' in the village of Los Chorros, press reports
Saturday quoted Gov. Roberto Albores Guillen as saying.
	   Government prosecutors, however, have concluded that a December
massacre of 45 residents of a nearby hamlet was planned by a
paramilitary gang in Los Chorros, and several of those arrested are
from the village.
	   About 850 Indian refugees who are members of a pro-rebel group
canceled plans to return to Los Chorros and nearby villages
Thursday, citing threats by government supporters.

Choir's music is powerful medicine for recovering addicts

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The cramped room seems ready to burst from too
many decibels and too much energy, as singers sway and stomp and
pour their souls into tunes that sometimes seem written just for
them.
	   ``I'm free, praise the Lord, no longer bound,'' they bellow.
``No more chains on me. My soul is rested. It's just a blessing.
Praise the Lord, Hallelujah! I'm free.''
	   More than music makes this gospel choir special. These three
dozen men and women are recovering from cocaine, heroin and alcohol
abuse.
	   They are the Addicts Rehabilitation Choir, and the music and the
faith it embraces keep them focused on the war they wage each day
to stay straight. When they sing ``Nobody Knows the Trouble I've
Seen,'' they feel it in their bones.
	   Gospel music and recovery are ``both about struggle and both
about overcoming,'' says the Rev. Reginald Williams, director of
operations at the Addicts Rehabilitation Center, the choir's
sponsor.
	   ``You have the lows of the basses and the highs of the sopranos,
and in between you have the whole range of life.''
	   Williams starts off the Wednesday morning concert at Harlem's
Mount Moriah Baptist Church, stoking the audience before the first
note from the choir. In the pews, they rise, dance, wave, sing.
	   ``Somebody ought to say, `Praise the Lord!''' shouts Williams,
and shouts come back from the packed pews. When he asks worshippers
to count their blessings, they pop up to speak.
	   ``My name is Roy,'' declares one man, ``and God has blessed me
and delivered me from drugs.''
	   ``I'm grateful to God,'' says another, ``because he picked up
all my broken pieces and made me whole.''
	   A woman in white is on her feet, gazing skyward, her arms
reaching high. Around her, loud ``Amens'' ring out whenever a song
touches on hard times past or obstacles overcome.
	   James Allen, the center's founder and director, leads the choir.
Forty years ago, this sharecropper's son put Lexington, Kentucky,
and heroin addiction behind him and moved to Harlem.
	   He joined a church and soon took over its program for alcoholics
and drug users, his ``Ministry to the Down and Outs.''
	   With a federal grant and donated building, the program
eventually grew into the Addicts Rehabilitation Center, which now
houses about 400 recovering drug addicts and several dozen AIDS
patients.
	   In the mid-1970s, Allen organized a small choir to help pay the
bills, but he soon realized singing could bring in more than money.
``It gives them a sense of pride,'' he says. ``It gives them a
sense ... that they have something to offer, they're not just
hustling.''
	   The combination of faith and music is powerful.
	   ``You have to have something that's bigger than you,'' says
Williams, ``and it has to be bigger than ... your drug of choice
and your addiction. God fills that role perfectly.''
	   The choir tours Europe several times a year and has sung at
Lincoln Center, as well as schools, churches and political rallies.
Altogether, it gives about 200 performances each year.
	   Allen hopes the choir's high profile will send a message to the
public. ``If beautiful singers are being lost to drugs, then maybe
there are other skills and talents we can save,'' he says. ``In
other words, stop writing people off as worthless because they use
drugs, and start trying to save them.''
	   Many of the choir members had little experience before joining,
but Allen claims he can train any voice.
	   It's a serious commitment. Rehearsals and concerts can take up
to 20 hours a week, and any lapse in sobriety means suspension.
	   ``I can't get high at this point, because I know if I do I can't
sing,'' says Benita Jones, a 32-year-old soprano who gave up crack
five years ago and is now a drug counselor. ``And I'd rather sing
than get high.''
	   In a soft, shy voice, she recalls her old life.
	   ``I was actually a bum,'' says Jones. ``All I did was get
high.''
	   After months of urging, Jones checked into Allen's center and
joined the gospel choir almost immediately. She now has her own
apartment and custody of her 15-year-old son. Singing, she says, is
her way of saying thank you.
	   ``Everybody doesn't make it back from crack, from drug
addiction. But (God) was with me when I was out there, so I have to
thank him for that.''
	   Two years ago, baritone James B. Johnson broke 23 years of
dependence on cocaine, crack and alcohol. Singing, he says, brings
him closer to God. ``It gives me a good feeling,'' he says, ``and
it also gives me an outlet when I'm feeling low.''
	   Johnson came to the center six months into a relapse that ended
five years of sobriety.
	   ``Fell apart, fell apart,'' he recalls with a grimace.
``Couldn't find decent work. Family members didn't want me in their
houses. ... I really didn't believe there was any turning around.''
	   Then he heard the choir sing.
	   ``That was the turning point for me,'' he says. ``I stopped
saying I knew everything, and I started listening to people.''
	   Allen says that's what the choir is all about.
	   ``When you see a person who's totally emaciated, and you take
that person and you slowly put them together bit by bit, and they
slowly become a productive, functioning person _ there's no way I
can describe the satisfaction of having done that.''

Yankees 7, Mets 2 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The New York Yankees made it two straight over
the crosstown Mets on Saturday, getting a strong start from Andy
Pettitte and a three-run homer from Tino Martinez in a 7-2 victory.
	   The much-hyped, three-game matchup for New York baseball
bragging rights has become a one-sided affair with the Mets now
needing to win Sunday night's nationally televised game to avoid a
sweep and salvage some respect.
	   The Yankees' fourth straight win wasn't a thing of beauty. They
committed three errors, but they capitalized on two by the Mets,
got the big blow from Martinez and a solid outing from Pettitte
(9-5).
	   Bobby Jones (6-5) gave up seven runs _ three earned _ and six
hits in 6 2-3 innings.
 &UR; Padres 5, Angels 1
	   In San Diego, Sterling Hitchcock pitched no-hit ball until
allowing Phil Nevin's homer on the first pitch of the eighth
inning, finishing with a two-hitter as the San Diego Padres beat
the Anaheim Angels.
	   The Padres remain one of two teams that have been around more
than six years that haven't had a no-hitter _ the other is the New
York Mets.
	   Hitchcock (4-1), who began his career in the AL and started this
season in the bullpen, spent a considerable amount of time on the
bases in the seventh.
	   Hitchcock reached on a fielder's choice, went to third on Tony
Gwynn's RBI double. The inning was extended by an intentional walk
to Ken Caminiti and a pitching change during which Hitchcock sat on
the bag for a few moments.
	   Nevin homered to left, his fifth, on a hanging curveball.
Hitchcock matched his career high with nine strikeouts. Omar
Olivares (5-3) was the losing pitcher.
 &UR; Giants 6, Rangers 5, 10 innings
	   In San Francisco, Darryl Hamilton got his fourth hit, a one-out
single in the 10th inning that bounced past center fielder Tom
Goodwin and gave the San Francisco Giants a win over the Texas
Rangers.
	   The Rangers committed a season-high five errors, leading to four
unearned runs. San Francisco ended its three-game losing streak and
stopped Texas' four-game winning string.
	   Brian Johnson reached on a two-base error by third baseman Luis
Alicea with one out in the Giants 10th. Brent Mayne drew a walk
from Danny Patterson (1-3), and Hamilton's single scored
pinch-runner Shawn Estes.
	   Goodwin charged Hamilton's hit and made a diving attempt, but
the ball short-hopped past him.
	   Robb Nen (5-1) pitched two scoreless innings for the win. The
Giants bullpen held the Rangers to three hits and no runs in eight
innings.
 &UR; Astros 9, Indians 5, 11 innings
	   In Cleveland, Moises Alou hit an RBI single in the 11th off Jose
Mesa, and Carl Everett followed with a three-run homer as the
Houston Astros beat the Indians 9-5.
	   Everett's homer punctuated a home-run derby that featured six
long balls _ three by each team.
	   Alou, who hit three homers for Florida against the Indians in
the World Series last fall, drove in Derek Bell with a two-out
single off Mesa (3-4) as thunderclaps rumbled in the distance.
Everett then added his eighth homer to right.
	   Reggie Harris pitched the 11th for Houston, which snapped a
three-game losing streak and ended Cleveland's six-game winning
streak. The Indians missed a chance to win seven straight for the
first time since winning nine in a row in August 1995.
	   Billy Wagner (2-2) struck out three in 1 1-3 innings.

World Cup volunteer arrested for selling VIP tickets 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ When T-shirts were spotted in the VIP section of a
World Cup match, officials knew something was up.
	   And that led to the arrest of a World Cup volunteer for
allegedly selling about 50 premium tickets, officials said
Saturday.
	   The volunteer for the tournament's French organizing committee
CFO was arrested in the northern border city of Lens where the
match took place, the officials said on condition of anonymity.
	   The man, who was not identified, was among 1,000 volunteers who
worked at the stadium.
	   French radio reported that officials were tipped off when the
fans who bought the tickets showed up in T-shirts in the usually
well-dressed ``presidential section.''
	   It was the latest problem involving tickets for World Cup
organizers. Most have involved travel agencies that allegedly
oversold tickets or failed to deliver them.
	   On Friday, the head of a U.S. ticket agency for the World Cup
was placed under formal investigation _ one step short of being
charged _ for alleged fraud. He reported the theft of thousands of
tickets officials said were already sold, judicial sources said.
	   Douglas Knittle, president and general manager of Prime Sports
International, was placed under judicial controls, preventing him
from leaving the country, the sources said on customary anonymity.
	   Critics have also said distribution plans were unfairly weighted
toward French fans and sponsors. Of the 2.6 million tickets
printed, more than 962,000 were earmarked for supporters in France,
while commercial partners snapped up 436,000.
	   In London, the English Football Association complained that the
official ticket allocation for Tuesday's match against Argentina
will create a flood of demand on the black market and fresh fears
of violence.
	   The allocation of 2,049 for the second-round game is smaller
than for any of England's group games and could provoke problems as
frustrated fans compete for black market tickets.
	   FA deputy chief executive Pat Smith said the association was
trying to negotiate more tickets for the Saint-Etienne match.
	   England was initially allocated 3,700 tickets for the game in
Marseille, 2,700 for Toulouse and 2,500 for Lens, but the figures
rose to 7,300, 3,300 and 4,400 after FA intervention.
	   Smith said the reasons for the small allocation were the
capacity of the stadium (36,000), pre-planned security arrangements
and increased international demand for tickets.
	   Many England fans bought black market tickets for first-round
games because allocations were limited. FA security adviser Sir
Brian Hayes said the distribution of World Cup tickets had been a
failure, and he had always thought much of the French allocation
would be resold on the black market.
	   ``It was always evident. Now people are paying outrageous,
inflated prices,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   KRASNOYARSK, Russia (AP) _ Looking for the best European museum?
	   It might just be in Krasnoyarsk, this formerly closed city that
is in Siberia _ which is, geographically and otherwise speaking, in
Asia.
	   Moreover, it's a museum that began life as a propagandistic
homage to Soviet founder Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, and hasn't entirely
turned its back on its Communist past.
	   At first blush, it might seem odd that the Council of Europe, a
respected cultural and political organization, gave its European
Museum of the Year Award for 1998 to the Krasnoyarsk Museum Center.
	   Past winners include the Miro museum in Barcelona, Spain, and
the National Museum in Munich, Germany, which are indisputably in
Europe and, let's face it, a bit more in the cultural swing of
things.
	   Was it geographical ignorance? Leftist nostalgia? An error in
translation?
	   Not at all.
	   ``Though we are situated in the center of Asia and the center of
Russia, the committee considered that we were very good at
instilling the European ideal,'' said the museum's director,
Mikhail Shubsky.
	   True, said Lord Russel Johnston, chairman of the Council of
Europe committee that selected the museum. Anyway, he added,
``Russia has become a member of the Council of Europe, so that's
how that was resolved.''
	   The museum that so appealed to Johnston and his cohorts sits on
the banks of the mighty Yenisey River, the lifeline of Siberia, in
the midst of a city better known for the aluminum smelter that
fouls the air and the defense plants that once made the area off
limits to foreigners.
	   It opened in 1987 as the Lenin Museum, the last of 13 branches
of the Central Lenin Museum in Moscow, and one of the largest, at
more 130,000 square feet (12,000 square meters). It was, as the
name suggests, devoted to the life of the leader of the Bolshevik
revolution.
	   As luck would have it, the museum was designed by a local
architect, Oleg Demerkhanov, who avoided the numbing conformity of
most modern Soviet architecture. He created something striking
instead: a bold outcropping of large blocks sheathed in the local,
mocha-colored granite, with towering windows that command fine
views of the river.
	   Inside, he gave it grand, soaring spaces _ as much as four
stories high _ and interesting nooks and crannies. Oh yes, and lots
of statues of Lenin, whose local claim to fame is having passed
through Krasnoyarsk en route to Siberian exile under the czar.
	   The Lenin statues are mostly bagged in burlap now. But his
presence is deeply felt anyway, not least in the presence of
Shubsky, the director, who bears more than a passing resemblance to
Vladimir Ilyich, with his shiny pate, graying goatee and piercing
eyes.
	   Like Lenin, Shubsky can be called a revolutionary. How else to
explain the changes he has brought to the museum since taking it
over in 1991?
	   In its announcement of the prize, the Council of Europe said its
jury decided to reward Krasnoyarsk ``in recognition of the spirit
of enterprise, creativity and resourcefulness of this museum,
which, despite financial constraints and an outlying location has
assumed a pivotal role within the vast Russian Federation.''
	   Calling the museum's role ``pivotal'' might be stretching a bit.
But the ``enterprise, creativity and resourcefulness'' are evident
to anyone who walks in the door.
	   In the central gallery recently was an exhibition by teachers
and students of a Siberian art institute _ part of the museum's
goal of encouraging local artists. The surprise was the quality of
the work, which was sophisticated, poignant and hip.
	   Another gallery contained a theatrical diorama of 19th century
Siberian life. Another held an exhibit of local photography that
reflected post-Soviet life in all its weirdness and complexity _
as, for example, in the photo of a Russian Orthodox priest, fully
robed, showing off his form at a bowling alley.
	   Yet another photo gallery exhibited the work of a local amateur,
whose full frontal male nudes would certainly have raised eyebrows
in an earlier time. In fact, they still do.
	   ``Some of the older women who work at the museum were shocked
when they saw that,'' confided Nina Ushakova, a museum guide.
	   The heart of the museum is its permanent exhibits, including a
searing tribute to the victims of the three recent undeclared wars
fought by the Soviet Union and then Russia _ in Afghanistan,
Tajikistan and Chechnya.
	   Among the objects on display is a torn-open metal ammunition box
surrounded and filled by photographs of the Soviet and Afghan
leaders who prosecuted the Afghan war. Nearby, electric flames glow
in little black boxes for each of the 165 local soldiers who died
in the three wars.

	   Then there are the ``red halls'' containing Lenin memorabilia.
They have been left as they were during the Soviet years, the walls
still deep red _ ``the color of the red flag and the color of
blood,'' Ushakova noted.
	   Why keep such obvious propaganda, when most Russian museums have
either junked it or kept it around out of sheer laziness or
conservatism?
	   ``This is our principal position,'' Shubsky said, ``that the
history of the country shouldn't be bad or good, but it should be
preserved. I should add that it is becoming more and more popular
with the years.''
	   A former philosophy professor, Shubsky strongly believes a
museum ``should be an active part of the cultural life of the city
and the territory,'' and has done what he can to pursue that goal.
	   He is especially proud of the two ``biennales'' that the museum
has produced during his tenure. These grand expositions brought
together works from dozens of museums _ 33 in 1995 and 43 in 1997 _
from throughout Siberia, others parts of Russia and Europe.
	   Now he has other ideas, including an exhibit that would recreate
part of an American children's museum for the children of
Krasnoyarsk. One problem: He hasn't yet found a museum willing to
cooperate. But he hasn't given up.
	   He can measure his success in part in numbers. In 1990, Shubsky
said, the museum attracted 60,000 people. Last year, it drew
500,000.
	   And then there's that award. A plaque from the Council of Europe
hangs in one of the upper galleries now, telling all who come that
they have stepped into the best European museum in all of Asia.

At age 75, Norman Mailer mourns that marvelous madness

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Manhattan looks mighty grand from the sky-high
heights of the Rainbow Room and the view indoors isn't bad either:
Muhammad Ali smiling and jabbing; Kurt Vonnegut wiping his glasses
with a pink napkin; William Styron, tall and broad, giving out
handshakes and shoulder hugs.
	   This is a New York publishing party, a big one. Norman Mailer is
75. He has just come out with his 31st book. He's marking 50 years
since the release of his famous first novel, ``The Naked and the
Dead.''
	   No longer a scowling young punk, the guest of honor has the
grace of a man with his own ideas of aging gracefully. He is a
round, white-haired figure dressed in a dark suit and a bright red
tie. He has a drink in one hand and a silver-tipped cane in the
other. He twinkles like a grandfather and swears like a sailor.
	   ``In certain ways, writing is the most enjoyable life you can
have,'' Mailer says. ``No boss until you finish a book, when you
have editors and publishers _ and that's not really a boss. And if
you make enough to live off your writing, it's even better.''
	   Norman Mailer. The Reporter. The Dean. The violent prince of
American letters. The self-canonized ``embattled aging enfant
terrible of the literary world, wise father of six children,
radical intellectual, existential philosopher, hardworking author,
champion of obscenity. ...''
	   If he never did write the Great American Novel, Mailer was a
generation's idea of the Great American Writer: bold and cunning
and in the middle of everything, running for office (for New York
City mayor, in the late 1960s), drinking and fighting, marrying and
remarrying (he's on wife No. 6), writing Big Books on war and
politics.
	   Mailer still celebrates that madness, that marvelous madness,
but he mourns it, too. Although his books are no smaller _ the
current checks in at more than a thousand pages _ Mailer the man is
mellower, and sadder. The revolution he hollered for never
happened. He has given up running for anything.
	   ``All the things I wrote against I feel like I have lost,'' he
said in an interview at his Brooklyn home, a riverfront townhouse
where he has lived for 40 years. ``The corporation has taken over,
and the computer has taken over.''
	   ``In the old days,'' he added,'' you could build up the somewhat
deluded notion of your own importance, without being crazy. ...
Now, people say, `Hey, hey, hey, he's going over the edge.' In
those days, people said, `Maybe he's got a shot.'''
	   The author once wrote that a good existentialist needs a
religion, and this is Mailer's: The spirit world is a struggle
between a force of good (call it God) and a force of evil (call it
the devil). Truth must be discovered as you go along. Even God
doesn't know how it's going to turn out.
	   As Mailer sees it, good is instinct, passion, creativity,
improvisation. Evil is habit, conformity, repression, sterility.
Good is like a snatch of hot jazz; evil a whiff of cold Muzak.
	   Mailer believes we live in evil times. Corporations grow like
cancer. Computers soften the muscles. Ugly buildings scar the
skies. We fear death so badly we've let our very souls become
climate controlled.
	   ``Life has taken on the character of a superhighway,'' he said.
``In the old days it took twice as long to get from one town to
another, but it was interesting, the drive was interesting. You had
to have a little skill to negotiate some of the curves and the
turns and it was intimate.
	   ``People live in this terror that if they get off the
superhighway they're doomed. And everything feeds it. Fluorescent
light feeds it. Plastic feeds it. McDonald's feeds it.''
	   His weighty new book has a weighty title, ``The Time of Our
Time.'' It is a very personal, very political anthology. The author
has arranged excerpts from his works into Maileresque history,
starting with Ernest Hemingway in a boxing ring, continuing through
bullfights, antiwar protests and political conventions, going back
to the ancient Middle East and then sailing off into the cosmos.
	   He wants the book to be read as a novel, and if the story line
gets lost in the sands of Egypt, the message survives. Whether
writing fiction or nonfiction, analyzing the minds of presidents,
prophets or boxers, Mailer asks the same questions: What does it
mean to live? What does it mean to die? What happens to people when
their minds become like machines?
	   ``Nixon's crime is his inability to rise above admiration for
the corporation,'' Mailer writes about the Watergate scandal.
``Throughout the transcripts, he is acting like the good, tough,
even-minded, cool-tempered, and tastefully foul-mouthed president
of a huge corporation _ an automobile man, let us say. ... He has
no more and no less sense of value than any big corporation
president in the land.''

<TEXT>
	   An accountant's son, Mailer was born in 1923 in Long Branch, New
Jersey, and raised in Brooklyn. He entered Harvard University as an
engineering major, but soon decided he wanted to be a writer. This
desire to dabble with the written word continued, and intensified,
after he served in World War II, when he took notes while fighting
in the South Pacific.
	   Once the war was over, the race to write the Great War Novel
began. For young men with ambition it was the prize of the time,
and Mailer seized it. ``The Naked and the Dead'' was a long, dense
book based on Mailer's war experiences, a then-controversial novel
because of its rough language and its unflattering view of military
thinking.
	   His next two novels, ``Barbary Shore'' and ``The Deer Park,''
were both seen as letdowns. But by the late '50s, a ``new'' Mailer
had emerged: violent, dynamic, outrageous. On television, he would
call President Eisenhower ``a bit of a woman.'' In print, he would
confess ``anger has brought me to the edge of the brutal.'' In
private, he would take himself to the edge _ and beyond.
	   Mailer's works during the '60s and '70s were among the most
talked about of the era. They included the brutal (some say
misogynist) novel ``An American Dream''; the magazine essay
``Superman at the Supermarket,'' which Mailer has claimed helped
elect President Kennedy, and ``The Armies of the Night,'' his
Pulitzer Prize-winning book of the massive antiwar march on the
Pentagon in 1967.
	   But over the past 20 years, since winning another Pulitzer Prize
for ``The Executioner's Song,'' Mailer's career presents a paradox
worthy of his existential mind. He knows he doesn't have his old
influence, but he must continue as if he did, to avoid becoming a
``cranky old guy with slits in his sneakers.'' He has interviewed
Madonna, put himself in the mind of Jesus (the novel ``The Gospel
According to the Son'') and traveled to Russia to write about Lee
Harvey Oswald.
	   His project now is to write the sequel to ``Harlot's Ghost,''
his 1,200-page novel about the Central Intelligence Agency. He
promised the book years ago, but the Cold War has since ended and
Mailer fears no one cares about the CIA anymore. He has had a hard
time deciding how to start. He doesn't know if he'll be around for
the finish.
	   And those are reasons why he wants to try.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Despite efforts to open up the attack, scoring was
down slightly in the first round of the World Cup from four years
ago.
	   FIFA said the first 48 games produced 126 goals, an average of
2.63 a match. In 1994, the first round _ with 36 games _ had a
2.71-goals-per-game average.
	   There were 176 yellow cards for rough play, an average of 3.7 a
game, down from 4.2 in the '94 Cup. But red cards were way up, with
16 for a 0.3 average from eight, an average of 0.22 in 1994.
	   FIFA president Sepp Blatter, who advocates more offense, said
the games in France still were full of action.

coach, Norway's Egil Olsen, would answer only two questions from
journalists.
	   The first question dealt with the weather. The second one was
even more straight-forward.

After 60 years, 'Gone With the Wind' returns to theaters 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The world's most popular movie is back.
	   New Line Cinema presented ``Gone With the Wind'' in about 250
theaters, bringing digitally reproduced sound, Technicolor's new
dye-transfer printing process and the original screen dimensions to
a generation that has seen the 1939 classic only on television or
video.
	   The more subtle and varied color has been criticized by
restoration expert Robert Harris, who considers it ``a distortion
of the original three-strip Technicolor look.'' But viewers should
be pleased with the 1.33:1 width-to-height ratio which will afford
a third more image than audiences have seen in decades.
	   ``Gone With the Wind'' remains the biggest movie moneymaker of
all time, when you consider inflation of the U.S. dollar and that
relative ticket prices have skyrocketed.
	   Why has ``GWTW'' captured generations of moviegoers?
	   ``I think it's one of the two most romantic films ever made; the
other is obviously 'Casablanca,''' says Charles Champlin, film
critic of the Los Angeles Times.
	   ``When you think of the cast: Gable, Leigh, Howard, de
Havilland. ... The casting in 'Gone With the Wind' is one of the
things that gave it majesty and power.''
	   Another factor is that ``GWTW'' is played against the backdrop
of America's greatest drama _ the Civil War.
	   The making of ``Gone With the Wind'' became as storied as the
book itself.
	   When Margaret Mitchell's novel was published in 1936, producer
David O. Selznick received a copy from his New York literary scout,
Kay Brown. Since a Hollywood producer would never read a 1,027-page
book, she sent along a 25-page synopsis and urged him to buy the
film rights.
	   Reluctant at first, Selznick was persuaded to offer dlrs 50,000.
It was accepted, and his decision was soon vindicated. ``GWTW''
sold a million copies at dlrs 3 apiece within six months. In a
year, it had sold 1,690,000 copies.
	   The publicity-wise producer realized he needed a gimmick to keep
the book in the public eye during the two or three years before the
film could be made and released. The Search for Scarlett O'Hara was
launched, with talent scouts auditioning thousands of young women
throughout the country.
	   Norma Shearer, Katharine Hepburn, Paulette Goddard and other
stars were considered for Scarlett (Hepburn eagerly sought it).
Even Lucille Ball auditioned.
	   Millions of readers agreed that only Clark Gable could play
Rhett Butler. But Gable belonged to MGM, and Selznick did not want
to owe his father-in-law, Louis B. Mayer, for Gable's services.
	   Selznick thought of casting Gary Cooper and Errol Flynn, but in
the end he was forced to deal with Mayer. The terms were tough; MGM
would lend Gable and supply half of the dlrs 2.5 million budget in
return for rights to release the film.
	   As production neared, Selznick had cast every role except
Scarlett.
	   To acquire space for the outdoor set of Tara, many of the
studio's old sets, including King Kong's lair, had to be
dismantled. The suggestion was made to use them as a bonfire for
longshots of the burning of Atlanta. Selznick invited famous
friends to witness the spectacle.
	   ``Where the hell is Myron?'' the irritated producer inquired.
His brother Myron, the top agent in Hollywood and a frequent drunk,
had not appeared. As the fire lit up much of suburban Culver City,
Selznick felt a tug at his sleeve.
	   It was Myron, accompanied by a slender young beauty. He said,
``Dave, I want you to meet Scarlett O'Hara.'' The young woman was
British actress Vivien Leigh.
	   As principal filming started on Jan. 26, 1939, the private lives
of both Leigh and Gable were in turmoil. She was enmeshed in
scandal because of her flaming romance with Laurence Olivier; both
were married to other people. Gable was faced with a huge
settlement to divorce his second wife and marry Carole Lombard.
	   Meanwhile Olivia de Havilland (Melanie) was being courted by
Howard Hughes, and the married Leslie Howard (Ashley Wilkes) was
having an affair with a younger woman.
	   Gable's problems were more than marital. He rebelled at being
directed by George Cukor and believed that the famed ``woman's
director'' was tilting the film to Leigh and de Havilland. Selznick
solved the impasse by firing Cukor and hiring a Gable favorite,
Victor Fleming.
	   The tall, commanding, part-Indian Fleming took immediate charge.
``I'm going to make this picture a melodrama,'' he announced,
reasoning that flamboyance was needed to lend credulity to the
panoramic events.
	   Leigh and de Havilland were distressed by the new approach.
Lacking support from the new director, each secretly visited Cukor
for coaching. Thus, in a way, George Cukor ended up directing
Scarlett and Melanie after all.
	   The high-strung Fleming became frazzled by pressures from
Selznick, the parade of writers with script changes, the
responsibility of huge crowd scenes and dealing with a gallery of
temperamental actors _ especially Vivien Leigh, whose nerves were
strained by overwork and the long schedule.

	   As the scene of Scarlett's final break with Rhett approached,
the actress cried, ``I can't do this scene! This woman is a
terrible bitch!'' Gable added that he wouldn't be able to do the
``don't give a damn'' scene scheduled for the following day.
	   Fleming exploded at Leigh. He rolled up his script, told her
where to put it, threw it at her feet, and stomped off the set. He
remained AWOL for two days, then Selznick, Gable and Leigh arrived
at his Malibu home with a cage of love birds.
	   He returned to ``GWTW,'' but the pressure continued, and he
seemed on the verge of a nervous breakdown. A series of directors
spelled him; even Selznick directed a scene.
	   Finally, on July 1, 1939, ``Gone With the Wind'' completed
photography. The production cost was dlrs 3.2 million; with
overhead, prints and other charges, the total reached dlrs
3,957,000, a record sum in that era.
	   ``Gone With the Wind'' won eight Oscars and brought David O.
Selznick untold millions and endless accolades. But he also
considered it a curse. For the rest of his career, he strove to
produce a film that would surpass his one great achievement.
	   Finally he realized that was impossible.
	   ``I know when I die,'' he sighed, ``my tombstone will read: Here
lies David O. Selznick, the man who made 'Gone With the Wind.'''
	   It doesn't _ the memorable film did not follow Selznick to his
grave.

World Cup: Vieri evokes memories of Rossi, Schillaci 
</HEADLINE>
By PIERO VALSECCHI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ By scoring his fifth World Cup goal,
which lifted Italy into the quarterfinals, Christian Vieri is
evoking memories of former Italian World Cup heroes Paolo Rossi and
Salvatore Schillaci.
	   Rossi, in 1982, and Schillaci, in 1990, entered their respective
World Cups with low profiles, yet each finished with six goals to
top the scoring list.
	   Vieri came to France 98 in the shadow of star strikers
Alessandro Del Piero and Roberto Baggio, but now is topping both in
popularity _ and goals _ and is even finding the net more often
than celebrated strikers such as Argentina's Gabriel Batistuta and
Brazil's Ronaldo.
	   ``I'm happy,'' said Vieri, who has scored in all four of Italy's
games. ``I'll try to keep on scoring also in the next games.''
	   The 24-year-old striker tallied his latest goal in Saturday's
second-round match against Norway, giving Italy a 1-0 win in the
first game of the knockout phase.
	   Italy's victory also ended Norway's 17-game unbeaten streak,
which including two wins against world champion Brazil. The
Italians will play either France or Paraguay in the quarterfinals
Friday at St. Denis.
	   Vieri, who lived for many years in Australia where his father
worked as a soccer coach, netted the game-winner on a classic
Italian counterattack in the 18th minute.
	   Fed by a long pass from midfielder Luigi Di Biagio, Vieri
outpaced defender Dan Eggen and beat goalie Frode Grodas with a
perfect diagonal shot. Then the Italians devoted themselves to
tight defense, gradually choking Norway's dangerous high-ball
attacks led by Chelsea striker Tore Andre Flo.
	   Even so, Norway's coach Egil Olsen didn't have glowing words for
the Italians.
	   ``We didn't play up to our limit and I felt if we had done that,
we would have beaten Italy,'' Olsen said. ``In fact, I wasn't
impressed by Italy either. It was more because we didn't play very
well that we lost the match. ... We wasted a good opportunity to
advance.''
	   Playing below their standards _ perhaps because of the hot
weather _ the Italians spoiled two clear scoring chances from Del
Piero while Norway's best chance _ a short-range header by Flo _
was stopped by a one-handed save from Italian keeper Gianluca
Pagliuca in the 71st minute.
	   ``I think it was a well deserved victory,'' Maldini said.
``Let's enjoy this important win. We will have plenty of time to
think of the next match.''

Nissan Motor to cut wages, eliminate senior advisors: report 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nissan Motors Co., Japan's second-largest
automaker, will trim management wages and stop employing senior
advisors to cut costs, a local media report said Sunday.
	   The reported move is part of an ongoing restructuring effort
designed to put the money-losing car maker back in the black. Last
month, Nissan posted a net group loss and steep drop in
unconsolidated pretax profit for the fiscal year ended in March.
	   Nissan will freeze the base pay of some 3,000 white collar
workers and slash their bonus payments by 10 percent, resulting in
a 3 percent reduction in annual compensation, the Nihon Keizai
business daily said.
	   Company officials were unavailable for immediate comment.
	   Nissan directors will receive no bonus and their salaries will
be slashed 10 percent, the newspaper reported. In addition, by
mid-July Nissan plans to eliminate its senior advisor system, which
has paid former company presidents and chairmen to provide
guidance, it said.
	   Other former executives who serve as advisors will be forced to
fully retire at age 70, down from a previous age limit of 75, the
paper said.

Ringo's back, with a little help from his friends 
</HEADLINE>

By DAVID BAUDER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Ringo Starr's name is enough to raise a smile.
	   There he is in your mind's eye, his Beatle haircut flapping as
he keeps the beat behind John, Paul and George. Jolly Ringo,
curator of the Octopus's Garden, who always got by with a little
help from his friends.
	   What's not to love?
	   But be honest _ the prospect of Ringo making a decent album at
this stage of his career was about as likely as Paul, George and
Ringo marching into Liverpool in their ``Sgt. Pepper'' suits.
	   Well, surprise. Ringo's new ``Vertical Man'' is his best work
since the ``Ringo'' album in 1973. Admittedly, that's not saying
much, and Starr's albums will never be accused of being works of
art. But the disc is a delightfully energetic trip down Memory, if
not Penny, Lane.
	   The secret, it seems, is pride.
	   Starr hides a real competitiveness behind his amiable nature and
almost cartoonish persona. He concedes he was ``really, really
hurt'' that his last album of original material in 1992 was barely
noticed.
	   Watching him bite into songs like ``Photograph,'' ``It Don't
Come Easy'' and ``Back Off Boogaloo'' during a recent taping of
VH1's ``Storytellers'' series, you sense the desire to remind
people of accomplishments that might otherwise have been forgotten.
	   ``I was the biggest seller after the breakup, at one point
there, which amazed not only everybody else but myself,'' he said
during an interview in a New York hotel suite. ``I was just really
cooking, as John said, cooking in the kitchen of love.''
	   Pride, too, led him to a recording that pointedly rights a
35-year wrong. Starr's new album contains a cover version of ``Love
Me Do,'' the Beatles' first single. Ringo sings and, yes, plays the
drums.
	   Beatles trivia experts know that producer George Martin replaced
Ringo with a session drummer when the single was originally
recorded, fearing the Beatle wasn't adept enough.
	   Starr subsequently laughed off the slight in countless
interviews but, yes, he was stung. ``For the last 35 years, I've
never let George Martin forget it,'' he said.
	   Packed with pop nuggets, ``Vertical Man'' recalls the spirit of
the ``Ringo'' album. It is similarly filled with guest stars,
including Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Aerosmith's Steven
Tyler, Alanis Morissette, Brian Wilson, Ozzy Osbourne and Scott
Weiland.
	   A remake of Dobie Gray's ``Drift Away'' finds the odd collection
of Tyler, Morissette and Starr trading verses.
	   Nobody, apparently, says no to Ringo.
	   ``I think there's the same amount of joy in this one that there
was in the `Ringo' album and it comes across,'' he said. ``I am
probably more comfortable on this album than I've been in a long
time. I feel I'm playing great, I'm singing better and I'm writing
the songs. They're directed in a way that I like to say things, and
that all helps.''
	   Like McCartney, Starr has come to realize the fruitlessness of
avoiding Beatles references in his music. Now he seems to revel in
them.
	   ``You can't say, `I can't use that because the Beatles did,'''
he said. ``Otherwise, you can't do anything. ... In my life or
Paul's life or George's life, whatever we do there's going to be
someone saying, `Oh, it's a bit like the Beatles.' Hey, too bad. We
are them.''
	   Starr doesn't hesitate to mine his solo work, too: the new
``King of Broken Hearts'' is similar to his bittersweet hit,
``Photograph.''
	   Producer Mark Hudson provided an enthusiastic foil and brought
Starr back to basics.
	   They recorded in a tiny Hollywood studio _ an office, really _
above a Chinese restaurant. Starr couldn't remember the last time
he recorded tracks live with all the musicians in the same room.
	   ``It was like Liverpool,'' he said. ``It was just the best
experience.''
	   The title ``Vertical Man'' is a sly reference to Starr's
successful effort to sober up a decade ago. If he had not done so,
he figures he would be a horizontal man by now. He has worked
steadily since then, writing songs, touring with his All-Starr Band
and preparing the anthology series with McCartney and Harrison.
	   A line from one of his songs simply explains why, at age 57, he
keeps working: ``My occupation is syncopation,'' he sings. ``When I
play it, it saves my life.''
	   ``Many people ask me the same question, 'You're loaded, you
don't have to do anything,''' he said. ``Would you stop if you won
the lottery? I'm not an electrician; I'm a musician and I do this.
I'm blessed that it's one of the things I'll be able to do as long
as I can hold the sticks or I can stand up in front of the
audience.''
	   He's hoping the continued interest in the Beatles, rekindled by
the anthology series, will benefit his solo career, too. It worked
for McCartney.
	   Starr, McCartney and Harrison have no plans for any more work
together. He has no regrets about the two songs they patched
together from old tapes left behind by John Lennon, even though
they disappointed many critics and fans and the process was tough
personally.
	   ``On my records we had Paul, George and John, but everyone was
separate,'' he said. ``Suddenly, the three of us were in the studio
with John's voice and it threw me for a loop at the beginning. But
you have to get over it and get on.
	   ``I'm glad we did it,'' he said. ``The three of us played
together again, if nothing else. We hung out with each other for a
while, which is always fine by me. I love those boys and I love
hanging out.''

Chilavert vs. Barthez put goalkeeper in the spotlight

Eds: WILL be UPDATED after match, scheduled for 1430 GMT kickoff.

<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Whoever thought all goalkeepers were the
same might want to pay attention to Sunday's second-round World Cup
match between France and Paraguay.
	   On one side stands Jose Luis Chilavert, an enigma who is more
famous than the rest of the Paraguayan team combined. Chilavert
already achieved one dream by producing sterling saves that has
turned the South American nation into the surprise team of the
World Cup so far.
	   One personal desire remains: scoring a World Cup goal. And with
Chilavert, that is not half as crazy as one might think. When he
says ``I'm the greatest,'' people listen.
	   On the other end stands Fabien Barthez, with a shaven head and
fiery, hypnotic eyes that could freeze an opposing striker at
point-blank range. He lives life at a heady pace.
	   He loves driving his Porsche at high speeds along France's rocky
Mediterranean coastline and has a love for cannabis that already
has earned him a two-month suspension last year.
	   Now, he is getting high on the World Cup and there is nothing
quite like a confrontation with the mighty Chilavert.
	   Chilavert has only allowed one goal in the so-called Group of
Death against Spain, Bulgaria and Nigeria. Barthez has only been
beaten on a penalty in three games.
	   Chilavert instills fear in any defense when he comes forward for
his famous free kicks. He also takes penalties for his team, and
already has four goals to his credit for Paraguay. He has even
scored on a 55-meter lob in the Argentinean league.
	   ``I want to score in the World Cup, but so far, it has been a
dream,'' he said.
	   Barthez said Chilavert should worry. If he stops one of
Chilavert's free kicks, the Paraguayan keeper will have a long
sprint while Barthez aims for the net at the other end for a unique
World Cup goal.
	   Whatever the case, both know about winning.
	   Barthez was just 21 when he won the European Champions' Cup with
Marseille in 1993.
	   Chilavert, 33, has won five league titles in Paraguay and
Argentina, the Copa Libertadores and the 1994 Toyota Cup title with
Velez Sarsfeld against AC Milan.
	   And don't cross his way when he is in a bad mood. His mouth is
almost as big as his hands and some 90 kilos (199 pounds) are
spread out over his 1.88-meter (6-foot-2) frame.
	   Earlier this month, he got into a fight with a journalist who
dared to criticize him.
	   He exudes leadership on the team.
	   ``He is a great personality,'' his coach Paulo Cesar Carpeggiani
said.
	   ``I just want to see him play,'' French defender Frank Leboeuf
said.

<TEXT>
	   EUGENE, Oregon (AP) _ Growing up in New York City, Dennis Greene
wanted to be a lawyer like Perry Mason on TV. Instead, he became a
rock 'n' roll star.
	   Through 15 years as lead singer of the 1950s revival group Sha
Na Na, Greene never forgot his boyhood aspirations or his Ivy
League education.
	   After the group's television show folded, he traded in his gold
lame suit for gray pinstripes and is now a law professor at the
University of Oregon.
	   ``Being a rock star was never something that was particularly
interesting to me,'' Greene says. ``It was a great job. I loved the
singing part. The byproducts, unfortunately, were exhausting _
travel, and the ongoing-forever politics of being in a businessI9s &Cx11; wnusual for thep1r	founding members of Sha Na Na, which has its
roots in an a cappella singing group at prestigious Columbia
University in New York. Two became physicians, two lawyers, one an
entrepreneur and four went into academia.
	   Only two are still in the latest incarnation of the group and
one is playing guitar in Nashville, Tennessee.
	   Just as performing ``Let's Go to the Hop'' at Woodstock never
swayed Greene from earning a degree in English from Columbia, his
current day job does not keep him from pursuing other interests.
	   This summer he is returning to Harlem with a video camera to
shoot the latest installment in a series of law review articles he
calls ``The Harlem Debates,'' written in a dramatic format with two
law professors meeting for lunch.
	   ``It will be, hopefully, the first law review article broadcast
over the Internet,'' he says.
	   Greene's life and career were always anything but ordinary.
	   His father was a postal worker and part-time actor who appeared
in commercials and movies in New York City. His mother taught
grammar school.
	   When Greene was a teen-ager, the family left Harlem for a
blue-collar Bronx neighborhood where, after a week of fistfights,
he found a way to fit in at a Catholic high school.
	   During his freshman year, Greene, who is black and played
basketball, was recruited to broaden the racial diversity at the
Hotchkiss School, an elite prep school in Connecticut.
	   Greene spent summers acting in a street theater group and sang
in an a cappella group. When he went to Columbia, he joined a
similar group called the Columbia Kingsmen.
	   Historically, the group had just two gigs a year: The Yule log
lighting ceremony at Barnard College, and the mental ward at St.
Luke's Hospital.
	   ``You were singing to older people and also to young guys who
were classmates sitting in bathrobes who had a bad trip,'' Greene
recalls. ``I will never forget having this bizarre experience
having an a cappella group singing 'Going Out of My Head' ... in a
mental ward.''
	   Breaking out of their traditional mold, they greased back their
hair, rolled up the sleeves on their T-shirts, and put on an oldies
show at the campus cafeteria. People liked it so much they added
costumes and instruments and called it ``The Glory That Was
Grease.''
	   The only one in the group with any formal dance training, Greene
did a lot of the choreography, devising moves that could be done by
guys who couldn't dance.
	   Joe Witkin, who played piano and went on to become an emergency
room physician in San Diego, had the only car in the group. Alan
Cooper, who sang bass and went on to teach the Bible at the Jewish
Theological Seminary in New York City, joined him and they drove
around Manhattan with a map of all the nightclubs. At the last one
on their list, Steve Paul's Scene, they got an audition.
	   ``Before we could get through the first song, the guy said, `OK,
you can start tonight. You get dlrs 50,''' Greene says. ``We had 12
guys being paid dlrs 50.''
	   Their gig there lasted just two weeks, but during that time they
got a record deal and bookings at Fillmore East and Woodstock.
	   After the movie ``Woodstock'' hit theaters, with Sha Na Na on
screen for 52 seconds doing ``Let's Go to the Hop,'' things started
to change. They got booked on ``The Tonight Show,'' ``Merv
Griffin'' and ``David Frost.''
	   Cooper was the first to leave the group, and was replaced by
another Columbia student, Jon ``Bauzer'' Bauman.
	   Greene stuck with the group through its television variety show,
from 1977 to 1980, and their appearance in the 1978 movie
``Grease,'' where he sang lead on ``Tears on My Pillow.''
	   He went on to earn a master's in education from Harvard
University in 1984, then moved on to Yale Law School, graduating in
1987.
	   From there he became a vice president at Columbia Pictures,
working on, among other projects, Spike Lee's 1990 film ``School
Daze.''
	   Greene was teaching a course on the entertainment industry at
City College of New York and performing a two-man play he had
written, ``Harlem Exchange,'' when a Yale classmate teaching at
Oregon's law school suggested he bring his play to Eugene and think
about teaching at the law school.
	   Now he is an assistant professor, teaching torts, entertainment
law and a course titled ``Law, Mass Media, and Race.''
	   At 49, his rock 'n' roll years are a footnote. But Greene says
they have taught him an important lesson about life's
uncertainties:
	   ``There's always a land beyond the river.''

World Cup: Japan bids early sayonara but takes home confidence 
</HEADLINE>
By YURI KAGEYAMA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Smart, unselfish teamwork. Impressive
defense that held powerhouses Gabriel Batistuta and Davor Suker to
just one goal each. And the cocky midfielder with the orange hair.
	   The Japanese brought all that and so much more to their first
World Cup.
	   Although eliminated in the first round, the team members say
they will go home with a confidence that is sure to enrich Japan's
soccer for years.
	   With respectable 1-0 losses to Argentina and Croatia, and a
first World Cup goal in a 2-1 loss to Jamaica in their finale
Friday, the players surprised even themselves.
	   But they definitely recognized a difference going against the
world-class players, who moved a little bit faster, tackled a
little bit harder and just seemed so much bigger.
	   ``The door to the world _ and the goal _ were far away,'' coach
Takeshi Okada said solemnly after the loss to Croatia that
virtually wiped out Japan's chances for advancing to the second
round.
	   ``Their bodies are built totally differently,'' said striker
Shoji Jo, who celebrated his 23rd birthday during the tournament.
	   Like the other young members of the team _ including 18-year-old
midfielder Shinji Ono and 21-year-old Hidetoshi Nakata with the
copper-dyed hair _ Jo is a sure candidate to return in 2002, when
the World Cup debuts in Asia with Japan and South Korea as
co-hosts.
	   The Japanese also brought to France '98 an enthusiastic,
easy-going bunch of supporters, who obviously would never dream of
hooliganism. They filled the stands with untiring cheers, chanting
the Japanese word for Japan, ``Nippon! Nippon!'' and jerseys of
navy blue.
	   If there had been a World Cup for fans, Japan would surely have
gone to the finals.
	   Many even had to quit their jobs because workaholic Japan still
frowns upon vacations.
	   More tragic were the thousands of victims of ticket fraud, who
were told the news hours before their flight or after their arrival
in France.
	   Toru Mishina, a 35-year-old computer company employee from
Tokyo, wandered through the streets of Nantes with his wife for two
days, holding up a sign in French asking for tickets to the
Japan-Croatia game.
	   He bought two tickets, at 5,000 francs (dlrs 1,000) each, and
thought they were worth every centime.
	   ``If Japan is going to play at the World Cup, I just have to see
it,'' he said.
	   What the fans and the world saw was a team that relied on finely
tuned group play to make up for the lack of individual size, power
and technique.
	   The assured passing in midfield, often led by Nakata, reflected
intelligence and discipline, if not dynamic flash.
	   When asked to identify his squad's strength, Okada answered
without hesitation that his players worked together as a team and
were not ego-maniacs out for their own glory _ hinting that Asian
group-oriented harmony may have some virtues over Western
individualism.
	   Defender Naoki Soma, who made a key pass that led to Masashi
Nakayama's goal in the final game, believes that his soccer
expresses Japanese culture. And he's proud of it.
	   ``We can win with our own culture. We don't have to imitate
other styles of soccer. We have our own way of being creative,'' he
said. ``And we have other good qualities, like teamwork, our
ability to carry out play without fail, our organizational power.
	   ``There isn't that much difference in ability between us and
them. All we have to do is win in the future,'' Soma said.
	   ``I don't think they were able to come and crush us,'' said
Nakayama, the forward who drove in Japan's solitary World Cup goal.
``It's not that we didn't have a chance. We lost _ that was the
difference.''

	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) _ Cracks line the Virgin Mary's weathered
granite face as she gazes down, scarred arms at her side and grainy
palms up. She is guarding a grave as she has done since the late
1800s.
	   Nearby, 2-foot (60-centimeter) stone sculptures depicting Christ
or a winged cherub stand sentinel for families entombed in 8-foot
(2.4-meter) vaults, built above ground because New Orleans lies
below sea level, too wet for traditional graves.
	   Walk a little farther, however, and the landscape changes.
	   An iron cross is missing from atop a marble vault. Gone also are
urns, angels and fancy iron fences that adorned other tombs in New
Orleans' historic cemeteries known as ``The Cities of the Dead.''
	   The artifacts have been stolen, and the crimes are not minor.
About dlrs 500,000 worth of stolen property has been recovered just
since May. Three men accused of stealing are in custody, and more
arrests are expected.
	   Cemetery thefts have been reported from Philadelphia to
Savannah, Georgia. A flea market in California offered goods
described as coming from New Orleans tombs.
	   ``I don't know any cemetery art that's legitimately for sale,''
says Meg Winslow, curator of a Cambridge, Massachusetts, cemetery
robbed of its gates last year.
	   Carved in elaborate architectural detail and laid out along
twisting lanes, the New Orleans tombs form whitewashed
neighborhoods. In some cases, stairs and doors lead visitors into
the vaults.
	   Lucille Prima still remembers the rush of grief that struck her
on a rainy day when she visited her family tomb on the first
anniversary of her 14-year-old grandson's death.
	   The two pink and white Italian marble statues were missing. For
almost a century the nearly life-size sculptures of women holding a
garland of roses had stood at the grave.
	   ``I'll never forget that day,'' Mrs. Prima says, her voice
cracking. ``It was already so sad. My husband and I were going to
the cemetery to visit Michael and then we were going to go to
church. I just stood in the rain in shock when I saw it.''
	   More than in many cities, cemeteries in New Orleans have become
tourist attractions.
	   ``They're truly outdoor museums,'' says Patty Lee St. Martin of
New Orleans. She and her husband, Armand, along with friend Tom
Bate, founded the National Cemetery Conservation Foundation and
pushed for a probe into the thefts.
	   She adds: ``Because of their uniqueness they're vulnerable.''
	   The thieves' targets, religious-theme objects, have become known
as ``cemetery chic.'' They are coveted for private gardens and
swimming pool patios.
	   ``Cemetery imagery is very popular. People love the old,
weathered statues. They love the metal crosses to hang on a wall,''
says Steven Hale, a designer with Ashley Hall Interiors Ltd., in
New Orleans. The firm does not deal in such objects, he says.
	   Antiques dealers say some of the works are fakes made in Mexico,
but more often they're real.
	   ``The thieves, the addicts ... they take vases all the time, but
we're also losing iron benches and gates,'' says Mike Giglio, whose
family plot in New Orleans was stripped of a 150-year-old statue of
the Virgin Mary.
	   Last year, he says, thieves trying to steal two firmly cemented
urns snapped them off at their bases instead.
	   ``This is our heritage. There's no difference between someone
going into the French Quarter or Garden District and stealing some
of the gingerbread off of a house than someone going into a
cemetery and taking pieces of our graves,'' says New Orleans
councilwoman Suzanne Haik-Terrell, whose district includes a
majority of the city's grave sites.
	   ``Our history's being torn apart for people's enhancements.''
	   Bate, a New Orleans native now living in Los Angeles, walked
through a California flea market earlier this year and noticed
marble sculptures and urns with price tags in the thousands. They
were being hawked as goods from historic New Orleans cemeteries.
	   Bate suspected the items were stolen and alerted Los Angeles
police, who are investigating. Then, with the help of the St.
Martins, he got an investigation going in Louisiana.
	   New Orleans police arrested three men and recovered dlrs 500,000
worth of cemetery ornaments.
	   The owner of a French Quarter antiques gallery also is under
investigation: stolen items were discovered in his shop. Other
items were recovered from private residences and from shops in
Mississippi.
	   Mrs. St. Martin praises New Orleans police for a quick response.
``Before we got involved, they told us they didn't even know this
was a problem.''
	   Now, according to Detective Lawrence Green, some dealers and
private citizens are surrendering cemetery pieces.
	   ``We're getting calls from people every day who want to turn in
stuff. I think guilt is starting to get to people,'' he says.
	   Recovered artifacts are stored in a warehouse as evidence, and
Green says police plan an open house for people to reclaim their
property.
	   ``If they say it's theirs we'll take the process a step further,
probably bring the item to the tomb, measure the base and do other
things to make sure,'' he says.
	   Police found some of the statues that had been removed from
plots owned by Mrs. Prima and Giglio.
	   ``At least we have resolved our problem,'' Giglio says, ``but
there are so many others out there who are still waiting for some
good news.''

Judy Garland's star is reborn on the Internet

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Fans who observed the 29th anniversary of Judy
Garland's death on June 22 didn't have to travel any farther than
their own Internet connection to pay their respects.
	   On one of numerous Web sites devoted to Garland
(www.zianet.com/chrisb), an admirer has posted a color photograph
of the singer's crypt in Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York,
for anyone wishing ``to stand in silence in front of Judy's
grave.''
	   Celebrity grave sites online are not uncommon. But the number of
elaborate, fan-generated Web sites dedicated to Garland so many
years after her death is somewhat remarkable. Her Web presence
dwarfs that of many contemporary artists, including her daughter,
52-year-old entertainer Liza Minnelli.
	   ``I was really impressed,'' said Andy Gems, a professional
Internet surfer employed by the Web directory Yahoo! ``She's a star
from a different era, and her sites are of way higher quality than
a lot of the stuff I see for rock bands and current actors and
actresses.''
	   A broad search of her name calls up hundreds of pages, but Gems
said the 15 core sites linked through a Garland Web ring are
notable for their sophisticated design, breadth of information and
intricate multimedia links.
	   Surfers can find out about the 23rd Annual Judy Garland Festival
in her birthplace of Grand Rapids, Minnesota, on June 25. Or they
can investigate her extensive and varied film career _ from the
treacly 1930s films with Mickey Rooney and lavish 1940s musicals of
Hollywood's Golden Era (``Meet Me in St. Louis,'' ``Easter
Parade'') to her critically acclaimed dramatic roles, including an
Oscar-nominated performance in 1961's ``Judgment at Nuremberg.''
	   Music samplings are clickable from a recording career that
spanned four decades and included such standards as ``You Made Me
Love You,'' ``Get Happy'' and ``The Man That Got Away.''
	   On several sites, collectors display, trade and sell memorabilia
such as photos, movie posters, photographs, autographs and videos
of her early 1960s TV variety show.
	   Information in some of the deeper links can be bizarrely
idiosyncratic: from noted typos in her 1922 birth announcement to
the fact that she is buried in the same cemetery as Malcolm X.
	   Discussions on Garland-related bulletin boards can get so
intense that her daughter, Lorna Luft, 45, told the Miami Herald
last month that some surfers should ``get a life.''
	   Still, the Web ring's title page touts a required G rating for
its member sites because they are frequented ``by a wide cross
section of people, including children.''
	   ``My 10-year-old daughter is mad for Judy,'' said one posting
from a 37-year-old Connecticut man.
	   ``I found my mom's old Judy albums in the basement. Her music is
timeless,'' said another from a 30-ish Ohio mother.
	   Mark Harris, manager/Web master of The Judy List, a daily e-mail
discussion about Garland launched in 1996, said many of its more
than 250 subscribers are younger than 16.
	   ``Judy seems to be a particular favorite with teen-age girls
these days, presumably because they identify with her early film
work,'' Harris said, adding that one subscriber is ``a prototypical
rock 'n' roller in his early 20s,'' fascinated by her vocal
technique.
	   Camille Paglia, a cultural critic and humanities professor at
the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, said the youthful
interest in Garland springs as much from a curiosity about American
popular music as from yearly TV broadcasts in the United States of
``The Wizard of Oz.''
	   ``We're living in an era where style is defined by irony and a
sense of detachment,'' Paglia said. ``Artists like Judy Garland
offer something young people aren't getting from their rock stars _
the pure, organic voice and a sense of emotional intimacy.''
	   Paglia said that in terms of artistic achievement, through film,
television, radio, concerts and song styling, Garland is the late
Frank Sinatra's only peer, though he lived nearly twice as long.
	   John Fricke, a Garland biographer who contributes to the Judy
Garland Database, is glad that few pages mention the drug-addled
antics often associated with her personal life and later concerts.
	   Fricke views the Web as a means for older fans like himself, who
saw Garland perform live, to broaden an appreciation of her
artistry among younger fans. ``The Internet leads them to her body
of work, instead of the legend that is inaccurately permeated with
a sense of tragedy,'' he said. (Garland died at age 47 of a drug
overdose.)
	   However, Garland's re-emergence isn't limited to the Web.
	   EMI Capitol Records just released a CD anthology, ``Judy
Garland,'' in conjunction with the A and E Network's ``Biography''
cable show. A two-hour telecast on Garland that aired in March 1997
and again this year drew high audience ratings.
	   ``There's been a whole resurgence of interest in American
popular music among college students and 30- to 40-year-olds,''
said Marc Rashba, producer of EMI's ``Biography''-related CD
anthologies. ``This CD is definitely being targeted to that
audience.''
	   In addition, ``Me and My Shadows,'' a new book about Garland by
Ms. Luft, will be the basis of a TV miniseries scheduled to air
next year.
	   In a New York Times essay previewing a recent sold-out,
two-night musical tribute to Garland at Carnegie Hall, Paglia
assessed this decade's entertainers and wailed, ``Where among
today's young ... will we get another Judy Garland?''
	   No one really can say, but young people know where to look for
the lady herself: on the Internet, the equivalent of their own back
yard.

Five questions with Joaquin Cortes: Flamenco star creates his own style of dance 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ As dance sensation Joaquin Cortes nears the end
of his frenetic flamenco performance in ``Gipsy Passion,'' his face
and bare chest dripping with sweat, you can tell he's on the edge
of exhaustion.
	   Yet, perhaps inspired by applause and awe of the audience, his
feet keep moving, stomping in a staccato rhythm that hypnotizes
those watching it. It is this kind of performance that has earned
the 29-year-old Spaniard worldwide fame and success. His dark good
looks only add to his allure.
	   Recently, Giorgio Armani, who designs the elegant costumes for
Cortes' show, and Oscar-winning actress Mira Sorvino, hosted the
opening performance of Cortes' week-long run at City Center. The
performance was a benefit for the National Alliance of Breast
Cancer Organizations. Rosie Perez, Sandra Bernhard, Gregory Hines
and Ed Bradley were among the celebrities in attendance.
	   Not everyone is a fan of this Latin dancer, whose performances
combine flamenco, the ancient dance of the Spanish gypsies, with
modern dance and ballet.
	   Yet Cortes, who was a member of Spain's National Ballet, takes
it all in stride.
	   ``When you try to do something different ... normally people are
against new things, like the new ideas. The critics, they are
normally very traditional,'' he said through a translator. ``But
this happens normally in the beginning. With the work, they can see
that that is the only way to do something new. At the beginning
it's (negative). But after two years, they clap.''
	   Cortes, who has performed with his own dance company for the
past three years, is expected to take his show to France in July.
	   1: Your show is so physically demanding. How do you maintain
your stamina?
	   Cortes: With a lot of discipline. Normally I dance seven or
eight hours a day. It's the only way I can keep in shape for
dancing.
	   2: You were trained in modern dance and classical. Why did you
concentrate on flamenco?
	   Cortes: I believe in the fusion between different styles of
dancing and music, and the last four years, I've been working very
hard in fusion. I started when I was 12 years old and I learned in
different styles and cultures.
	   3: Why did you create your own dance company?
	   Cortes: This is a dream of all dancers in the world, to have
their own company and create their own style, and I was always
thinking about that from the beginning. I was dancing in the
National Ballet, and when I was almost 20 years old, I decided to
create my own company.
	   4: How hard is it to be a choreographer and director?
	   Cortes: It's very difficult. But I'm always looking ahead and I
was learning to do all these things. In life, you have to fight for
everything, and I was fighting how to learn to be a good dancer,
choreographer and have my own company. I mean, you have to do it.
	   5: You are considering taking time off and living in the United
States for a while. Why?
	   Cortes: I want to learn and here you have a lot of options, you
have a lot of possibilities. You have theaters, you have ballet
companies. And I have to learn English, of course. And I want to
learn acting. I feel now that I'm almost 30 years old, it is a new
period in my life. I can feel the changes that are coming. I want
to do different things in the future.
	   5 1-2 : Are you trying to learn English?
	   Cortes: In one month in New York, I will learn.

	   In the spotlight: Deborah Harry, platinum punk queen
	   Born: July 1, 1945, in Miami.
	   Personal stats: Deborah Harry was adopted at the age of 3 months
by Richard and Catherine Harry and grew up in Hawthorne, New
Jersey. As a teen-ager, Harry says, ``I used to dress in black
every day and pretend to be tough.'' Before her musical career took
off, she worked in various odd jobs, including as a beautician and
a Playboy bunny waitress.
	   Musical background: Harry recorded backup vocals with The Wind
in the Willows, a folk-rock group. She later became a lead singer
with another group, the Stilettos, a glitter-rock band.
	   Pivotal moment: Hooking up with guitarist Chris Stein in October
1973 after hanging around at CBGBs, a New York City club considered
the birthplace of punk music in the United States. Harry and Stein
chose the band name Blondie because Harry's bleached-blond hair.
	   First hit single: ``Denis,'' a pop-punk remake of the 1963 hit
``Denise,'' hit the No. 2 spot on the British charts in 1978.
Singing in a torn swimsuit and high heels, Harry adopted the vacant
glamour poses of a platinum blonde with just the right amount of
self satire. Other hits followed, including ``Heart of Glass,''
``Call Me,'' ``The Tide Is High'' and ``Rapture.''
	   After the group split up in the early 1980s, Harry withdrew from
most of the entertainment world for three years to look after
Stein, who had become seriously ill.
	   Solo career: Harry hit the British charts in December 1986 with
``French Kissin' (in the USA).'' Her seductive album, ``Def, Dumb
and Blonde,'' released in 1989, did well in the United States. She
released her second solo album, ``Debravation,'' in 1993.
	   She was one of 12 vocalists on the ``No Talking Just Head''
album with the Talking Heads. She's also worked with the Jazz
Passengers, most recently on the 1997 album, ``Individually
Twisted.''
	   Don't forget: Harry is also an actress. She's appeared in
``Union City,'' ``Videodrome,'' ``Hairspray'' and ``Heavy.''
	   Notable quote: ``Stardom was always very attractive to me. I
don't know if I believe in total destiny, but I always felt that I
had the potential to do something, but I didn't know exactly what
it was.''

Serbs, KLA rebels locked in new Kosovo standoff at Kijevo 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous
By ADAM BROWN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A dangerous standoff at a crossroads
village in the center of the secessionist province of Kosovo has
become the focus of international negotiators, who fear it could
ignite all-out war in the region.
	   Ethnic Albanian guerrillas maintained an armed ring around
Kijevo and continued to rebuff demands Saturday that they end their
10-day siege of the strategic village, located southwest of the
provincial capital of Pristina on one of Kosovo's two main roads.
	   Serbian forces reportedly flew in food and supplies and
evacuated four women and a child. But Western diplomats and
Albanian sources reported an army buildup that could signal
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is poised for another
crackdown.
	   ``We are only a few steps away from a general war'' in Kosovo,
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke said at a forum of political and
economic leaders in Switzerland.
	   ``If he (Milosevic) opened the checkpoint at Kijevo by force,
there would be tremendous bloodshed and you would know about Kijevo
as a place that could have triggered a wider war,'' he said.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in
Kosovo since security forces launched an operation on Feb. 28 to
try to extinguish growing resistance by secessionist militants in
predominantly Albanian Kosovo. Some 80 people, mostly civilians,
died in that crackdown, and dozens more in another campaign
launched in late May.
	   Kijevo has emerged as a possible site of what diplomats fear
will be a third deadly offensive.
	   An influential ethnic Albanian politician, Adem Demaci, said he
was asked by Holbrooke to mediate with the Albanian militants to
break the Kijevo impasse, but his efforts produced no visible
results.
	   According to TV Tirana in neighboring Albania, the rebels said
they would let the Serbs go from Kijevo if the police and Yugoslav
army withdraw from three vital positions in the area west of
Pristina.
	   The KLA claims to control 30 percent to 40 percent of the
province of Serbia, the dominant republic in what is left of
Yugoslavia. They enjoy increasing support among the 90 percent
majority Albanians in Kosovo's population of 2.2 million.
	   The latest evidence that Kosovo Albanians favor a more radical
solution to their quest for independence than diplomacy came
Saturday, when several top politicians founded a new movement
intended to serve as the KLA's political wing.
	   A third of the group was once loyal to Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova, including his former top aide Hidajet Hiseni and prominent
activist Rexhep Qosja, who helped found the Albanian Democratic
Movement with the aim of uniting radicals.
	   Rugova favors a pacifist approach to gain independence.
	   ``Albanians in Kosovo can now be proud that our sons on the
ground defend their people and fight for a Kosovo where Albanians
would no longer be prosecuted but can decide themselves about their
destiny,'' Qosja said at the founding convention in Pristina.
	   Holbrooke renewed his plea for a diplomatic solution.
	   ``The search for a peaceful solution to the Kosovo problem is
indispensable to the West,'' he said in Crans Montana, Switzerland.
	   ``If we fail, and the situation spirals out of control into a
general war across international borders, affecting Albania,
Macedonia and other countries, perhaps Greece, the danger to
European stability will be even greater than it was in Bosnia.''

Hollywood hopes more of its movies will follow Clinton to China AP Entertainment Writer 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photo NY385
By MICHAEL FLEEMAN
<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ She's strong and resourceful enough to repel
the ferocious Huns and save China. But does Mulan have what it
takes to invade China's movie theaters?
	   China, one of the world's biggest potential movie markets,
accepts only 10 American films a year, and Disney's animated
feature, one of the most China-friendly films out of Hollywood in
years, isn't one of them _ yet.
	   ``Embassy officials have looked at it, and it was a positive
reaction,'' said Disney spokesman John Dreyer. ``So we are
cautiously optimistic. This is a decision the Chinese will have to
make.''
	   An official in the Chinese Cultural Office in Washington, D.C.,
confirmed that a lot of people liked it, but he said he had not
heard from Beijing as to whether ``Mulan'' would be approved for
distribution in China.
	   This marks a sharp change from 18 months ago, when Disney and
China were close to an international incident over ``Kundun,'' a
film about the Chinese occupation of Tibet, with China threatening
to rein in Disney's Chinese business dealings.
	   As President Bill Clinton visits China, Hollywood is on a major
push to persuade the country to accept more American movies,
walking a fine line between stroking the Chinese and making
promises it can't keep about U.S. film content.
	   With a population of 1.2 billion, China is considered among the
last untapped regions for the globally minded American studios,
which can derive about half their movie revenue outside the United
States.
	   Clinton has assured industry lobbyists he'll take up the matter
in meetings with Chinese officials. But it will be no easy task.
The Chinese screening process for movies is secretive and
intertwined with politics. And, as the ``Kundun'' episode and other
flare-ups have shown, China continues to bristle over U.S. films
critical of its policies.
	   But the payoff is so potentially big that Hollywood can't stop
methodically trying to break through. ``Titanic,'' one of the few
American films to be shown in China, has become a major hit,
grossing dlrs 41.4 million through June, a fortune considering the
paucity _ and quality _ of China's theaters.
	   ``I think a lot will depend on President Clinton's visit,'' said
Hollywood's top lobbyist, Jack Valenti, president of the Motion
Picture Association of America. ``He understands that I'm taking a
go-slow method, willing to be patient, and not saying: Knock this
wall down.''
	   Valenti's travel schedule would suggest otherwise. He has
visited China twice in the last year and has another trip planned
before the end of December.
	   Yet he says his talks with China's minister of culture and
minister of film, television and radio remain low-key, aimed at
gradually increasing the number of U.S. films over the next two
years.
	   In exchange, Valenti pledged to try to distribute more Chinese
films in the United States, set up Chinese film festivals in this
country, and provide movie industry training to the Chinese.
	   ``In general, we'd do all we can to promote indigenous Chinese
films,'' he said.
	   But Valenti's diplomacy is one thing and the fickle tastes of
American audiences are another.
	   Yet the biggest roadblock to expanding film trade with China has
been Chinese complaints about such U.S. films as last year's
``Kundun,'' ``Red Corner'' and ``Seven Years in Tibet,'' all
sharply critical of Chinese government policies on human rights,
artistic freedom and the Chinese presence in Tibet.
	   It didn't help Hollywood's case that Chinese President Jiang
Zemin toured Southern California last year just as billboards went
up for Richard Gere's ``Red Corner,'' about an American businessman
caught in China's legal system. Part of the movie's set depicting
Beijing back streets even remained in a field below one of the
offices Jiang visited.
	   And in April, the Chinese government sent a letter of protest to
the Washington International Film Festival demanding that it
withdraw a low-budget independent film, ``Windhorse,'' about the
resistance movement in Tibet.
	   The movie, according to the letter from Li Gang,
minister-counselor for cultural affairs at the Chinese Embassy,
depicted a ``completely false'' view of Tibet and ``its intention
is obviously to smear China's policies toward Tibet.'' Some scenes
in the film were clandestinely shot on location with a small
camera.
	   The local film festival didn't pull the movie, made by Academy
Award-winning short-subject documentarian Paul Wagner, but the
fallout from the protest continues. At the time of the festival,
Wagner didn't have a distributor lined up, and now he fears that
companies will bypass his film to avoid offending the Chinese.

LOS ANGELES: the Chinese.

	   ``It's having an effect on our ability to get the film out to
the public, not in China where we never thought it would be shown
anyway _ except clandestinely _ but around the world,'' said
Wagner. ``It's very frustrating.''
	   Still, Wagner is hopeful that efforts like those by Clinton and
Valenti will succeed.
	   ``I do think there's a (scenario) in which the economic freedoms
can lead to broader political freedoms for the Chinese people and
people outside China like myself,'' he said. ``Maybe I'm naive.
Maybe I'm too conservative for certain parts of the pro-Tibet
movement, but I think the situation can improve. I think it's worth
trying to approach it from the economic angle.''
	   Away from movie distribution, Hollywood already has made inroads
into China.
	   Sensing a slight thaw in its relations with the country, Disney
recently showed that it wants to further expand in China by
creating an executive position to coordinate all Chinese dealings.
And Universal Studios has announced plans for a large
entertainment-retail complex in Beijing.
	   On a smaller scale, independent producers also are sensing
opportunities in China. American Peter Shiao mounted a joint
production with the country to make the romantic comedy
``Restless,'' about young American and Chinese people living _ and
loving _ in China. The film was partly shot on location in Beijing.
	   The film is not overtly political and doesn't touch on the
hot-button issues of human rights and Tibet, but it doesn't shy
away from difficult subjects, including mixed ethnic dating. Unlike
``Mulan,'' this film has already been approved for distribution in
China.
	   ``The Chinese are open to issues of controversy,'' said Shiao, a
former political aide to Los Angeles and California lawmakers.
``I'm happy to present a more correct face of modern-day Chinese.
It's not as sinister as people would want to think. It's not
perfect, but it's certainly not evil.''

	   ADANA, Turkey (AP) _ An earthquake that rattled this southern
city has killed at least 108 people and injured about 1,000, news
reports and witnesses said.
	   Among those killed Saturday were 37 people who lived in the
slums of Adana, a city of 1 million, said Deputy Gov. Ardahan
Totuk. At least 30 people were reported dead in the nearby town of
Ceyhan, site of an oil terminal, the Anatolia news agency said.
	   Turkey's state radio said 107 people had been killed, and
rescuers later pulled at least one more body from a collapsed
building. The number of injured had reached about 1,000, said Gov.
Oguz Koksal.
	   Etem Zerenturk, 47, said he lost three relatives in one of the
buildings that collapsed.
	   ``I got shocked when I heard that they were inside. They were so
young,'' he said.
	   The quake struck at 16:56 p.m. (1356 GMT) and had a preliminary
magnitude of 6.3, according to Istanbul's Kandilli observatory. The
U.S. Geological Survey put the preliminary magnitude at 6.2 and
said the quake rattled the neighboring provinces of Mersin, Nigde
and Kayseri, as well as the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, off
Turkey's southern coast.
	   According to an announcement from the headquarters of the U.S.
Air Forces in Europe, 25 people at Incirlik air base sustained
minor injuries. The announcement did not say how many were U.S.
nationals.
	   But a U.S. Embassy spokesperson, speaking on condition of
anonymity, told The Associated Press that a dozen U.S. citizens
were lightly injured by falling objects.
	   The brief U.S. statement also said the earthquake caused
substantial structural and electrical damage to buildings on base.
Because the phone lines were knocked out in the quake, it was
impossible to call the base directly for further details.
	   The temblor knocked out power to most of Adana. It was not clear
whether the oil pipeline linking Iraq to Turkey had suffered any
damage.
	   Private NTV television said thousands of people fled their homes
in panic. Slum areas with poorly constructed buildings were the
hardest hit. The quake shattered windows and caused cracks in
several buildings, as well as damaging some mosques.
	   In the port city of Mersin, about 20 people were treated for
shock, Nedim Ince, a doctor at the state hospital, told NTV.
	   ``I felt a tremendous shake,'' said Ince. ``It was something
fearful.''
	   The Turkish Red Crescent, the Muslim equivalent of the Red
Cross, was setting up tents. Hospital beds were placed in the
streets and calls were made for blood donations.
	   Authorities cut power in Adana and Mersin to prevent fires and
advised people to spend the night outside their homes, anticipating
aftershocks. In some areas, people were trying to sleep in the
streets.
	   Adana, where the quake was centered, is only 20 kilometers (10
miles) from Incirlik, which serves as a staging ground for some 45
U.S. and British jets that patrol a no-fly zone above the 36th
parallel in northern Iraq. Some 1,400 personnel are part of the
mission.
	   Much of Turkey sits atop the Anatolian fault and quakes are
relatively frequent in the country.

	   ``Imagination'' (Giant) _ Brian Wilson
	   ``Imagination'' is being touted as the comeback of the tortured
genius, a masterwork along the lines of ``Pet Sounds.'' That's
smart marketing, if not entirely accurate. The fact is,
``Imagination'' has its weak spots.
	   But much of the time, Brian Wilson's new album soars on layers
of breathtaking vocals, giddy pop hooks and the occasional moment
of introspective songwriting. You don't need to be a Beach Boys fan
to want to crank this one through your car's stereo, roll down the
windows and cruise.

	   ``VH1 Storytellers'' (American/Columbia) _ Johnny Cash and
Willie Nelson
	   Before it went uptown and added sequins and rhinestones, before
it lost its soul in the corporate offices of Nashville, this was
country music: a couple of friends sitting around swapping stories
and songs, playing for the sheer joy of it. In the case of ``VH1
Storytellers,'' the two friends happen to be among the giants, so
it is a pleasure to be able to listen as they tell tales and play
some of their classic songs.
	   Credit VH1 with making it happen and the rejuvenated American
label for making it into an album: just Johnny Cash and Willie
Nelson and a small studio audience for what Cash likens to ``a
guitar pull at my house.'' The informal feel extends to the song
selection as well, with Cash at one point urging Nelson, ``You
gotta play 'Always on My Mind.''' (Willie obliges.)

	   ``How I Feel'' (Mercury) _ Terri Clark
	   Sure, she wears a hat just like the guys on the mainstream
country circuit. And Terri Clark isn't really edgy enough for the
alt-country types to embrace. But for Nashville, this is pretty
darn good.
	   Clark has a pure country voice, and doesn't mess with lush
arrangements, instead using pedal steel, fiddle and guitars. ``How
I Feel'' is mainstream country the way it was meant to be.

Fogerty reclaims his heritage, roaring through a bunch of CCR's
best swamp-rockers. Fogerty's in fine form here, and as a bonus you
get several songs from his solo career.

	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Version 2.0'' (Almo) _ Garbage
	   To ask Garbage to repeat the artistry of their groundbreaking
1995 debut would be asking a bit too much. Still, we do and are
destined for disappointment.
	   Such is the nature of the band's sophomore effort, ``Version
2.0''
	   Garbage started out as an experiment. Super producer Butch Vig
taking bits and pieces of songs and creating pop art in the studio.
He landed Scot Shirley Manson as his lead singer and she infused
the music with inspired lyrics, dissecting her psyche on such
stellar songs as ``Stupid Girl'' and ``Milk.''
	   It appeared Vig _ who had helped mold Nirvana and Smashing
Pumpkins _ may have reinvented rock yet again.
	   Well, ``Version 2.0'' brings this band back to Earth. Rather
than creating musical collages, Garbage seems to fall more than
once into a rave, club-mix sound, as in ``Hammering in My Head''
and ``Dumb.''
	   On other tunes it appears Garbage is conscious of trying to
re-create their complicated sound on stage. There is no overall
theme connecting these songs unlike the first album.
	   Still, as modern music, ``Version 2.0'' could do far worse. ``I
Think I'm Paranoid'' is the kind of chord-crunching time-changer
that is Garbage's calling card. The quartet gives a wink and a nod
to Chrissie Hynde on ``Special,'' and ``Medication'' rivals
``Milk'' as the band's most beautiful tune of despair.

	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Never Say Never'' (Atlantic) _ Brandy
	   When we were first introduced to Brandy on her self-entitled
debut, the then 15-year-old singer charmed us with her childlike
yet substantial pipes and her bubble-gum tunes. Now, four years and
4 million album sales later, rhythm and blues' young princess faces
a considerable challenge as she tries to make the leap from child
protege to serious adult singer.
	   Luckily, Brandy has talent and good production on her side. On
her sophomore effort, ``Never Say Never,'' the 19-year-old displays
a deeper voice with a broader range, capable of conveying more
intense emotions. She has also utilized producers who have chosen
to pair Brandy's singing with seductive, midtempo beats that add to
a more mature sound.
	   As for the material, there are more songs about relationships
and conflicts. ``The Boy Is Mine'' is a duet with fellow teen
singer Monica in which Brandy and Monica duke it out for the
affections of a boy. Brandy muses about a lover who doesn't
appreciate all she's given him on ``Almost Doesn't Count.''
	   Still, even with the more adult flavor and sensual overtones,
Brandy doesn't try to break her innocent girl image. Even Mase's
cameo appearance on ``Top of the World'''' is tame for the Bad Boy
rapper.
	   Brandy shouldn't lose any listeners with her new style _ only
gain new ones.

Trimble on top _ barely _ of Northern Ireland's new compromise Assembly 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Ulster Unionist Party leader
David Trimble is the firm favorite to become prime minister of
Northern Ireland's new cross-community government following the
election of a new Belfast Assembly.
	   But Trimble wasn't celebrating his rising political star,
because the results from Thursday's election to the 108-seat
Assembly _ the foundation for April's wider political agreement
among eight parties _ look too close for comfort.
	   His pro-British Protestant party, bitterly split over his
support for the accord, won 28 seats when the final result was
declared late Saturday.
	   To his disappointment, exactly the same number of anti-agreement
Protestants will be ranged against him inside the Assembly, where
majorities in both Protestant and Catholic camps will be required
to pass key aspects of the agreement.
	   While Trimble can also rely on support from two elected members
of the Progressive Unionists _ ironically, a pair of paroled
ex-terrorists now committed to peace _ he will have to watch his
back as never before.
	   At least four of the newly elected Ulster Unionists are outright
critics of the agreement, and could obstruct parts of the accord
they don't like by voting with the Assembly's Protestant
anti-agreement bloc led by Ian Paisley.
	   Trimble appealed to his party to stop ``inflicting damage on
itself by squabbling in public'' over the merits of the accord,
which he defends as securing Northern Ireland's union with Britain.
	   ``I don't have any baseball bats with nails in them to deal with
dissidents,'' Trimble said. ``We must have self-discipline within
the party.''
	   The Assembly meets for the first time Wednesday, and the first
order of business will be to elect a ``first minister'' to head a
multiparty administration, called the Executive. Most Assembly
members expect Trimble to get the job.
	   Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam, whose
governor-style powers would mostly be transferred to the Executive
next year if the plan succeeds, said ``the results mean that we're
going to have an Assembly that will work.''
	   But to the alarm of many Protestants, this new 12-member
Executive will be required to cooperate with the neighboring Irish
Republic _ and include members of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party.
	   Foreseeing that many Protestants would want to block these
developments, the April agreement contained a ``self-destruct''
clause for the Assembly.
	   It specified that if the Assembly hadn't appointed an Executive
and drawn up rules for liaising with the Irish government by
October, the British government would reserve the right to abolish
the Assembly, just as it did to Northern Ireland's last local
parliament in 1972.
	   The Assembly election also produced a 42-strong Catholic bloc
united in its support for the agreement. Among the Catholics' most
immediate demands is that Protestant Orange Order parades, an
annual summertime tradition in Northern Ireland, be rerouted if
they go through or near hostile Catholic areas.
	   That issue has sparked widespread rioting for the past two
summers. And Saturday, even as the last ballots were being counted,
riot police scuffled with Catholic protesters as they tried, and
failed, to block an Orange march on the edge of Catholic west
Belfast.
	   Trimble, a 53-year-old former law lecturer, was elected Ulster
Unionist leader in 1995 after championing the rights of Orangemen
to march in Portadown, where Northern Ireland's most inflammatory
parade is scheduled for July 5.
	   The major Catholic-supported party, the moderate Social
Democratic and Labor Party, got more first-preference votes than
the Ulster Unionists for the first time in Northern Ireland history
and won 24 seats.
	   The SDLP leader, John Hume, stressed that he wanted to work ``in
partnership'' with Trimble ``and bring our divided people together
by spilling our sweat together, not our blood.''
	   Sinn Fein, which won 18 seats with its best-ever share of the
vote, 17.6 percent, expects to receive two seats in the new
administration. But this could turn into the Assembly's first
running fight.
	   The agreement specified that the Irish Republican Army as well
as two pro-British paramilitary groups, the Ulster Defense
Association and Ulster Volunteer Force, should disarm by mid-2000.
	   Trimble insists he won't even talk to Sinn Fein leaders, much
less support their inclusion in the Executive, unless the IRA
starts disarming first, something that IRA commanders insist they
will not do.

At the Movies: 'Dr. Dolittle' 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: film opened Friday
By BOB THOMAS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In 1967, Twentieth Century Fox released an
overproduced version of ``Dr. Dolittle,'' complete with Rex
Harrison talk-singing highly forgettable songs (except for ``Talk
to the Animals,'' an Oscar winner). Even little children didn't
like the movie.
	   Now Fox is offering another ``Dr. Dolittle,'' which bears even
less resemblance to the charming Hugh Lofting stories parents have
read to their children for generations. The film was obviously
tailored to the extraordinary comedic talent of Eddie Murphy, who
gives one of his less manic performances.
	   Dr. John Dolittle (Murphy) enjoys a busy practice as a
physician, has a loving wife (Kristin Wilson) and two young
daughters. He and his partners are on the verge of consummating a
big-money deal to be taken over by a giant HMO. His money-mad
fellow physician (Oliver Pratt) is pushing hard to finalize the
contract.
	   Then something peculiar happens.
	   Daydreaming, Dolittle hits something while driving. He looks
back and to his horror sees a dog lying in the street. The dog
rises and saunters away, remarking, ``Why don't you look where
you're going, you bonehead?''
	   That's not all. Dolittle gets into a dialogue with his
daughter's guinea pig. A couple of rats in a trash barrel toss
sarcastic comments toward him. Cats, pigs, goats, even an ailing
carnival tiger converse with him.
	   When his family and associates notice him speaking to animals,
they are perplexed, then alarmed. The good doctor is shipped off to
the funny farm. Pratt is panicked that his partner's weird behavior
will spoil the HMO deal.
	   Thanks to special effects, the animals talk convincingly, and
they are amusingly voiced by such actors as Albert Brooks, Chris
Rock, Julie Kavner, Garry Shandling, Ellen DeGeneres, Norm
MacDonald and John Leguizamo. Too bad the script (by Nat Mauldin
and Larry Levin) doesn't match their talents.
	   If your notion of comedy runs to bodily odors and toilet jokes,
then ``Dr. Dolittle'' is the movie for you. But it seems
unfortunate that the gentle fantasy of Lofting's stories has been
junked in favor of nasty little jokes that kids snigger about in
kindergarten.
	   Murphy employs all the right moves to respond to the various
predicaments, and the reliable Platt has his moments. Also, Jeffrey
Tambor, the obnoxious sidekick on ``The Larry Sanders Show,'' does
a funny stint as an overbearing veterinarian. But Ossie Davis and
Kristen Wilson are wasted as Murphy's father and wife.
	   Betty Thomas directed the film with a big assist from Jim
Henson's Creature Shop and its puppeteers. Incidentally, Hollywood
seems to have found a new villain: the HMO.
	   ``Dr. Dolittle'' was produced by John Davis, Joseph M. Singer
and David T. Friendly. Running time: 95 minutes.

Summit leaders air their differences - direct to the people of China to Clinton, not Jiang. AP White House Correspondent 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS previous, CORRECTING attribution of quote in 3rd graf
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ In a gripping summit debate beamed to hundreds of
millions of homes across this vast country, U.S. President Bill
Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin treated China to an
uncensored airing of differences Saturday on human rights, freedom,
trade and Tibet.
	   The leaders gave no ground in their 70-minute news conference,
eagerly jumping in after each other to get the last word.
	   It was spirited but cordial. ``You can see that neither one of
us are shy about being strong about how we believe,'' Clinton said.
	   Bringing attention to a key area of difference _ religious
freedom _ Clinton planned to worship Sunday at Chongwenmen Church,
China's largest Protestant church.
	   Human rights groups say dozens of Protestant and Catholic
leaders are imprisoned or held in Chinese labor camps for refusing
to bow to government control. Clinton and Jiang agreed to exchange
visits of religious leaders to further understanding on spiritual
matters.
	   After church, the president and his family head off on a day of
sightseeing at the palaces of the Forbidden City and China's most
famous landmark, the Great Wall.
	   American officials applauded China's willingness to broadcast
Saturday's news conference across the land, from the temple-dotted
capital of Tibet in Chinese Central Asia to the flashy financial
center of Shanghai at the mouth of the Yangtze River.
	   The exchange also was telecast in America, but for China, it was
an unprecedented look at their leader standing side by side with
the American president, both men unflinching on areas of
controversy and disagreement.
	   Speaking afterwards, many Chinese expressed satisfaction with
the summit and the televised appearance.
	   ``For us Chinese, it really is new to see two presidents
speaking face-to-face, with reporters asking question, on live
television,'' said Andrea Yang, an insurance company employee in
Beijing. ``I hope we can see more of that in the future. This is
quite big progress.''
	   Clinton's critics back home weren't so happy with his
performance.
	   ``He reduced it to a disagreement. It's more than a
disagreement,'' said Republican Rep. Chris Smith, who chaired a
hearing on human rights in China on the eve of Clinton's welcome in
Beijing.
	   Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi, a longtime critic of Clinton on
China, said he treated the massacre around Tiananmen Square as a
``historical episode.''
	   Jiang credited his counterpart for a tougher stance.
	   ``I think President Clinton is a strong defender of the American
interest, and I am a strong defender of the Chinese interest,''
Jiang said. ``But despite that, we still can have very friendly
exchanges of views and discussion.'' Switching languages, he added
in English, ``And I think that is democracy.''
	   Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, said the
exchange between Clinton and Jiang demonstrated the wisdom of
engagement with China. He said Jiang ``not only was willing to
engage but seemed almost eager to engage in that dialogue.''
	   Both Clinton and Jiang played to their domestic audience as well
as one another.
	   Clinton said the United States and China still disagree about
the Tiananmen crackdown nine years ago and that ``the use of force
and the tragic loss of life was wrong.'' He said some of the
pro-democracy advocates arrested then for nonviolent activities are
still in prison.
	   ``Is there something that could be done there,'' Clinton
wondered.
	   Jiang did not answer that point but said _ as he has in the past
_ that ``resolute measures'' were necessary in 1989 to insure
China's stability.
	   Clinton and Jiang spent 11 minutes in Tiananmen Square,
reviewing military troops and standing at attention for national
anthems. Clinton said that in his brief visit ``I could hear and
see the many echoes of China's past and the call of its promising
future.''
	   On Tibet, Clinton gently pressed Jiang to open a dialogue with
the Dalai Lama _ the spiritual leader criticized by China's
government as a religious charlatan and a political tool of
anti-China foreign forces.
	   ``Let me say something that will perhaps be unpopular with
everyone,'' Clinton said. ``I have spent time with the Dalai Lama.
I believe him to be an honest man and I believe if he had a
conversation with President Jiang, they would like each other very
much.'' Jiang broke into a smile at this.	   
	   The two leaders agreed not to aim nuclear missiles at each
other's country _ a move Clinton said eliminates the possibility of
an accidental launch toward American soil. Jiang said the pact
demonstrated that China and America ``are partners, not
adversaries.''
	   The leaders also announced a string of accords on energy,
environmental matters, arms control and American and Chinese
exchanges. Clinton praised China for resisting pressure to devalue
its currency, a move many fear would worsen Asia's financial
crisis. But the leaders could not agree on terms to allow China
entry into the World Trade Organization, which sets global trade
rules.

At the Movies: 'Out of Sight' 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ With his 1989 hit, ``sex, lies and videotape,''
Steven Soderbergh was hailed as a bright, original filmmaker of
exceptional promise. That promise remained unfulfilled with
``Kafka,'' ``Schizopolis,'' ``The Underneath'' and other films
considered too esoteric to attract large audiences.
	   ``Out of Sight'' proves that the early predictions were not
exaggerated. Soderbergh has converted another Elmore Leonard tale
of overambitious lowlifes into a diverting movie filled with
outrageous characters.
	   Crime novels present challenges to filmmakers, since the plots
are often too complex to transfer to the screen. Screenwriter Scott
Frank has managed to retain the bizarre characters and unexpected
turns of ``Out of Sight'' without requiring a road map for the
viewer. But then, he has had practice, having written the script
for another Leonard book, ``Get Shorty.''
	   Jersey Films _ Danny DeVito, Michael Shamberg and Stacey Sher _
also produced the estimable ``Get Shorty.''
	   The central figure of ``Out of Sight'' is Jack Foley (George
Clooney), a career bank robber and habitue of the nation's prisons.
He is determined to make one last score and disappear into
retirement. First, though, Jack must find a solution to the 30-year
sentence he is serving.
	   Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez) toils on the other side of the law,
as a deputy federal marshal. While visiting the Florida state
prison to serve a summons and complaint, she finds herself in the
middle of a prison break.
	   Arming herself with a shotgun, she apprehends Jack, but is
grabbed from behind by his getaway driver, Buddy (Ving Rhames).
Jack and Karen end up in the trunk of the car. They become
acquainted in a hurry, and she grudgingly admires his gentlemanly _
and sexy _ manner.
	   Jack and Buddy escape, and Karen returns to Miami with
ambivalent feelings. She is intrigued by the handsome bank robber
but driven by her duty as a law enforcer.
	   The scene shifts to Detroit, where Jack and Buddy aim to relieve
a onetime fellow inmate, billionaire Richard Ripley (Albert
Brooks), of the uncut diamonds he claims to have in his mansion.
Another former inmate, wildman Snoopy Miller (Don Cheadle), has the
same idea.
	   The goings-on are much more complicated than this brief
synopsis. Needless to say, the unlikely lovers have their moment of
passion.
	   Soderbergh keeps the proceedings going with speed and style, and
some of the techniques he uses have been little seen since the days
when Hollywood was enamored with France's New Wave: stop-action,
dissolves, quick-cuts. This film definitely signals that Soderbergh
is back in the big time.
	   Clooney's transformation from TV heartthrob to film star has
been slow. ``Batman and Robin,'' ``One Fine Day'' and ``The
Peacemaker'' proved underwhelming. ``Out of Sight'' should smooth
Clooney's departure from ``ER'' next year. He registers a strong
screen presence.
	   Lopez generates electricity as the federal marshal who has more
brains and is just as daring as the crooks with whom she's dealing.
Her future in films is unlimited.
	   The Universal Pictures release runs 123 minutes.

World Cup: Cesar Sampaio an unlikely hero for Brazil 
</HEADLINE>
By PETER MUELLO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS, France (AP) _ Brazil was relieved to have Cesar Sampaio
back to shore up its shaky defense against Chile. The goals were an
unexpected bonus.
	   The 30-year-old midfielder scored twice and was the name of the
game in Brazil's 4-1 rout Saturday that moved the defending
champions into the quarterfinals against Nigeria or Denmark.
	   ``He was perfect,'' said Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo.
``Everything, not just the goals. Defense. He was complete.''
	   Sure, Ronaldo also got a pair, including one on a penalty kick,
and bounced shots off the post and the crossbar. But goals are what
everyone expects from the two-time FIFA Player of the Year.
	   Sampaio is new to this hero stuff.
	   ``My forte always was regularity. I was never the best player on
the field,'' he said. ``But in my sector I always tried to
contribute in a positive way.''
	   Sampaio's contribution usually is on defense, his specialty.
When he got two yellow cards and had to sit out last week's game
against Norway, Brazil tried out a more offensive formation, took
two goals in the last seven minutes and lost 2-1.
	   The defeat hurt, and Brazil was hesitant in the early minutes,
leery of opening up against Chile's dangerous front line of Marcelo
Salas and Ivan Zamorano.
	   Enter Sampaio.
	   Barely 11 minutes into the game, Rivaldo was fouled and Dunga
sent a curling free kick on goal. Sampaio raced in alone for the
header and a 1-0 lead.
	   In the 27th minute, there was Sampaio again, tapping in a loose
ball off a Roberto Carlos to make it 2-0.
	   Playing without three starters suspended with two yellow cards,
Chile left an avenue on the left side of its defense. Meanwhile,
Salas and Zamorano failed to click.
	   Then Ronaldo, who had scored only one goal in three games,
decided to make good on his promise to ``break the spell'' against
Chile.
	   In injury time, he raced in on a breakaway, and French referee
Marc Batta whistled a penalty when he fell over goalie Nelson
Tapia. Ronaldo himself converted for a 3-0 halftime lead.
	   ``We were brainless in the first 10 minutes. Luckily nothing bad
happened,'' said Zagallo. ``Then, in the second half, we played our
best football of the Cup.''
	   Brazil was better positioned after the break and hungry for
more. Sampaio just missed the hat trick on a tip-in of a Dunga free
kick, and Ronaldo rattled a shot of the post.
	   But it was Chile that struck first. A Zamorano header was
knocked out by goalie Taffarel, but Salas pounced on the rebound
and headed it in to make it 3-1.
	   A minute later, Ronaldo burst in on the right for a shot into
the far corner and a 4-1 lead. Brazil deserved more, but Ronaldo
hit the crossbar, and Junior Baiano fumbled the conclusion of a
Rivaldo solo run.
	   ``I knew this drought had to end soon, that at any moment I'd
find my rhythm, and thank God it happened at the best time,''
Ronaldo said.
	   For Zamorano, the defeat was ``the end of a dream, not a
nightmare.''
	   ``We played with dignity and showed we can play on even terms
with anybody,'' he said. ``When a team has players like Ronaldo and
Cesar Sampaio, anything might happen, as it happened today.''

Studies: Mom-to-infant HIV nearly eliminated with C-sections, AZT With AIDS Conference 
</HEADLINE>
By MARTHA IRVINE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ French researchers say using Caesarean sections
during birth, coupled with the HIV-fighting drug AZT, could nearly
eliminate transmission of the AIDS virus from mother to child.
	   As recently as 1994, a baby born to an HIV-positive mother had
about a 25 percent chance of contracting the virus. AZT alone
dropped that rate to less than 8 percent.
	   Two studies released Saturday and to be presented at the 12th
World AIDS Conference in Geneva show the rate of mother-to-infant
transmission plummeting to 2 percent and, in some cases, lower than
1 percent when the C-section is used with AZT therapy.
	   ``The goal was to have the rate of transmission below 1 percent
by the end of the century, and I think we're really getting
there,'' said Dr. Laurent Mandelbrot, leader of a French study that
will be published in Wednesday's HIV/AIDS-themed edition of the
Journal of the American Medical Association.
	   The study, which included 2,834 mother-infant pairs in France,
found that of the 1,917 mothers who did not receive AZT, 17.2
percent transmitted HIV to their infants. Of those who received
AZT, the percentage dropped to 6.6 percent.
	   Of the mothers who took AZT before delivery and also elected to
have a C-section, only 0.8 percent transmitted the AIDS virus to
their babies.
	   A study by the National Institute of Child Health and Human
Development in Washington combined the findings of that study with
several others in Europe and North America and found that
C-sections reduced transmission by half and, when combined with AZT
treatment, cut transmission to just 2 percent.
	   Dr. John Flaherty, an infectious disease specialist at the
University of Chicago, also has seen a dramatic drop in
mother-to-infant transmissions among his patients _ in large part
because of treatment with ``cocktails'' of AIDS drugs, including
AZT.
	   But he wonders if it's worth the risk of complications and even
death for the mothers to add C-sections to the process.
	   ``I'm kind of on the fence on it,'' Flaherty said. ``You have to
ask, `Is it worth it to do C-sections on 100 women to prevent one
transmission?'''
	   Dr. Patricia Garcia, an assistant professor of obstetrics and
gynecology at Northwestern University, is even more wary of
routinely using an invasive procedure.
	   ``There isn't a woman alive who wouldn't do anything to reduce
the risk of transmission to her child,'' Garcia said of pregnant
women who are HIV-positive. ``But until we sit down and so
carefully go over the implications of this, I'm very concerned
about implementing it.''

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The campaign leading up to Sunday's
first-ever national referendum on whether to permit abortions in
Portugal has deeply divided this predominantly Roman Catholic
country.
	   The speeches, marches and emotional campaigning of recent weeks
came to a halt Saturday as Portuguese voters observed an official
``day of contemplation'' on the referendum. People will decide
Sunday whether abortion on demand through the 10th week of
pregnancy should be ``decriminalized,'' which in effect will
eliminate current prohibitions.
	   Parliament approved a bill relaxing abortion restrictions in
February, but opponents successfully pushed for a national ballot
that will either overturn or ratify that legislation.
	   The campaign, which ended Friday, featured marches in major
cities and a nationwide media blitz. In Portugal, the electorate is
typically given a ``day of contemplation'' before the vote, during
which advertising and speechmaking is prohibited.
	   Parliament has been debating the abortion issue for the past 14
years _ since leftist parties first won enough seats to press for a
discussion.
	   Among the public, the younger generation, backed by leftist
politicians, largely wants to give women more freedom to terminate
unwanted pregnancies. The bulk of the opposition comes from older
Portuguese, supported by the influential Catholic church and
conservative parties.
	   While the `yes' camp has been projected to win, its support has
dropped over the course of the campaign to about 50 percent from 60
percent. The result will be binding only if more than half of
registered voters participate.
	   Under existing Portuguese law, termination of pregnancy is
permitted only for strictly defined medical reasons or in cases of
rape, and only until the 12th week. Women can be imprisoned for up
to three years for having an illegal abortion.
	   Pro-life activists estimate there are at least 16,000 illegal
abortions each year in Portugal, a nation of 9.5 million people.
	   Government statistics indicate that each year about 10,000 women
are treated at hospitals following botched illegal abortions.

Hanson demands English language competency test for immigrants 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia's One Nation party head
Pauline Hanson said Sunday that an English language competency test
would form part of her new right-wing party's immigration policy.
	   Hanson, speaking on a television program, reiterated her
controversial views, saying she did not want Australia to become
Asianized, just as many Asians do not want Asia to become too
strongly influenced by Australia.
	   ``Here in Australia, we speak English. Everyone should speak
English,'' Hanson said. ``I don't want to go to any parts of
Australia and don't know whether I am walking into a butcher shop
or a hairdresser.''
	   Hanson, whose party made a strong debut as a political force by
claiming 11 seats and 23 percent of the vote in this month's
Queensland state poll, is gearing up for the next federal election.
The election is due by March but expected earlier.
	   She is expected to release her party's official immigration
policy later this week.
	   ``I think there should be a test on English,'' Hanson said.
``This is Australia and I believe these people must make an effort
to know the English language.''
	   One nation would push for a referendum on the issue of
Aboriginal native title to land as a condition of support for the
Liberal and National coalition in the Australian Senate, Hanson
said.
	   ``Everyone has the right to enjoy this country and everything it
has to offer _ native title is destroying us and splitting us as a
people,'' Hanson said.
	   She also said the Racial Discrimination Act needed to be
repealed as it was discriminatory.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ In the sanctuary of China's largest Protestant
church, U.S. President Bill Clinton brought a message of religious
tolerance Sunday to a nation where Christian leaders have been
jailed or harassed by the government.
	   Human rights groups say dozens of Protestant and Catholic
leaders are imprisoned or held in Chinese labor camps for refusing
to bow to government control. Clinton and Chinese President Jiang
Zemin agreed to exchange visits of religious leaders to further
understanding on spiritual matters.
	   After worshipping at Chongwenmen Church, the president and his
family planned a day of sightseeing at the palaces of the Forbidden
City and China's most famous landmark, the Great Wall. Clinton's
wife, Hillary; aughter, Chelsea, and mother-in-law, Dorothy Rodham,
were along on the trip.
	   On Saturday, Clinton and Jiang treated China to an uncensored
airing of differences on human rights, freedom, trade and Tibet.
The leaders eagerly jumped in after each other to get the last
word. It was spirited but cordial, and neither leader was reluctant
to emphasize differences.
	   ``You can see that neither one of us are shy about being strong
about how we believe,'' Clinton said.
	   American officials applauded China's willingness to broadcast
Saturday's news conference across the land, from the temple-dotted
capital of Tibet in Chinese Central Asia to the flashy financial
center of Shanghai at the mouth of the Yangtze River.
	   The exchange also was telecast in America, but for China, it was
an unprecedented look at their leader standing side by side with
the American president, both men unflinching on areas of
controversy and disagreement.
	   Speaking afterwards, many Chinese expressed satisfaction with
the summit and the televised appearance.
	   ``For us Chinese, it really is new to see two presidents
speaking face-to-face, with reporters asking question, on live
television,'' said Andrea Yang, an insurance company employee in
Beijing. ``I hope we can see more of that in the future. This is
quite big progress.''
	   Clinton's critics back home weren't so happy with his
performance.
	   ``He reduced it to a disagreement. It's more than a
disagreement,'' said Republican Rep. Chris Smith, who chaired a
hearing on human rights in China on the eve of Clinton's welcome in
Beijing.
	   Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi, a longtime critic of Clinton on
China, said he treated the massacre around Tiananmen Square as a
``historical episode.''
	   Jiang credited his counterpart with taking a tougher stance.
	   ``I think President Clinton is a strong defender of the American
interest, and I am a strong defender of the Chinese interest,''
Jiang said. ``But despite that, we still can have very friendly
exchanges of views and discussion.'' Switching languages, he added
in English, ``And I think that is democracy.''
	   Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, said the
exchange between Clinton and Jiang demonstrated the wisdom of
engagement with China. He said Jiang ``not only was willing to
engage but seemed almost eager to engage in that dialogue.''
	   On Tibet, Clinton gently pressed Jiang to open a dialogue with
the Dalai Lama _ the spiritual leader criticized by China's
government as a religious charlatan and a political tool of
anti-China foreign forces.
	   ``I have spent time with the Dalai Lama. I believe him to be an
honest man and I believe if he had a conversation with President
Jiang, they would like each other very much.'' Jiang broke into a
smile at this.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ From the sanctuary of China's largest Protestant
church, U.S. President Bill Clinton preached a message of unity and
freedom Sunday in a nation where Christian leaders have been jailed
or harassed by the government.
	   ``I believe that Chinese and Americans are brothers and sisters
as children of God,'' the president told the congregation. ``We
come here in that spirit today.''
	   Clinton quoted from the Bible, Acts 17:26, ``God has made from
one blood every nation to dwell on the surface of the earth,'' and
added, ``I believe that is true.''
	   In a country where Clinton's very attendance at church
highlighted the quest for religious freedom, he said, ``I believe
our faith calls upon us to seek unity with people across the world
of different races and backgrounds and creeds.''

<TEXT>
	   On Saturday, Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin treated
China to an uncensored airing of differences on human rights,
freedom, trade and Tibet. The leaders eagerly jumped in after each
other to get the last word. It was spirited but cordial, and
neither leader was reluctant to emphasize differences.
	   ``You can see that neither one of us are shy about being strong
about how we believe,'' Clinton said.
	   American officials applauded China's willingness to broadcast
Saturday's news conference across the land, from the temple-dotted
capital of Tibet in Chinese Central Asia to the flashy financial
center of Shanghai at the mouth of the Yangtze River.
	   The exchange also was telecast in America, but for China, it was
an unprecedented look at their leader standing side by side with
the American president, both men unflinching on areas of
controversy and disagreement.
	   Speaking afterwards, many Chinese expressed satisfaction with
the summit and the televised appearance.
	   ``For us Chinese, it really is new to see two presidents
speaking face-to-face, with reporters asking question, on live
television,'' said Andrea Yang, an insurance company employee in
Beijing. ``I hope we can see more of that in the future. This is
quite big progress.''
	   Clinton's critics back home weren't so happy with his
performance.
	   ``He reduced it to a disagreement. It's more than a
disagreement,'' said Republican Rep. Chris Smith, who chaired a
hearing on human rights in China on the eve of Clinton's welcome in
Beijing.
	   Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi, a longtime critic of Clinton on
China, said he treated the massacre around Tiananmen Square as a
``historical episode.''
	   Jiang credited his counterpart with taking a tougher stance.
	   ``I think President Clinton is a strong defender of the American
interest, and I am a strong defender of the Chinese interest,''
Jiang said. ``But despite that, we still can have very friendly
exchanges of views and discussion.'' Switching languages, he added
in English, ``And I think that is democracy.''
	   Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, said the
exchange between Clinton and Jiang demonstrated the wisdom of
engagement with China. He said Jiang ``not only was willing to
engage but seemed almost eager to engage in that dialogue.''
	   On Tibet, Clinton gently pressed Jiang to open a dialogue with
the Dalai Lama _ the spiritual leader criticized by China's
government as a religious charlatan and a political tool of
anti-China foreign forces.
	   ``I have spent time with the Dalai Lama. I believe him to be an
honest man and I believe if he had a conversation with President
Jiang, they would like each other very much.'' Jiang broke into a
smile at this.

Clinton preaches religious unity to Chinese congregation AP White House Correspondent

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ From the simple sanctuary of China's largest
Protestant church, U.S. President Bill Clinton preached a message
of unity and freedom Sunday in a nation where Christian leaders
have been jailed or harassed by the government.
	   ``I believe that Chinese and Americans are brothers and sisters
as children of God,'' the president told the congregation. ``We
come here in that spirit today.''
	   In a country where Clinton's very attendance at church
highlighted the quest for religious freedom, he said, ``I believe
our faith calls upon us to seek unity with people across the world
of different races and backgrounds and creeds.''
	   Clinton quoted from the Bible, Acts 17:26, ``God has made from
one blood every nation to dwell on the surface of the earth,'' and
added, ``I believe that is true.''
	   He spoke in the large sanctuary of Chongwenmen Church with white
plaster walls and brown wooden floor and ceiling. The squat gray
building _ unmarked by any steeple _ is tucked at the rear of a
hotel parking lot, past a row of shanties. Its has a congregation
of about 2,500.
	   There was a brief disruption when a middle-aged woman walked up
the aisle toward the president's pew. Some members of the
congregation tried to grab her but she shook them off, saying she
wanted to see Clinton. ``Don't throw me out, I'll leave of my own
accord,'' she shouted.
	   She was escorted to the rear of the sanctuary and sat silently
through the service. Afterward, she was allowed to see Clinton and
told him she was a charismatic Christian, thanked him for coming to
China and expressed hope that China's leaders would become
Christians, a White House official said. Members of the
congregation would not allow reporters to talk to the woman, said
to be from another province.

UNDATED: 1 1-3 innings. Braves 2, Blue Jays 0 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   In Atlanta, Greg Maddux struck out a career-high 13 and became
the NL's first 11-game winner, pitching Atlanta past Toronto.
	   Maddux (11-2) is 9-0 in his last 12 starts and leads the majors
with a 1.64 ERA and three shutouts. The four-time Cy Young winner
earned his 100th victory since signing with the Braves before the
1993 season. He is 100-35 for the Braves and 195-110 overall with
26 shutouts.
	   Maddux walked none and allowed eight hits. The game took 1 hour,
46 minutes, the fastest in the majors this year.
	   Michael Tucker and Ryan Klesko hit home runs in the seventh off
Juan Guzman (4-10). The Braves stopped a three-game losing streak
and ended Toronto's six-game winning string.
 &UR; Expos 3, Orioles 1 &QC; 
	   In Montreal, pinch-hitter Scott Livingstone doubled in the
go-ahead run in the seventh inning as Montreal beat Baltimore,
extending the Orioles' losing streak to five games.
	   Carl Pavano (2-1) limited the Orioles to four hits in seven
innings, allowing the only run on Chris Hoiles' second-inning
homer. Ugueth Urbina pitched the ninth for his 19th save.
	   Chris Widger led off the seventh with a single and advanced to
second on Shane Andrews' sacrifice. Livingstone, hitting for
Pavano, doubled to right off Mike Mussina (6-5) to give the Expos a
2-1 lead. Jose Vidro, who was 2-for-4 with two RBIs, then singled
home pinch-runner Orlando Cabrera.
 &UR; Devil Rays 5, Phillies 1
	   In Philadelphia, pinch-hitter Paul Sorrento hit a grand slam off
Philadelphia ace Curt Schilling in the eighth inning for Tampa Bay.
	   Schilling (7-8) allowed a career-high 13 hits and all five runs
after giving up 12 hits and eight runs Monday in a no-decision
against Boston. He pitched 7 1-3 innings and struck out eight to
increase his major league-leading total to 175.
	   Tampa Bay's Rolando Arrojo (10-4) allowed six hits in eight
innings. He leads AL rookie pitchers in nine pitching categories,
including victories and starts (17).
 &UR; Red Sox 9, Marlins 4 &QC; 
	   In Miami, Nomar Garciaparra extended his hitting streak to 19
games as Boston beat Florida for its third straight victory.
	   Garciaparra's streak is tied for the second-longest in the
majors this season, one behind Larry Walker's string for Colorado.
He had two hits and had reached base in eight consecutive plate
appearances against the Marlins before a fly out in the eighth
inning.
	   Tim Wakefield (9-3) allowed four runs and six hits in 7 2-3
innings. Jesus Sanchez (3-5) took the loss.
	   Mark Kotsay hit a solo homer for Florida.
 &UR; Brewers 10, White Sox 5 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Marquis Grissom doubled to highlight a five-run
third inning as Milwaukee won their sixth in a row, beating
Chicago.
	   Fernando Vina, who hit two of Milwaukee's seven doubles, Jeromy
Burnitz and Jose Valentin each drove in two runs for the Brewers.
	   Grissom's two-run double helped Milwaukee win for the 13th time
in 19 games and improve to 7-3 in interleague play. Magglio Ordonez
homered, doubled and drove in four runs for the White Sox.
	   Brad Woodall (4-2) gave up three earned runs and seven hits in 8
1-3 innings. Tom Fordham (1-1) took the loss.

UNDATED: the loss. Cardinals 7, Twins 2 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   In Minneapolis, Mark McGwire hit his 36th home run _ matching
the most by any St. Louis player in a full season in 49 years _ to
help the Cardinals snap a four-game losing streak.
	   After failing to hit one out in his first seven plate
appearances of the series, McGwire drove a 2-2 pitch from reliever
Mike Trombley 431 feet (131 meters) to left-center field for a
two-run homer in the seventh inning.
	   McGwire, who has more homers before July 1 than any player in
major league history, needs 26 in the final 83 games to break Roger
Maris' record of 61 set in 1961. McGwire's total is the highest for
the Cardinals since Stan Musial hit 36 in 1949. The team record is
43 by Johnny Mize in 1940.
	   Brian Hunter also homered for the Cardinals.
	   Todd Stottlemyre (9-5) pitched a five-hitter for his third
complete game of the season. He allowed Scott Stahoviak's solo
homer in the seventh. Eric Milton (4-7) took the loss.
 &UR; Reds 6, Tigers 5, 13 innings &QC; 
	   In Detroit, Brook Fordyce and Lenny Harris hit RBI singles in
the 13th inning as Cincinnati beat Detroit for its third straight
victory following an 11-game losing streak.
	   Mike Frank walked to lead off the 13th and advanced to second on
a sacrifice. Barry Larkin was intentionally walked with two outs
and Fordyce singled for a 5-4 lead, taking second on the throw
home. After Dmitri Young was intentionally walked, Harris singled.
	   Gabe White (2-3) pitched two innings for the victory. Detroit's
Gabe Alvarez homered in the 13th, his third since being called up
from the minors Monday. Denny Harriger (0-3) took the loss.
	   Reggie Sanders and Young homered for the Reds.
 &UR; Athletics 8, Rockies 6 &QC; 
	   In Denver, rookie Ben Grieve hit a two-out, three-run homer in
the ninth inning, rallying Oakland past Colorado.
	   Bip Roberts also homered and drove in three runs for the A's,
including the tying run in the ninth with a single off closer Jerry
Dipoto (2-4). Grieve hit an opposite-field homer off Chuck McElroy
to make it 8-5.
	   Billy Taylor pitched the ninth for his 16th save, allowing Jeff
Reed's homer. T.J. Mathews (4-4) pitched two scoreless innings for
the victory.
	   Colorado's Darryl Kile, bidding for his first victory at Coors
Field this season, took a 5-2 lead into the eighth.

	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Johnny Damon's two-out single off Rod
Beck in the 10th pushed Kansas City past Chicago, the Royals' ninth
victory in 11 games and the Cubs' seventh straight loss.
	   Scott Service (2-1) earned the victory as Royals relievers
retired the last 15 Cubs in a row. Beck (1-2) took the loss.
	   The Royals tied it at 3 on Larry Sutton's RBI single in the
eighth.
	   In the fifth, Sammy Sosa came within 18 inches (46 centimeters)
of adding to his record for home runs in a month, hitting an RBI
double off the wall to give the Cubs a 3-0 lead. Sosa has hit 19 of
his 32 homers in June.
	   Sal Fasano homered for the Royals.
