<HEADLINE> Nepali Lawmakers Inspect Refugee Camps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A team of MPs of Nepal's Lower
House recently inspected different Bhutanese refugee camps in
eastern Nepal, the Nepali official news agency RSS said today.
</P>
<P>
The seven lawmakers, all members of the House Committee for
Foreign Affairs and Human Rights, made their inspection tour
aiming at gathering first hand information about the condition of
the Bhutanese refugees in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
They said during the inspection they found the Bhutanese
refugees wishing to return home.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that nearly 100,000 Bhutanese refugees, mostly
of Nepalese origin, have been living in eight camps in eastern
Nepal since 1990 when the Bhutanese authorities forced them to
flee their home country.
</P>
<P>
Nepal and Bhutan had held seven rounds of bilateral talks on
the refugee issue but no progress was made on how to settle the
controversial problem.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the House Committee Jayaprakash Gupta told RSS that
25 families of Indian origin were also found living in one of
those refugee camps.

<HEADLINE> Regional Political Forces Meeting Held in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Delegations representing 66 labor
and communist parties from 47 countries of the Eastern
Mediterranean and North Africa met here today to discuss the
current situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was organized by the Communist Party of Greece (kke)
within the framework of its 15th congress.
</P>
<P>
Speakers at the meeting agreed that following the gulf war and
the upheavals in the former socialist countries of Eastern Europe,
a new international correlation had been created with
repercussions for all the states and peoples of the region.
</P>
<P>
"The consequences of this situation in our region is tension
in the Balkans, the shaping of a new order in the Middle East and
systematic efforts by NATO and the European Union to extend their
roles in order to safeguard their interests in the wider region of
the Mediterranean," kke political bureau member Orestis Kolozov
told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to the meeting, the poverty, lack of
development and major social problems which exist in the countries
of the Mediterranean and North Africa create tension and insecurity
among the peoples of the region.
</P>
<P>
Other issues discussed at the meeting included the Palestinian
and Cyprus issues, problems faced by Lebanon and Syria, and the
embargoes against Libya and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The only victims of the embargoes are the innocent citizens
of those countries," Kolozov said.
</P>
<P>
The kke's 15th congress, which began on wednesday, is to end
on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Election Campaigns Proceed Smoothly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Police have so far registered a
total of 275 complaints related to the current election campaign,
reported Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
Police Inspector-General Assaf Hefetz told reporters that most
of the complaints involved scuffles between party activists,
pasting up and removing posters, poverty damages, threats and
arsons. The most serious case, the shooting of Arthur Yurovsky, a
Labor Party member, by Likud activists has been closed, and the
file has been transferred to the District Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
Hefetz said that he had been surprised by the relatively quiet
campaign, which he attributed to cancellation of mass political
rallies.
</P>
<P>
However, Hefetz said that on the election day some 20,000
police will be dispatched nationwide to safeguard the polling
stations and the public. Three days prior to the election day, the
Palestinian territories will be completely sealed off to thwart
possible infiltration by Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, some 640,000
new voters will participate in the elections. Two-thirds of them
are young people who will vote for the first time and the rest are
new immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Of the 3,933,250 eligible voters, 51.5 percent are women while
48.5 percent are men.

<HEADLINE> Anglo-Irish Differences over Ulster Talks Emerge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Serious differences between the
British and Irish governments have emerged over the procedure for
the planned all-party talks process to be convened on June 10.
</P>
<P>
The Irish government insists that an initial handover of arms
by rival paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland, mainly the Irish
Republican Army (IRA), cannot take place before significant
political progress has been made.
</P>
<P>
But the British government maintains that arms decommissioning
should be materialized at the start of all-party negotiations.
</P>
<P>
With no signs of moves towards an IRA cease-fire, and little
more than two weeks before the planned all-party negotiations, the
two governments are becoming increasingly jittery about prospects.
</P>
<P>
A report in Financial times newspaper today revealed that the
British government believed that the Dublin was "moving the
goalposts" on arms decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
And British officials had privately accused the Irish of
undermining attempts to persuade the IRA to end its three month
campaign of violence.
</P>
<P>
The two governments are also divided on the role to be played
by former u.s. senator George Mitchell as the chairman of the
international commission for overseeing the arms decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
The British government wants him to head the sub-committee to
look at paramilitary arms, while the Irish side is holding out for
him to be given the chairmanship of one of the main "strands" in
talks, dealing with relations between the Irish Republic and
Northen Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Dublin believes that London is still dragging its feet on many
of the main procedural questions because it does not want to
antogonize Unionists in favor of British rule over Northern
Ireland.

<HEADLINE> Philippine, US Scientists Study Ebola Virus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Philippine and US scientists have
finished the collection of blood samples from animal handlers and
monkeys from wildlife trapping areas in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
This completed the needed specimens for the extensive
investigation on reston subtype of ebola virus on the Philippine
macaque monkeys.
</P>
<P>
Health Secretary Carmencita Noriega-Reocica said the experts
collected a total of 27 blood samples from monkeys and 19
specimens from animal handlers from Iligan city, Kapatagan, Lanao
del Norte, Tinago mini zoo also in Iligan, and Sultan Kudarat in
Cotabato.
</P>
<P>
Reodica said all the blood samples were shipped to the US
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, USA
for examination.
</P>
<P>
The health chief said examination of the specimens from
Mindanao would answer questions about the transmission of the
reston virus in the wild.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the group also collected 1,674 blood samples
from monkey and 192 from farm workers of five private export
facilities in the country, including some of the workers household
contacts.
</P>
<P>
Last April, US scientists found that ebola virus was carried by
macaque monkeys imported from the Philippines. A joint team from
the Philippine Filovirus study group and the CDC was form to trace
the source of the disease.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 25 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela
today congratulated the South African expedition team on reaching
Jolmo Lungma or Mount Everest, the world's highest mountain,
reported Radio 702.
</P>
<P>
Two members of the team, leader Ian Woodall and Cathy O'dowd,
climbed to the peak of Jolmo Lungma at about 6 am, South African
time (04:00 gmt) on Saturday morning, said the radio.
</P>
<P>
In a live crossing on the radio, Mandela spoke to Radio 702
reporter Patrick Conroy at the team's base camp. The president
asked Conroy to convey his congratulations to Woodall and O'dowd,
saying, "our children did very well indeed."
</P>
<P>
Mandela said their success was "very important not only for
the purpose of inspiring the youth but the whole country."
</P>
<P>
"They deserve the highest recognition we can give to people
who make this achievement," said the president.
</P>
<P>
He also told Conroy he would like to speak to Woodall and
O'dowd personally on the telephone when they returned to the base
camp.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the first man to climb the Jolmo Lungma, Sir
Hillary, also sent his congratulations to team leader Woodall and
O'dowd, saying, "everyone in South Africa should be proud of
their effort."
</P>
<P>
In an interview on Radio 702 in his New Zealand home on
Saturday morning, Hillary said the Mount Everest was still "a
very considerable challenge and of course a considerable danger."
</P>
<P>
A third team member, photographer Bruce Herrod, was still
heading for the summit some six hours after the other two had
already made it to the top, reported the Radio.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Afghanistan at Crossroads After </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The four-year-long Afghan civil
war has come to a crossroads that may lead either to more
factional fighting or to a durable peace, after a latest
reconciliation between two major rival groups.
</P>
<P>
The signing of a six-point agreement on Friday by the Afghan
government headed by President Burhanuddin Rabbani and its
erstwhile enemy Hezb-i-Islami (Hekmatyar Group) has undoubtedly
consolidated the Kabul regime in both the political and the
military fields.
</P>
<P>
The fate of the war-torn country now lies largely in the hands
of the Kabul regime which can take advantage of the momentum
militarily or politically.
</P>
<P>
The agreement called for ceasing hostilities and restoring
peace and stability in the country, forming an interim
administration, holding elections, establishing an Islamic
government, setting up a national Islamic army and upholding
Afghanistan's sovereignty and unity.
</P>
<P>
It did not say if the two sides would jointly fight against
Rabbani's arch rival Taliban Militia whose heavy forces are
stationed outside Kabul.
</P>
<P>
However, a spokesman for the Afghan Defense Ministry said
Friday that Hezb fighters had already got involved in offensives
against the Taliban southeast of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Reports said about 1,000 Hezb troops arrived in Kabul on May 13
to help defend the capital and more soldiers were expected in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Afghan government troops, with no more threat
coming from the Hekmatyar group on the eastern front-line of
Kabul, launched consecutive attacks on Taliban positions south of
the city in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that in the military field, the allied
Rabbani-Hekmatyar troops would be strong enough not only to defend
Kabul, but also to launch large scale offensives against the
Taliban if they want to.
</P>
<P>
However, the Kabul regime has a political alternative to the
military track by further pushing its declared process of
intra-Afghan dialogues that will eventually lead the crisis to a
peaceful end.
</P>
<P>
The Rabbani-controlled Kabul Radio has hailed the
Rabbani-Hekmatyar reconciliation as part of the political process
initiated by the government.
</P>
<P>
Since February this year, representatives of Rabbani and
Hekmatyar had held many rounds of talks on the reconciliation
issue.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Rabbani and Hekmatyar met for the first time since
early 1994 when Hekmatyar, former prime minister of Rabbani's
regime, unleashed an abortive military coup with Uzbek General
Rashid Dostum.
</P>
<P>
Some Hezb sources said Rabbani had offered them the offices of
prime minister, defense minister and finance minister, while
Rabbani's side would retain the offices of president and foreign,
interior and national security ministers in a broadened
administration.
</P>
<P>
No formal and official statements on the power distribution are
available so far.
</P>
<P>
According to the analysts, power struggle is a major
characteristic of the Afghan civil war and a proper power
distribution among all Afghan factions is the key to the final
solution to the country's crisis.

<P>
HARARE, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Affairs Minister Stan
Mudenge announced today that Zimbabwe will host the 34th
Organization of African Unity (OAU) summit in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe will also become a member of OAU's Central Organ on
Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution, he added.
</P>
<P>
"It will be an occasion not only for the people of Zimbabwe,
but the whole of southern Africa to say thank you to the OAU,"
said Mudenge in a message commemorating Africa Unity Day which
falls on today.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it will be the first time in more than 20 years
that the OAU leaders will be meeting in southern Africa. The last
summit was held in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
As the in-coming chairman, he said, Zimbabwe will become "a
member of the OAU's Central Organ on Conflict Prevention,
Management and Resolution, a challenge which the country is able
and willing to take up given our wealth of experience in
peace-keeping operations."
</P>
<P>
He added, "it is only through economic development that the
continent can effectively address the burning issues of
eliminating disease, hunger and poverty."
</P>
<P>
"As we celebrate this important Africa Unity Day," said
Mudenge, "I appeal to all Zimbabweans to rededicate themselves to
the unity, peace, stability and prosperity of the African
continent in the knowledge that we owe it partly to the OAU that
we are liberated."

<HEADLINE> Chirac Urges Full Implementation of Dayton Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 25 (Xinhua) -- President Jacques Chirac today
appealed for the Dayton peace accord to be fully implemented as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Carl Bildt, the international community's top
civilian representative in Bosnia, Chirac said all parties
involved should abide strictly by the timetable set in the Dayton
agreements, including holding general elections in September.
</P>
<P>
On reconstruction in Bosnia, devastated by a 43-month war,
Chirac regretted that the United States paid only 200 million
U.S. dollars in aid to the former Yugoslav region and said it is
not enough.
</P>
<P>
He said most of the aid was still provided by the European
Union, which paid 800 million U.S. dollars in reconstruction aid.
</P>
<P>
The aid to the war-torn Bosnia should be shared by thirds
between the European Union, the United States and other countries.
</P>
<P>
Bildt, responsible for the civilian side of the Dayton peace
accord, called on the warring parties in Bosnia to honor the
accord, initialed last December in Dayton, Ohio, and do their best
to safeguard a lasting peace there.
</P>
<P>
Bildt was in Paris to attend a meeting of the steering board of
the Peace Implementation Council set up as part of the Dayton
agreement to help ensure it is carried out. He is the PIC's High
Representative in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The PIC is made up of more than 40 states and 10 international
organizations, including Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan,
Russia, the United States, the European Union and the Organization
of Islamic Conference.
</P>
<P>
The steering committee is reviewing progress made towards
staging elections and plans for economic reconstruction.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Hezbollah Warns Against "Anti-Islamic" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 25 (Xinhua) -- More than 2,000 Iranian extremists
today staged a rally in protest against the growing "anti-Islamic"
trend in the country.
</P>
<P>
Holding banners and slogans in the middle of the busiest Vali-
ye-Asr Square, members of Ansar Hezbollah shouted "Our culture is
Islam. Our culture is Quran."
</P>
<P>
A member of Ansar Hezbollah identified himself as Ali Islami
told Xinhua that "we hold this big rally with an aim to arouse the
whole society to observe the Islamic value."
</P>
<P>
The man said that the Ansar Hezbollah wants the Iranian
government to pay greater attention to the "anti-Islamic" trend.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Ansar Hezbollah has found some officials from
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani's government and the Tehran
Municipality are eager to have relations with the West
countries. But they should be aware the problem of Westernization
in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The man said that they are against any form or sign of
Westernization in the country, and stressed the need for observing
the Islamic code, especially the part on the Islamic wear for the
women.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believed that today's demonstration is part of
the efforts by the Iranian hardliners to wage hash attacks against
moderate President Rafsanjani in a bid to weak his position.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei recently lashed out at some
Iranian officials who attempted to resume relations with the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei warned that relations between Tehran and Washington
will have no benefits for the Iranian nation.
</P>
<P>
However, Mohammad Reyshahry, an influential clergyman, noted in
today's newspaper that the efforts to weaken the Rafsanjani
government would be against the Islamic values.
</P>
<P>
He noted that members of the Parliament have the justification
of criticizing the government, but they should not dishonor the
government.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah faction is opposed to any changes and reforms
implemented or proposed the moderate Rafsanjani government and
some newly-elected parliament deputies.
</P>
<P>
They regard any relaxation of strict Islamic codes like the
head-to-toe black chadore robes and separation of sexes and any
introduction of western academic values as breaches of the Islamic
principles.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Higher Education Minister Ignatius
Chombo has urged Zimbabwean youths to preserve the country's
unity to ensure that peace and stability prevailed.
</P>
<P>
At an African Day celebration in Bulawayo, the country's
second largest city, the minister told students that although
many African countries were politically free from colonialism and
oppression, they remained enslaved and conquered by tribalism
that lead to atrocious wars and regional conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot talk of pan-African unity if we are not united in
our individual states. Charity begins at home," Chombo said,
adding that youths should accept each other and share the
country's resources equally.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Organization of African Unity (OAU), through the
respective governments, to implement policies that stimulate
feelings of pan-African patriotism.
</P>
<P>
"Cooperation throughout and among states is not and should not
only be on political issues but should embrace social and
cultural inter-action," Chombo said.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that the journey to prosperity would not be
completed without total economic independence and improved
agricultural and industrial development.
</P>
<P>
"In today's competitive times, it is imperative for youth not
only to plan on getting respective qualifications but to effect
positive change in the system," he said.

<P>
HONG KONG, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions Indonesia
achieved their goal of scoring their first ever back-to-back
victory after they beat arch rivals China in the final of the 16th
Uber Cup world women's badminton team championships here today.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia defeated China 4-1 for their third win in the event.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia won Uber Cup in 1994, 20 years after its first
victory. The win brought to a stop Chinese triumphant advance
which featured five consecutive win since their first appearance
in the event in 1984.
</P>
<P>
And the Chinese lost to a team which they should have beaten
without much trouble.
</P>
<P>
It was experience against youth in the first singles, between
Indonesia's ace and Olympic champion Susi Susanti and China's
world number one Ye Zhaoying.
</P>
<P>
Ye, with smashes to the corners and drop shots, won the opening
game 11-4.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian came back strongly in the second, launching long
smashes and drop shots which forced Ye to retreat to the back
court.
</P>
<P>
But it was the numerous unforced errors on the Chinese side
that decided the fate, with Susanti taking the game 11-5 to level
the score.
</P>
<P>
Susanti went on with her old-style play in the decisive rubber,
reaching an initial 8-0 lead. Ye managed to narrow the gap at 5-9
with her patient play. But it was her unforced errors again that
cost her the chance to win. Susanti took the game again in 11-5.

The third game went sea-sawed, with the Indonesians missing no
chance to attack while the Chinese combining their usual defensive
play with some kind of attacks. The change seemed to work as they
came from a six-point deficit at 11-5 to level at 12-12. And from
then on the Chinese were back to the track and took the game 15-12
and the match 2-1.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's 15-year-old new star Mia Audina did not have much
problem in beating her Chinese opponent -- Wang Chen of 19 years
old. The two each took one of their two meetings last year. And
today Audina won two games to none for Wang, 11-4, 11-6, bringing
the Indonesian team to a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
Indonesians Lili Tampi and Finarsih won the crucial second
doubles 15-9, 15-10 over Chinese opponents Qin Yiyuan and Tang
Yongshu. The Chinese demonstrated excellent defensive play in the
early stage of the match but they gradually lost the ground. Some
unforced errors cost them dearly.
</P>
<P>
As a Chinese return went wide, which sealed the Indonesian win
for the game and, in fact, the tie overall, things went wild for
Indonesia. Players and coaches on the benches rushed onto the
court and braced their doubles players, with tears rolling down
cheeks.
</P>
<P>
The third singles and final match were actually meaningless as
the Indonesians had already secured that they would bring the
sport's most coveted trophy back to Jakarta days later.
</P>
<P>
Defending champions Indonesia will take on Denmark in the
Thomas Cup final here tomorrow evening. The Danes are the only
European side into the finals of the world badminton team
championships.

<P>
The Chinese vice premier also noted that the Malaysian
government led by Prime Minister Mahathir pursues a policy of
independence and has scored remarkable achievements in the
nation's development. On the international arena, the Malaysian
government upholds justice and strives to defend the interests of
the developing countries, Zhu said.

LONDON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Leon Brittan, Vice-President of the
European Commission, criticized Prime Minister John Major today
for "playing an anti-European card"to win votes over the current
beef crisis.
</P>
<P>
Brittan told Independent Television that such a ploy would be
dangerous and was not "an election winning gambit".
</P>
<P>
"What may seem attractive at one moment may seem less
attractive at another moment," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the pro-Europeans within the Conservative party to
unite to stop the beef crisis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lord Plumb, leader of the UK Conservative members of
the European Parliament (MEP), strongly criticized Tory
Eurosceptics for their "hysteria"and "bizarre behavor" over the
beef crisis, report BBC TV this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was irresponsible to use the beef crisis to try
to pull out of Europe.
</P>
<P>
He said his European colleagues would be working with other
MEPs to help find a Europe-wide solution.

Lord Plumb said, "We have decided to set up a group between

<HEADLINE> Rise In Electricity Demand Causing Power Cuts In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Tremendous rise in demand for
electricity has been causing power interruptions regularly in
Uganda, reported the local daily "The New Vision" today.
</P>
<P>
The acting managing director of Uganda Electricity Board
(UEB), Simon D'ujanga was quoted as saying that the frequent and
erratic power cuts are not determined by UEB but by the
tremendous rise in demand for electricity from consumers.
</P>
<P>
"We can only stop load shedding if we can produce sufficient
electricity at Owen Falls Dam in Jinja (80 kilometers east of
Kampala, Uganda's sole power station)", said D'ujanga.
</P>
<P>
The power station is producing far below market demand.
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, UEB consumers have been subjected to power
shortages and after the extension of the Owen Falls Dam, the
power station will generate an additional 200 megawatts, with 30
megawatts of these coming on in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Jinja Power Station is now capable of producing only 162
megawatts while the power requirement at peak hours between 7:00
pm and 10:00 pm, is 228 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
D'ujanga said the peak hour demand for electricity is growing
at the rate of approximately 2 percent per month.
</P>
<P>
So, he said, "inevitably every evening we must knock off 40
megawatts at the station."

<HEADLINE> Two Million Ugandans With HIV By Year 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The figure of 1.5 million Ugandans
with HIV is expected to rise to two million by the year 2000,
reported Radio Uganda today,
</P>
<P>
The director general of Uganda AIDS Commission Omwony Ojwok
was quoted as saying that this is a situation which demands
urgent attention.
</P>
<P>
He noted that infection is rising sharply in youths especially
the females at a time of decreasing resources with no immediate
drug and vaccine developed to combat it.
</P>
<P>
Addressing district veterinary, agricultural and fisheries
officers on how to handle people affected and infected with
HIV/AIDS during a seminar held here on Friday, Ojwok said
Uganda's "window of hope" in the fight against HIV/AIDS lies in
saving children between five and fourteen years from getting
infected.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that underlying factors like poverty, no voice
for women and poor parenting had aggravated the HIV/AIDS problem.
</P>
<P>
So, he called on district aids coordination committees in the
country to focus on the underlying factors, analyze them and get
priorities on how to handle them.
</P>
<P>
He also urged them to encourage youths to get involved in
income generating activities so as to reduce redundancy which
expose them to HIV/AIDS risks.

<HEADLINE> National Party Aims to Rule S. Africa Again: De </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The National Party (NP) is
moving into a new gear in the forthcoming local government
elections and will not stop until it becomes the majority party
again in South Africa, Deputy President F W De Klerk said today.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk is also leader of the National Party (NP).
</P>
<P>
The local government elections in the NP-controlled Western
Cape Province are scheduled to be held on May 29.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an audience of about 5,000 wildly enthusiastic NP
supporters at his party's final election rally in Cape Town, De
Klerk said the Wednesday's poll is not just about local
government, it is also the start of the 1999 general election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
On May 9, De Klerk announced the NP would withdraw from the
government of National Unity on June 30, citing the new
constitution does not make any provision for continued joint
decision making in the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The NP, which ruled South Africa since 1948, is a party which
has had the courage to say it is sorry its past policy had hurt
people, and which had "killed and buried apartheid forever", said
De Klerk.
</P>
<P>
He said the NP wishes to say to the African National Congress
(ANC) it is time discipline was restored in South Africa and time
for the death penalty to be brought back.
</P>
<P>
He added the NP stands for norms and standards aimed at making
South Africa a "decent" country as opposed to the "smut" the ANC
wants to introduce through the new constitution.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's new democratic constitution was adopted on May
8 by the constitutional assembly with overwhelming majority.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Self-Confident Hariri Decides not </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-
Hariri has announced that he and the members of his inner circle
would not run for the membership of the parliament in the Beirut
constituency.
</P>
<P>
It seems that the announcement, which Hariri made to the
Beirut Safir daily Friday night, was a concession to the
oppositions' demand for a separation between the government and
the parliament, or between the legislative and executive
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Political observers see that the decision to quit the
parliamentary election contest, which is likely to be held in the
next few months, shows Hariri's self-confidence on his ability to
continuously lead Lebanon's ambitious reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Being the prime minister for the longest term since Lebanon's
civil war, Hariri took office in October 1992, and formed a
widely representing national reconciliation government. In a major
reshuffle in May 1995, he successfully cleared main dissidents out
of his government.
</P>
<P>
Seizing the opportunity of the oil flourish in 1970s, he
established a gigantic Hariri business empire in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of 1980s, Hariri returned to his country and
started his political life. As one of the active members in the
parliament, he took part in initiating the 1989 Taif Accord, which
led to the end of the 15-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
Hariri has a dual capacity, the head of the government and a
member in the Lebanese unicameral house.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that Hariri announced his decision to stay away
from the parliamentary election campaign at a time when his
popularity has reached such an extent that no body else can
hardly match him in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
When he took office, Hariri gave the priority to the post-war
reconstruction. Since then, his government has scored brilliant
achievements in this regard, his country has become a "big
building site," and its position as a Middle East financial and
trade center has been partly restored.
</P>
<P>
During and after the large-scale blitz Israel launched in south
Lebanon last month, Hariri rushed around the world, making
intensive efforts to win international sympathies and supports.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Self-Confident Hariri Decides not </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By these efforts, he has attracted large sums of financial
aids for the restoration of the infrastructures damaged by Israel
in the recent military strikes and for the Lebanese
reconstruction projects masterminded by himself.
</P>
<P>
All these have won for him unanimous praise in the country
when the domestic problems, for which Hariri as well as his
government used to be blamed, were rapidly eased during the
Israeli aggression.
</P>
<P>
It would be very easy for Hariri and the members of his team
to obtain victories if they decide to enter into the election
contest. However, observers see three main reasons for Hariri to
make the contrary decision:
</P>
<P>
First, the decision is aimed at avoiding setting more people
against himself and having negative effects on his efforts to
maintain the national unity, which was shown during the recent
Israeli military operations and is very useful for Hariri's
government to carry on the reconstruction works.
</P>
<P>
Hariri's main political rivals are in the north part of the
country, but that does not mean that if he enters the
parliamentary election contest, he will not push other competitors
in his Beirut constituency to the opposition front.
</P>
<P>
Second, instead of bringing him any benefit, his entering the
parliamentary election contest would most likely draw troubles for
him.
</P>
<P>
Hariri, by attracting internal and external supports, has laid
a firm foundation for his continuous hold of the political
position. He does not see any advantage to challenge the tolerance
of both the Lebanese oppositions and Syria toward the unlimited
expansion of his power.
</P>
<P>
Third, the decision will help maintain his image before the
Lebanese people and safeguard it from being utilized by some
politicians for personal goals.
</P>
<P>
Even Hariri refrains from entering the parliamentary election
campaign, he can still be confident that the oppositions will not
obtain an upper hand in the house.

<HEADLINE> Peres, Netanyahu Offer Widely Different Goals in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Incumbent Prime Minister Shimon
Peres and his challenger Binyamin Netanyahu have explicitly laid
out their goals during the election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Peres hopes to complete the peacemaking mission by 1999 and
possibly beyond to realize his "New Middle East" dream. At 72, he
believes he is the very man who can lead his country on a long
march to the destination by making peace with the Palestinians and
Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
He sees Islamic fundamentalism led by Iran as the most
dangerous enemy to the Jewish state in a post-cold war era. "I see
a race between us and the fundamentalists reaching its peak by the
year 2000. My mission is to win that race," he said.
</P>
<P>
To this end, he declared, "We need to do three major
things: to eliminate the old animosities, so the coalition
against fundamentalism will not be just Israeli, but will include
Arabs and others too. In other words, we have to make
peace. Secondly, we have to create better economic conditions in
the region. Poverty is the food of fundamentalism. thirdly, we
have to build a coalition against Iran, headed by the United
States, and prevent Iran from going nuclear."
</P>
<P>
At an angle of a strategic position, Peres sees the difference
between him and his challenger. He warns that what may appear to
be a thin line between Labor and Likud could amount to what he
called a potentially "tragic difference."
</P>
<P>
Peres indicated that "the differences between us and the Likud
are deep. the Likud looks on (Palestinian) autonomy as the final
settlement, and we see autonomy as a station on the way to a
permanent solution. For them, autonomy means they have the right
to settle in the West Bank, and that will destroy everything we
accomplished."
</P>
<P>
He said, "Likud is a federation of different groups, one
headed by Raful (Rafael Eitan), another by David Levy, a third by
the settlers and a fourth by Ariel Sharon. What unites them is
not what the leader says, but a return to settlement policy. this
will mean money for settlements instead of education and
infrastructure."
</P>
<P>
"And it will make an agreement with the Palestinians
impossible. Again the Palestinian issue will become an open
wound. They will turn the West bank into a huge mess, with no hope
of lines of separation between us and the Palestinians," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the peace process which has traversed nearly three years
since the Oslo accord between Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO) in 1993, Peres noted, "To complete the
negotiations with the Palestinians and to convert the negotiations
with Syria into negotiations with the rest of the Arab world, I
hope to mobilize the international community to help."

<HEADLINE> Peres, Netanyahu Offer Widely Different Goals in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peres foresees that fat red dividends will stem from the peace
process. "If this is done, the Israeli economy will continue to
grow, overtaking British per-capita GNP. I want to invest heavily
in education so that every young Israeli will be able to attend
university, whether he can afford it or not."
</P>
<P>
Peres said, "I want to develop the spiritual side of Jewish
life. We have realized the material side of Herzl's dream. Now we
have to turn to the spiritual aspects, and make Jerusalem a center
of tradition and Jewish values. We have to transform Israel, from
being simply a shelter from persecution, to an invitation to
Jewish continuity."
</P>
<P>
The 47-year-old Likud leader, Netanyahu, paints a completely
different picture for the future of the 48-year-old Jewish
state. He does not believe in the viability of peace with what he
termed "dictators," and sees Israel's long-term survival in terms
of size -- economy, population and land.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that a peace treaty that involves relinquishing
Israel's vital assets, including the Golan Heights and West Bank,
"will not produce peace, but the very opposite."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Oslo accords the Labor-led government
concluded with the PLO, he said, "My point about Oslo (Accords)
was that we don't like it, never did." "This government has left
us with a very bad agreement and a difficult situation on the
ground," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
On the approach to peace, Netanyahu said, "We have to proceed
toward peace, but with a different policy. First we will make sure
the Palestinians keep their side of the bargain. An agreement
can't bind only the Israeli side. Second, we'll offer them a fair
deal, where they can control every aspect of their lives except
for two areas -- foreign policy and security, which are essential
for Israel's survival. Third, we'll make clear that we'll keep the
unity of Jerusalem by removing PLO offices from the city."
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians demand more. They want a full-fledged armed
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital. We won't give
them that, but we are prepared to give a great deal: arrangements
that offer them minimal interference in their lives, and offer us
maximum security," he declared.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of economic development and country building,
Netanyahu draws up a blueprint similar to Peres'. He said, "At
present we have one of the most controlled economies. We need a
series of rapid liberalization efforts. This means privatization,
release of public land, deregulation and investment in
technological education for children from grade 1."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu declared, "Israel can be one of the most advanced
economies, in the top 15 in the world. We can double the
per-capita GNP in less than a decade -- and double our population
through immigration and increased natural birthrate over the next
15 years. We could have an economy of a quarter-trillion dollars."

<HEADLINE> Oman Provides Palestinians 7-Million Dollar Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Sultan Qaboos of Oman has
provided 7 million U.S. dollars of aid to the Palestinian people
to alleviate their suffering, the official Oman New Agency (ONA)
reported today.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting between Sultan Qaboos and visiting Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat, the two sides decided to set up
representative offices in Muscat and Gaza as soon as possible, ONA
said.
</P>
<P>
Sultan Qaboos and Arafat talked about issues of common concern
and ways to boost bilateral relations between the two sides during
their meeting.
</P>
<P>
They discussed the latest developments in the Arab and
international arenas and ways to push forward the Middle East
peace process in order to achieve security and stability in the
Palestinian territories and the whole region.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival to Muscat earlier today, Arafat said in a
statement that the main aim of his visit was to brief Sultan
Qaboos the situation in the self-ruled Palestinian areas and the
difficulties faced by the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Oman, a member country of the Gulf Cooperation Council, also
has good relations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres visited Oman on April 1
this year and held talks with Sultan Qaboos.
</P>
<P>
Peres is the second Israel Government head visiting the
Sultanate, with which Israel has not yet established diplomatic
ties. Late Israeli Premier Yitzhak Rabin visited Oman in
December 1994.
</P>
<P>
Israel Tuesday opened a trade office in Oman, its first in
a Gulf state.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Ready to Restore Ties with Gulf War Allies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 25 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi senior official has said
that his government will be ready to develop bilateral ties with
all countries in the world and restore diplomatic relations
with 1991 Gulf war allies, excluding the United States.
</P>
<P>
Sa'ad Hamoudi, chairman of the Iraqi Foreign Relations
Committee, was quoted today by the Iraqi News Agency as saying
that Iraq is preparing for restoring diplomatic ties with those
states which turned against Iraq in the 1991 Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
He said that a number of countries are currently studying the
feasibility of rapprochement with Iraq. Iraq and Egypt are in
close contact for the discussion of resuming diplomatic ties in
the earliest possible date, he added.
</P>
<P>
But the Iraqi official ruled out the possibility of resuming
its diplomatic relations with the United States, which led the
multi-states forces fighting against Iraq in the gulf war.
</P>
<P>
A number of countries, including the United States, Britain,
Italy, France, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, broke their diplomatic
relations with Baghdad during the 1991 Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
Syria, one of the Gulf war allies, severed its diplomatic ties
with Baghdad in 1981 because of the ideologic differences between
the rulers of the two countries. Recently Iraqi official media
called for the improvement of its ties with neighboring Syria.

<HEADLINE> IPTF Protests Arrests of UNICEF Officials by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The International Police Task
Force (IPTF) protested with Bosnian Croat authorities today over
the arrest of a UNICEF delegation in Drvar for allegedly filming
military facilities.
</P>
<P>
IPTF spokesman Patrick Svensson told reporters in Sarajevo that
the delegation had planned to film a well-known historic site --
Tito's cave near Drvar in western Bosnia controlled by the Bosnian
Croats.
</P>
<P>
Towards the end of the Second World War, Josip Broz Tito, the
then-Partisan leader and later lifetime president of the former
Yugoslavia until he died in 1980, had his headquarters based in
the cave to fight against the German invaders and finally drove
them out.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Croat police on Thursday arrested the UNICEF delegation
members, headed by goodwill Ambassador Tetsuko Kuroyanagi of
Japan, as well as some reporters who accompanied them, and
detained them for five hours, according to Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
The agency said they were taken to the police station and
released after interrogation.
</P>
<P>
The police had seized the bus rented by the UNICEF delegation
for the occasion as well as all the cameras and films.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF has also lodged a strong protest with Interior Minister
Avdo Hebib and Foreign Minister Jadranko Prlic of the Muslim-Croat
federation.

<HEADLINE> Tibetology Originated in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- China enjoys exceptional advantages
in the research of Tibetology - because it is the very country in
which Tibetology originated.
</P>
<P>
Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, vice-chairman of the National Committee
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),
made the remark at a recent forum marking the tenth anniversary of
the China Tibetology Research Center.
</P>
<P>
The vice-chairman called on the center to "refute the fallacy
that 'China has destroyed Tibetan culture and trampled human
rights in Tibet', by applying full and accurate data and the
latest scientific findings."
</P>
<P>
Doje Cedain, director of the China Tibetology Research Center,
noted that "as one important member of the Chinese nation, Tibetan
nationality has been living on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, in the
southwestern part of China, for thousands and thousands of years."
</P>
<P>
"The Tibetan nationality and other Chinese nationalities have
been learning from each other for thousands of years and jointly
created the civilization of the Chinese nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, certain international anti-China forces and the Dalai
Lama group have randomly distorted the history and the present
condition of Tibet under the guise of Tibetology for quite a long
time, in an aim to turn Tibet into a breakthrough point in their
"splitting China" strategy.
</P>
<P>
Founded on May 20, 1986, the China Tibetology Research Center
concentrates on researching the history, the present condition and
the future of Tibetan nationality, in a move to serve the
unification of the motherland and the unity of all China's ethnic
nationalities.
</P>
<P>
"The fundamental aim of the center is to promote the reform and
opening up drive, as well as the modernization process, of Tibet
and other Tibetan-inhabited areas," the director said.
</P>
<P>
The past ten years have seen the center engaged in a series of
key state research projects, including "Research into the
Relationships between Tibet and the Central Governments Since
the Yuan Dynasty" and "The Environment and Development of the
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau".
</P>
<P>
A state-level publishing house, the center's China Tibetology
Publishing House, has published 222 books, most of which
are about Tibet and the Tibetan nationality.
</P>
<P>
In June, 1995 when the 7th International Symposium on
Tibetology was held in Austria, more than one hundred books
published in recent years by the publishing house were
exceptionally popular and all sold out before the end of the
symposium.

<HEADLINE> Britain Takes Measures to Combat Road Rage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The British government has come up
with a range of measures aimed at fighting road rage, which has
increased in Britain as car ownership has risen and the country's
roads have become ever more crowed.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times reported today that the new edition of the
learner-driver's guide, the Highway Code, due out in July, will
include advice on how to avoid verbal clashes, which are
increasingly escalating into violence and death.
</P>
<P>
The new Highway Code will give a number of suggestions to
defuse or avoid road rage.
</P>
<P>
It says that motorists should acknowledge a driving error that
annoys another motorist, avoid eye contact with other drivers to
defuse situations, relax after a stressed day with a walk before
driving, avoid tailgating, speeding or running red lights and
never leave the car if threatened.
</P>
<P>
A public campaign, including television advertisements, posters
and leaflets emphasising the need to stay calm if provoked, is
under discussion at the Home Office and the Department of
Transport, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Just five years ago, British police dismissed road rage as an
entirely American phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
But the number of violent incidents which took place in Britain
in recent months has increased the pressure for action. Last
week, a 21-year-old man was stabbed to death by another driver
after an altercation at traffic lights.

<HEADLINE> Ten Paper Mills Closed to Clean Huaihe River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Ten paper mills have been shut down
along the Huaihe River across the eastern part of China to reduce
pollution.
</P>
<P>
The blow for the factories, whose annual production capacity is
below 5,000 tons of paper, came after the government of Huainan
City, a coal and chemical industry base, handed over the right to
shut down any small-sized factories causing severe pollution, to
its environmental protection bureau.
</P>
<P>
The bureau will also be the first agency to consider approving
new industrial projects.
</P>
<P>
China is determined to clean up the Huaihe River, a mighty
river after the Yangtze River and the Yellow River, by the end of
the century.

NANJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Fuji Bank of Japan has been
given approval by China's Central Bank to open a representative
office in Nanjing, capital city of East China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
It will be the fourth foreign bank entering Jiangsu,
following Standard Chartered Bank, the Bank of Nagoya and the
International Bank of Paris &AMP; Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the People's Bank of China said that the Bank of
Tokyo and the Tokyo Marine and Fire Insurance Co. have also

<P>
Dong Jianting, an official from the Jiangsu branch of the
central bank, said that only the Standard Chartered Bank has a
branch in Jiangsu, which issued loans of more than 16 million US
dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
He said that Jiangsu is one of the major targets for foreign
banks in Shanghai, and the city obtained 366 million US dollars in
loans from them, which accounted for one-third of the province's
direct foreign debt by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
He said that Jiangsu will encourage more foreign banks to set
up branches, while strengthening cooperation with foreign banks in
Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Work to Start on New Nuclear Power Plant in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Construction of another nuclear
power plant is set to start within a few weeks, officials have
revealed.
</P>
<P>
And at least four more nuclear plants across the country are in
the pipeline waiting for government approval after passing
pre-feasibility studies.
</P>
<P>
China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) officials revealed
that construction of the new nuclear power plant, or the second
phase of Qinshan project, will start early next month in east
China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The two generating units of the new plant, each with a capacity
of 600,000 kilowatts, are expected to go into operation at the
beginning of next century.
</P>
<P>
In another development, CNNC officials said construction of
nuclear power plants in Jiangsu, Shandong, Fujian and Jiangxi
provinces have passed pre-feasibility studies, but the projects
are waiting for the approval of the State Planning Commission and
other relevant authorities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, CNNC reported that the country's existing two
nuclear power plants have generated more power in the first four
months of the year, compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In the January-April period, the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant
in south China's Guangdong Province generated electricity of 2.47
billion kwh, up 28 percent over last year's corresponding period.
</P>
<P>
In total the two plants generated a total power output of 2.9
billion kwh during the four months, 14 percent more than in the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Power output at the other nuclear power plant at Qinshan fell
to 450 million kwh, because engines in the plant were shut down
for a period of time for refueling.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Colorful Yangko dancers may liven up
the streets of Beijing. But the constant drum beating is a real
ear splitter for many city folk.
</P>
<P>
They flooded a telephone hotline in the capital with complaints
about noise pollution - with many of them citing the non stop
racket of Yanko dancers.
</P>
<P>
Beijing opened the hotline recently specially to handle
complaints about environmental pollution. Local residents showed
that noise pollution tops the list.
</P>
<P>
The telephone hotline, opened by an environmental protection
law enforcement inspection team under the Standing Committee of
the National People's Congress, received 1,652 complaints from
local residents between May 20 and 23.
</P>
<P>
A report shows that 402 items of them had been solved.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 28 percent of the complaints were about
noise pollution, 23 percent about air pollution, 15 percent about
solid wastes and 10 percent about water pollution.
</P>
<P>
Noise pollution in the city was mainly from motor vehicles,
constructions sites, pedlars' hawking and even yangko dancing in
the streets, according to the complaints.
</P>
<P>
Qu Geping and Zeng Xianlin, senior officials with the NPC
Standing Committee, have toured some of the places with serious
pollution problems and pledged to take effective measures to solve
these problems as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Rebel Leader Agrees to Hold Talks with Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Chechen separatist leader Zelimkhan
Yandarbiyev, who took power over in the rebel camp after Dzhokhar
Dudayev's death, has agreed to come to moscow for peace talks
scheduled for Monday, his spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Itar-Tass news agency, Movladi Udugov,
"information minister" of the separatist camp, said by telephone
that Yandarbiyev will lead the separatist delegation to the talks
proposed by Moscow.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chechen rebel leader sees the coming talks as "a
meeting of two presidents," Itar-Tass pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Vorkuta in Russia's far north on Sunday, Russian
President Boris Yeltsin confirmed that he would hold talks with
Yandarbiyev in searching for a peaceful solution to the Chechen
crisis, but stressed that Chechnya must not break away from the
Russian Federation.
</P>
<P>
Udugov also told Itar-Tass that Yandarbiyev would be
accompanied during the upcoming Moscow trip by Akhmed Zakayev, a
"commander of the south-western front" of Chechen rebel resistance.
</P>
<P>
"The State Defense Committee (of the rebel camp) has appointed
one of its members as acting president of (the Republic of)
Ichkeria for the period of his (Yandarbiyev's) absence and for
emergencies," Udugov said, without giving the name of the "acting
president."
</P>
<P>
"However," he continued, "because of the military activity of
Russian troops, this trip is, in the opinion of my state committee
members, threatened with failure."
</P>
<P>
Udugov stressed that "all depends on the conditions which are
emerging and on fulfillment of preliminary accords which have been
reached with mediation of the mission of the OSCE (Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe)."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a Moscow-backed Chechen government's delegation to
the Monday talks has arrived in Moscow, Itar-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the Russian Federal Commission for the Chechen
Settlement held a close-door meeting, the news agency said, giving
no details.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Gaddafi Hold Talks on Second Consecutive Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
visiting Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi held talks on the second
consecutive day here today.
</P>
<P>
The talks mainly covered bilateral relations and ways of
overcoming all Arab differences and closing Arab ranks with the
aim of realizing an integrated and diversified Arab economy,
Egyptian Information Minister Safwat el-Sherif told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders called for Arab unity under the umbrella of the
Arab League and stressed the necessity of creating a healthy Arab
atmosphere, Sherif said.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi, who arrived in Egypt Friday, held the first round of
talks with Mubarak in Cairo Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In today's talks, Gaddafi hailed relations between Libya and
Egypt, saying that his frequent meetings with Mubarak would serve
the best interests of the two countries and the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
It is the second time that Gaddafi has visited Egypt this
year. In January, he held talks with Mubarak at an Egyptian
military base at Sidi Barrani, some 80 kilometers east the
Egyptian-Libyan border.
</P>
<P>
Sherif said that Mubarak and Gaddafi also discussed bringing
closer different views regarding the Libya-West crisis,
referring to the Lockerbie issue.
</P>
<P>
Libya is seeking an end to the U.N. air, arms and diplomatic
embargo imposed after the country refused to hand over two Libyan
nationals suspected of bombing a Pan Am passenger plane over
Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. A total of 270 people were killed in
the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi had to travel to Egypt by land because of the U.N. ban
on air travel in or out of Libya.

<HEADLINE> Data Telecom Service Booms in Guangdong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province, one of
China's most vigorous coastal economies, invested 400 million yuan
in the fixed assests of data telecommunications business last year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the switching capacity of the public packet
exchange network (Chinapac) and digit and data network (DDN) was
expanded by 9,000 lines and 13,000 lines, respectively.
</P>
<P>
So far the data telecom service has extended its coverage to
all the cities and counties of the province, and some townships in
Pearl River Delta.
</P>
<P>
The country's largest financial data telecommunications network
has become operational in the province, connecting more than 1,000
ATMs (automatic teller machine).
</P>
<P>
Imported equipment plays an important role in the telecom
gallop. Last year saw the Chinapac import six Passport systems
from Canada, and the DDN began to use the US DACS-2 equipment.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the province provides internet services to 2,240
subscribers through the data telecom networks.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Authorities Urged to Take Real Action for Reunification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan authorities were today urged
to abandon the splittist route of "Two Chinas" and "One China,
One Taiwan" and take practical action towards the peaceful
reunification of China.
</P>
<P>
The call was made in a signed article entitled "Judge people by
their deeds, not just by their words", which was published here
today.
</P>
<P>
The article noted that the leader of Taiwan authorities said
in a speech delivered on May 20 that he will not pursue the policy
of "Taiwan Independence", and is willing to visit the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The article pointed out, however, that the leader aims to
create "Two Chinas" or "One China, One Taiwan" in the
international community becauses he plays up in his speech "to
continue to promote pragmatic diplomacy" and completely shuns away
from the one China principle, which is crucial to the relations
across the Taiwan Straits and the peaceful reunification of the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
It is the basis and pre-condition to stick to the "one China"
policy and oppose splitting and "Taiwan Independence" in the
course to develop the relations across the Taiwan Straits and
realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland, the article
says.
</P>
<P>
Since the regression occurred in relations across the Taiwan
Straits from last year all Chinese people on both sides of the
straits want Taiwan authorities to abandon the splittist route of
"Two Chinas" and "One China, One Taiwan", and take the one China
stand in real terms, and make practical efforts to improve and
develop relations across the Taiwan Straits, the article
said.

<HEADLINE> China Expects Summer Grain Bumper Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, May 26 (Xinhua) -- China is to have a bumper harvest
for summer grain despite unfavorable climatic conditions.
</P>
<P>
Effective disaster relief measures taken by all parts of the
country have played a key role.
</P>
<P>
A national agricultural conference held in Jiyuan City of
central China's Henan Province has predicted that provinces and
autonomous regions such as Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi and
Ningxia are expected to have big output increases in summer
grain. A record bumper harvest year, the second of its kind in the
history, is expected for rapeseed.
</P>
<P>
Liu Chengguo, vice minister of agriculture, told the conference
that there still exists some unfavorable factors for the summer
harvest which will start in some 10 days in north China.
</P>
<P>
He urged agricultural departments in north China to attach
importance to late-stage management, and that the double-harvest
rice areas in south China should do a good job in field management.
</P>
<P>
The vice minister also urged effective measures be taken to
encourage farmers to grow more summer cotton, since cotton growing
areas have dropped sharply this year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the lingering situation in wheat production, he
said that it is crucial to streamline the national seed market,
and action must be taken to crack down on all illegal activities
in seed trading.

advantage, outplayed Beijing Guo'an 3-1 to keep its leading
position with 17 points after seven rounds of the Chinese soccer

Wang Tao opened the scorings with eight minute gone, while
Beijing Guo'an managed to level at the 40th minute through Han Xu

However, Beijing's relief didn't last long as the home team
added two more goals in a span of three minutes.

Beijing Guo'an once strengthened their attack in the second
half but posed little challenge to the host.
</P>
<P>
Dalian, the only unbeaten team in the League, accumulated a
total of 17 points out of five wins and two ties.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Shanghai Shenhua also showed their
superiority to whitewash Shandong Taishan 2-0 on the home pitch
and was second in the overall standings, just one point off.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A Jordanian government spokesman said
here today that Jordan was shocked and stunned at the murder of
seven French monks in Algeria by terrorists.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman said Jordan condemns all terrorists
regardless of their motives, particularly the recent crime
committed against innocent people in Algeria under the disguise
of religion, which does not approve such ugly and criminal acts.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added the crime committed by the terrorist
groups can in no way be attributed to the subline principles of
religions.
</P>
<P>
He also told reporters that Jordan appeals to all nations to
resist the law of jungle and departure from human and religious
values.
</P>
<P>
He noted, while Jordan condemned the vicious crime, it
declares its full support for the Algerian government and its
measure to uproot the bloodthirsty gangs and to restore peace,
security and stability to Algeria.
</P>
<P>
The Armed Islamic Group, the most militant of Algeria's armed
factions, said in a communique to Algiers radio stations Medi 1
last Thursday that it had killed seven French monks last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The monks were kidnaped March 27 from their monastery near the
town of Medea, about 65 kilometers south of Algiers.

<HEADLINE> China Targets at Officials In Housing-related Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Corruption in public housing in China
is one of the major issues to be tackled under anti-corruption
efforts, a leading official has declared.
</P>
<P>
Hou Zongbin, vice-secretary of the Communist Party of China
Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, said the practice of
housing-related corruption by leading officials has not been
curbed in some areas over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
In order to improve the implementation of the party's policies
and decisions on leading officials and the way they carry out
housing tasks, the Central Committee has decided to act.
</P>
<P>
Hou said the commission has made the decision to list the
housing issue as one of the important elements to ensure that
leading officials are clean and honest.
</P>
<P>
Under the decision leading officials at county level and above
who have improved their own housing situation by using their power
will be dealt with.
</P>
<P>
The decision also calls for tough measures to curb the
practice of officials taking advantage of their own power to get
better housing.
</P>
<P>
Hou made the statement during a tour of investigation of Anhui
province, which ended today.
</P>
<P>
"Leading party and government officials at all levels should
understand the importance of solving the issue from the point of
politics, and must unify their thoughts and do a good job in
tackling the issue with high sense of political responsibility,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials with serious involvement in housing-related
corruption who refused to correct their mistakes will be dealt
with severely, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the next two months, the Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection will dispatch inspection groups to
investigate the issue in some provinces, cities and autonomous
regions.

Taiwan businesses investing in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
A Taiwan businessman commented that it is an irresistible
tendency for Taiwan-mainland economic and trade exchanges to
become busier, and that the reason the seminar is being held in
Tianjin is because a new wave of Taiwan investment is being
concentrated in the northern coastal area of the mainland.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Protest against Settlement Activity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of Palestinian residents
in the West Bank today gathered in protest against illegal
settlement activity, according to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian
press service based in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The protest took place when Israeli bulldozers started working
on leveling a plot of confiscated land in Mt. Abu Ghnaim in order
to open a street between Jerusalem-Bethlehem and Beit Sahour. The
Israelis carried out the activities in spite of the fact that
there is a court case on the confiscation of the land, and a court
verdict has not been issued yet.
</P>
<P>
The location of the bulldozing is near Elias Church, and the
street, as it is planned, will separate Jerusalem form Bethlehem
and Beit Sahour.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian residents went to obstruct the work of the
bulldozers, which then stopped working. A large of number of
Israeli troops were present.
</P>
<P>
Beit Sahour Mayor Al-Atrash told reporters that the settlement
activity has happened when the government is busy with election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres has promised to continue the
settlement freeze if he wins the elections, but his challenger
Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu has declared that he will step up
settlement activities if he comes to power.

<HEADLINE> China to Limit City Population Levels to Save Farmland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Population levels in China's big
cities will be limited under new guidelines aimed at controlling
city planning issued by the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The amount of land for construction purposes and the
populations of big cities must be limited to levels approved by
the year 2000, and should not be expanded, says a new circular
issued to every local government across the country.
</P>
<P>
The move follows concern expressed about the amount of valuable
rural and farming land swallowed up by rapid urbanization and city
expansions.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the State Council has called on local governments
to tighten control over city planning by strictly abiding by the
City Planning Ordinance.
</P>
<P>
According to the circular, governments at all levels and their
leading officials should safeguard the dignity of city planning,
and give full rein to the role of city planning in managing urban
land and space resources.
</P>
<P>
The circular says power on city planning must be under
centralized control and should not be delegated.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be made to save and make use of land resources
in a rational way, to impose strict controls over the size of
large cities and to develop medium-sized and small cities
rationally, says the circular.
</P>
<P>
The size of land for construction purposes in large cities with
one million urban residents should not be expanded in principle,
it says.
</P>
<P>
According to reports by major Chinese newspapers, a lot of
farmland has been depleted for industrial and construction
projects during the past five years.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto has announced a 30,000-rupee (857 US dollars) compensation

</P>
<P>
Each of the five injured in the blast this morning in Lahore,

dollars) as compensation.
</P>
<P>
Senior Minister of Punjab Malik Mushtaq Ahmed Awan disclosed
this when he visited the blast site, according to the Associated
Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
A postal department employee was killed and five others were

<HEADLINE> Poland to Curb Surging Food, Meat and Sugar Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Poland held a special agricultural
meeting Friday to curb the surging prices of staple food, meat and
sugar while increasing their reserves.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Wlodzimierz
Cimoszewicz and other senior government officials.
</P>
<P>
The meeting decided to extend the time period for tariff-free
grain imports from April to the end of this year, hoping that the
increased supplies on the domestic market will help stablize the
wheat price at 650 zlotys (250 dollars) per ton and rye at
400 zlotys (154 dollars).
</P>
<P>
In order to help boost the grain output, the Polish government
recently enhanced this years' low-interest loans available to the
agriculture sector to 630 million zlotys (243 million
U.S. dollars) from last year's 210 million zlotys (81 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
To guarantee domestic consumption, the Polish government also
adopted measures restricting the exports of certain agricultural
commodities and, by requiring food producers to tag the ex-factory
prices, prevented middlemen from making excessive profits.
</P>
<P>
As the world market has been seeing the hikes of grain prices,
some Polish farmers have stored their products since the beginning
of this year, driving up prices of processed food, meat and dairy
products.
</P>
<P>
The dire food situation in Poland has been exacerbated by the
delayed spring planting season which might lead to lower grain
output later this year.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Ruling Party Blamed for "Artificial Majority" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Two South Korean opposition parties
criticized today the ruling New Korea Party (NKP) for winning a
majority in the new National Assembly by inducing opposition and
independent lawmakers-elect to join the NKP.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition National Congress for New Politics (NCNP)
led by Kim Dae-jung and the conservative opposition United Liberal
Democrats (ULD) headed by Kim Jong-pil organized a joint outdoor
rally here today.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties urged the NKP to hold a parliamentary
hearing on corrupted election campaigns and revise election-
related laws to guarantee fair election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
The two Kims claimed in their speeches that the NKP's
"artificial" creation of majority in parliament is an act to
ignore the people's choice and destroy opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
They also said that the 15th National Assembly, which opens
early next month, will be managed by dialogues and negotiations
only if the ruling party and the government show a faithful
attitude to accept demands of the opposition camp.
</P>
<P>
In the 15th South Korean National Assembly elections held on
April 11, the ruling NKP headed by President Kim Young-sam won 139
seats, 11 short of a simple majority in the 299-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, the NKP later secured 150 seats by admitting 11
opposition and independent lawmakers-elect.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Better Manage Non-State-Run Economic Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government will take a
number of measures to better manage the non-state-run economic
sector, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The measures are aimed at ensuring all establishments, which
have adequate conditions for business, are registered, pay tax and
strictly implement the accounting and statistics collection
systems, the Vietnam News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Management, registration and taxation of non-state-run
businesses, which employ a workforce of more than 3.5 million
people, have not been strictly implemented, it reported.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the General Statistics Office show there are
nearly 1.9 million individual economic households in Vietnam, of
which only 34.6 percent have been registered for business, and of
those registered, only 43.3 percent pay tax.
</P>
<P>
Besides, there are about 16,000 non-state-run enterprises in
the country, including nearly 11,000 private companies, 138 joint
stock companies and more than 4,000 limited liability companies.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of the non-state-run enterprises are engaged
in trading, hotel industry and services, and nearly 35 percent in
capital construction.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Makes Steady Progress in Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has made substantial
achievements and gains in education since the kingdom won its
independence in 1946.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Educational Committee of Jordan was formed in 1954
and a law on education was passed in 1955 under which the
compulsory education all over the kingdom would last nine years.
</P>
<P>
And in 1988, a new law on education was passed under which
compulsory education would last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
A Jordanian Education Ministry high-ranking official told
reporters that the number of schools in Jordan rose from 141 in
1950 to 3,807 in 1993, the number of school teachers from 476 in
1950 to 55,258 in 1993, while the number of school-goers rose
from 24,258 in 1950 to 1,181,575 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
He added that, as a result of the educational policy drafted
by the Jordanian government on personal directives from King
Hussein, the number of school-goers all over the country reached
1,289,955 in the scholastic year 1995/96, the number of school
teachers reached 60,921 and the number of schools reached 4,224.
</P>
<P>
According to an official census released early this year, the
population of Jordan is 4.17 million.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the efforts made by the Jordanian government in the
field of education, illiteracy rate dropped from 67.6 percent in
1961 to 13 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's education budget for the year 1996 amounted to 198.7
million Jordanian dinars (about 140.9 million U.S. dollars),
accounting for 11.39 percent of the state budget.
</P>
<P>
During the 1980s and 1990s, the process of education in Jordan has
been closely linked to the national economic and social
development plans.
</P>
<P>
Some Arab countries, especially the Gulf state, have asked for
a number of Jordanian school teachers to contribute to the process of
instruction in their own schools.
</P>
<P>
Jordan had sent in the 1970s and 1980s a large number of its
school teachers to Yemen and Kuwait and other Arab countries to
meet their educational needs.

<P>
CAIRO, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's Supreme Military Court today
sentenced an Egyptian accused of spying for Israel to life
imprisonment with hard labor, the Middle East News Agency (MENA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Malek Abdel-Moneim Hamed, a former volunteer navy
sergeant, has been charged with providing Israel with information
about Egypt's vital military installations for money. The military
prosecutor had sought a death sentence for Hamed.
</P>
<P>
Hamed, a resident of the village of Nawasa El-Gheit at the Nile
Delta, has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor says that Hamed received sophisticated espionage
training.
</P>
<P>
Hamed's case was the second espionage trail involving Israel in
two months.
</P>
<P>
On April 14, an Egyptian court sentenced Amer Salman to life
imprisonment with hard labor for spying for Israel for 12 years.

<HEADLINE> 4 Bomb Blasts Occur in Pakistan in 2 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Today's bomb blast in Lahore,
metropolis of Punjab province in Pakistan is the fourth one in or
around Lahore in a span of two months.
</P>
<P>
On May 8, seven people were killed and 35 others injured in a
bus bomb in Shekhupura, a district headquarters some 35 kilometers
northwest of Lahore.
</P>
<P>
On April 14, six people were killed when a bomb went off in an
outpatient department waiting-room of a charity cancer hospital
set up by former cricket star Imran Khan in Lahore.
</P>
<P>
But the bloodiest one struck on April 28 on the eve of Eid ul
Azha, one of the biggest Muslim festivals, when people rushed for
home for the festival celebration.
</P>
<P>
Some 52 people were killed when a powerful bomb attached to the
petrol tank of a passenger bus exploded in a crowded bus-stop
about 100 kilometers southwest of Lahore.
</P>
<P>
So far no one claimed responsible for any of the blasts.
</P>
<P>
Punjab, the most populous province in Pakistan, once enjoyed
relative peace compared with its neighboring Sindh province.
</P>
<P>
The confrontation between the government and the ethnic Mohajir
Qaumi Movement in Sindh caused 1,800 deaths last year in the
provincial capital Karachi alone.
</P>
<P>
However, since the beginning of this year, a series of violence
occurred in Punjab, especially in or around Lahore, while the law
and order situation in Sindh has shown considerable improvement
due to the government's strong measures.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan blamed its neighbor India for the worsening law and
order situation in Punjab while India accused Pakistan of
masterminding a bomb attack in a New Delhi market place which
killed 28 people and injured 40 others.
</P>
<P>
Each side denied the other's accusation.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Lay Off 6,000 Armymen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian army is about
to retrench between six and 10 thousand fighters before July 1,
this year, according to the local paper "Observer" today.
</P>
<P>
The move has been prompted by pressures under the terms of the
economic reform program to cut down military spending in favour
of social services in the next government budget, said the paper
quoting sources from army headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Sources within the army have hinted that those to be
retrenched will get a handsome send-off pay package including a
number of privileges hitherto non-existent in the army.
</P>
<P>
In the last two years, the army has adapted a humane system of
retiring its armymen. A year before the date of retirement, an
officer is put into civilian clothing and does not report to work
but continues to draw full salary. The retirement benefits are
paid at the end of that year, when a person who is used to live
under instructions and orders, has either found an alternative
job or has adjusted into a life of self motivation. enditem

ISLAMABAD, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The policy perceptions of Iran
and Pakistan on the Afghan issue are closer now than in the past,
Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan Mehdi Akhunzade said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a gathering organized by the Association of Former
Ambassadors of Pakistan, Akhunzade said both Iran and Pakistan
feel that the stable situation in Afghanistan will have a positive
impact on the region.
</P>
<P>
"If Afghanistan calms down to normalcy and stability, both Iran
and Pakistan can do a lot for the reconstruction of the country,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
"Due to the transparent and face-to-face talks with Pakistan,
we have cleared many misunderstandings," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The Afghans have their specific mentality and it could be seen
in the joining of hands by Hekmatyar and Rabbani, two arch rivals
of very recent past," he said, adding, "we can only advise them
not to fight."
</P>
<P>
On the bilateral ties between Iran and Pakistan, the Ambassador
said, "the two countries have to concentrate on more productive
projects in economic cooperation, the oil pipeline projects in
particular."
</P>
<P>
"It is a matter of time, and we will bring gas to Pakistan
which will promote the infrastructure to the benefit of the two
nations," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Japan's largest electric power
supplier is turning to Southeast Asia to launch its first overseas
operation, according to a published report today.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo Electric Power Co.'s move, a shift from its long-standing
policy of limiting its activity to within Japan, is due to
sluggish demand at home, the Asahi Shimbun reported.
</P>
<P>
The international expansion effort is also prompted by growing
energy demands in other Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The company's first project outside Japan, said the newspaper
report, could be the construction of an Indonesian thermal power
plant that will cost several million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The plant in Sibolga, northern Sumatra, is a planned Indonesian
government project worth a total of 38 million dollars. Two
100,000-kilowatt generators are expected to be installed.
</P>
<P>
To participate in the project, Tokyo Electric Power plans to
invest "a small amount" to be in a consortium established for the
plant's construction, a company official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The consortium could include two Japanese trading houses --
Mitsubishi Corp. and Mitsui and Co. -- an Indonesia conglomerate
and U.S. and European power suppliers.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A South African mountaineering
has gone missing after climing to the peak of Mount Qomolangma,
according to prive Radio 702 here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Photographer Bruce Herrod and teammates Ian Woodall and Cathy
O'Dowd on Saturday became the first official South African team to
reach the summit of the world's highest mountain.
</P>
<P>
A much slower Herrod, however, straggled behind the others and
only made it to the top some seven hours after team leader Woodall
and O'Dowd, the first African woman to scale the mountain, had
already begun their descent.
</P>
<P>
The last radio contact with Herrod, Radio 702 said, was just
before he began his own descent at 3 p.m. (0900 GMT) on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The bearded photographer faced a night of struggling down the
8,848 meter mountain on his own, a challenge experienced
mountaineers described as "extremely dangerous."
</P>
<P>
According to Radio 702, which has a reporter at base camp,
Herrod made no further contact during the night and rescuers were
considering starting a search for him Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, eight climbers, among them some the world's
most experienced mountaineers, died on their way down from the
peak when a fierce blizzard struck the mountain.

<HEADLINE> Santer Blames UK Government for Beef Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) Commission
President Jacques Santer has blamed the British government for
mismanaging the beef crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a BBC television interview this morning, Santer
issued a stark warning that British Prime Minister John Major's
policy of non-cooperation with the EU would prove
counter-productive.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that it would also counter-productive for the
EU to go as far as giving a clear timetable for lifting the global
ban on British beef products exports, because it would not gain
the confidence of the other EU member states.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Major announced the non-cooperation policy with
the EU last Tuesday, calling for a clear timetable to lift the
two-month-old worldwide ban on exporting British beef products.
</P>
<P>
However, Santer noted that the EU Commission would help to lift
the ban on some British beef by-products when the EU Agriculture
Ministers meet in Brussels early next month to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts say that Santer's refusal to make any
concessions to Britain is likely to produce an alarming shock to
the ruling Conservative Euro-sceptics.
</P>
<P>
Sir Jerry Wiggin, Chairman of the Commons Agriculture Select
Committee said that Santer's hard stance could be regarded as
obstructive.
</P>
<P>
Wiggin argued that it was the EU which caused the panic in the
first place by ignoring scientific advice and therefore the
British government should insist on its non-cooperation policy
with the EU.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed the ban on March 27 when the British government
admitted that there were possible links between BSE or the
so-called "mad cow" disease and its human equivalent
Creutzdelft-Jocob Disease.

<HEADLINE> Report: Qatar to Reshuffle Cabinet in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Qatar will witness a full
cabinet reshuffle in September, local newspaper Gulf News today
quoted a high-level Qatari official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior Sheikh Abdullah
Bin Khalifa, brother of Qatar's Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al
Thani, will take over the premiership, the official, who sought
anonymity said.
</P>
<P>
A new minister of petroleum and energy will be appointed, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hamad has found through experience that the next stage
of political action, which will mainly focus on achieving an
economic flourishing, needs changing some of the present faces and
moving of some other officials to new posts, the official said.
</P>
<P>
A 25-40 percent rise in salaries of employees of the Qatari
Government will also be declared by the end of June, marking the
first anniversary of Sheikh Hamad's accession to the throne in
succession to his father Sheikh Khalifa in a bloodless coup in June
in 1995, he said.
</P>
<P>
Such a move will usher in an economic boom in Qatar
particularly after the government managed to freeze some Qatari
assets abroad, which were registered in the former Emir's accounts.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the Qatari government has succeeded in
freezing the assets and accounts in London and France controlled
by Sheikh Khalifa, after persuading these capitals that assets are
state property.
</P>
<P>
According to another report, several accounts had been blocked
in Geneva and Zurich and an investigation was under way into funds
which Qatar says belong to the state.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Khalifa's fortune abroad was between 7
to 9 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Qatar will issue a law distinguishing between the state's
revenue from oil and other sources on one hand and the personal
accounts of the Emir, on the other hand, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Political observers in Doha believe that Sheikh Hamad has
started to focus on means of realizing economic boom after he
succeeded last year to contain some crises related to his
country's relations with neighborly countries particularly Saudi
Arabia.

<HEADLINE> Cause of Bomb Blast in Pakistan Under Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The bomb blast occurred this
morning in Pakistan could be a result of the ongoing tussle
between the workers union and the rival group, according to the
Associated Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Talking to local reporters, Superintendent of Crime
Investigation Agency Ahmed Khan Chaddar said that however a clear
picture would emerge after a thorough probe.
</P>
<P>
One person was killed and five others injured, two of them
seriously, when a bomb blasted in the General Post Office in
Lahore, metropolis of Punjab province in Pakistan at around 9 a.m.
local time (04:00 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The roof of the office building cave in due to the explosion.
</P>
<P>
The Central Secretary General of the National Organization of
Postal Employees, Syed Tehzibul Hassan, alleged that certain
elements planted bomb in his office to remove him from the scene.
</P>
<P>
"Thank God it was not peak hour otherwise there would have been
a large number of casualties," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, other senior police officials having reached the spot
declined to comment on the blast.
</P>
<P>
City police chief Choudhry Sajjad thought it was premature to
say anything about the blast.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsible for the blast while further
investigations are underway.
</P>
<P>
Concerned agencies including bomb disposal rescuers and fire
brigade reached the spot immediately for rescue work.
</P>
<P>
"It was such a high-intensity explosion that entire
concrete-made roof of the building caved in," said a bomb expert.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the explosion, window panes of the adjacent
houses were smashed while people came out of their houses to know
what had happened.
</P>
<P>
The deafening explosion triggered panic and scare in the area
where anguished parents rushed in panic to ascertain the safety of
their children studying in different schools in the area.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Quiet Before Major Thai Cabinet Reshuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's political scene has
appeared quiet this weekend in the wake of mass resignations of 10
cabinet members within two days last week.
</P>
<P>
The public, from the man on the street up to the monarch, are
waiting, speculating or even betting on who and which parties are
to be included in the new cabinet lineup.
</P>
<P>
Even Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa has spent a relaxed
weekend, spending Saturday morning in his home province of Suphan
Buri and enjoyed a film show with his son in the evening. Sunday
morning, he was televised to be taking morning exercises at his
home.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Banharn is not as relaxed as he appears. He is under
pressure and is in dilemma over the new cabinet team.
</P>
<P>
His coalition partners have applied pressure on him to get rid
of the Palang Dharma (virtue force) Party (PDP), all of whose five
ministers, including Deputy Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra,
resigned on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The PDP did not toe the coalition government line and withheld
support for Deputy Interior Minister Suchart Tancharoen in the
vote of no-confidence. Suchart's Therd Thai faction, furious
about the PDP's abstention, vowed to expel it.
</P>
<P>
Of the seven coalition parties, at least three of the smaller
ones, namely, the Prachakorn Thai (Thai citizen), Muan Chon (the
masses) and Social Action parties, in addition to the Therd Thai
faction of Banharn's Chart Thai Party, have openly expressed
unhappiness about the PDP's resignation announcement at a public
gathering on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
They said that the PDP had sought to impress the people that it
was the only good party in the government.
</P>
<P>
There is speculation among coalition politicians that the PDP
will not stop at resigning from the cabinet but may quit the
government altogether as a means of increasing its popularity
among Bangkok voters.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok is the essential strength base of the PDP, 16 of whose
23 parliamentary seats are from Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Pressure on the prime minister to remove the PDP is expected to
grow to prevent the PDP from gaining credit by quitting the
government of its own accord.
</P>
<P>
In his heart, Banharn does not seem to want the PDP out at this
time. Removing the PDP, which is seen by the public as a
relatively "clean" party from the cabinet, would certainly not
bring credit to the prime minister: with the PDP in, the image of
the entire cabinet would seem less bad.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister will have to weigh carefully the pro and
cons over the inclusion or exclusion of the PDP in the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The stability of Banharn's premiership would hinge on his final
decision on whether or not to bow to the pressure.
</P>
<P>
In his own backyard of the Chart Thai Party, after the five
Therd Thai ministers and deputy ministers' resignation on
Thursday, Banharn will have a tough time to decide which of the
five would be reappointed.
</P>
<P>
Because, of the five, at least two, Deputy Interior Minister
Suchart Tancharoen and Deputy Finance Minister Newin Chidchob, are
believed to be unacceptable to other coalition parties, because of
alleged abuse of office and alleged involvements in a number of
land and loan scandals.
</P>
<P>
The faction, claiming to hold 29 parliamentary seats, describes
itself as the "legs" of the government.
</P>
<P>
Banharn may have to "cut the bad fingers" by dropping one or
two of the most unpopular key Therd Thai figures "to save the
body."
</P>
<P>
Another key member from the Chart Thai Party, Finance Minister
Surakiat Sathirathai, who used to be dean of a law faculty of a
university and law advisor to Banharn, may also have to leave his
post, and to take a less important post in the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Ever since Surakiat's appointment last July, he has been under
attack from the opposition, political observers and the press that
he is not a suitable person for lack of economic knowledge and
experience, and he is blamed whenever there is an economic blunder
during his 10 months in office.
</P>
<P>
There has been speculation that the finance portfolio will be
offered to Amnuay Virawan, leader of the Nam Thai (Thai
leadership) Party, who is also deputy prime minister, in charge of
economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
Besides, it is not yet clear if Foreign Minister Kasem S.
Kasemsri will quit this time. Kasem has been under pressure from
his own Nam Thai party members to quit, on the grounds that he is
not a MP.
</P>
<P>
Kasem told reporters two months ago that he had tendered an
undated resignation letter to his party leader Amnuay and that it
was up to Amnuay or Prime Minister Banharn to decide when he would
leave.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Jordan Saturday granted the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) seven tons of medicines and
drugs to help meet shortage in medical supplies in the
Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Acting Minister of Health Mustafa Shneikat, who handed the
shipment to a PNA representative in Amman, said the gift
represents Jordan's standing policy of providing assistance to the
Palestinian people who are still under the strict closure imposed
by Israel in late February following a spate of suicide bombings
in the Jewish State.
</P>
<P>
According to the English-language daily Jordan Times today,
the medicines include badly-needed children's medicines and
antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian Ambassador to Jordan Omar Khatib voiced
his appreciation for Jordan's continued assistance and support for
the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted him as saying that the shipment was evidence
of Jordan's continued care for the Palestinians in their on-going
efforts to achieve freedom.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Jordan's Ministry of Supply signed a deal under
which Jordan will sell the PNA 5,000 tons of flour which is now
being shipped to Palestinian territories at the rate of 250 tons
per day.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom announced in March a donation of several tons
of wheat flour to the PNA as a gift to the Palestinians at
a time when international flour prices rose sharply and there
was an acute shortage of the staple in the Palestinian areas.

<HEADLINE> China Improves Export Quota System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- To make it impossible for domestic
traders to "dump" goods abroad, China has adopted a mechanism
requiring exporters of a select group of commodities to buy the
right to export.
</P>
<P>
The scheme, entailing public bidding for strict quotas of the
commodities, was revised for the second time earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The latest revision will benefit individual companies at home
and abroad as well as the whole country, a trade official
predicted.
</P>
<P>
Companies will find it easier to qualify as bidders, while an
improved calculation formula for choosing candidates virtually
rules out collusion among bidders, said Liu Changyu of the foreign
trade administration under the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Co-operation (Moftec).
</P>
<P>
Moftec in 1994 assigned quotas to 13 categories of commodities
in order to regulate their export and give the State some control
over the commodities prices. The method succeeded in boosting
overseas sales prices and Moftec expanded the experiment to cover
24 categories of goods in 1995 and 27 this year, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
According to the new rule, at most 50 percent of export quotas
will be put aside for companies whose combined transactions will
account for 50-70 percent of China's total exports of the
commodity in question. With the latest amendments, that portion is
reduced to a maximum of 40 percent.

<HEADLINE> India's Congress Party Differs on Support to United </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Simmering differences in the
Indian National Congress over the leadership's decision to support
the United Front (UF) came to the fore at meetings Party President
P.V. Narasimha Rao had with newly-elected parliamentary members
Saturday, the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
According to Congress Party sources, Rao met with party Members
of Parliament (MPs) from Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and union
territories Saturday afternoon. In the evening, he had meetings
with MPs from Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Assam.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the general complaint of the MPs was that the
leadership at times ignored their views in taking decisions on
important issues.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Rao had met with the MPs from Karnataka, Kerala,
West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh.
</P>
<P>
The MPs from these four states were of the view that the
party's rank and file in their respective states would find it
difficult to support a UF government since one or the other
constituent of the front was ruling their respective states.
</P>
<P>
Rao said there was not much of a difference between the
policies of the Congress and the UF, which comprises the National
Front-Left parties Combine and a number of regional parties.
</P>
<P>
Both groups were secular and their first and foremost task was
"to throw out the communal regime represented by the Bharatiya
Janata Party." Certain things could be sorted out at a later
point, he added.
</P>
<P>
He assured the MPs that their sentiments would be kept in mind
while dealing with the UF.

<HEADLINE> None Has Right to Make Comment on Gov't Behalf: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi caretaker government has
warned that none has the right to make comment on behalf of the
government and any ill-attempt to destabilize the prevailing
normal situation would not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a function Saturday, Chief Adviser Habibur Rahman
reminded that all powers of the republic are vested in the present
non-party caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
"None other than the government has the right to make any
comment or statement on behalf of the government," he warned in a
veiled reference to the recent developments following a foiled
mutiny on May 20.
</P>
<P>
The former chief of army staff A.S.M. Nasim and six other
senior army officers have been put under military custody for an
alleged ploy to topple the present caretaker government as some
troops loyal to them had marched from their barracks in the
northern districts of Bogra and Mymensingh towards Dhaka following
the forced retirement of Nasim ordered by the Defense Ministry
under President Abdur Rahman Biswas, who is also the supreme
commander of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
After the happenings, some political parties led by the former
largest opposition party -- the Awami (people's) League -- have
accused the president of acting in a partisan manner in favor of
the ex-ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) which "is
hatching a conspiracy to foil the June 12 elections" and making
the country being run under dual administration.
</P>
<P>
The televised speeches of both the president and the chief
adviser on the May 20 happenings have produced differences, which
means the chief adviser is disassociated with the president's
actions, they noted.
</P>
<P>
Every center of constitutional power and every organ
discharging constitutional responsibilities act in their
respective fields, the chief adviser explained, adding that "we'll
face all the situation from a monolithic coordination. There is no
scope for misunderstanding."
</P>
<P>
He called upon the people to have patience and help the
government deliver people's verdict in only 18 days. On the eve of
forming the present government, the major political parties had
assured the government of their full cooperation and "it is my
firm belief that those who make commitment with honesty do not
breach it," the chief adviser stressed.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Allows Nicaraguan Refugees to Stay for Another Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States has decided to
allow thousands of Nicaraguan refugees living in the country to
stay for another year, the U.S. Embassy in Managua said today.
</P>
<P>
But the embassy said the refugees should meet three conditions
before their residency permits, which expire on June 12, would be
extended.
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguans need to prove that they have been at least
seven years in the United States, that they have not had any
problems with the justice, and that their deportation will cause
penury to the person affected or to his or her family.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Nicaraguans emigrated to the United States as
refugees from the civil war during the 1980s between the ruling
Sandinista Front for National Liberation and the U.S.-backed
anti-government force.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Nicaraguans in the United States reside in Miami,
San Francisco and Los Angeles, and send approximately 250 million
U.S. dollars a year in remittances to their relatives in Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan government says the country, which has been in
financial straits and haunted by violence, is not in a position to
receive the thousands of Nicaraguan refugees.

KATHMANDU, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A Central Working Committee (CWC)
meeting of the Nepali Congress (NC), the country's main ruling
party, Saturday reiterated the party's commitment to the
three-party ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
NC central members at the meeting agreed that they would help
make the coalition government, formed last September under Sher
Bahadur Deuba, more stronger and last for its full term, reports
said.
</P>
<P>
It was the first NC CWC meeting after the party's 9th General
Convention earlier this month when senior NC leader Girija Prasad
Koirala was elected party president.
</P>
<P>
Koirala at the meeting "drew the attention of the central
members towards the state of the coalition government and the
political situation of the country", NC General Secretary Taranath
 Tanabhat told reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said Koirala also stressed the need to strengthen
organization work of the NC party, which was considered aiming at
restoring the party's majority status in the parliament during the
next general election.
</P>
<P>
The NC lost its majority control of the parliament in the 1994
mid-term polls and became the second largest party in the lower
house after the Communist Party of Nepal (UML).
</P>
<P>
A local newspaper said some NC leaders expressed "serious
concern" over the poor performance of the coalition government at
Sunday's meeting but Prime Minister Deuba refuted the charges.

BANGKOK, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and Laos have agreed in
principle to build a third bridge on the Mekong river between
Laos' Khammouane province and Thailand's Nakhon Phanom province,
the Bangkok Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
Thai Transport Minister Wan Muhamad Nor Matha and Laotian
Communications, Transport and Construction Minister Phao Bounaphon
discussed the bridge in Khammouane Saturday and visited a proposed
site.
</P>
<P>
The first bridge between Nong Khai and Vientiane, was opened in
April 1994, and agreement has been reached for a second bridge,
between Mukdaharn in northeast Thailand and Savannakhet in central
Laos, which is expected to be completed within six or seven years.
</P>
<P>
Wan Muhamad Nor Matha expressed confidence that the two sides
would be able to make progress on the third bridge and that the
site and a time frame were on the agenda.

<P>
The third bridge will connect Road 8 in Laos with the port of
Vinh in the north of Vietnam, and Road 12 to a port which Vietnam
is thinking of developing at Vung Anh in the central part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Wan Muhamad Nor Matha and Phao Bounaphon,

WASHINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate Majority Whip Trent
Lott said on Saturday he has received public commitments from at
least 28 of the Senate's 53 Republican members, enough to assure
his election to succeed Bob Dole as majority leader.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of his only rival Senator Thad Cochran, Lott said, "We
have an easy relationship. We talked at length, both on Wednesday
and Thursday of this week. I think there are over 28 Republican
senators that have publicly committed to vote for me," Lott said
on CNN's "Evans &AMP; Novak" program.
</P>
<P>
Cochran, who has agreed that Lott enjoys a "head start" in the
race, has tried to keep the rivalry a publicly friendly one.
</P>
<P>
Lott holds the second-ranking Republican leadership post in the
Senate, while Cochran is the No. 3 -- chairman of the Senate
Republican Conference.
</P>
<P>
Dole has announced his resignation from the Senate, effective
on or before June 11, to devote full time to his challenge to
President Bill Clinton in the November election.
</P>
<P>
The Senate leadership balloting is expected during the week of
June 3, after the chamber returns from its current recess.

<HEADLINE> Spain to Protect Companies in Cuba From U.S. Law, PM Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Spanish Prime Minister Jose Aznar
said today that his country will take the "fittest" measures to
protect its business interests in Cuba from being affected by a
contentious U.S. law.
</P>
<P>
Aznar was complaining to U.S. Vice-President Albert Gore about
the Helms-Burton law, enacted by U.S. President Bill Clinton in
March to tighten U.S.-imposed decades-old sanctions on Cuba.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference after their meeting, Aznar said his
government is concerned over Spain's interests not only in Cuba
but also in any other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
Aznar, who came to power earlier this month after a victory of
his Popular Party in the March elections, said he believed the
U.S. government will be "highly sensitive" to such a situation and
learn about Spain's stance and matters of its concern.
</P>
<P>
Gore, who arrived here Friday from Portugal for a one-day
visit, replied that the United States, in enforcing the law, will
respect Spain's stance and try to avoid possible trouble.
</P>
<P>
He also repeated the U.S. determination to keep up pressure on
Cuba to accelerate what he called a transformation to democracy.
</P>
<P>
Gore was sent to the two countries to learn about their new
governments' views on the Helms-Burton law and other major
international issues such as the peace processes in Bosnia and the
Middle East. In Portugal, Antonio Guterres of the Socialist Party
replaced Anibal Silva of the Social Democratic Party, which had
been in office for 23 years, as the prime minister last October.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress adopted the Helms-Burton bill in February
following the downing by the Cuban Air Force of two small planes
of a U.S.-based anti-Cuba organization, killing all four
Cuban-Americans on board.
</P>
<P>
The law, which allows Cuban exiles in the United States to sue
foreign companies that have investment in and trade links with
Cuba, threatens at least 1,000 European, Canadian and Mexican
companies. Spain maintains broad economic and trade links with
Cuba, one of its former colonies.
</P>
<P>
The law has been sharply criticized by U.S. European allies and
trading partners, which have urged Washington to revoke it and
desist from unilaterally imposing trade sanctions on other
countries.
</P>
<P>
But the Clinton administration, which has been busy wooing
voters in the November presidential elections, has said repeatedly
that it has no intention of backing down on the law, which
analysts say will help boost Clinton's image as a strong
president.

<HEADLINE> Malaria Cases on Rise in Northern Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The number of malaria cases in
northern Thailand's border province of Mae Hong Son is increasing
each year.
</P>
<P>
The disease was thought to be spread by Karenni refugees who
frequently crossed the border into Thailand to escape fighting in
Myanmar, Dr. Phadung Srirattanabal, director of Sangwan Hospital
in Mae Hong Son province, was quoted today by local newspaper
Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Heat and humidity also helped the disease spread in the
mountains of this province, dr. Phadung said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 561 patients sought treatment for malaria at Sangwan
Hospital from January to May 15 this year. However, none has died
of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Last year, of the 1,580 people who sought treatment for malaria
at the hospital, only four died. Among the patients were 628
Myanmar nationals.
</P>
<P>
Mobile medical teams are now educating villagers as to how to
protect themselves from malaria. Preventive measures are also
broadcast monthly on a health program produced by Radio Thailand's
Mae Hong Son Station, Dr. Phadung said.

RIO DE JANEIRO, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian Finance

<P>
Air travel ticket prices stayed frozen for two years and the

<P>
A one-way ticket between Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo will cost
157 dollars at least, while round trip fare will be more expensive
than a flight to Buenos Aires.

Airlines requested in November last year an increase in the
prices of tickets but they were not allowed to raise the price
because they were offering discounts of up to 40 percent.
</P>

The prices for traveling by air, the highest in the world,
generally more than double as compared with the prices in the

<HEADLINE> Home of "Wild Man" Prepares to Welcome Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Shennongjia area, the
haunt of the legendary "Wild Man", known as the "Big Foot" of
China, will open to more outsiders as a result of the local
government's tourism development plan.
</P>
<P>
A promotion activity called "First Sightseeing Ceremony of
Shennongjia International Tourism" will start next Monday. The
ceremony will be attended by representatives of domestic and
overseas travel agencies as well as reporters, according to the
Hubei Tourism Bureau.
</P>
<P>
It will be a prelude to the province's plan to put the area on
the international tourist map from next year.
</P>
<P>
In previous years, scientific expeditions and many tourists
have headed for "Big-Foot's Home".
</P>
<P>
Located in central Hubei Province, the Shennongjia Mountains
are a paradise of flora and fauna. It came to world attention
because for hundreds of years local residents have reported
sighting a figure that is a kind of half-man, half-ape.
</P>
<P>
In order to attract more tourists, the district, where tourism
resources are abundant, has been offering a series of tourism
packages including adventure tours, medical herb collecting tours
and folklore tours.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has invested tens of millions of yuan
in the construction of tourism facilities since 1988.
</P>
<P>
A nature museum, a "Big Foot" theme park and a botanical garden
have been built recently.
</P>
<P>
It is said that from next year a new travel route will be
offered, linking Shennongjia with other famous scenic spots such
as the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River, Mount Wudang and Yichang
City.

<P>
OTTAWA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Greece has withdrawn from next
month's Canada Cup soccer tournament, reducing the one-week,
three-team event into a one-game exhibition between Canada and
Costa Rica.

Greece was suspended last week by world soccer ruling body FIFA
because of an internal dispute between the Greek Football
Federation and its government.
</P>
<P>
According to the previous schedule, Greece was to play against
Costa Rica on June 2 and Canada on June 8 at Varsity Stadium.
</P>
<P>
With those two games cancelled, the Canada Cup was reduced to

<HEADLINE> Central Bank Plans Audit of Reborn Pawnshop Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Pawnshops across the country will
have to be audited before the end of this September by the
People's Bank of China as part of the central bank's effort to
regulate the trade, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
With approval from the State Council, the bank adopted the
Provisional Rules on Pawnbrokering Management early last month,
the first unified measure issued since the reappearance of the
business in 1987, an official with the bank's legal department
said.
</P>
<P>
"Adopting the rules gives us a legal weapon to better manage
the industry," he said.
</P>
<P>
The rules delegate to the People's Bank of China the authority
to supervise and manage the trade, ending the disorder caused by
multiple managers such as industrial and commercial
administrations, public security departments and local governments.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics suggest that more than 2,000 pawnshops
have been established across the country since the first appeared
in 1987 in Chengdu, capital of Sichuan province.
</P>
<P>
The pawnshops have been helpful in invigorating money
circulation and meeting the urgent needs of customers. But the
lack of legal measures has resulted in confusion. No standards
concerning the appraised price, fixed period for pawning, interest
rate, handling of dead pawning or obligations and responsibilities
for pawnbrokers and pledgers.
</P>
<P>
The new rules elaborate clear guidelines on these issues.

<HEADLINE> B.A.T. Optimistic About Chinese Tobacco Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The British American Tobacco
(B.A.T.) Industries Company has expressed confidence about the
Chinese tobacco market, especially duty-free tobacco market,
despite the government's ban on TV advertisements for tobacco and
the prohibition of smoking in public places in some cities.
</P>
<P>
Martin Riordan, corporate affairs manager of B.A.T. (UK and
Export) Ltd, said that the Chinese government's restrictions on
tobacco will not have a serious impact on its sales of tobacco
products in Chinese duty-free shops, but with the continued
development of tourism, China's duty-free market has bright
prospects.
</P>
<P>
He told the ongoing China Duty Free Symposium '96 here Saturday
that over 100 million travelers pass through Asian airports
annually, adding "More than half of the travelers to the
Asia-Pacific region will eventually come to China."
</P>
<P>
According to China's National Tourism Administration, the
number of international arrivals in China has been growing at an
annual rate of 11.1 percent. The number is expected to top 50
million this year.
</P>
<P>
Riordan said that B.A.T., which has 170,000 employees
worldwide, started to do business with China in 1980, and has so
far set up 19 offices across the country.
</P>
<P>
In Asia, tobacco is one of the top three sales categories in
the duty free market.

<HEADLINE> Myna Bird Serenades its Way to Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- A myna bird has won a competition by
singing songs in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Trained by Li Xiaoping, a self-employed worker, it won the top
marks in a competition held in this capital of northwest China's
Shaanxi province.
</P>
<P>
The bird sang "Mother is the Greatest in the World" and "Happy
Birthday to You" in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Another two competitors together sang the revolutionary song
"The east is red, the sun is rising." Then one sang "The east is
red," and the other followed with "The sun is rising."
</P>
<P>
The owners said that the mynas can not only learn to speak and
sing songs, but can also imitate the accents of their trainers.
</P>
<P>
Three mynas bred by Liu Hanfu, a retired worker, can speak 30
sentences between them. In a chorus they sing "I Am a Soldier" and
seven notes of the scale.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that it took him at least two years to teach his pets
to sing songs.

wristwatch valued at 5,000 dollars in the Paraguayan Congress.

<HEADLINE> China Considers Drafting of Export-Control Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, Mary 26 (Xinhua) -- China is considering to draft its
first export-control law as part of its effort to further
strengthen export control over sensitive products and technology.
</P>
<P>
Related government branches are discussing the drafting of the
country's first export-control law in order to standardize
administration and reinforce transparency, a foreign trade
ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
Liu Hu, director-general of the Science and Technology
Department of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Co-operation (MOFTEC), said the implementation of such a law is
expected to help carry out export control uniformly,
scientifically and openly.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government always advocates banning and destroying
weapons of mass destruction. We are for taking necessary steps,
including international supervision of sensitive products and
technology, to prevent proliferation of such weapons," the
official was quoted today by the English-language newspaper "China
Daily" as saying.
</P>
<P>
Liu said such supervision should be carried out fairly and
reasonably and "we are against using the tool to harm the
development of civil science of countries, especially developing
nations, and it should not affect normal international exchange
and cooperation."

<HEADLINE> "Three Gorges Project Investment Tolerable": Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- China's financial capability can
bear the scale of investment in the multibillion dollar Three
Gorges Project, a senior company official said here recently.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Guolin, vice-president of the Yangtze River Three Gorges
Development Corporation, said that the gigantic project will need
a total investment of 240 billion yuan (about 28 billion US
dollars) by the time it is finished in the year 2009.
</P>
<P>
Yuan was visiting this, China's biggest city at the invitation
of the municipal government to discuss the progress of the
project, the world's largest water-control scheme.
</P>
<P>
Based on May 1993 prices, investment in the project is 90
billion yuan, equivalent to 10.8 billion US dollars at present.
</P>
<P>
But the project is expected to continue for 17
years. Considering price rises, loan interest and other factors,
the investment may involve 240 billion yuan by the time the
project is completed in 2009, Yuan said.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, the investment scale is large, but since it
is a long-term project, investment in the project annually is
insignificant in terms of the country's overall budget. In 1995
China put 6.5 billion yuan into the project, which only accounted
for 0.11 percent of the country's Gross National Product (GNP) and
0.33 percent of the country's total investments in fixed assets.
</P>
<P>
The official acknowledged that by 2007 the project will see a
financial gap of some 35 billion yuan, most of which would be in
existence before 2003. He said the gap would be filled mainly by
raising money at home. The country also is considering utilizing
foreign funds in the forms of export credits, commercial loans,
and issuing stocks and bonds.
</P>
<P>
"There are many factors affecting the investment in the project
during the long period of construction. Besides, these factors are
uncertain and complex," Yuan said.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, control of investment has certain risks, and
discrepancies may appear between the actual investment scale and
previous estimates," he added.
</P>
<P>
To deal with such problems, the company has taken a series of
stern measures to control the investment in the project.
Investments have been put under multi-level control. A market
competition system has also been introduced to reduce costs, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Control of investment over the past few years has proved to be
effective, Yuan said. The funding of the project is smooth at
present, and no shortage of money has so far affected the progress
of the project, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Project is a comprehensive project for flood
control, power generation and navigation.
</P>
<P>
When the Three Gorges Power Station starts to generate
electricity, the project will be able to repay the loans at the
rate of 10 billion yuan a year, becoming a major source of debt
repayment.
</P>
<P>
Yuan said that his company will be able to repay all its debts
before 2014.
</P>
<P>
He also said that debt structure of the project is relatively
rational because state assets comprise 50 percent of the project's
total assets, which will help reduce its debt burden.

<HEADLINE> American Sprinter Banned for Doping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 26 (Xinhua) -- American sprinter Kevin Braunskill
would be banned for four years after testing positive at the 1994
New York Games, the International Amateur Athletic Federation
announced in Monte Carlo on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Braunskill's case went to an IAAF arbitration hearing after
U.S. Track and Field contended the correct procedure wasn't
followed in the testing of his sample.
</P>
<P>
The IAAF said Braunskill, a former world junior 200-meter
champion, tested positive May 22, 1994 and his urine sample was
sent to an IOC-accredited laboratory in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
The sample was found to contain the metabolites of stanozolol,
a prohibited anabolic agent. But one of the doping forms
describing the B sample had omitted one of the digits of the
sample code.
</P>
<P>
It was on that basis that U.S. Track and Field had decided
there had been a departure from the correct procedure and that the
positive doping finding should not stand.
</P>
<P>
In its review, the IAAF arbitration panel decided that a
departure from the normal procedure would only invalidate a
positive finding if it cast real doubt on the reliability of that
finding.
</P>
<P>
The panel ruled that it didn't and that U.S. Track and Field
had "misdirected itself".
</P>
<P>
The IAAF decided that Braunskill would be banned from the date
of the test until May 21, 1988.

<P>
XI'AN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The provinces of Qinghai, Gansu and
Shaanxi and the Xinjiang Uygur and Ningxia Hui autonomous regions
-- all in northwest China -- have built some 50 nature reserves to
better protect wild animals.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi, which has the largest number of such reserves, has
rescued about 30 giant pandas since 1983.
</P>
<P>
Gansu protects the largest number of musk deer in the world,
standing at 5,000.
</P>
<P>
The local governments of the five provinces and the autonomous
regions have worked out regulations to protect wild animals and
established relevant organizations at all levels.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 forest rangers are patrolling the reserves.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, over 500 cases of selling protected wildlife have
been dealt with and some 1,000 culprits punished.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the number of rare ibises native to China
has increased to more than 60 from only seven when they were first
discovered in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Apart from ibises, the region has about 1,000 varieties of wild
animals, including giant pandas, golden monkeys, leopards and wild
asses, more than 200 varieties of which are under state
protection.

<HEADLINE> Big Project Helps Thousands Escape Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Some 630,000 people in north China's
Shandong Province who have escaped from poverty attribute this to
a massive anti-poverty project in a former revolutionary base, the
Yimeng Mountains.
</P>
<P>
The area was a huge headache for both the central government
and local authorities for many years because of its poor farming
conditions, according to an official from the local government.
</P>
<P>
In 1991 the provincial government urged its departments of
finance, agriculture and forestry to join hands to begin the
biggest anti-poverty project in the history of Shandong to improve
the farming and industrial conditions, the official said.
</P>
<P>
More than 1.44 million people and 11 counties and 67,000 ha of
land were involved in the project. The total investment in the
first phase came to 200 million yuan (about 24 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The project saw the completion of 5,161 km of roads, 1,045
pumping stations, 1,742 reservoirs of all sizes and 1,230 km of
diversion channels to meet the infrastructural needs for the
area's agriculture and industry.
</P>
<P>
More than what had been planned, 105,000 ha of lands have been
opened up in the past half-decade. Some 37,000 ha of farmlands and
86,000 ha of orchards have appeared in the previously barren
mountains.
</P>
<P>
New farmland had earned 970 million yuan for the area by last
year, and the average per capita income of the area has increased
by 200 yuan annually since 1992, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Citing the Shanting region, the official said that the project
has caused great changes in the area. Shanting, which used to be
one of the poorest regions in the area, increased its per capita
income to 1,300 yuan last year, contrasting with a mere 100 yuan
only a few years ago. Thus, nearly 200,000 people have escaped
poverty.
</P>
<P>
The second phase of the project is expected to start soon.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Retains Uber Cup Badminton Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 25 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Defending champions
Indonesia achieved their goal of scoring their first ever
back-to-back victory after they beat arch rivals China in the
final of the 16th Uber Cup world women's badminton team
championships here today.
</P>
<P>
The Asian badminton powerhouse defeated China 4-1 for their
third win in the event.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia won Uber Cup in 1994, 20 years after its first
victory. The win brought to a stop Chinese triumphant advance
which featured five consecutive win since their first appearance
in the even in 1984.
</P>
<P>
And the Chinese lost to a team which they shouhd have beaten
without much trouble.
</P>
<P>
It was experience against youth in the first singles, between
Indonesia's ace and Olympic champion Susi Susanti and China's
world number one Ye zhaoying.
</P>
<P>
Ye, with smashes to the corners and drop shots, won the opening
game 11-4.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian came back strongly in the second, launching long
smashes and drop shots which forced Ye to retreat to the back
court.
</P>
<P>
But it was the numerous unforced errors on the Chinese side
that decided the fate, with Susanti taking the game 11-5 to level
the score.
</P>
<P>
Susanti went on with her old-style play in the decisive rubber,
reaching an initial 8-0 lead. Ye managed to narrow the gap at 5-9
with her patient play. But it was her unforced errors again that
cost her the chance to win. Susanti took the game 11-5, again.
</P>
<P>
It was a hard fight again in the following first doubles,
between China's world number one Ge Fei and Gu Jun and Indonesians
Eliza and Zelin Resiana, ranked eighth in the world.
</P>
<P>
The attacking Indonesians took the unitiative in the opening
game, smashing their way into a 15-7 opening game win.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese won the second game back 15-8 with a patient play.
</P>
<P>
The third game went sea-sawed, with the Indonnesians missing no
chance to attack while the Chinese combining their usual defensive
play with some kind of attacks. The change seemed to work as they
came from a six-point dificit at 11-5 to level at 12-12. And from
then on the Chinese were back to the track and took the game 15-12
and the match 2-1.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's 15-year-old new star Mia Audina did not have much
problem in beating her Chinese opponent -- Wang Chen of 19 years
old. The two each took one of their two meetings last year. And
today Audina won two games to none for Wang, 11-4, 11-6, bringing
te Indonesian team to a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
Indonesians Lili Tampi and Finarsih won the crucial second
doubles 15-9, 15-10 over Chinese opponents Qin Yiyuan and Tang
Yongshu. The Chinese demonstrated excellent defensive play in the
early stage of the match but they gradually lost the ground. Some
unforced errors cost them dearly.
</P>
<P>
As a Chinese return went wide, which sealed the Indonesian win
for the game and, in fact, the tie overall, things went wild for
Indonesia. Players and coaches on the benches rushed onto the
court and braced their doubles players, with tears rowling down
cheeks.
</P>
<P>
The third singles and final match was actually meaningless as
the Indonesians had already secured that they would bring the
sport's most coverted trophy back to Jakartta days later.
</P>
<P>
Defending champions Indonesia will take on Denmark in the
Thomas Cup final here tomorrow evening. The Danes are the only
European side into the finals of the world badminton team
championships.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong to Improve Manufacturing by Using Science </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province, one of the
most developed areas in China, has decided to improve industrial
growth by means of science and technology over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
A provincial government official says that the government has
drawn up a technology development plan for key enterprises for
1996-2000, according to which, technological progress in major
manufacturers is projected to account for 50 percent of increased
production by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
"In the year 2000, 50 percent of Guangdong's manufactured goods
will meet international standards of the early 1990s and 15
percent will be up to advanced international standards by then,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The plan also calls for 60 to 70 percent of major manufacturers
to set up their own technology development institutes by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
Spending on research and development will account for 1.5
percent of Guangdong's industrial production value at the turn of
the century, he said, and at least two percent of company's annual
sales.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong's manufacturers have been told to bring out 3,000
kinds of new products annually in the next five years, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, manufacturers in the Pearl River Delta,
the most developed area in China, will concentrate on high-tech
products such as electronic information, integration of lasers,
machinery and electronics, new materials, and fine chemicals.

<HEADLINE> More Female Students in Chinese Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The national enrolment rate for
female students is up 4.5 percentage points since the early 1990s,
an official here has said.
</P>
<P>
The difference between the enrolment rates for boys and girls
in Chinese schools has narrowed to only 1.5 percentage points from
4.6 percentage points ten years ago, according to Zhu Qingjun,
secretary general of the Leading Group for National Educational
Science Planning.
</P>
<P>
She said that about 50,000 female drop-outs have returned to
schools in recent years, thanks to various charities and the
government's efforts.
</P>
<P>
One effective move has been the providing of 800 special
classes for girls with seven million yuan worth of donations from
the public sector, she said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that two-thirds of the children who quit
schools in the early 1990s were girls.

<HEADLINE> Thatcher Urges Major to Call Earlier General Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Former British prime minister
Margaret Thatcher is urging his successor John Major to call a
general election in October, reported the Mail on Sunday weekly.
</P>
<P>
Baroness Thatcher has thrown her weight behind senior Tories
and is convinced that it is too risky for the Conservatives to
wait until next May, the latest possible time.
</P>
<P>
Tory party workers are also pressing for an Autumn poll to cash
in on public support for the tough action taken by Major this week
over the European Union's worldwide ban on British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
And the dates for an earlier general election they suggested
are October 10 and November 7.
</P>
<P>
One advantage of October is that it would force the
cancellation of all annual conferences of the three major parties,
namely, the Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Then Labour leader Tony Blair would be denied the chance to set
the agenda in his keynote speech as Tory strategists admit that
Labour's conferences have been more effective than their own since
Blair became leader of the opposition party.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, November would make Major's speech in Tory
annual conference the last big event before the election campaign
officially starts.
</P>
<P>
The danger of waiting until Spring is that a last-minute crisis
would leave the Tories boxed in.
</P>
<P>
Some government ministers, including Chancellor of the
Exchequer Kenneth Clarke, are warning that public support for the
government's policy of non-cooperation with the European Union may
vanish if the beef crisis drags on.

<HEADLINE> UK Centrist Conservatives Form New Group in Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- A number of Britain's Tory members
of parliament are forming a new group within the Conservative
party in an attempt to ensure that the next general election is
fought on the center ground, according to a BBC TV report this
evening.
</P>
<P>
One of the leading figures behind the new group, Conservative
Mainstream, is David Hunt, a former cabinet minister.
</P>
<P>
Hunt was quoted as saying that the new group would represent
"the authentic voice of Conservatism in the House of Commons and
the country".
</P>
<P>
He predicted that close to 200 of the 327 Tory members of
parliament, including some Eurosceptics, would sign up to the
group.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Chief Justice Laments Profit Motive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) -- The profit motive has turned the
practice of law into a business, leading to dissatisfaction and
perhaps less trust by many of lawyers' clients, Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Market capitalism has come to dominate the legal profession in
a way that it did not a generation ago," the nation's top-ranking
judge told Catholic University's graduating law students. "Today,
the profit margin seems to be writ large in a way that it was not
in the past."
</P>
<P>
"This observation, that the practice of law is today a business
where once it was a profession, has considerable truth," he said.
</P>
<P>
The current emphasis on a lawyer's income-producing ability
through "billable hours" has eroded the loyalty between law firms
and their clients, Rehnquist said.
</P>
<P>
In earlier times, said the head of the Supreme Court, there was
"an element of trust and understanding" between a law firm and its
long-term clients. That relationship "may be diminishing today,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Clients regarded lawyers as supplying a sort of service
different in kind from that supplied by their vendor of office
supplies or raw materials," Rehnquist said. "But if the law firm
simply counts the number of hours spent and send a bill for that
amount, perhaps there isn't any great difference between the law
firm... and the office supply vendor who simply counts the number
of pencils furnished and sends a bill."

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Central Bank to Get Currency Soared </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Central Bank Governor
Rasheed Huwaish has stressed that the bank will take measures in
the coming days to boost the value of the Iraqi currency of dinar.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi dinar has been fluctuating out of control following
the news of then oil-for-food deal signed Monday by Iraq and the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The governor said in a TV interview, quoted today by the Iraqi
News Agency, that the central bank has taken many measures to
boost the exchange rate of the Iraqi dinar.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. embargo imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of
kuwait has shown that no depositors have been harmed, on the
contrary, those who did not invest their money in banks were
deprived of interests, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the rumor that the bank intends to withdraw
certain banknotes is baseless and the huge amount of currency in
circulation can be absorbed from the market through banking
measures that can in no way harm Iraqi citizens' possessions.
</P>
<P>
He added that the rumors are doing harm to the local currency
which has started to revive.
