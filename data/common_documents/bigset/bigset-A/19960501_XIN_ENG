SANAA. April 29 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh
met here today with Francis Guthman, personal envoy of French
President Jacques Chirac, who briefed President Saleh about his
talks in Asmara in pursuit of France's good offices to resolve the
Yemeni-Eritrean conflict over the Red Sea island of Greater Hanish.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, President Saleh expressed appreciation of
France's efforts to reach a peaceful settlement, emphasizing that
Yemen was in favor of a peaceful resolution of the conflict. He
hoped the French envoy would succeed in his mission.
</P>
<P>
President Saleh asserted that his country would cooperate with
France in strengthening security and stability in the Red Sea
area, and in safeguarding the safety of international navigation.
He pointed out that the peaceful solution was the right option
that would avert regional tension and guarantee the interests of
all parties.
</P>
<P>
The French envoy is visiting Sanaa for the second time to keep
the Yemenis posted about France's mediation talks with Eritrean
President Isaias Afewerki on the Yemeni-Eritrean conflict. The
French envoy had earlier left Sanaa on April 27 on his way to
Asmara in the course of his shuttle between Yemen and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Yemen and Eritrea fought a brief battle on the disputed island
of Greater Hanish in December 1995. Eritrean forces took control
of the island before a ceasefire took effect on December 18.
</P>
<P>
Two nearby islands, Zuqar and Lesser Hanish, are now controlled
by Yemen but also claimed by Eritrea.

ALMA ATA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Cooperation between China and
Kyrgyzia in a range of areas has a bright future, Kyrgyz Foreign
Minister Roza Otunbayeva said today.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries have developed rapidly in

Cooperation between some provinces and cities in China and some
states in Kyrgyzia have also improved in the past few years,
Otunbayeva told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Beijing and Bishkek, capitals of the two countries, have
already become friendship cities, she said, adding that during her

<HEADLINE> Former US Senator Considered for Northern Ireland Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Irish and British governments
are considering proposals for the involvement of George Mitchell,
former US senator and chairman of the international panel on
Ulster peace process to oversee the arms decommissioning, in the
planned all-party talks on June 10, according to a report in the
Irish Times newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Like talks in 1992, all-party talks on Ulster's future will be
divided into three strands. The first strand to be attended by
political parties in Northern Ireland will deal with the internal
affairs of the crisis-laden province, the second involves the
relations between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland, and the
third will focus on the relations between London and Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, who presided over last year's arms decommissioning,
is favored by the Irish government to chair the second strand of
the talks process.
</P>
<P>
And as a comprise aimed at placating Ulster unionist opinion,
Canadian General John de Chastelain, who was also member of the
international panel headed by Mitchell, has been proposed as
chairman of a subcommittee which would deal with arms
decommissioning by rival paramilitary groups in parallel with the
talks process.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell is a close political contact of US President Bill
Clinton and is trusted by the Irish government and General de
Chastelain is seen as being acceptable to the British government
and Ulster unionists.
</P>
<P>
The appointment of the two is being considered as part of a
wider package designed to encourage all political parties in
Northern Ireland to take part in the talks process and to bring
about a renewal of the IRA ceasefire.

<P>
PRAGUE, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir
Meciar said today his country is preparing to join NATO and will
not lag behind other applicants in making itself qualified for
membership.
</P>
<P>
Although there is no direct external threat, Slovakia is keen
to join the Western military alliance to ensure its security,
Meciar told NATO's Secretary-General Javier Solana in the Slovak
capital of Bratislava.
</P>
<P>
Solana, who arrived here Monday for a two-day visit, said it
was too early to work out a timetable on NATO expansion before
NATO's consultations with all nations applying for membership are
completed by the year end.
</P>
<P>
Slovakia, along with 11 other former Soviet satellite states
stretching from the Baltic to the Mediterranean seas, has been
knocking at NATO's door for the last six years.
</P>
<P>
NATO's planned eastward expansion has been delayed due to
strong opposition from Russia and several other former Soviet
republics, who maintain their security will be endangered if
NATO's border moves closer to theirs.

<HEADLINE> Report: Change in PLO Covenant Is Product of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Council (PNC) decision on April 24 to revoke anti-Israel clauses
of the PLO Charter and draw up a new one within six months was the
product of an agreement reached between Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres at face-to-face
talks a week earlier, according to the Jerusalem Report.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting on the Israel-Gaza border, according to a report
carried in the latest issue of the bi-weekly English magazine,
the PLO chief and the Israeli prime minister decided that it
would be simpler to fulfill the Oslo accords by eliminating the
articles that called for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
By giving a PNC-appointed legal committee six months to
formulate a new charter, Arafat has spared Peres the potential
pre-election embarrassment of a new draft that would likely
call for a Palestinian state with its capital in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Equally, the six-month delay gives Arafat a leverage: The final
wording of the charter will depend on progress in the peace
process, and on the tone Israel adopts at the final status
talks set to begin in May.
</P>
<P>
Peres was positively euphoric over the outcome of the PNC
vote, describing it as "the greatest ideological change this
century" and proof of Arafat's integrity.

<HEADLINE> Capital Controls May Have Positive Effects, UNDP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Experiences of Latin
American Countries show that capital controls can help stabilize
financial market while immature liberalization may produce severe
consequences in developing countries, according to a United
Nations Development Program (UNDP) study.
</P>
<P>
The study entitled "Managing Capital Flows in Latin America"
compares experiences of Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Their experiences prove that selective capital controls such as
disincentives to short-term capital inflows achieved greater
monetary stability and overall growth. For instance, Chile has
consistently applied selective restrictions on short term capital
flows since 1991 and achieved exchange rate stability and highest
average GDP real growth rate in the early 1990s among the four
countries.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Mexico liberalized its capital account
completely in the second half of the 1980s and suffered a
destabilising financial crises in 1994 and a negative growth rate
since then.
</P>
<P>
Based on the experiences of the four countries, the study
authored by Manuel Agosin and Ricardo Ffrench-Davis concludes that
a small tax on capital inflows is one of the best policy
instruments for avoiding instability since it penalizes very short
term speculative capital flows without impeding long term capital
investment.

<HEADLINE> EU Round Table Meeting on Employment Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A round table meeting organized
by the European Commission(EC) with representatives of both sides
of business ended here today with participants agreed to make
joint efforts to tackle the unemployment in the European Union(EU).
</P>
<P>
During the two-day encounter, more than 70 participants
discussed the employment situation in the EU and raised various
proposals aimed at restorating "a climate of confidence" which is,
said the EC, a prior condition for a recovery in investment and
consumption.
</P>
<P>
The social partners(companies and trade unions) assembled at
the round table stressed the need to "act in concert" at the
appropriate levels, the EU, Member States, industry-wide, company
level, in a strategic framework.
</P>
<P>
According to the meeting's Conclusion, a so-called "interlinked
undertakings" will have to come into being over the next few
months.
</P>
<P>
"If we are to succeed in this, it is important for everyone to
take a step in the other side's direction," the Conclusion said.
</P>
<P>
This means, stated the Conclusion: firms must agree to place
investment and employment at the top of their agenda; employees
must accept a less corporatist form of labour market and the
authorities must undertake to promote a general framework which is
favorable to business competitiveness and which can give rise to a
more solidarity-oriented society.
</P>
<P>
To modernize the labour market, it said, there is need for
positive forms of working flexibility, to reduce labour costs and
to enhance vocational training.
</P>
<P>
According to latest figures from EUROSTAT, the statistical
office of the European Communities, about 18.3 million people are
now unemployed in the European Union, a jobless rate of 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of this round table meeting, the Italian Presidency
of the EU's Council of Ministers will organize a three-sided
conference in mid-June, between governments, employers/workers and
the EC to discuss growth and employment in the countdown to the EU
Summit in Florence, on June 21/22.

<HEADLINE> Canada Approves Use of New AIDS Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Canada's British Columbia (B.C.)
Province has endorsed the use of a new anti-AIDS drug, saquinavir,
despite doubts about its efficacy.
</P>
<P>
The drug is the first of a new series of medications against
Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), called protease
inhibitors, to be approved for use in Canada. British Colombia is
the first province to endorse and agree to pay for it for treating
AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
Protease inhibitors "have been shown to retard the progress of
HIV and to delay or even arrest, the onset of full-blown AIDS,"
B.C. Premier Glen Clark said on Monday when announcing the
endorsement. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The province plans to spend up to 3.65 million U.S. dollars in
the coming year to purchase the drug for an estimated 500 people
who have HIV but not fully developed AIDS, he was quoted as saying
by today's Globe and Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Saquinavir inhibits the function of the enzyme protease, which
is needed for HIV to replicate. It is usually used in combination
with other anti-retroviral drugs, and many practitioners and
patients believe that it is keeping people with AIDS healthier
longer.
</P>
<P>
But an article in the New England Journal of Medicine cautions
that "it is not known whether the favorable effect on laboratory
markers with the three-drug combination will translate into a
reduced progression of disease and improved survival."
</P>
<P>
While the drugs look promising, "the clinical benefits of
regimens containing saquinavir remain to be determined," the
article said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Germany's economy will grow by only
0.5 percent in 1996, a group of independent advisers to the
government known as the "Five Wise Men" said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The group's assessment, released by the Economics Ministry on
Monday, was the most pessimistic prediction which is even lower
than the 0.75 percent forecast by the six major economic research
institutes.
</P>
<P>
The advisers said the economy in western Germany would stay
stagnant and the east of the country would have an increase of 4.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The joblessness would reach 3.9 million this year, they said.
</P>
<P>
Though close to recession, the German economy will recover
later this year and grow by 2.5 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The "Five Wise Men" proposed the government to control public
spending, cut taxes and ease the burden on enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to vitalize its economy and hope to save 50 billion
marks (about 32 billion U.S. dollars), German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl has announced a radical welfare reform package last week,
calling for a two-year wage freeze for government employees and a
reduction in sick leave benefits.

LAGOS, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Shooting broke out in Monrovia,
capital of Liberia, again on Monday near the Executive Mansion
(state house), a report reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear who was doing the shooting, but
some fleeting civilians blamed the Krahn militias loyal to ousted
faction leader Roosevelt Johnson for the firing.
</P>

The report quoted a fugitive as saying that Krahns were
attempting to take the Executive Mansion where members of the
ruling Council of State, including faction leaders Charles Taylor
and Alhaji Kromah, met for the first time in three weeks.

<P>
The Executive Mansion is heavily guarded by the African peace
keeping force ECOMOG, and it is believed the peace keepers were
exchanging fire with the Krahn militia attackers, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Peace keepers quickly took combat positions on the streets in
several parts of Monrovia, and ordered civilians to leave the
streets.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Krahn fighters late on Sunday broke
the nine-day-old ceasefire with sporadic shooting near the army
barracks.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
officials today confirmed that the talks on the final status
of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip are to start on May
4.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Danny
Shek as saying that the talks will begin in the evening of May 5
in Taba, a Red Sea resort of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Hassan Asfour, head of the Negotiation
Directorate for the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), made
the same confirmation to reporters in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the PNA had agreed to start the final status talks
by May 4, in accordance with the Oslo peace accords, but because
that day is the Jewish Shabath, the talks are rearranged to begin
one day later.
</P>
<P>
According to an Israel Television report, Palestinian chief
negotiator Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) will head the PNA
delegation, with Uri Savir, director-general of the Israeli
foreign ministry, heading the Israeli negotiation team.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian officials disclosed that official
negotiations on the final status issues between Israel and the
PNA have been going on for three months.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that next week's talks will be largely
ceremonial, adding that the real talks will begin only after
the Israeli general elections, scheduled to take place on May
29.
</P>
<P>
The decision to hold the final talks as scheduled was
made during a meeting between PNA President Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres earlier this month, in an
effort to continue the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Knesset (Israel's parliament) is
expected to meet in a special session Wednesday to discuss
the possibility of an imminent Israeli army withdrawal from
the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media reported last week that the Israeli army
would leave 85 percent of the Hebron municipal area in May,
and then to redeploy troops in the remaining 15 percent of the
city.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Health Minister Ephraim Sneh said Sunday that
redeployment of the Israeli army in Hebron will be completed
before next month's elections.
</P>
<P>
However, army sources said that the withdrawal from Hebron
could be conducted in stages, with the final one taking place
after the elections.
</P>
<P>
Israel has postponed its withdrawal from Hebron, which was
scheduled to be completed on March 28 in accordance with the
Oslo accords, citing security reasons.

imports fell by 2.5 percent to 6.603 billion pounds (9.9 billion

The ONS said about half the rise in exports could be attributed

<HEADLINE> India's First Athletics Grand Prix Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 30 (Xinhua) -- India's first ever Grand Prix
track and field meet has been postponed because of conflict with
the country's parliamentary elections, a top sports official said
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The event, originally slated for May 8, was a Grade Two meet
sanctioned by the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF).
</P>
<P>
But Lalit Bhanot, secretary of the governing body of Indian
track and field, said because the date coincided with the
vote-counting in the general elections, the grand prix could draw
little attention.
</P>
<P>
"The IAAF has agreed to our request and asked us to fix an
alternate date as early as possible," Bhanot said, adding a
probable date would be in August.
</P>
<P>
The IAAF stated that India could hold the meet in the last week
of August, but at least two days before the Berlin Grand Prix on
August 30, he said.

<HEADLINE> Ulster Women Demand Participation in Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- A new Women Coalition in Northern
Ireland is set to field at least 50 women candidates in the
elections for the peace forum scheduled for May 30, reported the
Irish Times newspaper.
</P>
<P>
It is a signal that women in Ulster, who during the 17-month
cease-fire spoke of their determination never to allow violence to
return to the conflict-torn province, meant what they said.
</P>
<P>
It will also be the first serious challenge to the
male-dominated establishment parties and highlights the impatience
and frustration of women from all sides with the way that they
have been consistently sidelined and absented from the political
process, although women in Ulster make up 52 percent of the
electorate.
</P>
<P>
The Women Coalition includes a number of women organizations,
such as The Northern Ireland Women's European Platform (NIWEP),
the Centre for Research on Women, the Derry Women's Centre, the
Shankill Women's Forum, the Women's Information Group and the NI
Women's Right Movement.
</P>
<P>
The umbrella organization was just set up early this month,
when the above-said women groups gathered to discuss the coming
elections in Ulster.
</P>
<P>
Chairwoman of the Shankill Women's Forum said that voters had
been taken for granted for years that women should participate in
the political process.
</P>
<P>
"We have to show the IRA and the British government that we
want the freedom to move about and do things we were not able to
do for more than 20 years," she added.
</P>
<P>
By April 10, NIWEP chairwoman Ms Bronagh Hinds on behalf of the
Women's Coalition submitted detailed demands to the British and
Irish governments and political parties in Ulster, seeking
gender-proofing of the election process.
</P>
<P>
Now Ms Hinds has received a response from the British
government saying that it would be possible to list a women's
coalition as a valid electoral group which could run candidates.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Hails Yeltsin's Visit to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin's
recent visit to China has opened a new era in the history of
Sino-Russian relations, a top Russian diplomat said today.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Russian Foreign Minister Alexander Panov told reporters
that Yeltsin's trip "showed progress and logic in Russia's headway
to the East, which offers Russia many opportunities to show itself
as a great power."
</P>
<P>
Panov, who is in charge of Asian-Pacific affairs, noted that
during the president's visit, the two sides signed a package of
documents on bilateral cooperation in space exploration, nuclear
energy and trade.
</P>
<P>
The present relations between Moscow and Beijing are based on
three "yes" and three "no" principles, said Panov.
</P>
<P>
"No" to a military or political alliance, alienation from
cooperation with the United States, Western Europe and other
regions and "no" to opposition to any third country.
</P>
<P>
"Yes" to global peace and stability, the construction of a
multi-polarized world and respect for each other's national
interests, said Panov.
</P>
<P>
Summing up the general purpose of the agreement on
confidence-building in the border regions signed by the leaders of
China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzia and Tajikistan in Shanghai
during Yeltsin's visit, Panov said it was actually a treaty on
non-use of force and non-aggression.
</P>
<P>
The next step to be taken is to sign a treaty on troop
reduction in border areas, he noted, stressing that the
five-nation Shanghai agreement had laid "the basis for the
creation of a mechanism of security in the Asian-Pacific region."

ULAN BATOR, April 30 (Xinhua) -- France and Britain have both
pledged to continue their support for Mongolia's foreign policy
and its political and economic reforms, Mongolian President
Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also promised to continue humanitarian aid to
Mongolia and expressed appreciation of and backing for its
self-declared nuclear-free status, Ochirbat said in an interview
with the newspaper People's Right.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia's reforms, aimed at transforming its centrally-planned
economy into a market-oriented one, have won support from France
and Britain since they were launched in 1990, said Ochirbat,
shortly after his return from his first visit to the two countries.
</P>
<P>
France promised to grant Mongolia 10 million francs (about 2
million U.S. dollars) in aid to establish a geographical remote
control research center, and decided to reopen its embassy in Ulan
Bator as quickly as possible, Ochirbat said.
</P>
<P>
The two European countries also agreed to strengthen their
relations with Mongolia and increase economic and trade contacts,
he added.

<HEADLINE> Slower Economic Growth Fuels Prospect of Rate Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Interest rate cuts appear to be
firmly back on the agenda in Britain after new figures on Monday
showed that economic growth remains sluggish.
</P>
<P>
Gross domestic product grew by 0.4 percent in the first quarter
of this year compared with 0.5 percent in the last quarter of
1995, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show -
the slowest rate of growth for a year.
</P>
<P>
Growth in the first quarter compared with the same period a
year earlier was 2.0 percent, the same annual growth rate as the
previous quarter and lower than financial analysts expected.
</P>
<P>
The figures threw fresh doubt on the upbeat forecast by Kenneth
Clarke, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, for 3 percent annual
growth this year.
</P>
<P>
The data clearly illustrate the contrasting fortunes of
different sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing recorded virtually no growth, as companies worked
off stocks of unsold goods instead of stepping up new production,
and export sales dipped as key overseas markets faltered.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to manufacturing, the service sector continued to
enjoy robust growth, although at a slower rate than in previous
quarters.
</P>
<P>
Total service sector output grew by 0.5 percent in the first
quarter, compared with 0.8 percent in the previous quarter, and
was 2.8 percent higher than in the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Some economists said that the data has intensified pressure on
the Chancellor to cut interest rates to deliver faster growth
before the next general election, which must be held by mid-1997
at the latest.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Parliament Speaker Criticizes Liberals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Parliament Speaker Ali
Akbar Nateq-Nouri today lashed out at what he called liberals in
the country, warning that they pose a serious threat to the
Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Nateq-Nouri, a hardliner, noted that if liberalism prevailed in
the country, not only the Islamic laws could not be implemented
but also previous humiliation and dependence would return.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with the commanders and officials of the Islamic
Revolution's Guards Corps (IRGC), he warned that the liberals'
threat to the Islamic revolution was neither superficial nor over,
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, the Basij (volunteer forces) and Hezbollah
(Party of God) people should exercise vigilance and eliminate
liberalism.
</P>
<P>
However, Nateq-Nouri did not specify who are liberals inside
the country.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the parliament speaker was obviously
referring to President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and his supporters.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the power struggle between the conservative
camp headed by Nateq-Nouri and the liberal camp led by Rafsanjani
will be more fierce in the presidential elections scheduled for
June 1997 than in the parliament elections held in March and April.
</P>
<P>
In his strongly-worded statement, Nateq-Nouri said, "there is
a group that favors holding talks with the United States and
backing down from such issues as Salman Rushdie, the Palestinians
and the Middle East peace process."
</P>
<P>
But, he stressed, "we believe that we should not take even a
single step back from our principles and values because, if we do
so, our country's independence will perish."

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Suggests Continued Presence in El Salvador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 30 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali proposes that a United Nations Office of
Verification replace the Mission of the United Nations In El
Salvador (MINUSAL) whose mandate expires today.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the General Assembly, Boutros-Ghali said that a
continued presence in El Salvador is required in order to carry
out the U.N.'s responsibility to verify all aspects of the peace
accords.
</P>
<P>
Though El Salvador has achieved some positive developments in
public security since he put forward the report last October, a
post-war crime wave has been exacerbated by organized crime,
simmering social protest periodically disturbed the public order
and led to violence, inconclusive efforts made to professionalize
and modernize the national civil police and the progress has been
slow in improving the skills of judges and prosecutors to meet
professional and ethical standards.
</P>
<P>
"The public security situation in El Salvador and efforts by
the government to address it continue to raise concern," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Recent developments suggest a reversion in the trend towards
fulfillment of the recommendations relating to judicial reform and
other measures arising from the peace accords aimed at
strengthening the rule of law, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the programs designed to ensure the
productive reintegration of combatants and others most affected by
the war will fall far short of ensuring the successful
reintegration of this segment of the population.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the verification responsibilities assumed by the
U.N. in El Salvador will not be completed by April 30 and it is
necessary to set up a new mechanism known as the United Nations
Office of Verification to replace the expired MINUSAL.

ZAGREB, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Nato-led Implementation Force
(IFOR) on Monday called on Bosnian parties to take
responsibilities in preventing incidents during refugees visits to
their former residence.
</P>
<P>
A statement by IFOR ground troops commander Lt. General Michael
Walker said that the parties, and not IFOR, should be responsible

"Our business is army control, not crowd control," the general
said.

"I sincerely hope that...the tragic events at Doboj will shock

the safety and freedom of movement for all citizens into
responsible actions," he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, two Muslim refugees were killed and several
wounded near the Serb-controlled town of Doboj when they ran into
Serb gunfire and a minefield on their way to visit family graves.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Peres Calls on Assad to Be Peace Partner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres today called on Syrian President Hafez al-Assad to work
together with Israel to promote the peace process in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to American business leaders assembled by the Price
Waterhouse accounting firm in New York, Peres said that Israel
wants to turn the Syrian leader into a true partner for Mideast
peace in the same way that Palestinian President Yasser Arafat has
become one.
</P>
<P>
Peres said that he has discovered that, even more important
than a peace plan, one must have "a partner for peace, much the
way you must have a business partner."
</P>
<P>
Israel has signed peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan and is
entering into the final stage of peace talks with Palestine, but
it has no peace agreement with Syria.
</P>
<P>
"You don't find the ready-made partners, you have to raise
them, the same way we did with Arafat. We are doing this with
Assad. We close our eyes. We don't criticize because for peace we
must produce a partner," Peres said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli leader praised Arafat for showing "character" in
recent weeks by cracking down on terrorism and leading the
Palestine Liberation Organization to renounce demands in its
charter clauses for Israel's destruction.

<HEADLINE> UK Local Elections to Be Held on May 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Britain's local elections will be
held across England outside London on May 2 amid speculations that
the ruling Conservatives are doomed to a disastrous defeat.
</P>
<P>
Over 10 million people will take this opportunity to signal the
mood of voters in the last council elections before the general
election next year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 3,031 seats will be contested in 150 local councils,
of which the Tories hold just four.
</P>
<P>
The Tories are defending 1,092 seats; the opposition Labor,
1,256 seats; the Liberal Democrats, 467 seats; independents and
other parties, 165 seats; and the other 51 seats will be contested.
</P>
<P>
Most of the seats were last contested in 1992 in the afterglow
of the Conservative general election victory.
</P>
<P>
But in last year's local elections, the Conservatives were
badly beaten by Labor.
</P>
<P>
Translating the votes into a projection of nationwide support,
Labor scored 47 percent, the Conservatives 25 percent and the
Liberal Democrats 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
Now the Conservatives will be hoping to approach 30 percent of
the support to show they have recovered from last year's low.
</P>
<P>
The confident Labor will need at least 45 percent to show that
it has not lost momentum and the Liberal Democrats hope to
maintain last year's score.
</P>
<P>
The local elections are seen as the most significant test of
public opinion before the next general election scheduled for May
1997.
</P>
<P>
But it is generally considered that the ruling Tories are
facing a repeat of the disastrous defeat as they suffered in last
year's local elections.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the Tories could lose between 400 and 700
seats and control of at least two of their four councils on May 2.
</P>
<P>
The Times newspaper in an editorial Monday also predicted that
the Tory prospects in the local elections looked bleak.
</P>
<P>
The Times reminded the Tories that in the run-up to the general
election, they needed rapidly to reassert their reputation for
economic competence, hard-headed defense of the national interest
and low taxation, if they were to have any chance of holding what
was won four years ago.

</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, APRIL 30 (xINHUA) -- Chinese Minister of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi today urged UNCTAD and its
secretariat to reform in order to adapt to the new situation and
play its role better.
</P>
<P>
Ms Wu was speaking during a general debate in Midrand at the
ninth session of the UN Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD IX).
</P>
<P>
However, she noted, "the reform of UNCTAD must proceed in
strict accordance with its mission and its objective of
strengthening and improving functions so as to offer developing
countries better services for trade and development."
</P>
<P>
"UNCTAD and WTO are supplementary to each other in
international economic cooperation. The special terms of
reference of UNCTAD cannot be substituted by any existing
international organizations," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Ms Wu continued, "never should the functions of UNCTAD be
weakened in the name of reform. We believe that the convocation
of this session, the political will and joint efforts of all
member states should and will surely lead to strengthened
functions of UNCTAD."
</P>
<P>
In her speech Wu also thanked UNCTAD and its secretariat for
having provided useful help to China for economic and trade
development over the years.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue the sound cooperation with UNCTAD and
enhance further support to it in the future," she said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 3,000 delegates and ministers including five heads of
state from 188 members attended the opening ceremony of UNCTAD IX
on Saturday on the theme of opportunities and challenges after
globalization and liberalization in the post-Uruguay round era.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will come to a close on May 11.

<HEADLINE> Dudayev's Successor Makes Public Appearance on TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Chechen separatist leader Zelimkhan
Yandarbiyev made his first public appearance earlier today on
television, confounding claims of his death by the pro-Moscow
Chechen authorities earlier this week, the Interfax news agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
There has been confusion over his fate since Chechnya's
pro-Moscow government announced his death on April 29. The
government claimed that Yandarbiyev, successor to slain leader
Dzhokhar Dudayev, was killed in a gun battle with other
separatists near Urus-Martan, 25 kilometers south of the capital
Grozny.
</P>
<P>
But the report was denied by other media using their own
sources.
</P>
<P>
Yandarbiyev said on rebel-controlled television that the
announcement of his death by the pro-Moscow authorities was done
to benefit the Chechen government and Russia.
</P>
<P>
He said that even if he were killed in the future, his
successor would be able to carry on the separatists' fight to the
end.
</P>
<P>
Russia's first Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Kadannikov
yesterday vowed to carry on the peace process in Chechnya no
matter who become leader of the rebel Chechen movement.
</P>
<P>
His remarks were echoed by Doku Zavgayev, Prime Minister of the
Moscow-backed Chechen government.
</P>
<P>
Yandarbiyev became leader of the Chechen separatists last week
after Dudayev was killed in a rocket attack on April 21. Dudayev
became the self-styled leader of the breakaway republic after
declaring independence in 1991.

is the creator not only of material civilization but also of
culture and ideology," he said.

<P>
BEIJING, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The forest fire in north China's
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region had been completely put out by
eight o'clock this morning, Xinhua learned from the Forest Fire
Prevention Office of the Ministry of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua also learned that the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China (CPC), the State Council and the Central Military
Commission have jointly sent a telegram congratulating the
officials, soldiers and ordinary people involved in the
fire-fighting.
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out in the Republic of Mongolia and spread into
China on April 23. Helped by strong winds, the fire swept over
300,000 ha of land in nine days, including 46,000 ha of forests in
the Hulunbuir and two other leagues (counties) of Inner Mongolia.
</P>
<P>

abreast of the situation and continue widening the isolation belt,
to prevent any revival of the fire.

<HEADLINE> Africa's GDP Grows by 3.7 Percent in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Africa made "satisfactory" economic
progress in 1995 with its gross domestic product (GDP) growing by
3.7 percent over that in 1994, it was announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Edordu Esq, president of the Cairo-based African Export-Import
Bank (Afreximbank), told a press conference that Africa's economy
performed better last year than in the previous year, when the GDP
of the continent increased by 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said that Africa's inflation was estimated to have fallen
from 34 percent in 1994 to 21 percent in 1995, adding that budget
deficits were down from 7 percent of the GDP to 5 percent as a
result of tighter budgetary controls.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Esq said, higher commodity prices and better external
sector management raised Africa's foreign reserves by 14 percent
from 33 billion U.S. dollars to 38 billion between 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
With the better economic environment in Africa, the African
Export-Import Bank also put up an excellent performance last year.
</P>
<P>
The bank, which was established in October 1993 to facilitate,
promote and expand intra-African trade and trade between Africa
and the rest of the world, approved in 1995 a total loan of 141
million dollars, of which about 17 percent was "in support of
intra-African trade," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the bank netted a profit of about 6 million
dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen African countries such as Egypt, Morocco and Nigeria
have benefited from the loans provided by the bank last year, he
said, noting that total loan disbursements exceeded 48 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The bank, whose shares are mainly held by African governments
or their designated institutions, African and non-African
finantial institutions and private investors, will open its third
Annual General Meeting in Addis Ababa on May 10.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting, to be attended by the bank's over 100
shareholders from various parts of the world and African
government officials, is expected to discuss ways of strengthening
its role in promoting African trade.
</P>
<P>
The bank, with an authorized capital amounting to 750 million
dollars, will help African countries open new markets for its
exports without compromising existing markets, Esq said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of Muscovites
braved heavy rain today to mark the traditional May Day holiday
while rival candidates in the June presidential poll used the
occasion to woo voters.
</P>
<P>
At a rally organized by the Moscow Trade Union Federation and
attended by some 15,000 people, President Boris Yeltsin repeated
his determination to win a second term of office.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin told trade union leaders, who called on him to pay
attention to employment and the prompt payment of wages, that
their demands would be fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of coal miners and teachers, a major force in
the June election, went on strike early this year over months of
unpaid back pay.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin later confirmed he would visit Chechnya before the
election. He has admitted the longstanding Chechen conflict, which
has killed about 30,000 people and forced tens of thousands of
others to flee their homes, is a major obstacle to his re-election.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, who has
been ahead of Yeltsin in most opinion polls, tried to win over
voters by reiterating his strong opposition to Russia's military
campaign in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"Our election program is clear: the Communists do not want war
and stand for peace, honest labor, honor and dignity of this
country," the Communist leader told a 10,000-strong rally
organized by his party.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov also promised to honor all his promises made before
the presidential election.

The operation began Tuesday and is still in progress, said the
official Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) here today.
</P>
<P>
The meat has been distributed among 13,878 Afghan refugee
families at Kacha Garhi, Badaber, Azakhel and Nasir Bagh refugees
tented camps in Peshawar, provincial capital of North West
Frontier Province (NWFP), and surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
The meat was received by Abdul Hafiz, Coordinator of Afghan
Refugees Commissionerate of NWFP in Peshawar, and Alsajjani Musa,
representative of the Islamic Development Bank who arrived in
Peshawar to supervise the meat distribution operation.
</P>
<P>
According to the Muslim tradition, people sacrifice animals on
Eid ul Azha, a Muslim festival due Monday this year, and
distribute sacrificial meat among relatives and the poor.
</P>
<P>
The objective of distributing meat among the poor refugees in
Pakistan or elsewhere in the Islamic world is to give a sense of
participation in Eid ul Azha joys to those who can not slaughter
animals on this sacred occasion, said APP.
</P>
<P>
This is the 13th year that the Saudi government has been
sending sacrificial meat to Peshawar for distribution among the
uprooted Afghans.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the operation is borne by the Islamic Development
Bank and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, while the government of
Pakistan is helping them administratively.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Improves Tourism Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 1 (Xinhua) -- More than 110,000 visitors have
used special tourism buses to travel to Beijing's famous scenic
spots since new rules were introduced in January to drive out
cheating.
</P>
<P>
A local public communication company has so far made more
than 6,000 journeys to places such as the Summer Palace and Great
Wall during the period from January 15 to now.
</P>
<P>
The "Visits to five scenic spots in one day" has been welcomed
by both domestic and overseas visitors to Beijing. In recent
years, the annual number of visitors taking the five-in-a-day
package stood at over 2 million.
</P>
<P>
But some profit-seeking operators asked for extra payments from
visitors and cheated them.
</P>
<P>
Local municipal government departments paid close attention to
rectifying the situation, in bid to protect the interests of
visitors.
</P>
<P>
Ticket prices were re-adjusted and regulated and a local public
communication company opened five special travelling lines to
suburban Beijing's scenic spots, so that visitors can chose their
favorite journeys.
</P>
<P>
Local industrial and commercial departments, and departments in
charge of prices, public security and tourism all co-operated
together in the supervision and enforcement of the new regulations.
</P>
<P>
As a result 32 bus owners still asking for extras and excessive
fees from visitors were investigated, with punishments of 180,000
yuan imposed.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Groundlessly Accuses China of Failure to Implement IPR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government today once
again groundlessly accused China of failure to implement a
bilateral agreement on the protection of intellectual property
rights and threatened to retaliate with sanctions.
</P>
<P>
China was among 35 countries blacklisted by the U.S. and has
been targeted as a "priority foreign country" under "special 301",
a clause in the U.S. law governing the protection of intellectual
property, for its alleged failure to carry out the 1995 agreement.
</P>
<P>
Acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky threatened
that trade sanctions for noncompliance could be imposed on China
at any time.
</P>
<P>
Washington also placed seven countries -- Argentina, Greece,
India, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Turkey -- and the 15-Nation
European Union on the special 301 "priority watch list" for
"failing to adequately safeguard U.S. patents and copyrights".
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government conducts a yearly review under the
so-called "special 301" provisions of a 1974 Trade Act and
classifies trading partners according to its own criteria.
</P>
<P>
Both the review and the threat of sanctions are intended to
serve the policy of "opening markets and creating opportunities
for U.S. companies," but they often result in strained relations
between the United States and its trading partners.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmer Ready to Take to the Skies (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Farmer Zhou Shangyuan's dream of
flying like a bird are about to take-off.
</P>
<P>
More than a decade ago Zhou, from southwest China's Sichuan
province, launched his ambition by starting to build his own
airplane.
</P>
<P>
Now his aircraft is about to take to the skies after being
successfully launched.
</P>
<P>
Born to a farming family in Wanchun Township of Wenjiang
County in this southwest China province, Zhou Shangyuan acted
very unusually when he was young, and even these days in the eyes of
his parents and his neighbors he is different from other people.
</P>
<P>
For generations, Chinese farmers have always dedicated
themselves to farmland, and seldom thought about doing other
things, let alone building an aircraft.
</P>
<P>
One day in the mid 1970s, Zhou found that an engine at a local
processing factory would not work normally.
</P>
<P>
Observing for a while, Zhou told factory director that he would
like to have a try to repair the fault. Using knowledge
remembered from the first year of junior middle school, Zhou made
the engine work again within ninety minutes.
</P>
<P>
The factory director paid Zhou 20 yuan as a thank-you gesture
for Zhou's work.
</P>
<P>
Zhou found that it was an easy way to get rich and a chance to
make use of the knowledge obtained from school.
</P>
<P>
His decision was opposed by his parents. But his wife supported
him.
</P>
<P>
With help from his wife, Zhou bought books on repairing
diesel and other machine engines.
</P>
<P>
Later on, Zhou became famous in nearby townships. In the late
1970s, he set up a store for repairing various engines and
machines.

<TEXT>
<P>
It was in his store that Zhou had his dream of building an
airplane.
</P>
<P>
He realized that it would only raise a laugh if a farmer said
he was going to build an aircraft. Zhou was also worried about
this, but he still started work on his "secret" dream project.
</P>
<P>
He spent all the household savings buying various rotary hand
drills and bench-type drilling machines, but much money was needed
to buy auxiliary tools.
</P>
<P>
To buy all tools as quickly as possible, Zhou sold his the
family pigs and chickens at low prices.
</P>
<P>
With debts increasing, Zhou's tools were far from enough
to build an aircraft. He still needed money to buy an engine,
welding machine, acetylene set and other major equipment.
</P>
<P>
To earn money for his airliner, Zhou spent days and nights
repairing engines and machines. Many times, he was so tired that
he ran into stationary trucks and cars and wire poles.
</P>
<P>
Gradually, Zhou repaid his debts, and he also started to
build his aircraft.
</P>
<P>
With three months of hard work he built his aircraft, 2.7
meters high, 6.3 meters long and wingspan of 10.08 meters. With a
designed flying speed of 60 to 80 kilometers per hour, the
aircraft has a 50 hp-hr engine, and weighs 410 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Zhou's aircraft did not make its maiden test flight until June of
1994 due to various reasons.
</P>
<P>
But this time, his family experienced another difficult time,
since Zhou had turned their farmland into a runway which meant
that not a single grain seed was grown.
</P>
<P>
The local party committee was moved by Zhou's creative spirit and
sent him 6,000 yuan to complete his dream aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The first trial flight proved unsuccessful, but Zhou mastered a
series of problems.
</P>
<P>
Now he has repaired and improved his plane and it can now can
take off.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that he planned to use one more year to fully prove
various parameters and functions of the aircraft for an early
successful test flight.
</P>
<P>
He has plans to popularize the aircraft as a suitable
communication tool in the country's rural areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Trade Development
Council (TDC) will this month launch a "road show" in three
Southeast Asian cities to promote Hong Kong's growing capability
as the services hub of Asia.
</P>
<P>
The road show will consist of three half-day seminars in Kuala
Lumpur on May 15, Singapore on May 17 and Bangkok on May 21, to
explore and encourage partnerships between Hong Kong and Southeast
Asian companies.
</P>
<P>
The seminars aim to capture lucrative service opportunities
throughout the region, a TDC spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The initiative comes after a recent announcement by the TDC of
a 10-point plant to promote Hong Kong's growing expertise in
providing specialized business, trade and financial support
services.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that under the plan, the TDC will organize
high-profile business conferences worldwide between May and
October to raise awareness internationally of Hong Kong's strength
in services.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Southeast Asia, other places where the conferences
would be held are the United States, Europe and four major cities
in China, he said.
</P>
<P>
The three seminars will feature a number of prominent business
leaders presenting Hong Kong's specialist business and
professional services, and how regional partnerships can be formed
to profit from the region's growing business opportunities, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Each seminar will have a special session focusing on
infrastructural development opportunities with speakers from the
engineering construction, and architectural sectors.
</P>
<P>
According to the TDC, Hong Kong is now the second most
services-oriented economy in the world, after the United States,
and the 10th largest exporter of services in the world. Currently
83 percent of Hong Kong's GDP is service-based.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Africa is clearly coming out
of economic depression, Dr. K. Y. Amoako, United Nations Under
Secretary General and Executive Secretary of Economic Commission
for Africa (ECA) said here yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Opening the four-day 17th meeting of ECA's Technical Preparatory
Committee of the Whole yesterday afternoon, Dr. Amoako said,
"beginning with the second oil shock of 1979, Africa has been
through figurative hell. For many countries a record of negative
development continued into the early 1990s."
</P>
<P>
"But the worst nightmares end," he said, adding that "the
picture today is much better. Not universally better, but
impressively better."
</P>
<P>
He emphasized basic challenges which are facing Africans
and said:"First, Africans must continue a path of improved
economic and social policies."
</P>
<P>
These policies must be aimed at a good quality as well as a
good quantity of growth, particularly in securing growth which
attacks the scourge of poverty, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He continued that Africans must cope with the interplay of
good security, population and environment, and strengthen their
economic management.
</P>
<P>
Africans must prepare for the 21st century and join the
information age, unite their strength in regional cooperation and
integration as a way of not being marginalized by globalization,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that Africans must unite their strength in their
society by fully incorporating women in development.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will prepare the ministerial meeting which will be
held here from May 6 to 8, this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 1 (Xinhua) -- An expected increase in output
volume of 29 percent in 1996 and 10 percent in 1997 should
contribute to stronger earnings growth for Qingdao Brewery in the
next two years, according to Salomon Brothers.
</P>
<P>
Pitzi Lau, vice president of Equity Research at the firm, one
of the world's leading investment banks, said that a turnaround in
operations after two years of profit decline for the Chinese
brewing company is now visible.
</P>
<P>
Qingdao's expansion plans, coming as competition between
stronger regional breweries and increasing numbers of foreign
brewers intensifies, will see capacity increase from 500,000 tons
to 700,000 tons per annum by 1997, she said.
</P>
<P>
That would increase the company's economies of scale and
strengthen its position as China's third most recognized brand
name.
</P>
<P>
The Qingdao Brewery Company intends to increase its marketing
expenditure from its current position of around 1 percent of sales
to 3 to 5 percent by the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
It has also started to expand its product range by launching a
high value-added beer, Gold Label, in new package design and its
management strategy also includes vertical integration of its
local barley production so as to reduce its reliance on imported
barley.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official on Arafat's Visit to US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Freih Abu Medein, member of the
Palestinian Council, has said that there was no connection between
the visits to Washington by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Cairo-based radio Sawt al Arab (Voice of
Arab), Abu Medein said each of the two leaders has his own agenda
and issues he will discuss with the U.S. Administration officials,
the Egyptian Middle East News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The presence of Arafat and Peres in Washington at the same time
was just a coincidence, he said.
</P>
<P>
Abu Medein said the Palestinians wanted to prove to the
U.S. the credibility of the Palestinian leadership and people
regarding the peace process.
</P>
<P>
On the Palestinian-Israeli talks to open in Taba, an Egyptian
coast town in Sinai, Sunday, he said he did not expect any real
progress to be achieved in this round.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian official said progress could be made after the
Israeli elections due to be held on May 29 and after the formation
of the new Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arafat and Peres held a 20-minute meeting in
Washington early this morning shortly before the Israeli prime
minister left the U.S. capital for Paris, according to reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Their talks dealt with the Israeli security blockade imposed on
the Palestinian self-rule areas of The West Bank and Gaza Strip,
the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Rao Calls on Parties to Work for India's Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister and
President of the ruling Congress Party P.V. Narasimha Rao today
called upon all political parties to observe a five-year
moratorium on all disputes and steadfastly work for the
development of the country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an election meeting at Chandauli of Uttar Pradesh,
Rao reiterated that his government would need another term in
office to complete the economic liberalization process, starting
in 1991 when he came to power.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that no party other than the congress could provide
a stable and cohesive government at the center.
</P>
<P>
Referring to media predictions about post-poll slit in the
congress party, the prime minister said that the 111-year-old
party would not dry up or die under any circumstances. It would
only go from strength to strength in the coming 500 years.
</P>
<P>
Cautioning the voters to be wary about the last minute tactics
of the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), Rao said that if the BJP came
to power, "the country will break and a new constitution will be
imposed on it," for it was basically anti-secular and had
fundamental differences with the long-tested constitution.

<HEADLINE> FA Asks Hoddle to Take over England Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The England Football Association has
asked premier league Chelsea's Glen Hoddle to take over as England
manager when Terry Venables quits the post this summer.
</P>
<P>
The FA's offer to Hoddle was made earlier this week but the
former England midfielder said he would need time to think it
over.
</P>
<P>
The news of the offer was confirmed by Chelsea vice-chairman
Matthew Harding.
</P>
<P>
Harding said: "As far as I am concerned, his decision to renew
or not renew his contract with Chelsea still has nothing to do
with the England job he has been offered."
</P>
<P>
The news that 38-year-old Hoddle, the only contender not to
blatantly rule himself out of the running for the job, could
follow the lead of Middlesbrough's Bryan Robson and sign a
long-term club contract clearly forced the FA's hand.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said that Venables' refusal to contemplate a
U-turn in his decision to quit after the coming European
Championship finals to concentrate on his legal battles means his
successor will have little time to prepare for the forthcoming
World Cup qualifying campaign starting on September 1.

<HEADLINE> Manila Seeks Higher Monetary Growth Ceiling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government wants to
maintain a growth rate of 22 percent for domestic liquidity this
year in a bid to achieve the country's economic target.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank sources disclosed today that the argument for
a higher monetary growth ceiling is based on the entry of both new
local and foreign banks and the upgrading of some thrift banks to
commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
However, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is insisting on
a much lower monetary growth of 18 percent from the previously
allowed 25 percent growth rate.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine panel admitted that if the April inflation
figure is still high, it may have to reach a compromise with the
IMF to peg monetary growth at 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the expansion in domestic liquidity was caused mainly
by the increase in domestic credits, financed by saving deposits,
as local firms undertook various expansion projects to cash in on
the positive economic development.

<HEADLINE> Surrendered S.Leone Rebels In Custody, Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Nine Sierra Leonean Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) rebels who surrendered to the government on
Monday are "not being detained but are in protective custody",
Major Foday Kanu told local journalists in Makeni in the north.
</P>
<P>
The journalists quoted Kanu as saying,"we are looking urgently
into their welfare before a decision is taken to release them."
</P>
<P>
The nine include three boy soldiers who claim to have taken
part in RUF ambushes and over a dozen mutilated operations on
civilians, cutting off hands and feet.
</P>
<P>
One of them, Allieu Koroma aged 10, recounted he was captured
at Masanga in the north when rebels invaded the American run
Masanga leprosy hospital in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Koroma said he regretted his actions and misfed his parents.
</P>
<P>
"I just want to go home and start going to school," he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
UNICEFf officials said Koroma and his two colleagues will
shortly be sent to a children affected by war (CAW) camp in
Grafton near the capital.
</P>
<P>
Another youngster, Mustapha Sillah, 11, said over 100 children
were ready to surrender but are "dreading" how they would be
received.
</P>
<P>
"We are still worried but we want to go back to our villages,"
sillah added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government owned Daily Mail reported in its
front page Wednesday that rebels led by a commanding officer
called Mohamed killed the head of the local hunters in Malen
Chiefdom in the Pujehun district in the South.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the head of the hunters, John
Bannister, died while ten of his followers received "serious gun
shot wounds."
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a surrendered rebel commando as saying,
"Corporal Foday Sankoh is only using delaying tactics by
proclaiming a so called ceasefire because he is short of arms and
ammunitions."
</P>
<P>
Reports from Bo Wednesday said that government troops on Monday
rescued 41 malnourished civilians from Malen.
</P>
<P>
No background of the rescue has been given but medical sources in
Bo said the civilians have been taken to the French humanitarian
group, Action Contre le Faim (AICF).

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 1 (Xinhua) -- President of the Korea First Bank Rhee
Chul-soo and Chairman of the Hyosan Business Group Chang Jang-son
were arrested today on bribery charges.
</P>
<P>
Rhee was indicted for receiving 320,000 U.S. dollars in
"commissions" from Chang who, in return, asked for an extension of
an illegal 241-million-dollar loan from September 1993 to March
1994.
</P>
<P>
Rhee only admitted taking 128,000 dollars instead of the
alleged 320,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Chang used the loan to buy and build hotels and a ski resort in
and around Seoul, a prosecution official said.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean laws ban provision of loans for use in such
projects unless they are located in government-designated tourist
complexes.
</P>
<P>
Chang was first fingered in the case of former presidential
secretary Chang Hak-ro, who was indicted on graft charges in March
this year.
</P>
<P>
He was accused of giving 77,000 dollars to Chang Hak-ro in
return for his influence in securing a large loan from a
Seoul-based bank.
</P>
<P>
As President Kim Young-sam pledges to rectify the history and
wipe out deeply-rooted corruption in this peninsular nation, two
former presidents, one former finance minister, one presidential
secretary, three parliament members and a dozen of business
leaders have been accused with bribery.

<HEADLINE> NGOs Call for Prevention of Food Security Erosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a declaration which was made available to the media today,
the NGOs said, "We urge a halt to the coercive, unilateral trade
initiatives employed by some powerful governments to undermine the
food security of more vulnerable countries."
</P>
<P>
The declaration, which was released today at a press
conference, demanded "Asia-Pacific governments firmly oppose
indiscriminate and binding liberalization initiatives being
proposed by some governments in the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC)."
</P>
<P>
The NGO representatives, who met on April 29-30 in preparation
for the World Food Summit scheduled for November 13-17 in Rome,
pointed out that more than 20 years after the First World Food
Conference in 1974, "There are more hungry people, there are more
poor farmers and agriculture is in a worse state."
</P>
<P>
They expressed concern that Green Revolution technology is
being promoted without regard for its social and ecological
consequences; agriculture and farming communities are submitted to
strategies aimed at rapid urban industrialization; and small
farming households are being dissolved owing to indiscriminate
liberalization policies.
</P>
<P>
The document said, "Food is a human right." People need the
food to be available, accessible and the power to access it.
</P>
<P>
In their declaration, the NGO representatives said food
emergencies arise from natural as well as human-made disasters;
and a slow but equally menacing disaster derives from
contamination of entire ecosystems, specifically its natural
protein-sourcing and other food-productive capacities.
</P>
<P>
It cited floods, earthquakes, droughts, civil conflicts, use of
land mines, and heavy use of toxic agricultural chemicals, which
increase the vulnerability of the food insecure communities.
</P>
<P>
Indiscriminate use of synthetic pesticides, fertilizers and
other chemicals have resulted "in adverse health effects,
contamination and adulteration of food, pollution of air and
water, reduction of biodiversity, and the depletion of soil
fertility."
</P>
<P>
Today, almost 800 million people in developing countries face
chronic undernutrition and some 200 million children under the age
of five suffer from acute or chronic protein and energy
deficiencies. Low cereal reserves threaten food security in many
areas.
</P>
<P>
The declaration is also strongly opposed to the use of foods as
a political weapon, such as food blockages of countries and
communities.
</P>
<P>
It said the concept of sustainable agriculture and agricultural
support-systems must be central to the idea of ensuring food for
all, particularly for vulnerable groups.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The entire northern states of Nigeria
are seiously endangered by poor soil quality, deforestation and
dsertification which, if not checked, would worsen the food
security of the country, according to a senior emvironmental
protection official.
</P>
<P>
The problem was far worse than "the dramatized reports of oil

network (EANET-Africa), a non-governmental organization
monitering the implication of the encroaching desertificaion.
</P>
<P>
The Sahara desert bordering the northern states has advanced
beyond and encroached into the middle belt states which he said
"are the country's bread basket".
</P>
<P>
The impact of desert encroachment has been confirmeed by
information and data from remote sensing satellite imagery which
indicates that "any moment from now, we shall be witnessing a slow
process of disappearance of the natural resources", according
to the official.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Minister Calls For Education Overhaul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 1 (Xinhua) -- A Zimbabwean minister yesterday
underscored the pressing need for an immediate overhaul of the
education system.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister of Education William Gumbochuma said the
current education curriculum was so lukewarm that students could
easily score "fantastic" grades at o-level but remain "academic
disasters".
</P>
<P>
He vowed not to allow the rot to spread or to be currently
"sweeping the mess".
</P>
<P>
There should be a deliberate shift towards practical subjects
and other co-curricular subjects, the minister said, adding high
sounding core-subjects only helped in the production of
academics, while practical subjects equipped students with
necessary skills for job creation.

<HEADLINE> Senator Supports US-Israeli Development of UAV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate majority whip Trent
Lott pledged to seek 24 million U.S. dollars this year for further
U.S.-Israeli development of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the
local Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
Lott, chairman of the U.S. Strategic Forces Subcommittee, told
the newspaper that the development of the UAV would boost both
countries' capability to intercept enemy missiles.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, 15 million dollars was allocated for the program, the
paper reported.
</P>
<P>
Lott said that the funds would be budgeted in the defense
authorization bill to be prepared this week, and the proposal
enjoys strong bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
The boost-phase intercept and Arrow programs, along with the
recently announced Nautilus laser venture, are the three major
joint missile defense programs between Israel and the U.S.. All
these programs are designed to intercept enemy missiles.
</P>
<P>
Lott said that Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, who was
paying a three-day visit to the U.S., Monday discussed the missile
defense issues with U.S. Senate majority leader Bob Dole and other
Senate leaders.

<HEADLINE> Lectuerers Call Off Strike In Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Lecturers of Makerere University,
largest in Uganda, have decided to return to work tomorrow to end
a 15-day strike, reported the local daily "The New Vision" today.
</P>
<P>
The lecturers voted 155 to 130 yesterday to terminate the
strike, but they will consider another one on July after general
elections if a government pledge of 1.3 million Shilling (about
1,300 U.S. Dollars) for a professor is not honoured, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
The lecturers have been on strike for two weeks demanding a
living wage of 2.5 million Shillings (about 2,500 Dollars) as
basic pay for a professor.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government has made an offer of 1.3 million
Shillings (about 1,300 Dollars) but declined to put the promise
on paper.
</P>
<P>
The lecturers, however, have not yet backed down from their
stand of 2.5 million shillings (about 2,500 dollars) as mimimum
pay for a professor.
</P>
<P>
The current pay for a professor at the university stands at
448,000 Shillings (about 448 Dollars) while a junior lecturer
takes home 229,000 Shillings (about 229 Dollars) all subject to
taxation.
</P>
<P>
Professor Apollo Nsibambi, Director of the institute of social
research in the university, was quoted as saying that it was not
advisable at the moment to negotiate with the incumbent
government officials currently engaged in campaigning.
</P>
<P>
The Uganda presidential and parliamental elections will be
held on May 9 and July respectively.

<HEADLINE> Australians Remember Port Arthur Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Many Australians today bowed their
heads in silence in memory of 35 people whose lives were destroyed
by a lone gunman at Port Arthur, in Tasmania island last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Flags were flown at half mast, schools and universities stopped
classes for a minute, even the frantic trading at the Australian
Stock Exchange and Sydney Futures Exchange stopped as all trading
system were switched off.
</P>
<P>
At the epicenter of the nation's grief, Hobart,
Governor-General William Deane led a service at St David's
Anglican Cathedral attended by Prime Minister John Howard and
Opposition leader Kim Beazley.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Howard and Beazley visited the site of the massacre,
laying wreaths on the stairs of the Broad Arrow cafe in which 20
people were killed and speaking with a large group of local
residents and site workers.
</P>
<P>
Howard said, "This is an event that has shaken the core of this
country in a way that no individual crime has done in my
lifetime."
</P>
<P>
Tasmania's Anglican Bishop Newell said that people would
remember those who died and prayers would go out to the dead and
the loved ones who were suffering.
</P>
<P>
In Sydney, the New South Wales Parliament rose for 35 minutes
from 10:30 a.m., the time of the Hobart church service, as a mark
of respect for the 35 victims, while the Queensland Parliament
observed a minute's silence.
</P>
<P>
The tragedy took place Sunday afternoon when the gunman armed
with semi-automatic rifles shot dead 20 people in a restaurant in
Port Arthur and 15 others including three hostages before he was
captured by the police.

<HEADLINE> FAO Sounds Alarm Bell on Mideast Water Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The report, released today, warns that by the year 2000, six
out of seven East African countries and all five North African
countries bordering the mediterranean, including Algeria, Egypt,
Libya, Morocco and Tunisia, will be sustaining water shortage.
</P>
<P>
"Overextraction of groundwater is a growing problem in many
areas, most acute in the Near East, where it leads to salt-water
intrusion and causes irreversible damage to aquifers," the report
says.
</P>
<P>
The shortage will lead to rivalry between countries sharing
water tributaries, such as the Jordan River. "Competition is
certain to increase among riparian countries and among sectors
within the countries," the report says.
</P>
<P>
According to the FAO report, Mediterranean countries will face
severe ecological problems within a few years because of urban
expansion and tourism, which are destroying water resources and
farmland.
</P>
<P>
"The Mediterranean environment needs to be preserved and
sustained without depriving the millions of people who live on its
shores of the benefits of economic development and technical
progress," it says.
</P>
<P>
The water crisis forecast by the FAO will hit several areas of
the Mediterranean basin, particularly the Middle East and North
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The FAO terms a country as water deficient when water supply is
average less than 100 cubic meters per capita.
</P>
<P>
The report says that irrigation accounts for 80 percent of
water use in the area, with the greatest increase in demand in
cities and towns. The FAO calls for increased water conservation
and the use of brackish groundwater, recycled water and
desalinated seawater.
</P>
<P>
The FAO report was prepared for its European regional
conference meeting, which was held Monday in Tel Aviv. The
conference is a biennial gathering of ministers from the 40
member countries of FAO in the European region. The ministers are
preparing for the first World Food Summit to be held November
13-17 in Rome.

The RBA's index of commodity prices rose 2.6 percent in special
drawing rights (SDR) in April. The index was composed by
measuring Australian commodity prices against a basket of major
trading currencies.
</P>
<P>
In terms of Australian dollars, the index fell 0.1 percent in
the month due to a strengthening local currency.
</P>
<P>
The RBA said that increases in the prices of oil, iron ore and
wheat were partially offset by a fall in the price of sugar.
</P>
<P>
However, the world economy is expected to pick up speed later
this year. Demand for Australian raw materials will increase as
Australia's major trading partner, Japan, began to show signs of
shaking off economic doldrums.

<HEADLINE> Ban Upheld Against Singapore's Doping Violator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The International Federation of
Bodybuilders (IFBB) upheld the lifetime doping ban on Singapore's
top women bodybuilder Jojo Sinclair, a newspaper reported here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But the IFBB lifted the previous one-year suspension of the
Singapore Bodybuilding Federation, the Straits Times said.
</P>
<P>
Jojo Sinclair tested positive for the banned substance
Stanozolol at the World Bodybuilding Championships in Belgium last
year and was later stripped of the 52-kilogram gold she won there.
</P>
<P>
The Straits Times said an IFBB appeal panel ruled Monday that
the Singapore federation should not be punished for Sinclair's
doping case.
</P>
<P>
Sinclair, 44, had also appealed against the testing procedures
but was rebuffed, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The IFBB panel said Sinclair, who denied she had taken the
drug, could still lodge another appeal "after a reasonable period
of time", the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Hardliner Predicts Short Life of Liberal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 1 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian hardliner predicted that
the liberal camp backed by President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani will
disappear from the Iranian political scene in some 15 months,
according to today's local English paper Iran News.
</P>
<P>
Seyed Ahmad Rasooli-Nejad, a member of the current and next
parliament and a supporter of the conservative camp -- the Society
of Combatant Clergymen (SCC), said the liberal modernist faction
supported by President Rafsanjani, known as Group-6, will disappear
from the political scene with the termination of the presidency of
Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
He said the Group-6 members have created a lot of economic,
social and cultural problems for the country while in office, but
President Rafsanjani remained silent on the way of working of the
group.
</P>
<P>
Rasooli-Nejad also lost no chance to attack members of the
Group-6 for economic problems such as high inflation and heavy
duties on housing construction.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the power struggle between Iran's
liberal and conservative camps will be getting more and more
fierce in the presidential elections scheduled to be held in June
1997.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that it is hard to know what kind of
situation will be turning out as the conflicts between the
liberals headed by President Rafsanjani and the conservatives
headed by Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri are getting
fierce in the political arena of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Nateq-Nouri Tuesday lashed out liberals in the country,
warning that they posed serious threat to the Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
He said if liberalism prevailed in the country, not only the
Islamic laws could not be implemented but also previous
humiliation and dependence would return.

<P>
PRAGUE, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Olympic champion Jan-Ove Waldner
lost unexpectedly to Alex Perry in Sweden's 4-1 victory over
England at the European Table Tennis Championships in Bratislava,
Slovakia, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Perry, who had never won an international match for England,
lost the first set 19-21 but rallied to take the next two 21-13,
21-18.
</P>
<P>
Waldner drew power from his forehand loop shots but at the same
time erred much to allow Perry surged to 18-18 in the deciding
game.
</P>
<P>
The setback did not prevent Sweden from beating England for the
last group match and entering the semi-final as the group winner.
</P>
<P>
In the semi-final Sweden will meet Belgium and defending
champions France, 4-3 winners over Germany on Tuesday, will clash
with Poland.
</P>
<P>
France led Germany after Damien Eloi upset world number five
Thomas Rosskopf in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
Then Nicolas Chatelain defeated Thomas Schroder in the decider
as a battle between two reserves.
</P>
<P>
Poland recovered from a defeat by England to beat Italy 4-2 for
the runner-up berth in Group B.
</P>
<P>
In women's semi-finals, Germany trounce Romania 4-0 while
Germany needed three and a half hours to beat Romania 4-2.
</P>
<P>
World number 14 Nicole Struse suffered a surprising defeat to
Romania's Adriana Simion 14-21 and 15-21 to make the score tie at
1-1.
</P>
<P>
Chinese-born Jie Schopp beat Emilian Ciosu 2-1 before Struse
and Olga Nemes winning their respective singles to seal the
victory.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Cattle Herd Shrinks To 5.5 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's national cattle herd has
shrunk to about 5.5 million, as a result of considerable
reduction in the southern African country's breeding stock over
the years.
</P>
<P>
The commercial herd has sunk, in percentage terms, far more
drastically than the communal and small-scale herd.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Zambabwean department of veterinary services
Stuart Hargreaves said yesterday despite massive improvements in
the management of livestock, the national herd was still below
the 6.5 million mark recorded 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
He said that frequent droughts and the high interest rates have
frustrated efforts by farmers to rebuild the herd.
</P>
<P>
Communal farmers who rely heavily on cattle for draught power
have increased their herd over the years and it now stands at
just over 4 million, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
But the commercial herd has been declining and is now
calculated at about 1 million with its breeding herd down to no
more than 400,000.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the cattle producers association said in the space
of only four years the commercial herd has declined by about 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the association Bob Swift said that while the 1992 and
1995 droughts accelerated the decline, the overwhelming cause was
high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
He warned that unless a meangingful facility was made available to
cattle producers Zimbabwe would soon be unable to fulfil its beef
quota to Europe.

KUWAIT CITY, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The French warship Commandant
Bory will arrive in Kuwait Thursday to take part in a multilateral
naval exercise, a statement released by the French embassy in
Kuwait said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the planned maneuver, code-named
"Eager Sentry 96/2", will start on May 5 and will last for one
week.
</P>
<P>
The maneuver, which will be participated by Kuwaiti, French and

signed by Kuwait and France following the liberation of Kuwait
from the seven-month Iraqi occupation in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has signed defense pacts with France, the United States,
Britain and Russia since the end of the Gulf War in 1992 and has
conducted over 30 multilateral military maneuvers since then.
</P>
<P>
The warship, which is the third of the nine frigates designed
for France to show up on all the seas around the world, is
equipped with four Exocet missiles, two 100mm guns, two 40mm guns
and the Dagaie chaffs launcher that deflects missiles, the

<P>
COLOMBO, May 1 (Xinhua)-- Sri Lankans Celebrated the
International Labor Day today amidst tight security precautions,
and demonstrations were banned this year under the Emergency
Regulations.
</P>
<P>
May day celebrations are traditionally a show of strength by
political parties in Sri Lanka. There are usually marches and
processions through the streets and public meetings held under
the banners of the different political parties.
</P>
<P>
However, processions and demonstrations were banned by police
this year under the Emergency Regulations due to the prevailing
security situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
At least 22 May Day rallies were to be held in the afternoon
with major political parties and trade unions marking the event
with meetings at different venues in Colombo, the capital of Sri
Lanka, according to police sources.
</P>
<P>
The ruling People's Alliance is scheduled to hold its rally at
the Colombo Town Hall grounds.
</P>
<P>
The major opposition party, the United National Party (UNP),
will hold its rally at Avissawella.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the People's Liberation Front, which is to
conduct May Day celebrations after a lapse of 12 years, will hold
its rally at the Burgher recreation Club grounds.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Feature: Chinese Doctors And Their Ugandan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan patients say the Chinese
medical treatment saves life. Chinese doctors say thirteen years
of aid work benefits both.
</P>
<P>
The local people are getting comfortable with acupuncture.
That's one thing.
</P>
<P>
"I can walk now!" exclaimed a hemiplegia patient who regained
the ability to move the right parts of her body after receiving
two weeks of acupuncture treatment.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the "Needle Mama", Dr. Luo Yongli.
</P>
<P>
Luo, an acupuncture specialist among the Chinese medical aid
team working in Uganda, has during the last eight months cured
thousands of Ugandan patients by inserting tips of needles into
specific points of the human body so as to stimulate nerve
impulses.
</P>
<P>
"I'm here to sow the seeds of traditional Chinese medicine --
and friendship," Luo writes in a medical journal she has been
keeping since the team, the seventh of the Chinese Medical Aid
Mission in Uganda, kicked off aid services in July, 1995.
</P>
<P>
There are eight Chinese doctors in the team, combating all
sorts of epidemics at a hospital in Jinja, the second largest
city 80 kilometers east of Ugandan capital Kampala.
</P>
<P>
Jinja Hospital, once the country's best known with a history
of 70 years, is now old, shabby and in severe shortage of funds,
medicine and equipment.
</P>
<P>
But the hard conditions have no compromise to the rescue work
by the Chinese doctors.
</P>
<P>
A story was told about Dr. Liu Lan, a young sergeon who
assisted her Egyptian colleague to bring a shock patient back to
senses when the hospital's shock-resistant medicine was used up.
</P>
<P>
Liu used traditional Chinese medicine as a replacement. It
worked. She helped the Egyptian doctor perform the operation, and
succeeded.
</P>
<P>
No wonder. The Chinese doctors, with their outstanding
professional competence, have completed hundreds of operations on
complicated cases.
</P>
<P>
The achievements include the removal of advanced breast cancer
and massive ulcerous breast cancer, as well as the splenectomy
and replantation of spleen.
</P>
<P>
They didn't forget to apply new medical technologies.
</P>
<P>
Yan Qun, a surgeon who is also the team leader, is now using a
sigmoidscope to examine and treat the dieases on the colons and
sigmiods. That's a world-class medical technology.
</P>
<P>
But what is more important is that the Chinese medical aid
workers dedicate themselves to their "African brothers and
sisters."
</P>
<P>
Whenever needed, the Chinese doctors are always coming to help.
</P>
<P>
Awakened by a sudden telephone ring at midnight, the team
rushed to the rescue of a local patient who became impetus from a
dead headache and fever.
</P>
<P>
He was said to have caught malaria at some hospitals and had
been "treated" accordingly.
</P>
<P>
But actually it's meningitis, according to the diagnosis by
Chinese doctor Li Yongjie. Hours of emergency treatment made the
dying man come to life.
</P>
<P>
As the man was about to leave hospital two weeks later, his
son disclosed that the family had already made arrangements for
the funeral of his father!
</P>
<P>
There are over 550 such cases during the last eight months.
</P>
<P>
And the Chinese medical aid team have cured thousands of
Ugandan patients during the period of time.
</P>
<P>
"We feel we are needed here. That's the best payment," said
Yan Qun, leader of the medical team.
</P>
<P>
"And we will remain here," she said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Jockeying for India's New Government Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 1 (Xinhua) -- As a hung parliament is expected
by most of the political parties in India, jockeying for the new
government has already begun even before counting of votes for the
11th Lok Sabha (Lower House) elections on May 8-9.
</P>
<P>
Former prime minister V. Pratap Singh Tuesday expressed the
hope that dissident congressmen and splinter groups would support
the "third force" to form the government at the center.
</P>
<P>
The chances of the "third force" forming the government were
bright. With the help of rebel Congressmen and Communists, it
would manage the majority of the 543 elective seats in the
parliament, Singh said.
</P>
<P>
The situation was bound to arise since all the three
contenders, the Congress Party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
and the third force --National Front-Left Front, would be getting
Lok Sabha seats in the range of 130 to 180, he further said.
</P>
<P>
Former Karnataka chief minister Ramakrishna Hegde suggested
Tuesday that leaders of the Janata Dal, its allies and the Left
Front should sit together after the Lok Sabha elections and work
out the possibility of forming the government at the center.
</P>
<P>
Leaders should chalk out a minimum program that would carry the
country towards prosperity. The ground should be prepared before
the results, as there would be a scramble later if no party got a
majority, he said.

political scenario changed in favor of the Congress Party and
quite different to the 1991 Lok Sabha poll.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that the Congress will get a working
majority in the current Lok Sabha poll. He said that he would be
in national-level politics after the Lok Sabha polls as he had
rendered long enough service in the state.
</P>
<P>
The rebels had started returning to the Congress fold and were
working together for Congress victory, he added.
</P>
<P>
BJP prime ministerial candidate Atal Behari Vajpayee hinted
Tuesday at the possibility of some honest Congressmen supporting
his party to form the government at the center after the
elections.
</P>
<P>
Without naming the congressmen, Vajpayee said "talks with them
are on and the modalities will be worked out in the post-poll
scenario." he also claimed that a split in the Congress after the
elections was in the offing.
</P>
<P>
Apart from some Congressmen, the BJP would get the support of
Samata (Equality) Party and some regional parties, Vajpayee said,
adding that he had no hesitation in becoming the country's next

COLOMBO, May 1 (Xinhua)-- Sri Lankan president Chandrika
Kumaratunga said today the country's working class wants to see an
early end to the ethnic war and that an atmosphere is being
created to promote unity among different communities.
</P>
<P>
In her May Day massage to the nation, the president said this
year's celebrations were held at a time when an environment is
being created to boost unity among Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim
communities in the north-east and south once again.

The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) has been fighting
against the government for a separate Tamil state in the

have been killed in the civil war.
</P>
<P>
The president said the political proposals are aimed at ending
the war as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
She said the atmosphere of peace created through the
implementation of these proposals will enable the working class to
further enjoy their rights for improved standards of living and
clear the way for prosperity for the people of Sri Lanka as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
There were 22 May Day rallies organized by different political
parties and trade unions in Colombo today. About 10,000 Army and
police personnel have been deployed to beef up security.

YANGON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Four more state-owned saw mills are
to be privatized in Myanmar, the New Light of Myanmar newspaper
reported today, quoting an announcement of the Privatization
Commission.
</P>
<P>
The latest move is in line with another privatization plan for

<HEADLINE> China Urges West to Take Active Part in ADF Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- China today called upon the developed
countries to actively participate in the Asian Development Fund
(ADF) negotiations so as to help reach a fruitful conclusion as
early as possible.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 29th annual Asian Development Bank (ADB)
meeting, Yin Jieyan, deputy governor of the People's Bank of
China, said the Asia-Pacific region has demonstrated a robust
momentum for economic development, but the level of development
remains uneven.
</P>
<P>
Over 60 percent of the world impoverished population still live
in this region, and the fight against poverty continues to be
extremely challenging, Yin said.
</P>
<P>
"We are of the view that in the process of social and economic
development, many developing members of the bank are in an urgent
need for the support from the international community and
particularly the support of concessional fund," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1979, thanks to the policy of economic reform and opening
up, China's economy has grown rapidly, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, China remains a low-income developing country
characterized by a large population base and unbalanced
development, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have been committed to solving the subsistence problem for
65 million people and eliminating poverty before the year 2000.
This is certainly a task of enormous difficulty," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said China strongly called on the international community
and the bank to support its efforts in poverty alleviation by
making ADF resources available to China and hoped that China's
access to the ADF will be resolved during the ADF negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He said specific conditions of the developing countries of the
Asia-Pacific region are different and they remain at different
stages of economic development.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he added, the bank should formulate its policy in
full consideration of the specific situations of the bank members.
</P>
<P>
As a multilateral financial institution in the region, he
continued, the ADB should always maintain its "Asian character."
</P>
<P>
It should never hesitate to draw upon and promote the proven
experience of the developing members in the process of economic
development and social progress, he added.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua's Foreign Debt Impedes Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Nicaragua this month embarks on
critical renegotiations of its massive foreign debt which is
blocking any chance of economic growth in Latin America's poorest
country after Haiti.
</P>
<P>
At 7 billion U.S. dollars, Nicaragua's foreign debt is more than
five times its gross domestic product (GDP) and 50 percent of its
export earnings goes toward debt servicing, according to
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Cooperation Minister Erwin Kruger will begin a tour of
European capitals in May to try to renegotiate Nicaragua's debts
with European countries.
</P>
<P>
Russia forgave 98 percent of Managua's debt, some 3.3 billion
dollars, in April.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said there is no possibility of growth since
government spending and debt servicing swallow up almost the
entire national budget of Nicaragua, with little left to stimulate
the economy.
</P>
<P>
Servicing its foreign debt consumes 500 million cordobas (61
million dollars) a year out of a current national budget of 2
billion cordobas (244 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua, with a population of only four million, is one of
eight countries with the lowest per capita income in the world.
</P>
<P>
In a statement recently sent to the International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank, the Group of Support to Nicaragua said that
the country's foreign debt was "unsustainable".
</P>
<P>
The group, comprising Spain, Sweden, Canada, Mexico, Holland
and the U.N. Development Program (UNDP), said "the lack of quick
and definitive relief will have a negative effect on the
investment climate" and limit the possibilities of growth.

<HEADLINE> Serbs: Muslims Killed in Minefield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Some people were wounded and a
few reportedly killed in a mine explosion in the Serb town of
Doboj on Monday, the Doboj Public Security Center said in a
statement today.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Serb news agency, SRNA, today quoted the
multinational peace Implementation Force (IFOR) as saying one
Muslim was killed and seven wounded in the accident.
</P>
<P>
Some 300 Muslims crossed into Doboj in northern Bosnia Monday
from the direction of Gracanica in violation of an agreement
reached between the Serb authority and IFOR on April 25.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, civilians are forbidden to enter the
Republic of Srpska from the territory of the Muslim-Croat
Federation.
</P>
<P>
IFOR tried to prevent the Muslims from entering, but the
Muslims avoided the IFOR checkpoint and reached about 200 meters
inside the Serb territory, causing a scuffle between the Muslims
and local Serb civilians, the center said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
After the Serbs fired a rifle-launched grenade, the Muslims
started to withdraw to their territory but walked into a
minefield, with some killed and others injured in a mine
explosion, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
As the IFOR did not allow the Serbs to conduct an investigation
on the spot, the Doboj security center was unable to give precise
information about the consequences of the incident, the center
added in the statement.
</P>
<P>
In the past two weeks, several clashes have taken place between
Serb civilians and Muslims, who attempted to enter Serb
territories to visit their old homes and cemeteries.

VIENNA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Austria backs efforts by Bulgaria
and other East European nations to join the European integration
process, Austrian President Thomas Klestil said today.
</P>
<P>
Austria will help Sofia forge closer ties to the European Union
through economic cooperation, Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky

country's financial crisis, adding that Bulgaria needed investment
to build transportation infrastructure.

Vranitzky said both sides would look for ways to boost
Bulgaria's exports to Austria and increase investment in the
former Soviet satellite state.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian prime minister stressed that joining the European
integration process and the European security system are the
priorities of his government.
</P>
<P>
He said Bulgaria would not make alliances with Russia, but
would adapt its traditional relationship with East and West to new
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
The European integration process should not close its doors to
Russia, he added.

Videnov also sought a mutual visa-exemption agreement between
the two countries, but received no positive response from
Vranitzky.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government to help Shrimp Exporters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, MAY 1 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Fisheries Department will
issue licenses to Thai shrimp exporters to help them ship out
farm-bred shrimps to the United States, the Bangkok Post reported
today.
</P>
<P>
An embargo on wild marine shrimps to the U.S. goes into effect
today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has demanded that all foreign governments of countries
exporting shrimps to the U.S. guarantee that their shrimps are
bred in farms, and not harvested from the sea.
</P>
<P>
Licenses with guarantees must follow the rules specified by the
U.S.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate exports from shrimp farms to the U.S., the
Fisheries Department has confirmed that it will issue such
licenses.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the department announced temporary measures to
obtain such licenses that will be acceptable to the U.S.

<HEADLINE> Thai Union Leaders Demand Higher Minimum Wages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Key members of seven Thai labor
congresses have signed a letter to the Prime Minister demanding an
increase of 22 baht (88 U.S. cents) in the daily minimum wages.
</P>
<P>
They are going to deliver the letter later today to Prime
Minister Banharn Silpa-archa at International Labor Day
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
They request a rise in the minimum daily wages from 145 baht to
167 baht (5.8 to 6.68 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The tripartite National Wages Committee, comprising
representatives of the government, employers and employees, has
failed several times to reach agreement on the minimum wages.
</P>
<P>
A hike in the minimum wages might not be necessary if only the
government could control prices, said Somsak Kosaisuk,
secretary-general of the State Enterprise Workers' Relations
Confederation.
</P>
<P>
Som Suppanakorn, chairman of the National Wages Committee, said
several factors needed to be taken into account, adding that the
proposed increase would lead to an increase in consumer prices.
</P>
<P>
The congresses are also demanding amendments to labor laws and
the establishment of councils on workplace safety.

<HEADLINE> Abuse of Foreign Words May Be Fined in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian media will probably get
a fine for using too many foreign words once a proposal by the
Institute of Linguistics and Literature is approved by the
government.
</P>
<P>
The institute recommended that the authorities concerned set up
a "language customs" to curb the spread of foreign words by fining
the press, radio and TV for excessive use of foreign words.
</P>
<P>
Shaban Demiraj, chairman of the Albanian Academy of Sciences,
recently called the influx of foreign words into Albania a worrying
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Some Albanians like mixing foreign words with their own
language, considering this fashionable, but the native language is
actually the most beautiful and popular, Demiraj said.

LONDON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Colombian soccer star Faustino
Asprilla playing for the English Premier League side Newcastle has
beened banned and fined on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Asprilla was suspended for one match next season and fined
10,000 pounds by an English Football Association disciplinary
committee following his clash with Manchester City defender Keith
Curle in February.
</P>
<P>
The ban will not affect Asprilla's chance to play in
Newcastle's final two matches this season.
</P>
<P>
Asprilla, playing his second match since signing for 7.5
million pounds (about 11 million U.S. dollars) from Italian League
team Parma, first elbowed the City skipper's face in retaliation
in the February 24 match.
</P>
<P>
Curle was seen to have grabbed Asprilla as he sprinted forward
for a ball.
</P>
<P>
Then the pair were involved in the tussle after the final
whistle which was witnessed by the linesman.
</P>
<P>
Asprilla was found guilty of two counts of misconduct. Curle
was charged with one but cleared of any wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu to Invest 5.3 Billion Yuan in Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Jiangsu Province in east China will
spend 5.3 billion yuan on the development of its tourist
attractions in the next five years, a provincial tourism official
has disclosed recently.
</P>
<P>
The money will be spent on 37 major tourist attractions in
Nanjing, Xuzhou, Lianyungang and other cities, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The year 1996 will see a remarkable improvement in Jiangsu's
transportation and other basic tourism facilities. Following the
opening of an express train service between Nanjing, capital of
the province, and Shanghai, an expressway linking the two cities
is also expected to open to traffic within this year. By 1997
Nanjing will also have a new airport.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing once served as the capital of the early part of the
Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). The development of local tourism will
include the renovation of Ming Dynasty remains, including the
imperial palace.
</P>
<P>
A large part of the money will go to coastal cities, including
Lianyungang City, where an ocean park and a bathing beach will be
built, and Yancheng City, where a David's Deer Reserve and a
red-crowned crane reserve will be improved, the official said.

VIENNA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Canada and the United States
booked their semifinals spots at the world ice hockey
championships on Tuesday, ousted last year's finalists Finland and
Sweden respectively.
</P>
<P>
Canada captured a 3-1 win over the title holder Finland while
the United States stunned Sweden 3-2.
</P>
<P>
Finland dominated the game in most of the play but it was
Canada who struck first when Travis Green intercepted an errant
pass at the Finnish blueline and skated in all alone.
</P>
<P>
The Finns struck back when Mika Nieminen won the faceoff, took
the puck down the ice and beat Curtis Joseph.
</P>
<P>
Hartford Whaler forward Andrew Cassels broke the deadlock in
the 16th minute of the period, breaking down the right side of
the ice before cutting inside and whipping a wrist shot over the
goalie' shoulder.
</P>
<P>
The win left Canada on course for a rematch with Russia who
beat them 6-4 in the preliminary round. The Russians are heavily
favoured to beat Italy in Wednesday's quarter-final.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday, the Americans toppled Sweden with the help
of minor league netminder Parris Duffus who continually thwarted
Sweden's high-powered attack.
</P>
<P>
A slapshot in the head midway through the opening period
floored the big netminder but he was able to shake off its
effects and remained on the ice facing a total of 31 shots.
</P>
<P>
U.S. coach Ron Wilson described Duffus as "probably the best
goalie in this tournament".
</P>
<P>
The Americans will meet the winners of Wednesday's battle
between the Czech Republic and Italy.

<HEADLINE> Central American Countries to Introduce Regional Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The presidents of the Central
American countries will present a regional tourism plan at the
summit to be held in Managua next week, Costa Rican Foreign
Ministry sources said today.
</P>
<P>
It will have to do with integrating the offers of beaches,
culture and ecology that each of the seven countries in the region
have, in order to make regional offers more attractive to
tourists, European and North American ones, in particular.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of the seven countries in the region:
Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama
and Belize meet every six months in a regional summit.
</P>
<P>
The 18th meeting will be held in Managua, the Nicaraguan
capital between May 8-10 and will have "Tourism and Sustainable
Development" as its central theme.
</P>
<P>
"It has to do with planning the tourist routes in Central
American and with establishing a regional policy in this matter,"
said Luis Guillermo Solis, the special ambassador for Central
America.
</P>
<P>
Solis emphasized that 17 regional summits have already been
held since the end of the past decade and that now, for the
first time, Central America is working under a common strategy,
established by the Alliance for Sustainable Development (ALIDES).
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica, for example, which, unlike Guatemala or Honduras,
has no Mayan ruins, has a very developed offer in ecological and
beach tourism.
</P>
<P>
The tourist industry has become the main source of foreign
currencies for Costa Rica which today receives an increasing
number of charter flights from countries such as Germany or Canada.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the integration of regional offers will
make the region more attractive for European and North American
tourists who are the main visitors to the region but the Central
America countries also aspire to open lines with Asian
countries.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Leaders Welcome Letters from Citizens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 1 (Xinhua) -- In a recent letter to Shanghai
Mayor Xu Kuangdi, 48 Young Pioneers from a local primary school
suggested that a children's tree planting campaign be launched to
enhance public environmental awareness.
</P>
<P>
They soon got an answer from the Municipal Council of Red
Scarves, a self-governing body of Young Pioneers, which called on
the 1.5 million Shanghai children to help the grown-ups to clean
up and beautify the city.
</P>
<P>
They were more excited to learn that the mayor had not only
read their letter carefully, but also praised it as "a very good
proposal that reflects the high qualities of our younger
generation."
</P>
<P>
The letter from the children is just one of hundreds of letters
daily received at a special office of the Municipal People's
Government of Shanghai, whose duty is to collect opinions and
proposals from the 13 million local citizens.
</P>
<P>
In recent years this office has seen a steady rise in the
number of letters, which last year reached 54,000. Some 39 percent
of them were proposals for city construction and management, or
criticisms of existing problems.
</P>
<P>
"Most letters are from citizens with higher intellectual
backgrounds, such as technicians, specialists, teachers,
government retirees, and business managers, who share deep concern
for Shanghai's reform and opening up," an official from the office
said.
</P>
<P>
He cited Dong Shicheng, a retired senior economist, as an
example. Soon to be 70, Dong keeps on making investigations at
grassroot units each year, and has sent a total of some 30 reports
to the municipal government for reference.
</P>
<P>
Exposure of corrupt activities of some officials is also an
important part of the contents of the letters, he pointed out,
adding that tips from citizens have greatly helped the government
in its anti-corruption campaign.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Leaders Welcome Letters from Citizens (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to him, leaders of the municipal government always
attach great importance to the citizens' letters, describing them
as a "huge bank of golden ideas".
</P>
<P>
He explained, "We are required to read through each letter,
select good proposals and pass them onto relevant departments, and
make sure that all problems listed in the letters are dealt with
in accordance with the leaders' instructions."
</P>
<P>
In 1995 top Shanghai officials, including Party Secretary Huang
Ju and Mayor Xu Kuangdi, wrote comments or instructions on some
2,700 letters from citizens.
</P>
<P>
Dai Dehua, an employee of a tourism agency, who had made some
reasonable suggestions in a letter on developing local tourism,
was quite taken by surprise when Deputy Mayor Hua Jianmin arrived
early one morning at his home.
</P>
<P>
"It was beyond my expectation that a letter from an ordinary
citizen like me could bring one of the municipal leaders to my
house," he exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
A source at the municipal government pointed out that the
proposals of the citizens, if good and feasible, are very likely
to be accepted by the authorities.
</P>
<P>
"As a matter of fact, many of them have already been put into
practice," he revealed, attributing the emergence of a number of
new amenities in the city last year to the "public wisdom of
Shanghai citizens".
</P>
<P>
These new amenities include the turning of East Nanjing Road,
Shanghai's major shopping area, into a weekend pedestrian mall,
the appearance of pigeons in the renovated People's Square, large
TV screens in the streets and open-air concerts on the Bund, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the letters from the citizens are usually the
most reliable reference for the government's decision-making, as
well as the best touchstone for the feasibility of new measures,"
he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Minister Urges UNTAD To Play Better Role  (by li sizhi and ma fangyun) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 30 (Xinhua) -- UNTAD should help
developing countries with carrying out realistic and viable
economic reform, improving market economic system and enhancing
their self-reliance capability, a Chinese minister said today.
</P>
<P>
Wu Yi, Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation of
China, made the remarks in a general debate in Midrand at the
ninth session of the UN Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD IX).
</P>
<P>
She noted that UNCTAD should push the developed countries to
increase assistance to the developing countries, create a sound
external environment for their development, and help resolve the
special difficulties of the least developed countries (LDCS).
</P>
<P>
"The world economy today is experiencing profound and
convoluted changes, featuring the growing trend of globalization
and liberalization and increasing inter-dependence among
nations," said the minister who came here specially for UNCTAD
IX.
</P>
<P>
She said, "However, the structural adjustment made by the
majority of the countries at great social cost did not achieve
due results, thus seriously constraining their economic
development as a result of the irrational international economic
order and the adverse external economic environment.
</P>
<P>
"Instead of significantly moving away from poverty and
backwardness, the developing countries as a whole are seeing a
widening gap with their counterparts in the developed world in
terms of level of development. The LDCS are growing in number
with ever worsening social and economic situation."
</P>
<P>
After the conclusion of the Uruguay round and the
establishment of the world Trade Organization, Ms Wu said, the
trade preferences accorded to the developing countries were
seriously eroded and some powers keep on imposing sanctions and
abusing anti-dumping measures and placing unreasonable
restrictions in their trade with developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"Against the backdrop of globalization and liberalization of
the world economy, the issues of development within the UN system
have been subject to constant marginalization and negligence,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Wu urged UNTAD to render useful services to developing nations
in terms of improving the generalized system of preferences, and
assisting them in integrating into the international trading
system on the basis of equality and non-discrimination.
</P>
<P>
The priority areas of UNTAD should help facilitate
international investment flow to developing countries, assist
their negotiations on investment issues and support development
of their service industries and improvement of their
international competitiveness, she noted.

<HEADLINE> Deadline of Global Telecoms Deal Extended to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Two years of tough negotiations on
a global pact to liberalize basic telecommunications adjourned
today with a decision from the participants to extend the deadline
for clinching a deal to February 15 next year.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-three members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) who
have participated in the talks failed to meet the original April
30 deadline after the United States Monday bluntly rejected
market-opening offers from others including the European Union and
Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The tough stance of the U.S. came as a shock to other
participants who believed that a global deal on telecommunications
was within reach during the final week of negotiations. At the
initiative of the European Union, they agreed to an extension of
the deadline in a bid to save the telecoms talks from collapse after
two years of hard bargaining.
</P>
<P>
In a decision made at the final formal meeting of the WTO
negotiating group on telecoms, negotiators agreed to keep their
best offers unchanged until January 15 next year, after which they
will be allowed to improve or otherwise change their offers during
resumed negotiations until the February 15 new deadline.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to keep the originally proposed implementation
date of a telecoms deal, which is January 1, 1998, unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the results of the meeting, WTO Director-General
Renato Ruggiero said it was better than nothing. "All the
substance has been saved," he said, adding that the political
understanding now was that the general direction was pointing to
an further improvement of offers in the extended phase of the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The world telecoms talks ran into trouble Monday when the U.S.
told a meeting of telecoms negotiators that it was dissatisfied
with market-opening offers, including those from the EU, Japan,
Canada and some countries in Asia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. said it was particularly dissatisfied with offers in
international telecommunication services.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. fears that countries refusing to liberalize their own
markets could free-ride on cheap international connections between
highly competitive markets in the U.S. and Europe. At the same
time, they would be able to charge high international accounting
rates for incoming calls.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. thus wanted to reserve the right to refuse licenses to
foreign companies seeking to offer international services in the
U.S. after weighing whether they might distort the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. also signaled that it might withdraw its offer to open
its satellite-services market because less than half the 53
participants in the talks had even made an offer to open theirs.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 33 market-opening offers have been put on table
during the two years of negotiations, including the one from the
EU Commission on behalf of the 15 members.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has offered to open its telecoms market fully to
international competition, provided it receives satisfactory
liberalization commitments from a "critical mass" of other WTO
members.
</P>
<P>
The EU also has offered to open markets in most of its member
states, in line with its own deregulation plans, and has promised
to move beyond that to relax the remaining foreign ownership
restrictions in countries like France, Belgium and Spain, provided
that a final global deal could be concluded.
</P>
<P>
Japan has offered to allow 100 percent foreign ownership in its
telecom companies, except for NTT and KDD, the main domestic and
international operators.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian offer provided for an end to the national monopoly
on its international telecom services by 1998 and an end to the
monopoly on domestic satellite services by April 2002.
</P>
<P>
Most of the developing countries, including Argentina, India
and Thailand, also put forward their offers at the final stage of
the negotiations after initial hesitations.
</P>
<P>
All these have added up to the extremely high expectations for
a deal within the April 30 deadline before the U.S. moves to
reject the offers.
</P>
<P>
EU trade commissioner Leon Brittan said in Geneva Monday that
the EU did not share the U.S. assessment that critical mass did
not exist. "Huge progress has been made," he said.
</P>
<P>
Brittan also indicated that he believed the tough stance of the
U.S. could be explained by the domestic political scene back in
Washington which makes it very difficult to make any far-reaching
trade concessions during a year of presidential elections.

<HEADLINE> Bruton Makes New Call for IRA Cease-fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister John Bruton
made a strong appeal in Dublin today for the Irish Republican Army
(IRA) to declare a new cease-fire, according to reports from the
capital of the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
Bruton said a peace settlement in Northern Ireland was
"literally within reach," but it could only be achieved through
all-party negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He once again urged the IRA to revive its truce so as to pave
the way for its political wing Sinn Fein to take a place at the
negotiating table as demanded by the British government.
</P>
<P>
Bruton said, "We want all nationalist and unionist parties to
be there with the will to make the talks a success."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister assured Sinn Fein, who feared that the
negotiations process would be dominated by Unionists in favor of
British rule over Ulster, that there was no question of his
government conforming to or acquiescing in any Unionist agenda or
domination.
</P>
<P>
He also tried to placate Unionists that there could be no
question of their being dominated by Irish nationalists and
rail-roaded into a united Ireland against their wish.
</P>
<P>
Bruton pledged that the aim and approach of his government
would be to ensure a balanced accommodation between the two major
traditions with which both could live.

<HEADLINE> China Urges UNCTAD Help Developing States In Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 30 (Xinhua) -- China today urged the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) to
help the developing countries make full use of benefits brought
by the globalization of international economy.
</P>
<P>
The remarks was made by Long Yongtu, Assistant Minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, at the ministerial
round-table talks on globalization of international economy in
Midrand north of Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
Long said the specificities of the different countries,
developing countries in particular, were often ignored in the
economic globalization. The trend of globalization, therefore,
did not change the varieties of economic systems, development
levels and natural surroundings existed in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He said UNCTAD should take into consideration the specific
demands of each nation and help developing countries to make best
use of opportunities brought by global and regional liberation of
trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Mr. Long urged UNCTAD to bring its economic
analysis mechanism into full play and to assist the developing
countries get to know the effects brought by the liberation
measures of global and regional trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial round-table, first of the scheduled four on
different topics, took place ahead UNCTAD's general debate at
Gallagher Estate in Midrand.

<HEADLINE> China Remains Developing Country: Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Li Sizhi and Ye Xingzeng)
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 30 (Xinhua)-- Although China has made
economic progress over the 17 years of implementing reform and
open-door policy, she "remains a developing country," Chinese
Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi said
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a general debate in Midrand at the ninth
session of the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD
IX), Ms Wu said, "We have a long term arduous task ahead in
economic development" as China has a large population.
</P>
<P>
In China today, she pointed out, "65 million people are still
living under poverty line."
</P>
<P>
She was referring to the fact that some western powers
rejected to accept china into the world Trade Organization,
saying China would be admitted in if she enters as a developed
country.
</P>
<P>
Still, Ms Wu gave an account of China's achievements in recent
years as a result of the effort to set up the socialist market
economy.
</P>
<P>
China's "GDP grew at an average rate of 9.4 percent for each
of the years from 1979 through 1995. Its foreign trade also grew
rapidly over the period with its volume reaching 280 billion US
Dollars in 1995," she noted.
</P>
<P>
Wu said economic cooperation among developing countries is
"part and parcel of international development cooperation" and
that "China has always supported and participated in cooperation
as a member of the developing world".
</P>
<P>
China "is ready to explore and open up together with other
developing countries more channels and fields for cooperation
based on the principle of equality, mutual benefit, seeking
practical results, employing diversified forms and striving for
common development," she declared.

<HEADLINE> UK Deputy PM Calls for Tory Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- British Deputy Prime Minister
Michael Heseltine warned warring factions within his ruling Tory
party this afternoon that "disunity and divisiveness" could lead
to their defeat in the next general election, reported BBC TV.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to a meeting of the left-leaning Tory Reform Group,
Heseltine appealed for unity and an end to infighting in the
party.
</P>
<P>
He told those in his party pressing for pulling out of the
European Union that there was "no credible position" for Britain
outside the EU.
</P>
<P>
He also cautioned that swingeing tax and spending cuts being
urged by a number of Tory members of parliament were not reliable
to draw voters.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, he added, such measures risked putting off
uncommitted voters.
</P>
<P>
According to recent reports, Conservative splits were deepening
as top Tories concentrated on their own post-general election
leadership test.
</P>
<P>
Up to 60 right-wing Tories in the 100-strong "92 Group"
intended to depart from the official line on Europe and to oppose
a single European currency and back a referendum on Britain's wide
relations with the EU when they made their general election
addresses.
</P>
<P>
The right-wing has been accused of plotting for a long time to
force a split in the party.
</P>
<P>
On the left-wing, Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell fuelled the
air of intrigue by refusing to rule out the speculations that he
was now the favored candidate of the Tory Left to succeed the
embattled Prime Minister John Major.
</P>
<P>
"I frankly think that is an interesting piece of lobby gossip,"
he said in an interview with BBC radio.
</P>
<P>
Besides, it was reported early this month that Chancellor of
the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke did not conceal his ambition to
replace Major.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Mail tabloid reported today that Major agreed he would
consider stepping down and handing the leadership to Heseltine on
a plate if the party's fortunes did not improve by this summer.
