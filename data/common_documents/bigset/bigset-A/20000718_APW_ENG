<HEADLINE> States Plan Tobacco Settlement Use  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- States plan to spend $8 billion through next
year in tobacco settlement money -- the first installment of a
25-year cash flow -- and nearly half the money is going toward
health care services for working poor families, a report shows.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 10 percent of the money is going for smoking
prevention programs, according to the National Conference of State
Legislatures report that gives the first comprehensive look at how
states are using money from the historic lawsuit settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, states have earmarked money for tax cuts, general funds
and other initiatives that have nothing to do with anti-smoking
themes, as well as assistance for tobacco farmers, services for
children, elderly care, education and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   The report, detailing money appropriated by 44 states for fiscal
years 2000 and 2001, showed states have enacted 91 laws governing
how to spend their share of a massive 1998 settlement under which
tobacco companies will shell out $206 billion to states over the
following 25 years. Four other states settled separately for an
additional $40 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The money was to compensate states for the cost of treating
smoking-related illnesses of people on Medicaid. But there are no
rules on how the money can be spent, so the settlement funds have
provided a windfall for states to use on a variety of health and
non-health related programs, from rainy-day funds and property tax
relief to fixing dilapidated schools and beefing up teacher
salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the end, each state has acted in a manner that reflects the
concerns and desires of their respective citizens,'' said William
Pound, executive director of the conference.
</P>
<P>
   The report comes just days after a Florida jury ordered tobacco
companies to pay a $145 billion penalty in a class-action suit
filed on behalf of sick Florida smokers. The companies plan to
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-eight states have appropriated $3.5 billion -- 43 percent
of the total amount states will spend through fiscal 2001 -- to help
low-income people get health care, reflecting widespread concern
about the 44 million Americans who lack health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Many states have earmarked the money for expanding existing
health insurance programs for the poor. Washington state has
appropriated $153 million of the $168 million it received for a
state-funded program for working poor families that don't qualify
for Medicaid and can't afford to buy their own insurance.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey, which received $552 million, will use $100 million
to expand Medicaid, a state-federal insurance program for
low-income people.
</P>
<P>
   The report also showed that 17 states used $1.3 billion for a
variety of non-health related services. Illinois, which received
$437 million, used $315 million for property tax relief and an
earned income tax credit and just $26.4 million for anti-smoking
programs and $8.9 million for health care.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota, New York and Wisconsin each put over $200 million in
their general funds. They allocated $20.2 million, $30 million and
$20 million for anti-smoking campaigns, respectively. Minnesota and
Wisconsin didn't use any money for health care; New York allocated
$338 million for health care.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco prevention programs represented the third largest area
of spending among all states, with $754 million going toward
community and school-based programs, anti-smoking media campaigns
and other tobacco control initiatives. Prior to this year, states
spent just $140 million of their own money for anti-smoking
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Other spending detailed in the report:
</P>
<P>
   --Seven states are spending $537 million to assist tobacco
growers;
</P>
<P>
   --Ten states earmarked $534 million for programs benefiting kids,
including foster care, pre-school learning and after-school
services;
</P>
<P>
   --Eleven states put $496 million in reserve to insulate
themselves against future reductions in annual tobacco payments;
</P>
<P>
   --Fourteen states will spend $483 million on education, including
remodeling schools and scholarships;
</P>
<P>
   --Twelve states have earmarked nearly $270 million for long-term
care, including home and community care designed to keep the
elderly living at home, long-term care insurance and prescription
drug coverage for seniors.

<HEADLINE> Single engine plane crashes; minor injuries  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SPRINGFIELD, N.Y. (AP) - Two people were injured after their
single engine airplane crashed in Otsego County, according to state
police.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, Robert R. Shirer, 53, and his wife, Deborah A.
Shirer, 44, were the only two on board when the plane crashed
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Both were taken to Mary Imogene Bassett Hospital in Cooperstown,
where Robert Shirer, suffering from multiple cuts, was admitted for
observation. Deborah Shirer was treated for minor injuries and
released, state police said.
</P>
<P>
   The Shirers were were headed to Columbus, Ohio, from Fulton
County Airport when the Cessna 210's engine malfunctioned, state
police said.
</P>
<P>
   The airplane was last in radio communications with Federal
Aviation Administration flight control officials at the airport in
Rome when Shirer reported his plane's engine malfunctioned and shut
down.
</P>
<P>
   That report came at 3:38 p.m., said FAA Spokesman James Peters.
</P>
<P>
   The accident is under investigation by the National
Transportation Safety Board, Peters said.

<HEADLINE> Mets 7, Blue Jays 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Mike Piazza hit a tiebreaking RBI grounder in the
11th inning as the New York Mets defeated the Toronto Blue Jays 7-5
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   After Toronto reliever Pedro Borbon (1-1) allowed a single to
pinch-hitter Benny Agbayani and walks to Derek Bell and Edgardo
Alfonzo, Piazza hit a grounder up the middle to second baseman
Homer Bush, who threw to second for the force.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Zeile followed with an RBI single to make it 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   John Franco (4-3) pitched 1 1-3 scoreless innings for the win.
Armando Benitez worked the 11th for his 21st save in 25 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Down 5-4 in the eighth, the Mets tied it when Harris singled,
stole second, and scored on Bell's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who lost nine of their previous 12 games, held a brief
team meeting before the game. They also placed third baseman Robin
Ventura on the 15-day disabled with a bruised rotator cuff.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Franco, Joe McEwing and Harris will replace Ventura at
third for the Mets, who already are without Gold Glove shortstop
Rey Ordonez for the remainder of the season with a broken arm.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Delgado hit his AL-leading 30th home run for the Blue
Jays, who scored five runs on just five hits because New York
starter Rick Reed walked a career-high five.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, activated from the disabled before the game, fractured his
left wrist and strained his right calf on June 30.
</P>
<P>
   After Reed walked Shannon Stewart in the first, Bush hit a
fielder's choice and scored on Delgado's homer.
</P>
<P>
   McEwing hit his second homer of the year, a towering two-run
shot in the second off Toronto starter Pasqual Coco, making his
major league debut.
</P>
<P>
   Darrin Fletcher hit a solo shot, his 11th homer, in the bottom
half to put Toronto up 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   After Reed walked two in the third, the Blue Jays scored twice
on Alfonzo's throwing error and Fletcher's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets narrowed the lead to 5-3 in the fourth after Harris
tripled and scored on Coco's wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   McEwing's RBI grounder in the fifth made it 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Reed gave up five runs -- four earned -- and five hits in five
innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Delgado became the second fastest in club history to reach
30 homers, in his 94th game. George Bell hit 30 in 93 games en
route to a 47-homer season in 1987. ... Delgado's 129th career
homer tied Jesse Barfield for third on the Blue Jays' career list.
... Toronto right-hander Joey Hamilton made his first rehab start
for Triple-A Syracuse. Hamilton, recovering from shoulder surgery,
gave up four earned runs on 10 hits in five innings against the
Durham Bulls. ... Attendance was 23,129. ... Coco gave up four runs
on five hits and five walks in four-plus innings. ... The Mets met
for less than 10 minutes before the game.

<HEADLINE> ABC plans NYC rest room ads for sitcom  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) - Turns out television really is in the
toilet.
</P>
<P>
   ABC said Monday it plans to put ads for one of its sitcoms in
urinals in Los Angeles and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just when you think you've heard it all, we have found the
perfect ad location for 'Norm,' and they're called rest room
panels,'' ABC marketing executive Alan Cohen told the Television
Critics Association.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he expected reporters to joke that ''ABC is going down
the toilet this fall,'' Cohen defended the campaign as fitting for
''Norm.'' The show stars Norm MacDonald as a crass, insensitive
guy.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Norm'' ads will combine a billboard above the urinal with
an audio message about the show.
</P>
<P>
   As a takeoff on NBC's ''Must See TV'' slogan, ABC also plans to
put a ''Must Pee TV'' headline over the billboard message, network
spokesman Kevin Brockman said.
</P>
<P>
   The network will also reach out to viewers with automated calls
from series stars reminding them to tune in.
</P>
<P>
   The messages, targeting homes in the top 10 TV markets, will
only be left as voice mails if no one picks up the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to call you and bother you with 'Sign up for a
credit card.' We're not going to even want to talk to you if you
answer the phone,'' Cohen said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Thomas Has Paid CBA Debt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Isiah Thomas has paid off the $750,000 he owed
team owners in the Continental Basketball Association, the minor
league's president told the Chicago Sun-Times.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said that clears the way for the Hall of Famer to
be hired as coach of the Indiana Pacers later this week.
</P>
<P>
   CBA president Don Welsh said Thomas, one of two acknowledged
candidates to succeed Larry Bird as the coach of the Pacers, made
the payments.
</P>
<P>
   ''We sent out all those checks by registered mail on Thursday,
and they should have gotten them on Friday,'' Welsh told the
Sun-Times.
</P>
<P>
   ''So we have paid off every penny of that installment. The job
of consolidating nine ownerships into one took much more accounting
time than expected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas has been told by NBA officials that he must sell his
ownership of the CBA, which he bought last year for $10 million, in
order to accept any NBA coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   Pacers assistant coach Rick Carlisle is the other candidate for
the coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Jay Frye, former owner of the Fort Wayne Fury, said
Thomas planned to use advance payments from the Pacers' coaching
position to pay off the $750,000 installment that was due to CBA
owners on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Welsh spoke out against Frye on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''What Frye has done is totally improper. He had engaged in a
campaign to publicly embarrass Isiah and to try to keep him from
getting the Indiana Pacer coaching job. We hear he has been calling
Pacers president Donnie Walsh trying to discourage him from hiring
Isiah,'' Welsh told the Sun-Times.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 8, Twins 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Chris Richard homered on the first pitch he
saw in the major leagues as the St. Louis Cardinals beat the
Minnesota Twins 8-3 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Richard, who replaced injured outfielder J.D. Drew, was called
up Sunday from Triple-A Memphis and joined the Cardinals on Monday
after a red-eye flight from Colorado Springs.
</P>
<P>
   With his homer leading off the second inning, Richard became the
second St. Louis player this month and fourth in Cardinals history
to homer in his first major league at-bat. Keith McDonald did it on
July 4 and then hit another two days later in his second time up.
</P>
<P>
   Richard gave the Cardinals a 1-0 lead when he hit a shot over
the center-field fence against Mike Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, who lead the major leagues in homers, did not hit
any on Sunday but hit three on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Tatis extended the Cardinals' 2-1 lead with a two-run
shot in the fifth. Jim Edmonds hit a 431-foot homer, his 27th this
season, into the upper deck in right-center to make it 7-2.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Hentgen (9-6) pitched six innings for the Cardinals, raising
his career record against the Twins to 13-3.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln (0-3) pitched out of a bases-loaded jam in the first
with a pair of strikeouts, but gave up four runs, seven hits and
four walks in only 4 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota scored single runs in the third and seventh innings,
but were unable to match the Cardinals' power.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins best chance came in the seventh, when they loaded the
bases with one out. But Matt Lawton's grounder off Heathcliff
Slocumb turned into a double play when Jay Canizaro was caught in a
rundown, and only one run came across.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Jones led off the Twins' ninth with his team-leading
15th home run.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals won for only the second time in nine games at the
Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The once-dead effort to get an outdoor baseball stadium
built in downtown Minneapolis may get a boost on Tuesday when
commissioner Bud Selig visits. Selig will address Minnesotans for
Major League Baseball, a 130-member advisory committee which is
seeking ways to build a Wrigley Field-style ballpark, using mostly
private funds. ... St. Louis has been in first place for all but
three days this season. ... Drew was placed on the 15-day disabled
list with a sprained left ankle.

<HEADLINE> Melvin Lister Wins Long Jump  </HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Melvin Lister, Dwight Phillips and
Walter Davis made the U.S. team in the long jump at the Olympic
track and field trials Monday night, but will they be good enough
to extend the Americans' domination at the Sydney Games?
</P>
<P>
   The United States has won every Olympic long jump competition
since 1964 except for the 1980 Moscow Games boycott.
</P>
<P>
   The streak of seven straight gold medals, including the last
four by Carl Lewis and the world record jump by Bob Beamon in 1968,
now appears in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Lister's best jump of 27 feet, 3&AMP;frac34; inches, was the shortest
winning performance at the trials since 1980. Lister, of course,
was elated, jumping up and down and pumping his fists in the air
after he landed.
</P>
<P>
   But his excitement has to be tempered.
</P>
<P>
   Since Lewis retired in 1997, U.S. long jumping has deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   Only two Americans were ranked in the top 10 last year -- Erick
Walder at No. 4 and Roland McGhee at No. 10, and the United States
was shut out of medals at the World Championships. Walder finished
sixth and McGhee seventh Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips was second at 26-8&AMP;frac12; and Davis third at 26-7&AMP;frac14;.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Glover, a second-grade teacher in Houston until this
year, ran the fastest time in the world this year in winning the
women's 400-meter hurdles in 53.33 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, she beat world record-holder Kim Batten and the
second-fastest ever, Tonja Buford-Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   Glover led all the way in becoming the No. 4 U.S performer ever
and making her first Olympic team at 31. Glover, last year's U.S.
champion and fifth at the 1999 World Championships, is coached by
her husband, Don.
</P>
<P>
   Batten, who set the world record of 52.61 in 1995 at the World
Championships, beating Buford-Bailey by 0.01 seconds, finished
second at 54.70. Buford-Bailey, returning to competition after a
two-year absence to have a family, was third at 54.80.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm faster this year, I'm stronger,'' Glover said, ''so I have
to get used to handling the speed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't do it at 22 or 23, but I'm here and I'm grateful ...
31 years old and running strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, she said to Batten, ''Sorry, Kim, but your record is going
down this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynda Blutreich, the American record-holder in the javelin with
the new implement, won the event at 191-2 -- 13 inches short of her
mark -- and will be the only U.S. representative at the games if no
one else reaches the 'A' standard of 196-10 by Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Blutreich, an assistant coach at Duke, finished third at the
1996 trials, but did not go to Atlanta because she did not meet the
qualifying stndard.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Kreiner was second Monday at 187-2 and Emily Carlstein third
at 186-11.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Petranoff, one of track and field's most colorful
characters, was in top form Monday.
</P>
<P>
   After qualifying for Thursday's final in the men's javelin, the
42-year-old Petranoff held court and distributed his Turbo Jav, a
throwing implement designed to develop correct throwing techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux Greer, who missed competing in the 1996 Olympics by
inches after finishing third in the trials, led the qualifying at
263-1, while American record-holder Tom Pukstys was fourth at
254-9. Petranoff, the former world record-holder, finished fifth at
237-3.
</P>
<P>
   Petranoff, who competed in his first trials in 1980 and made the
team that did not compete in the Moscow Games, thinks his chances
of making this year's team are slim.
</P>
<P>
   ''For me to make this team would be exposing how vulnerable we
are in this event,'' the outspoken Petranoff said. ''I'm surprised
the (qualifying) distances were as low as they were.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got everything to win and nothing to lose. It's a mental
thing. I'm strong physically. I'm trying to get my timing down.''
</P>
<P>
   The world record is 323-1 by Jan Zelezny of the Czech Republic.
Pukstys' American record is 285-10.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.S. used to be the best in the world at this event,''
Petranoff said. ''And right now, frankly, we're maybe as bad as
we've ever been. That has to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Pukstys made the 1999 U.S. team for the World Championships, but
didn't compete because of a back injury.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, he injured a shoulder at a meet in Glasgow,
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was very scared,'' he said. ''Up to five days ago, I
couldn't get over 220 (feet). This was a test throw.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to let it all hang out in the final. I want to go to
Sydney so bad it's not even funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer still was bemoaning his near-miss four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was hard for me not to cry,'' he said. ''I'd only been
throwing the javelin for a year. Now, it motivates me.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Clippers, Huggins Talk Job  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- University of Cincinnati coach Bob Huggins
denied a report that he and Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald T.
Sterling recently discussed the NBA team's coaching vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   FOXSports.com said Monday that Sterling met with Huggins and
former UNLV coach Jerry Tarkanian at a Las Vegas restaurant over
the weekend. Tarkanian is the coach at Fresno State.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting a source close to Tarkanian, FOXSports.com said the
meeting ''went very well, but he doesn't believe Sterling offered
the job to Huggins,'' who is 275-85 in 11 years with the Bearcats.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins, in Las Vegas recruiting, said he was having dinner with
Tarkanian when Sterling came over to their table to visit. Huggins
said there was no discussion of him filling the Clippers' job.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd never met the guy,'' Huggins told The Cincinnati Enquirer.
''It's the first time I ever talked to him.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been reported that current Clippers assistant Dennis
Johnson, Denver Nuggets assistant John Lucas and former Georgetown
coach John Thompson are among the candidates for the Clippers'
coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   Team spokesman Rob Raichlen said that per team policy, there
would be no comment on the search for a new coach.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers have been without a coach since Jim Todd, who
finished the season as interim coach, was removed as a contender in
May. At that time, general manager Elgin Baylor said he hoped to
hire a replacement before last month's draft.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor has since said he hopes to have a coach in place in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
   Todd was elevated from assistant to interim coach when the
Clippers fired Chris Ford in February.

   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Mark Croghan won his heat in the
3,000-meter steeplechase, but his heart was with his infant son who
is in the intensive care unit at Rainbow Babies and Children's
Hospital in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Ten-month-old Griffin Croghan, born with a congenital heart
defect, has been in the hospital for six weeks. While there, he's
undergone two surgeries and had a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors had predicted he would need a heart transplant, but the
boy has done better since a pacemaker was installed in the latest
operation on Monday, Croghan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's had some ups and downs but the last week he's been able
to put seven good days back to back,'' Croghan said. ''He hasn't
been able to do that before, but he's hanging tough. He's going to
be a tough kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Crogan, the 1997 national champion who finished fifth in the
1996 Olympic Games, has altered his training schedule, working out
early in the morning so he can spend the day at the hospital

   ''I've got a new focus as far as track goes. It's not life or
death for me anymore,'' he said. ''I mean, I would love to make the
team. I was really happy with my performance today. But I can
honestly say that if I don't finish in the top three on Thursday,
I'll be disappointed. I'll hang my head for maybe a day, but it's

   Running is a relief, he said.

   TEEN SENSATION@: What a week for 18-year-old Katy Polansky of
South Eugene High School in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Polansky broke the national high school women's javelin record
twice, in Sunday's preliminaries and again in Monday night's
finals. Her best on Monday, 174 feet, 2 inches, was good enough for
sixth place in a field where she was by far the youngest.
</P>
<P>
   She knows she should have been satisfied, but she wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a p.r. again, and to do it in this caliber of meet is as
much as you can ask for,'' she said. ''But I think there could have
been a little bit more there. That's me, always wanting more.''
</P>
<P>
   Polansky plans to enroll at the University of Oregon, but
doesn't plan to compete in track unless she is allowed to continue
to work under her present coach. She will be a walk-on in
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   But she knows there could be an Olympics in her future. She'll
only be 22 when the next trials rolls around.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it definitely shows great signs for the future,'' she
said. ''Obviously, I was by far the youngest one out there.
Hopefully, that will speak for my longevity.''

   DIFFERENT DRUMMER@: In a sport filled with individualists,
1,500-meters champion Gabe Jennings is in a league of his own, and
he comes by it naturally.
</P>
<P>
   Raised and home-schooled in a remote region of Northern
California, Jennings literally runs to the beat of different
drummers.
</P>
<P>
   With his parents providing the lead, friends and relatives pound
a primitive, steady beat on drums in the grandstands as he runs.
Jennings, whose shaggy hair makes him look like some latter-day
Beatle, said it provides him with the rhythm he needs on the track.
</P>
<P>
   A music major at Stanford, Jennings held a news conference like
no other after his victory Sunday. He spent several minutes
explaining how the sunlight floating off the leaves earlier in the
day had helped his preparation. He cried, he said, and knew it was
going to be a good day.
</P>
<P>
   He had reporters laughing with his discourse on the stages of
life.
</P>
<P>
   ''Life is in three stages,'' Jennings said. ''Athletics, that's
the initial stage, to get the body healthy. I'm trying to do that
with running. The other two stages are music and philosophy. When
I'm 50, I see myself being a jazz musician.''

   GREENSPAN HONORED@: Bud Greenspan, the filmmaker who has
chronicled some of the greatest and most infamous moments in
Olympic sports, will be presented the lifetime achievement award by
USA Track &AMP; Field.
</P>
<P>
   The award will be presented at the Century of Champions dinner
Wednesday night. Among those scheduled to attend are former Olympic
greats Billy Mills, Evelyn Ashford, Bob Mathias, Bob Richards,
Tommie Smith, Wyomia Tyus, Al Oerter and Dick Fosbury.
</P>
<P>
   The Sydney Games will mark the sixth in a series of official
Olympic films produced by Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   In a news release, USA Track &AMP; Field said Greenspan would be
honored ''for dedication and service to creating a historical
record of track and field's greatest memories.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Greenspan received the George Foster Peobody Award, the
broadcast and cable television's most prestigious honor, for his
lifetime of work. He also won three Emmy Awards in 1994 for his
official film, ''Lillehammer '94: 16 Days of Glory.''

   TRACK REBIRTH@: In Sacramento, for 10 days in July, track and
field is alive and well in America.
</P>
<P>
   Spirited, standing-room-only crowds have packed Hornet Stadium
to watch a sport that has barely has a pulse in the public
consciousness in non-Olympic years.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Greene, Jackie Joyner-Kersee and many other competitors
at the U.S. track and field trials have lauded the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ''They say track is dead,'' Greene said. ''Track ain't dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Attendance for the first three days were 23,211, 23,450 and
23,500.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this is a new beginning for track and field,'' said
Joyner-Kersee, competing in her sixth Olympic trials. ''The fans
have been very, very supportive. They've been wonderful. I think
the Sacramento Sports Commission did a great job of getting the
volunteers and pulling everybody together.
</P>
<P>
   ''This atmosphere is far greater than any Olympic trials that I
have experienced. Like Saturday, I'm sitting there watching and
they're all into the shot put. That was really great. As athletes,
that's what you want.''

<HEADLINE> Man who once saved tot from drowning dies in swimming accident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELVIDERE, N.J. (AP) - A man once honored for pulling an
unconscious girl from a Phillipsburg swimming pool drowned while
trying to swim across the Delaware River, authorities said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Reddy, 45, of Belvidere died after he tried to swim from
the New Jersey side to Pennsylvania, south of the Belvidere boat
launch, about 4:45 p.m. Sunday, The Express-Times of Easton, Pa.,
reported in Tuesday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   Using a private boat, Belvidere first aid squad members
recovered Reddy's body and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation
on him in an unsuccessful attempt to revive him.
</P>
<P>
   He was pronounced dead at 5:05 a.m. Monday, more than 12 hours
after rescue workers had taken him to Warren Hospital, according to
a statement from the Warren County prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Malcolm Cowen of the Warren County Medical Examiner's
Office, said the death was an accidental drowning. Reddy had been
drinking before the incident, and Cowen said Reddy's blood-alcohol
level was higher than the 0.10 percent limit for drivers, the
Express-Times reported.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-three years ago, a 12-year-old Reddy pulled a 3-year-old
girl's unconscious body from a pool in Walters Park, enabling
rescue workers and a lifeguard to resuscitate her.
</P>
<P>
   Reddy, along with others at pool, had been ordered out because
of rain, but Reddy returned when he spotted a girl's body floating,
the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   He carried the girl out of the pool to a lifeguard who performed
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation until rescue workers arrived. The girl
survived.
</P>
<P>
   Reddy was honored with two Boy Scout certificates for his role
in the rescue.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Stock Exchange To Debut  </HEADLINE>
By TINI TRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- When Vietnam's first post-war stock market
makes its debut this week, it plans to offer up government bonds as
well as equity shares in its listed companies -- all two of them.
</P>
<P>
   A fledgling bourse it may be, but it marks a huge step forward
in the communist country's drive to embrace economic reform,
mobilize capital, and encourage privatization, say investors and
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with last week's signing of a trade pact with the United
States, the opening of the first stock trading center on Thursday
signals Vietnam's determination to continue its path of economic
liberalization.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like an extremely modest start. That's not only
understandable, but acceptable at this point. The greater
significance is that it represents nothing short of a paradigm
shift for the country and its financial system,'' said John
Shrimpton, director of direct investment firm Dragon Capital.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam has been planning a stock exchange since the early
1990s, but postponed a launch for years because of a lack of
companies willing to list and concerns the market would expose
Vietnam's financial system to unnecessary risk.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian crisis further rattled the country's conservative
leadership, who believed the problems were created by exposure to
foreign investment and capital. Plans for a stock market in 1998
were put on hold as the ruling Communist Party debated the merits
of a capital market.
</P>
<P>
   But sputtering economic growth and a drastic decline in foreign
investment convinced Vietnam's leaders that bold steps were needed,
say analysts. It may be years before the stock market truly takes
off, but in the meantime, it serves to boost investor confidence in
reform efforts and renew international interest.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a consensus that this is something that needed to be
done and would be good for the economy,'' said Fred Burke, an
attorney at Baker &AMP; McKenzie who has advised the goverment on
regulatory laws. ''They're moving forward at last.''
</P>
<P>
   Housed in a turn-of-the-century French colonial complex in the
country's economic hub of Ho Chi Minh City, the stock trading
center will initially operate only three days a week. Trading
activity should be extremely light.
</P>
<P>
   Ho Chi Minh City-based Refrigeration Electrical Engineering
(REE) and the Cables and Telecommunications Materials (SACOM)
joint-stock company in neighboring Dong Nai province are the first
companies licensed to list their shares. The State Securities
Commission is expected to approve a handful more within months.
However, the main source of commodities for the exchange floor will
be government bonds, bank bonds and project bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Although stock exchange operations are not perfected, Vietnamese
officials are acknowledging that waiting any longer could hurt the
domestic economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may be small, but if we don't do it now, it will be too
late,'' said Tran Cao Nguyen, the SSC's director of the Securities
Market Development Department. ''Many local companies have been
badly in need of long-term capital for years.''
</P>
<P>
   some laud the country's cautious approach. Vietnam is virtually
alone in the region for putting in a regulatory framework before a
stock market was created.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you go slow, you'll be able to build,'' said Chris Kamm,
whose Cleveland-based Kamm Investments has put money in several
Vietnamese firms. ''You don't want what happened in Indonesia or
Malaysia where money flowed in so quickly that speculators drove
prices up, took profits, and left countries in shambles.''
</P>
<P>
   A stock market would also provide incentive to speed up
privatization efforts. Only 400 of some 5,900 state-owned
enterprises have been privatized under a program launched seven
years ago to attract public savings.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of buying stock is a new thinking in a country where
people are more accustomed to keeping savings in gold. Still,
analysts are optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may take a while, but there is already very active curbside
trading going on so we know the interest is there,'' said Burke.

<HEADLINE> Basque Separatists Wage Offensive  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL WOOLLS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- A journalist returning from an errand in a
Basque town is shot in the back of the head. One of Madrid's
busiest shopping areas is rocked by a car bomb blast. A politician
in Malaga is riddled with bullets as he heads to a party with his
wife and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months after the Basque separatist group ETA called off a
14-month cease-fire that had encouraged hopes for peace, once again
it seems no place -- and perhaps no one -- in Spain is safe.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish government says its initial wariness of the truce
has proved well-founded, insisting that ETA used the cease-fire to
reorganize, resupply and recruit and has now launched a
full-fledged offensive in its battle to create an independent
Basque state.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today ETA has new logistics, a new infrastructure which the
security forces must be able to detect,'' Interior Minister Jaime
Mayor Oreja said Sunday in Malaga.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after he spoke, another car bomb exploded -- this time
outside a police barracks in the town of Agreda in northern Soria
province. The wife of an officer was slightly injured. There was no
claim of responsibility, but officials pointed to ETA.
</P>
<P>
   Since Jan. 21, ETA has been blamed for nearly a dozen shootings
and car bombings that have left six people dead. Most of the
targets have been politicians, police or military officers, as has
been the case throughout ETA's 30-year armed campaign, which has
killed nearly 800.
</P>
<P>
   So Spaniards were especially shocked last Wednesday when a car
bomb exploded outside one of Madrid's most popular department
stores in a bustling commercial district.
</P>
<P>
   The blast came as dawn broke, before business hours, and no one
was killed, although nine people were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the Saturday night killing of Jose Maria Martin
Carpena, a 50-year-old ruling Popular Party councilor in Malaga,
followed 17 hours later by Sunday's car bomb in Agreda.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the organization tends to regroup for weeks or
even months after an attack, so these back-to-back ones are
especially chilling.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say ETA's muscle-flexing is aimed at debunking the
government's pre-ceasefire contention that ETA was a spent force,
its ranks decimated by arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Cotarelo, professor of political science at Complutense
University in Madrid, said it is also highly significant that ETA
is operating all over Spain, not just in the Basque country, and
appears to be keeping the death toll low on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   He said ETA wants to show that ''it is in better shape than
ever, and more importantly, that it strikes when it wants and where
it wants and that if it does not do more damage, it's because it
choses not to.''
</P>
<P>
   As to why ETA is intensifying its campaign now, both he and a
Basque official said a shadowy organization like ETA is virtually
impossible to gauge. But the Basque official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, rejected suggestions the show of force is a
prelude to another cease-fire. ''That's wishful thinking,'' he
said. ''I fear we in are for some bad times.''
</P>
<P>
   ETA has been fighting for an independent Basque state in
northern Spain and southwest France since the late 1960s. Six
months after it declared the 1998 truce, the group held a single
round of peace talks with the government, the first in a decade.
The dialogue went nowhere, with the government refusing even to
discuss ETA's goal of independence.
</P>
<P>
   Many Spaniards express frustration and puzzlement with Basque
nationalists who claim to suffer repression from the central
government in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   That complaint was valid under the dictator Gen. Francisco
Franco, who cracked down on Basques and other regional groups with
distinctive cultures and languages other than Castilian Spanish.
Speaking Basque or Catalan, for instance, was a crime.
</P>
<P>
   But Franco died 25 years ago, Spain is now a stable democracy
and the Basque country is one of its most prosperous areas. The
Basque region also enjoys more self-rule than just about any other
under the 1978 constitution, which divided Spain into 17 regions
with varying degrees of say in running their affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The government rules out resuming talks with ETA while bombs are
going off. It is focusing peace efforts on pressuring the moderate
Basque Nationalist Party, which controls the regional government,
to sever all ties with ETA's political wing as a way to isolate ETA
and persuade it to lay down arms again, this time for good.

<HEADLINE> Auction of Triassic winged reptile fossil stirs debate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - The fossil of a winged reptile that dates
to the Triassic period is headed for the auction block, peeving
paleontologists who argue the relic belongs in a museum.
</P>
<P>
   Lesser known as the Icarosaurus siefkeri, the reptile resembles
a huge dragonfly that's about 7 inches long and stretches about 10
inches from wingtip to wingtip. Its fossilized imprint could fetch
$300,000.
</P>
<P>
   The fossil is about 200 millions years old, meaning the creature
lived some 50 million years before dinosaurs and Archaeopteryx -
evolution's first true bird - emerged.
</P>
<P>
   A trio of teen-agers excavated it from the black shale of an
abandoned New Jersey quarry 39 years ago. At the time, it was the
oldest airborne vertebrate known to scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ''It proves that vertebrates attempted flight some 10 million
years earlier than anyone suspected,'' Edwin H. Colbert said at a
crowded news conference in 1961, when the find was first exhibited.
Colbert was chairman of the American Museum of Natural History in
New York, where the fossil was kept to be studied for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The shape of the fossil's delicate web-like wings and body
indicates that the ancient creature could not actually fly, Colbert
said, but probably was a glider, using its wings to soar from tree
to tree in what was then a verdant tropical forest.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Alfred Siefker, the man who found the fossil when
he was 17 and whose name museum scientists gave to it, reclaimed
the relic. Now 56 years old and ill, Siefker is selling it because
he needs the money, according to David Herskowitz, the natural
history specialist at Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield, where the fossil
will be auctioned Aug. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the block for the ''natural history auction'' are a nest
of 15 dinosaur eggs, two other theropod eggs and a single egg, all
from the Xia Xia formation in China's Henan province.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Icarosaurus is our most outstanding object and really
belongs on exhibit in a museum, not in some private collector's
living room,'' Herskowitz said. ''So we've notified every natural
history museum about it, and they ought to get some of their
wealthy trustees to buy it and donate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists agree that fossils such as these belong in museums,
and they are disturbed by the increasing commercialization of
fossil collections.
</P>
<P>
   Mark B. Goodwin, a vertebrate paleontologist and principal
scientist at the Museum of Paleontology in Berkeley, blasted any
sale of the Icarosaurus as a ''highly unethical event that will
only increase commercialization and encourage the theft of fossils
from museums.''
</P>
<P>
   Paleontologist Kevin Padian, coeditor of the Dinosaur
Encyclopedia, said objects like the Icarosaurus fossil should
belong to everyone. ''Professional scientists are constantly trying
to protect these things for future generations,'' he said, ''and
yet objects like this one often wind up on someone's mantelpiece
where they can never be cared for professionally, or shown to
students, and then they become completely lost to science.''
</P>
<P>
   Herskowitz said the Butterfield's auction will indicate a sale
price range of between of between $250,000 and $350,000 for the
Icarosaurus fossil. The nest with 15 dinosaur eggs from China could
go for $20,000 to $30,000; the pair of eggs for $17,000 to $20,000,
and the single ''fine dinosaur egg'' for $1,800 to $2,250.
</P>
<P>
   As for the site where the Icarosaurus was found: It's home to a
supermarket, a parking lot and a bunch of stores.

<HEADLINE> Queen Elizabeth II To Open Embassy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Much has changed since Queen Elizabeth II visited
the German capital eight years ago, including the street corner
where her country has a sparkling new embassy.
</P>
<P>
   On a trip to open the building Tuesday, the queen and her
husband, Prince Philip, had a tight program of glimpses at the city
that became Europe's biggest construction site after the Berlin
Wall fell in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The royal couple last came in 1992 to lay the British Embassy's
cornerstone and were staying not quite 24 hours this time.
</P>
<P>
   Two 10-year-old girls will present the queen with a posy and
traditional ''moving-in'' gifts of bread and salt as she arrives to
tour the building and give a speech.
</P>
<P>
   Most countries that had embassies in the old West German capital
of Bonn are moving back to reunified Berlin after the German
government made the trek last year. The United States and France,
among others, plan new diplomatic headquarters nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The new British building, around the corner from Berlin's
signature Brandenburg Gate, replaces one destroyed in air raids
during World War II. It was built on the same site where the
British had their embassy from 1875 to 1939, and even incorporates
a wrought-iron gate salvaged from the rubble of the old building.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the smooth sandstone facade, the $27 million embassy has
modern, angular touches, with bold accents of red and purple, a
glassy interior courtyard and an Internet-based information center
for the public. It's meant to symbolize vibrant British culture and
the openness of British society.
</P>
<P>
   After a speech in the courtyard, the royals were scheduled to
head to Bellevue Palace for lunch with President Johannes Rau, then
play tourist at the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag parliament
building -- newly renovated by British architect Norman Foster.
</P>
<P>
   The queen's last stop was at the new British Council cultural
center in Berlin's trendy Mitte neighborhood.

WTO: US Acted Illegally in Dispute

   GENEVA (AP) -- The United States acted illegally when it announced it was

bananas, the World Trade Organization ruled Monday. The ruling said the United
States had effectively imposed unilateral retaliatory sanctions, which WTO rules
prohibit, requiring a country to get permission from the joint membership. The
United States applied in January 1999 for permission to impose sanctions worth
$520 million per year in the long-running banana dispute, claiming that the EU

the wireless industry's most influential trade group. The new guidelines will be
imposed in August for all new handset models submitted for product certification
by the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association, the Washington-based
organization confirmed Monday. Cell phones will start being packaged with the
new information in three to six months, CTIA said.

<HEADLINE> DNC Demonstrators in Training  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY BREZNICAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. (AP) -- Atop the Santa Monica Mountains,
demonstrators bound for the Democratic National Convention next
month are learning how to be like Superman.
</P>
<P>
   They're practicing ways to scale tall buildings to hang massive
protest banners, linking arms to form nearly unbreakable human
blockades and learning how to move faster than a speeding tear gas
canister.
</P>
<P>
   The Berkeley-based Ruckus Society is hosting a training camp
this week to teach activists elaborate civil disobedience tactics
for the demonstrations planned outside the Aug. 14-17 convention in
downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're taking protests to the very edge,'' said John Quigley,
39, as he pointed to demonstrators hanging a banner from a
six-story scaffold on Monday. ''We want people to wonder, 'Why are
those people risking their lives to do this?'''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 150 activists gathered for the six-day camp at a mountain
ranch overlooking the Pacific Ocean, sleeping in clusters of tents
along the bluff and dining in a makeshift kitchen under a stand of
elm trees beside a small lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   The participants are members of various activist groups,
including environmentalists, anarchists and feminists. Many are
veterans of massive protests last fall and early this year that
disrupted global trade and banking meetings in Seattle and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Ruckus organizers said they hope to inspire similar high-profile
demonstrations while avoiding the violence that tainted those
gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to lessons about colorful acts of civil
disobedience, the camp teaches activists safety procedures for
rowdy protests and methods of calming members of a crowd who start
rioting.
</P>
<P>
   ''We show people how to de-escalate violence. We don't want
people to get hurt,'' said Ruckus trainer Lynn Stone, 34, of San
Francisco. ''We also say that property destruction is virtually
useless in a mass-protest. ... It needlessly puts a lot of people
at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   On the first day, participants attend outdoor classes about
nonviolent protests, focusing on the actions of civil rights
leaders such as the Rev. Martin Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
   The camp teaches other safety tips for use during tense
protests, such as using a handkerchief smeared with toothpaste as
an impromptu gas mask.
</P>
<P>
   ''The minty smell helps counteract the tear gas,'' Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   And when police in riot gear move on a crowd, Stone added,
demonstrators are told to simply sit on the ground and turn their
backs to the officers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Showing someone your back is an act of trust,'' she said.
''When we did it to the police in Seattle, it showed we weren't
threatening and the officers seemed to relax.''
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Wright, another Ruckus organizer, said the protesters
have decided to converge on the Democratic National Convention
because they feel citizens have lost control of the U.S. political
system.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Democrats are the same as Republicans anymore, and the
presidential candidates are like Coke and Pepsi,'' Wright said.
''We're calling for a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruckus participants plan to stage blockades on downtown streets,
linking arms through large plastic pipes to form nearly
impenetrable human chains.
</P>
<P>
   They also intend to drape buildings with billboard-sized banners
emblazoned with messages aimed at convention delegates.

<HEADLINE> Activist Wants Nader on Mich Ballot  </HEADLINE>
By KATHY BARKS HOFFMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Craig Harvey is striking fear into the
hearts of Michigan Democrats by pushing to get the Green Party --
and its presidential candidate Ralph Nader -- onto Michigan's ballot
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, Harvey and other Green Party supporters plan to
turn in more than 50,000 petition signatures. At least 30,272
signatures must be valid for the party to qualify for the November
ballot and Thursday is the last day to hand in petitions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ones that sign ... are just so happy to have a viable
alternative'' to Bush and Gore, Harvey said. ''We get everything
from being cursed out to getting hugs for what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   With a recent statewide poll showing Nader taking away votes
from Vice President Al Gore, Democrats have reason to worry about
the feisty consumer advocate being on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent poll, done by EPIC/MRA of Lansing earlier this
month, put Gore at 40 percent and Texas Gov. George W. Bush at 45
percent. But in a hypothetical four-way race with Nader and likely
Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan, Gore got only 34 percent to
Bush's 46 percent, while Nader got 8 percent and Buchanan got 3
percent. The margin of error was 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Nader has been helped in Michigan by the United Auto Workers and
Teamsters unions' decisions to hold off endorsing Gore after he
supported granting permanent normal trade relations with China.
Teamsters leaders have met with Nader, while UAW head Steven Yokich
has mentioned him as a possible alternative to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan voters have a habit of backing anti-establishment
candidates -- Jesse Jackson won the 1988 Democratic caucuses, and
Sen. John McCain defeated Bush in February's GOP presidential
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomfield Township Sen. Gary Peters said there are plenty of
reasons to worry that Nader will cost Gore votes -- and possibly the
election. ''We will probably see a very close race for president,
so any third-party candidate out there could mean the difference,''
said Peters, a member of the Michigan Democratic Party's executive
board.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey, who voted for Nader in 1996 as a write-in candidate,
isn't feeling much sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   ''If someone is worried about Bush getting elected, then they
should look at who's stronger against him. And if it's Gore against
Bush or Nader against Bush, Nader is the stronger candidate,'' said
Harvey, a 45-year-old resident of Pittsfield Township near Ann
Arbor.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey has leaned toward Democratic candidates in the past but
went for Ross Perot in 1992, a year when 19 percent of Michigan
voters supported the Texas billionaire and his United We Stand
America party. By 1996, Nader had Harvey's attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nader has been saying the same basic things and working the
same basic issues for 35 years now, not changing his tone with
every poll that comes down,'' Harvey said. ''I trust him.''
</P>
<P>
   He recognizes that in car-crazy Michigan -- home of General
Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and the Chrysler division of
DaimlerChrysler AG -- not everyone is going to embrace the man who
trashed the Corvair in his 1965 book, ''Unsafe at Any Speed: The
Designed-In Dangers of the American Automobile.''
</P>
<P>
   He expects Nader's call to renegotiate trade agreements, protect
the environment and force Congress to listen to citizens rather
than corporations is going to appeal to Michigan voters.
</P>
<P>
   Nader is on the ballot in 19 states so far but hopes to be on
the ballot in 45 by November.
</P>
<P>
   During a town hall meeting Thursday in Saginaw, Gore avoided
mentioning Nader by name, even though one woman told him she was
considering voting for the Green Party candidate because ''the
Clinton-Gore administration gave an awful lot of ground back to the
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollster Ed Sarpolus of EPIC/MRA said many of those now in
Nader's corner probably will vote for Gore when the election comes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once labor wakes up from its stupor and realizes it has to get
back on track,'' Sarpolus said, ''many of those will come back to
Gore.''

<HEADLINE> Quake Jolts Afghanistan Residents  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -- An earthquake with a preliminary
magnitude of 6.2 jolted residents in this capital Tuesday morning,
sending them fleeing from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The quake, centered in the central Afghan Hindu Kush mountain
range barely 60 miles north of the capital, caused windows to
rattle and furniture to tremble, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.
</P>
<P>
   People grabbed their children and ran into the streets of Kabul,
said witnesses waiting for the rumbling to subside.
</P>
<P>
   The quake was felt as far away as Islamabad, the federal capital
of neighboring Pakistan, some 240 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   A powerful earthquake in 1998 killed more than 5,000 people and
left tens of thousands of people homeless in northern Afghanistan.

<P>
   QUETTA, Pakistan (AP) -- Rockets hit the center of the
Baluchistan provincial capital of Quetta early Tuesday in an attack
that police blamed on disgruntled tribesmen.
</P>
<P>
   There were no injuries and damage was slight, police said.
</P>
<P>
   While no one took responsibility, police say it may have been a
retaliatory assault by members of the Mari tribe.
</P>
<P>
   One of the tribe leaders was arrested earlier in connection with
the killing of a judge. Since then, tribesmen have made several
attacks on government buildings in the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the attacks have been attempts to harass rather than
cause any serious damage or injury.
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern Baluchistan province is a sparsely populated region
that neighbors Afghanistan. A deeply conservative region it is
largely inhabited by tribesmen, who often clash.

<HEADLINE> Gore Boosts Victims' Rights in Tenn  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Criticized for halfhearted support of a
victims' rights resolution in the Senate, Al Gore is wrapping the
proposed Constitutional amendment into his presidential campaign --
first with a TV ad and, now, with a campaign appearance at the side
of crime victims.
</P>
<P>
   At Rhodes College in his home state, the vice president was
expected Tuesday to echo his exhortation in the Democratic National
Committee's most recent ad: ''Accused criminals have all kinds of
rights. But the victims of crimes do not have rights that are
always protected and guaranteed.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, promising to ''lead the fight to pass a Victims' Rights
Amendment'' to the U.S. Constitution, said crime victims should be
notified if a prisoner is released -- or escapes -- from jail and
should have the right to speak to a jury at trial.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, aides said, victims would also be granted
the right to consult on trial preparation and to be heard on
sentencing and plea bargains.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic presidential candidate's proposed amendment
borrows heavily from the Senate resolution sponsored by Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif., and Jon Kyl, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl yanked that measure from debate in late April, after
negotiations with the White House failed to reach agreement on one
point: the administration's insistence that it give police,
prosecutors and judges the flexibility to limit victims' rights if
they threatened to jeopardize a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Kyl blamed the resolution's failure on the
Clinton-Gore administration's refusal to endorse it. Kyl planned --
at the behest of Republican presidential contender George W. Bush's
campaign -- a conference call to reporters on Tuesday to counter
Gore's effort to champion the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gore will champion his support for crime victims' rights, but
his administration just killed a bipartisan bill two months ago,''
said Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two states have enacted some form of victims' rights.
</P>
<P>
   The DNC ad, which pictures Gore with uniformed police officers,
began airing in 17 states six days ago. Under campaign finance
laws, the DNC, which uses unregulated ''soft money'' for the ads,
is not supposed to coordinate their production or placement with
Gore's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was back on the DNC fund-raising circuit Monday night, with
a $400,000 pair of receptions. At the more intimate
$25,000-per-person gathering, where guests were treated to a silver
notepad engraved with the vice presidential seal and Gore's
signature, Gore asked Democrats to rally for the fight against
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''The other side is arguing to put the old guard back in power
with their old ideas,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's father was president from 1989-1993, when he lost the
White House to Bill Clinton and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   At that same reception, Gore made a plea for racial harmony,
referring to ethnic conflicts overseas. He raised eyebrows among
his aides when he called the Bosnians ''Bosniacs.'' A spokeswoman,
aware of the ridicule Bush faced for calling Greeks ''Grecians,''
hastened to clarify for reporters that Bosniacs is a common and
acceptable term in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Iloilo Sworn In As Fiji President  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL ALEXANDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Fiji's new president, a frail and elderly
tribal chief, was sworn in Tuesday and urged reconciliation in the
ethnically divided nation that had been paralyzed by a two-month
hostage crisis. But Ratu Josefa Iloilo later named a Cabinet that
included no ethnic Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet does have at least two supporters of nationalist
coup leader George Speight, whose men stormed parliament on behalf
of indigenous Fijians. Still, Speight rejected the Cabinet and
predicted a return to unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will result in a backlash,'' he said. ''The fun is just
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   The only Indian involved in Iloilo's administration will be
George Shiu Raj, appointed one of two assistant ministers for
multiethnic affairs -- a non-Cabinet post. Iloilo said in a
statement that members of Fiji's ethnic Indian minority initially
accepted Cabinet posts but later withdrew ''due to concern for the
safety of their families.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement did not elaborate. But the presence of Speight
supporters and total absence of Indians is likely to prompt more
nations to follow New Zealand's lead and slap sanctions on Fiji to
press for a return to multiracial democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Iloilo took the oath of office in a stately official residence
overlooking the harbor of the capital, Suva.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are one, as one nation and one people,'' Iloilo told an
audience that included Speight, the country's former military head
of state Commodore Frank Bainimarama, and former Prime Minister
Sitiveni Rabuka.
</P>
<P>
   Iloilo, his left hand shaking from Parkinson's disease, said he
would be ''dedicated to promoting national unity and encouraging
moderation, inclusiveness, consideration and compassion of all in
our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Speight, who backed Iloilo's appointment, said: ''We are
pleased, it's a good day for the Fijian people.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase stayed in the post he was
appointed to just last week heading an unelected interim government
that has a mandate to guide Fiji to elections in about 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports Speight was unhappy with a scenario that
would include few of his men and allow Qarase, who was sworn in two
weeks ago by the military as interim prime minister, to keep his
job.
</P>
<P>
   Qarase's prospects rose Friday, however, after he released a
blueprint for Fiji's future that was branded as racist for
guaranteeing political superiority and affirmative action for
indigenous Fijians and promising redistribution of resources to
benefit them.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the stated goals of the May 19 coup that Speight led.
The last 18 of dozens of legislators taken hostage in Parliament
were freed last Thursday as part of a deal that Speight said would
disenfranchise ethnic Indians, who make up 44 percent of the
population.
</P>
<P>
   Speight has vowed a renewal of the civil disturbances that
wracked the country for 11 days until the hostage release if he
finds the Cabinet unacceptable. He is particularly interested in
ensuring that his backers dominate a commission that will write a
new constitution.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand did not wait even for the Cabinet lineup to be
announced, imposing sanctions Monday. The sanctions include
suspension of joint military exercises, reduced development aid and
ending student visits and sporting visas.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would find ethnic Indians acceptable in the Cabinet,
Speight replied, ''Not at the moment, not if I can help it.''
</P>
<P>
   He described deposed Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry's declared
intention to return to office as ''misguided.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Chaudhry being beaten up while being held by Speight
and a gang of gunmen for two months in Fiji's Parliament, Speight
said, ''He's OK, he was roughed up once and beaten once. He's lucky
he's alive.''

<HEADLINE> Marriage-Penalty Bill Nears Passage  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are on the brink of sending
President Clinton a centerpiece of their election-year tax relief
agenda, a bill cutting income taxes $248 billion over 10 years for
millions of married couples.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate was expected to pass the ''marriage penalty'' bill
Tuesday, sending it to the House, where swift approval also was
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are aiming to send the legislation to Clinton before
the GOP's national political convention begins July 31 in
Philadelphia in hopes of drawing public attention to their
differences with Democrats on tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will see who supports marriage tax relief, and we will see
who thinks American families are not entitled to this relief,''
said Sen. William Roth, R-Del., the Senate Finance Committee
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he could sign the measure into law only under
one condition: That Congress also send him an acceptable bill
creating a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare program. White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart accused Republicans of playing
politics by passing the tax-cut bill alone to force a veto.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can make political points, pass bills so they can talk
about them at their convention, or we can get marriage penalty
relief and prescription drugs for seniors,'' Lockhart said. ''It's
up to them: politics or substance?''
</P>
<P>
   Elimination of the marriage penalty was the centerpiece of the
$792 billion Republican tax cut that Clinton vetoed last year.
Republicans have spent this year passing bite-sized pieces of that
larger tax cut using the huge anticipated budget surplus, hoping to
frame clearer election-year distinctions between themselves and
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   A Treasury Department analysis of seven GOP tax measures that
have passed the House Ways and Means Committee this year said that
together, 76 percent of the cuts would go to the 23 million
wealthiest families. The remaining 91 million families would get
just over 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told reporters the
administration prefers tax cuts targeted at low- and middle-income
taxpayers instead of ''large tax cuts that are heavily backloaded
and primarily benefit the highest-income Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The marriage penalty bill gradually would enlarge both the 15
percent and 28 percent tax brackets so they apply to a greater
share of a married couple's income. Today, two single people enjoy
wider tax brackets than a comparable married couple, resulting in
an average tax bill $1,400 higher for 25 million couples.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not just tax relief, it's a tax correction,'' said
Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also would boost a married couple's standard
deduction in 2001 so that it equals that of two single people -- in
2000 dollars, an increase from $7,350 to $8,800. It would increase
the income cap for low-income couples who claim the earned-income
tax credit and ensure that the alternative minimum tax is not
triggered when couples claim any of several personal credits.
</P>
<P>
   On a 50-46 vote Monday, the Senate defeated a Democratic
alternative costing $54 billion over 10 years that would have given
couples the choice of filing joint tax returns or as two singles,
whichever benefits them more, with benefits phasing out at incomes
between $100,000 and $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say the Republican bill would cut taxes of millions of
married couples who don't now pay penalties, usually those in which
one spouse earns most of the family income, and would give
unnecessarily large tax cuts to upper-income people.
</P>
<P>
   ''This isn't a marriage-penalty bill. It's a tax cut disguised
as a marriage-penalty bill,'' said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans planned action on two other tax bills this week:
</P>
<P>
   --The House is expected to pass legislation gradually raising
contribution limits for individual retirement accounts from $2,000
to $5,000 annually and for 401(k)s from $10,500 to $15,000. Total
cost: About $17 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   --The House Ways and Means Committee will consider a bill to
repeal a 1993 tax increase in which income tax was imposed on 85
percent -- up from 50 percent -- of Social Security benefits of
recipients earning over $34,000 for individuals, $44,000 for
married couples. That bill would cost an estimated $44.6 billion
over five years.
--------
</P>
<P>
   The marriage penalty bill is H.R. 4810.

<HEADLINE> Mexicans Fed Up With Ruling Party  </HEADLINE>
By LISA J. ADAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANENECUILCO, Mexico (AP) -- In rural communities like this -- the
birthplace of Mexico's greatest revolutionary hero, Emiliano Zapata
-- the country's ruling party thought it had an unshakable bastion
of support.
</P>
<P>
   But people here say they've been fed up with the party for years
-- and on July 2, their votes helped elect Mexico's first opposition
president in 71 years. Now, they say the victory of Vicente Fox has
given them a sliver of hope.
</P>
<P>
   For one, many people here believe Fox will help them improve
their lives. For another, they know the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, will have to redouble its efforts in
the countryside if it wants to win them back.
</P>
<P>
   ''They will have to make a much bigger effort to help the
people,'' said Zapata's great-granddaughter, 32-year-old Herlinda
Zapata. ''Because if they don't, people know that the next time,
they can support someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Rufino Castillo Rodriguez, a 53-year-old farmer and school
teacher unloading bunches of dried onion leaves off the back of a
truck, said support for the party used to be strong here, but now,
''people are tired of seeing the same authorities working just to
enrich themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Now they've woken up and are reacting in a different way in
the hopes of improving their situation.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how tight the race -- and the PRI looked at Fox as one
of its greatest threats ever -- party members never expected to fare
so badly in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   On election day, after receiving early exit polls showing he'd
lost, PRI presidential candidate Francisco Labastida reportedly
held out, saying ''Let's wait for the rural vote.'' That
overwhelming victory never came. Labastida won the countryside by
only 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   Zapata's home state of Morelos was the first of the southern
states -- the PRI's strongest base of support -- to elect a governor
who wasn't with the PRI. Upcoming gubernatorial elections in the
southern states of Chiapas and Tabasco will be yet another test of
the PRI's endurance.
</P>
<P>
   Anenecuilco is one of several small communities of Ayala, a
Morelos municipality of 70,000 people ringed by farmland and
rolling hills 65 miles south of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Images of the mustachioed, sombrero-wearing Zapata appear
everywhere here: A bronze statue in his likeness keeps watch over
the town square. He rides to victory on a painted mural outside the
tourist site that guards the ruins of his humble stone home. His
name is used to identify everything from beauty salons to
stationery stores.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI has long portrayed itself as a champion of Zapata's
fight for the poor, but Angel Mina, curator of the Zapata house for
18 years, scoffs at such an idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Zapata was alive, he would not back the PRI. Zapata was
honest, a clean man. We have seen that the PRI is a big rat,'' he
said, using the Mexican slang word for thief. ''It is a party that
no longer works for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Castillo said even the PRI's ability to hold onto the Ayala
mayor's seat this year was just a fluke. And Jose Guadalupe Vega, a
66-year-old farmer playing dominoes in the main square of the Ayala
village of Tenextepango, said as far he's concerned, ''the PRI is
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala's new mayor, Miguel Octavio, admits that the party must
work hard to maintain its local support in the face of state and
nationwide election losses.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the declarations of national party leaders scrambling to
reorganize and redefine the ''New PRI,'' Octavio says his
administration's most important goal is ''to work more closely and
intimately with the community, together with the people ... with
the spirit of service.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, the 41-year-old gynecologist and neophyte
politician, accompanied by a small cadre of campaign workers, made
a special visit to a poor neighborhood of Tenextepango on a recent
evening to thank farmers for their support and to reiterate a
pledge to complete a much-needed health clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to share the benefits of our hard work with the
whole community,'' Octavio told sun-bronzed farmers and their
families who sat in folding chairs or leaned against the walls of
the one-room cement building.
</P>
<P>
   The response of his audience, while enthusiastic, also reflected
the nascent skepticism of lifelong PRI voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people are interested in seeing a project like the health
center actually finished,'' said Isidro Ramirez. ''None of the
(PRI) presidents before would authorize it. ... We hope with you we
are closer to making it happen.''

<HEADLINE> Hearing Examines Distracted Drivers  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As long as there have been cars, there have
been drivers who pay more attention to their radios, friends,
grooming or eating than to steering.
</P>
<P>
   Add in newfangled distractions -- cellular phones, navigation
systems, TVs, on-board computers -- and the potential for dangerous
lapses of attention are even greater.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has been
studying the issue and planned a public hearing Tuesday to hear
what others think should be done. There is also an ongoing Internet
forum for those who couldn't make it to the Washington meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of things that have been with us for a long
time, and lately there have been some new things,'' said NHTSA
spokesman Rae Tyson. ''With technology emerging as fast as new
vehicle technology, it's very difficult for us to try to keep up.''
</P>
<P>
   Automakers say they are also concerned about putting drivers in
danger with new high-tech gadgets and welcome NHTSA's probe, as
long as the agency doesn't start regulating what they install in
new vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now with the roads becoming more congested and longer commutes
and people spending more time in their cars, people want to do more
as well,'' said Rob Strassburger, vice president of safety for the
Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. ''We are a customer driven
set of companies, but we also need to make sure that what we are
doing doesn't have the potential to distract.''
</P>
<P>
   The automakers and groups that provide the high-tech
instruments, such as the cellular phone industry, stress that they
are not to blame for accidents that may occur when drivers are
using new devices that are often meant to improve safety.
</P>
<P>
   ''It boils down to driver responsibility,'' said Lisa Ihde,
manager of wireless education programs for the Cellular
Telecommunications Industry Association. ''Your first response when
you are driving a car is to drive safely.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you are driving through a congested area, through a work
zone or in a parking area, you shouldn't be paying attention to the
kids in the back seat, the CD, the hamburger or the phone
ringing.''
</P>
<P>
   No state bans the use of wireless phones in automobiles, and
only California, Florida and Massachusetts have laws limiting cell
phone use in moving vehicles, according to the National Conference
of State Legislatures. Dozens of U.S. communities are considering
restrictions on cell phone use by drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Several countries have banned the use of cell phones while
driving. A 1997 study in the New England Journal of Medicine found
that talking on a phone while driving quadrupled the risk of an
accident and was almost as dangerous as being drunk behind the
wheel.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Network of Employers for Traffic Safety, which
has organized a campaign encouraging responsible use of new vehicle
technologies, distracted drivers cause at least 4,000 accidents a
day and perhaps as many as 8,000.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Dingus of the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, who
has been studying the distractions for 15 years, said his research
shows that tuning the radio has about the same accident rate as new
simple mapping systems.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we are willing to accept that level of risk, there is room
to add features to the car that would increase convenience, but you
have to be very, very careful when you do that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dingus said crashes will increase significantly if the systems
are not designed with maximum safety benefits in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's feasible, but it think we need more and better
information, we need more work, we need better designs, we need
systems that don't allow them to do all these things at once,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Teen Allegedly Fires Shot in School  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. MARTINEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   RENTON, Wash. (AP) -- A 13-year-old boy who students said had
talked about killing a teacher climbed onto a cafeteria table and
fired a shot into the ceiling at summer school Monday, prompting
other youngsters to scatter and run. No one was injured.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, who was dressed in black and had blond hair dyed blue
at the ends, fled and was still at large late Monday. Authorities
in the Seattle suburb scaled back their search after focusing their
efforts on woods behind Dimmitt Middle School, where Tuesday
classes were canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's only so much area we can search,'' sheriff's spokesman
John Urquhart said. ''After that, you can't send people searching
Seattle willy-nilly. We'll wait for a hard lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Urquhart said the boy was still believed to be carrying a
handgun. The gun apparently belonged to the boy's grandmother,
KIRO-TV reported Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Urquhart said the boy got on a table and shot a round into the
ceiling. He ordered the other students to get on the stage in the
cafeteria, but they scattered and ran, Urquhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 200 students were in the school at the time. Sheriff's
deputies urged them to gather outside so they could be accounted
for.
</P>
<P>
   Cylas Sampson, 13, said he was sitting with a group of friends
in the cafeteria and had called the boy over to sit with them.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said, 'You don't have to worry about school anymore.
Today's your last day of school,''' Cylas said.
</P>
<P>
   Brittany Lamb, 14, was sitting at same table as the boy when he
stood up and fired the shot. ''He put the gun right up to my face
and he said, 'I'm going to kill you if you don't get up on the
stage.' I was frozen. I could not move at all,'' Brittany said.
</P>
<P>
   A teacher shouted to the boy that police were coming and the boy
swore and ran, Brittany said.
</P>
<P>
   Cylas and other students said the boy frequently talked about
wanting to kill a particular teacher. ''He wanted to kill all the
teachers, but he only wanted to kill a few students,'' Cylas said.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Carpenter, 10, said he was sitting in the cafeteria,
playing with friends when he heard the gunshot.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just ran. I thought I was going to die. I didn't know what
was going on,'' the fifth-grader said.
</P>
<P>
   School spokesman Peter Daniels said authorities had received no
previous warnings about the boy. ''Generally, the kids have been
really good about helping us to identify problems,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Praises Sierra Leone Rescue  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- After the humiliating capture of 500
peacekeepers 2&AMP;frac12; months ago, the Security Council finally had a U.N.
military operation to praise lavishly -- the rescue of 233 U.N.
soldiers trapped by rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement adopted unanimously Monday, the 15-member council
called the Indian-led U.N. rescue operation ''an example of the
very best in United Nations multilateral peacekeeping.'' And
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said the ''remarkable discipline and
determination'' displayed by the U.N. rescue force brought credit
to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   But council members and Annan stressed that there is still much
to be done to bring peace to Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   With all peacekeepers now free, Britain's U.N. Ambassador Jeremy
Greenstock said the force should turn its attention to helping the
Sierra Leone government extend its authority in the country
''without this millstone around their neck caused by the rebels.''
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council initially sent 6,000 peacekeepers to Sierra
Leone to help implement a July 1999 cease-fire signed by the
government and rebels who terrorized the country for eight years,
killing tens of thousands of civilians and mutilating thousands
more. In February, the council increased the force to 11,100.
</P>
<P>
   But the peace accord was shaky. And when rebels from Foday
Sankoh's Revolutionary United Front reignited the civil war in May,
they embarrassed the United Nations by capturing 500 peacekeepers,
who turned out to be poorly trained and equipped.
</P>
<P>
   Those hostages were disarmed, then released after several weeks.
But 222 Indian peacekeepers and 11 military observers of various
nationalities remained besieged in a U.N. base inside the eastern
rebel stronghold of Kailahun in eastern Sierra Leone -- and
exhaustive diplomatic and political efforts to free them failed.
The RUF's recent decision to impede the delivery of supplies to the
besieged troops was the final straw.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. rescue operation was launched early Saturday when a team
of Ghanaian, Indian and Nigerian troops supported by British and
Indian helicopter gunships helped 233 peacekeepers and observers
break out of Kailahun amid RUF fire.
</P>
<P>
   An Indian soldier who was injured when a rocket-propelled
grenade hit his truck, later died. Six other U.N. peacekeepers were
injured, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it shows what the U.N. can do when it has good capable
troops and good leadership,'' U.S. Deputy Ambassador James
Cunningham said.
</P>
<P>
   Since June 1999, the United Nations has embarked on major
peacekeeping missions in Kosovo and East Timor as well as Sierra
Leone. The Security Council is currently considering beefing up the
Sierra Leone force to 13,000 and deploying military observers, and
possibly peacekeepers, to Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Greenstock said the United Nations is moving into
''new peacekeeping territory'' in Sierra Leone, and U.N. troops are
learning how to operate with more robust mandates to gain access to
rebel territory and to protect themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hasn't been easy,'' he said. ''This (rescue) has shown the
U.N. is learning how to change, and is getting the right support
for what it wants to do. But it has to build on that. ... There's a
massive amount still to do in Sierra Leone and we must go on
supporting them.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Shows Progress in the Polls  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore campaigned about the nation's
prosperity for the last month as the Democratic National Committee
flooded key states with millions of dollars in advertising. This
week, Gore got a hint the intensive effort may have helped, with
two new national polls showing the presidential race is even.
</P>
<P>
   A political analyst says a Gore recovery in the polls, if it
holds up, couldn't come at a better time.
</P>
<P>
   ''By the end of the conventions many people have locked in their
votes until the first debate, when they can ask themselves 'Have I
made the right decision?' said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the
Annenberg School For Communication at the University of
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Two polls released Monday suggested that Gore has closed the gap
with Texas Gov. George W. Bush after trailing in the majority of
polls taken over the past couple of months. A CNN-USA Today-Gallup
poll had Bush at 48 percent, Gore at 46 percent among likely
voters. A four-way matchup also showed the race very close. Earlier
this month, Bush led Gore 50 percent to 41 percent in that poll,
but Gore has moved ahead among women voters and pulled even among
independents.
</P>
<P>
   A CBS News poll showed the race equally close among registered
voters, 43 percent for Bush and 41 percent for Gore. In May, Bush
was at 47 percent and Gore at 39 percent. Both polls of about 600
were taken over the weekend and had error margins of 4 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   The two latest polls were not a cause of great concern for Bush
spokesman Ari Fleischer, who said the average of recent public
polls still has the Republican up by 6 points, where he's been
since spring. ''That's why we look at the trend and it remains
solid.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was in a joking mood Monday as he toured his new
headquarters in Nashville and his aides were upbeat about the
polls, after three months of explaining that negative polls don't
matter because voters are not yet paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Gore adviser Tad Devine said the public polls are
starting to reflect what the Gore campaign's polls have been
showing recently.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think some of these other (public) polls, which are
credible, are beginning to catch up and show this is a close
race,'' Devine said from his Nashville office. ''I think we have a
race that has been tight and which will likely be tight for a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   The polls are likely to continue their fluctuation heading into
the convention season, said Frank Newport, executive editor of the
Gallup poll.
</P>
<P>
   ''As we move into the weeks and months ahead, with the vice
presidential announcements and conventions, we would anticipate
some continued significant movement,'' Newport said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was campaigning in Arkansas, part of a campaign swing
through a handful of Democratic leaning states in the days leading
up to the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's poll numbers are unimpressive in several states that are
critical to Democratic presidential candidates, giving Bush hope
that he can rebuild the political coalition that his father rode to
the White House in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Arkansas, the GOP candidate plans to travel by
plane and bus to Missouri, Kentucky, Ohio and West Virginia en
route to the July 31-Aug. 3 convention in Philadelphia. Clinton won
each of those five states in 1992 and 1996. Former President Bush
won all but West Virginia in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Polls in those five states show Gore behind Bush or in a dead
heat as the Texas governor holds an advantage in the state-by-state
race for 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The progress by Gore in national polls has shown up in several
surveys, including the Annenberg analysis of how campaign
advertising can affect a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   She said the poll progress have been the greatest in states
where the Democrats dramatically outspent Republicans on
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The DNC launched a 17-state advertising effort in early June
designed to revive Gore's lagging campaign. Democrats already had
spent more than $14 million by mid July to reach deep into the
media markets of swing states while protecting traditionally
Democratic states.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee made a gamble, spent money
early to solidify its base in key states, Jamieson said, adding:
''That gamble appears to have paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's emphasis on prosperity during the Clinton-Gore
administration and his plans for continuing it have helped, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has been maintaining a positive vision of the Gore
alternative,'' she said, ''rather than conducting a sustained
attack on Bush.''

<HEADLINE> Jeb Bush Kicks Off Brazilian Visit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Florida Gov. Jeb Bush kicked off a
three-day visit here in the company of 200 executives hoping to
foster greater business opportunities between their state and South
America's largest country.
</P>
<P>
   ''These missions give a chance for a lot of businesses -- many of
whom are small businesses -- to get acquainted. And if you come in
the scale we've come in, the results are likely to be impressive,''
Bush said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said trade between Brazil and Florida totaled around $8
billion in 1999, with the bulk of that being Brazilian imports from
Florida. On the other hand, Brazilian companies with operations in
Florida provide jobs for about 10,000 Floridians, Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush started Monday with a luncheon sponsored by Cutrale Citrus
Juices USA, the affiliate of a Brazilian firm building orange
groves on 15,000 acres in Florida. Brazilian citrus growers have
long complained about U.S. tariffs on their oranges and orange
juice.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also was scheduled to address the American Chamber of
Commerce in Sao Paulo and meet with President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso in Brasilia before heading home Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Tough Questions at Mideast Summit  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- There's a reason they're called ''core
issues'' -- they go straight to the heart of the conflict that has
raged between Israel and the Palestinians for more than half a
century.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees. Borders. Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The parties came to the Camp David talks hoping to produce a
sweeping Middle East agreement, but they may wind up settling for
partial solutions.
</P>
<P>
   So explosive are the so-called core issues that in seven years
of peacemaking, the two sides repeatedly put off talks about them.
Now, with President Clinton declaring he wants an agreement by
Wednesday, they find themselves with only a matter of hours to edge
toward tentative compromise.
</P>
<P>
   In the secluded presidential retreat, negotiators and the
leaders themselves have argued and discussed and debated late into
the rainy summer nights.
</P>
<P>
   While only they know what has been said in private, here is a
look at some possible dealmaking that, while not comprehensive
solutions, could emerge in response to the toughest questions.
------
</P>
<P>
Borders of a Palestinian State
</P>
<P>
   The struggle for land is as old as the West Bank's stony hills,
a battle that persists to this day.
</P>
<P>
   Seized by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War along with the Gaza
Strip and East Jerusalem, the West Bank -- only the size of Delaware
-- is regarded by many Jewish settlers as their biblical birthright.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians already control the West Bank's major cities
and have partial autonomy in Gaza. But they fear the Israelis will
try to hand them an archipelago state, a patchwork of territory
crisscrossed by Israeli-controlled roads and Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 200,000 Jewish settlers have made homes for themselves in
the West Bank and Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has said
up to one-quarter of those may be left outside the umbrella of
Israeli sovereignty in any peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Palestinians headed into the negotiations demanding
all the West Bank and Gaza, they have quietly suggested they are
willing to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Days before the Camp David talks began, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat's senior economic adviser, Mohammed Rashid,
essentially gave his blessing to a land swap that would leave large
settlement blocs under Israeli sovereignty in exchange for
unpopulated land elsewhere in Israel proper.
------
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Refugees
</P>
<P>
   In the chaos of Israel's war of independence, and again 19 years
later in the Six-Day War, they fled or were driven from their
homes. They long for them still.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as well as Jordan, Lebanon and
Syria, several million Palestinian refugees and their descendants
live in crowded cement-block camps, administered by the United
Nations, that were supposed to have provided only temporary refuge.
</P>
<P>
   For as long as the Palestinians have been fighting for a
homeland, one of their sacred tenets has been the ''right of
return'' -- the refugees' claim on homes in Israel proper, some in
towns and villages that no longer exist.
</P>
<P>
   Israel flatly refuses to accept all the refugees, saying they
would overwhelm a country of only 6 million and undermine its
character as a Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   However, Barak is said to be considering Israel's recognition of
a U.N. resolution on Palestinians' right of return, but only in
principle and not in practice. Under this scenario, Israel would
not accept moral responsibility for causing the refugees' plight.
</P>
<P>
   The respected Haaretz newspaper, citing Israeli sources,
reported an idea under which Israel would absorb several thousand
refugees to be reunited with immediate families. A future
Palestinian state would take in others, and a massive international
aid package would assist other refugees in their current places of
residence.
------
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem
</P>
<P>
   Sacred to three faiths, this ancient city is the scene of a
modern-day holy war. Conflicting claims resonate through Jerusalem,
from the cobblestone streets of the Old City to the Arab souks
(marketplaces) and the modern buildings of the Jewish western
sector.
</P>
<P>
   Israel wants to keep Jerusalem exclusively under Israeli
sovereignty, keeping the status quo of freedom of access to holy
sites. The Palestinians seek to divide the city into two capitals,
theirs in the east and the Israelis' in the west.
</P>
<P>
   Some alternatives put forward in the past include the so-called
Beilin-Abbas plan, informally negotiated five years ago and named
for its architects: Yossi Beilin, now Israel's justice minister,
and Mahmoud Abbas, a top aide to Arafat. This would expand the
borders of the city to include West Bank suburbs, where the
Palestinians would base their capital.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea is the so-called boroughs approach. This would
allow the Palestinians partial administrative control in Arab
neighborhoods, including health, education and utilities. In the
sensitive Old City, some holy sites would be managed by the
Palestinians, while overall sovereignty would be retained by
Israel.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Steps Up Mideast Talks  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- The Camp David summit was entering a
make-or-break day Tuesday, with President Clinton saying through a
spokesman he hopes the parties will have ''wrapped up their
business'' by the time he is to leave to Japan the following
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's chief spokesman Joe Lockhart said Monday the president
intended to keep to his scheduled departure, but nonetheless
suggested that the hours leading up to it could be a cliffhanger.
</P>
<P>
   ''You'll know that we're following through on the schedule when
you see the president walk to the top of the steps (of the plane)
and wave and the door close,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Another White House spokesman amplified that later. ''The
schedule won't change until it changes,'' P.J. Crowley said late
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the leaders, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, had a clear view of the time
constraints at the week-old summit in the mountains of western
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that the parties understand the schedule here,'' he
said. ''They understand that they're working toward that.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Clinton met with Barak, then Arafat, then Barak
again. No formal dinner with the delegations was scheduled, unlike
the first five evenings of the summit.
</P>
<P>
   With the clock ticking down on the talks, Lockhart said, ''I
think the pace and intensity have both quickened.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators in two parallel sets of talks -- the primary ones at
the Camp David presidential retreat, addressing so-called core
issues, and lower-level secondary discussions in nearby Emmitsburg,
Md. -- have both been keeping long hours, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has shuttled back and forth between the two leaders
during the week of talks, bringing them together twice for
three-way meetings, in addition to informal encounters at meals.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials said they knew the negotiations had reached a
critical juncture.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is clear we are at a very historic and delicate moment,''
Cabinet Secretary Yitzhak Herzog told Associated Press Television
News. ''I guess we will know in the next 48 hours whether there is
a breakthrough, and whether we can reach an agreement or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared to be using the three-day summit of industrial
powers in Japan as a means to prod the two sides toward compromises
aimed at resolving their bitter half-century-old dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The main issues on the table are the borders of a future
Palestinian state, the fate of several million Palestinian refugees
and the status of Jerusalem, which both sides claim as their
capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''The negotiations are very difficult and our position is
clear,'' said Hassan Abdel Rahman, the Washington envoy of Arafat's
Palestine Liberation Organization. On the key matters, he said,
''We cannot make concessions.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart, though, said no one was ready to throw in the towel.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we would be here if there wasn't a chance to get
this done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the White House spokesman was asked, half in jest,
whether Clinton might take Barak and Arafat with him to Japan so
they could continue their negotiations in flight.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thirteen and a half hours on a plane? I don't think so,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is due to met in Tokyo on Thursday with Japanese Prime
Minister Yoshiro Mori and other leaders before their Friday-Sunday
summit on Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   Both Barak and Arafat face political problems at home if they
arrive at a compromise -- or if they fail to.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's governing coalition collapsed on the eve of his
departure for the summit, and he is likely to face early elections.
Hard-liners have been staging demonstrations urging him not to make
broad territorial concessions to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's aides said heading into the talks that it was not the
right time for a summit, because gaps between the two sides needed
to be narrowed first. But once he was here, top aides including
Nabil Amr, the parliamentary affairs minister, said he wanted to
try to make a deal. Palestinians have been frustrated by the slow
pace of peacemaking since Barak's election in May 1999, and that
anger has sometimes erupted into deadly street clashes in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. hosts have sought to keep a veil of secrecy over the
substance of summit talks. Clinton himself broke the silence to say
in an interview with the New York Daily News published Monday that
the talks were ''so hard'' that he did not know whether an accord
could be reached.

<HEADLINE> Former Starr Aide on Trial  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prosecutors are trying to portray Charles
Bakaly III, former spokesman for Kenneth Starr, as an official who
leaked information to ''send a message'' that the investigation of
President Clinton would not end with his impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly, who resumes testimony today, took the stand Monday in
his contempt of court trial. He is accused of misleading a federal
judge by denying in a court statement that he leaked information to
a New York Times reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly contended during direct examination he never misled the
court about his cooperation with the Times, and even tried to edit
a court document submitted on behalf of Starr, the former
independent counsel, in order to fully explain his role.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly said the personal account he submitted of his meetings
with Times reporter, Don Van Natta Jr., was accurate when presented
to a judge in February 1999. But he testified that lawyers for
Starr omitted some of his proposed changes from an accompanying
court filing on the leaked material -- changes that would have shown
that he provided the reporter with public information.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson is conducting the
trial without a jury. Bakaly could get up to six months in prison
if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   In cross-examination, Justice Department prosecutor John
Griffith tried to show that Bakaly had motives to leak information.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of the trial is a Times story of Jan. 31, 1999, which
said that Starr -- who was investigating Monica Lewinsky's affair
with the president -- had decided that a sitting president could be
indicted. The article, written during Clinton's impeachment trial,
also said that a group of prosecutors in Starr's office concluded
the president should be indicted.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith portrayed the defendant as a willing participant in the
leaks, asking Bakaly whether he intended to ''send a message'' that
Starr's investigation would not end with the Senate impeachment
trial. Bakaly acknowledged that he wanted to convey to the public
that ''our office would stay in business'' -- but contended he never
provided any secret material.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith also questioned whether the Senate's decision against
calling live impeachment trial witnesses led to frustration by
Bakaly and played a role in his cooperation with the Times.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly, without acknowledging any connection to the article,
said that prosecutors would have liked live witnesses as a
''preview'' of Clinton's defense.
</P>
<P>
   In direct questioning from defense lawyer Michele Roberts, the
former spokesman said Starr's lawyers, in their filing, made it
appear he was denying providing any material to the Times when, in
fact, he gave the reporter public information.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly admitted he gave Van Natta a Watergate-era memo studied
by Starr's lawyers and a copy of Starr's congressional testimony on
the power to indict a sitting president.
</P>
<P>
   ''Was it true?'' defense lawyer Michele Roberts asked Bakaly
about his personal statement to the court in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes it was,'' Bakaly responded.
</P>
<P>
   ''Does it remain true today?''
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes it is.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Seeks a New Role  </HEADLINE>
By JOJI SAKURAI
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIYAZAKI, Japan (AP) -- As Asia's lone economic superpower and
biggest donor of development aid, Japan has grown accustomed to
having a key -- if not high-profile -- position in world affairs.
</P>
<P>
   As Japan prepares to welcome the leaders of the Group of Eight
leading industrialized countries and Russia for a July 21-23 summit
on Okinawa, Tokyo is maneuvering to bolster its image.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs its efforts are bearing fruit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Japan can't take the lead all at once, but it is making
efforts to shed its status as an outsider and become an insider,''
said political analyst Minoru Morita. ''Japan feels that the G-8
gathering is an initial step toward taking a more central role in
diplomatic affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the summit, the late Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi toured
Asian countries to hear their views, and reassured them that, as
Asia's sole representative in the elite G-8, he would take regional
concerns to the summit roundtable.
</P>
<P>
   Since his sudden death in April, the administration of his
successor, Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, has tried to keep that
promise.
</P>
<P>
   At this week's foreign ministers' conference, held in this
southern Japan city, Japan made sure regional issues got an
abundant hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic detente between North and South Korea was mentioned
in the joint communique ahead of other world hot spots such as
Yugoslavia and the Mideast.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono was instrumental in
convincing G-8 foreign ministers to spotlight the landmark
encounter between South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and the
North's Kim Jong Il.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the ball rolling, Kono flew to Seoul after the
conference here to consult with President Kim on the wording of a
special statement to be issued at the G-8 summit in support of
Korean reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Kono said after the foreign ministers' meeting that Western
powers are beginning to pay heed to Japan's views on regional
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the only foreign minister from Asia, I shared my views
about the Korean Peninsula and many of the ministers indicated a
strong interest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Backing for democratic reform in Indonesia and infrastructure
building in East Timor were also mentioned prominently in the joint
communique, which urged ''the full support of the international
community to further promote peace and stability in the entire
region.''
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo was able to push its agenda in other ways at the foreign
ministers' gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Its initiative to curb the small arms trade topped the list of
measures agreed upon to help prevent global conflicts. And despite
opposition from some G-8 countries, the foreign ministers endorsed
beefing up the U.N. security council in line with the wishes of
Japan, which has long been lobbying for a permanent seat.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomatic successes could signal a gradual coming of age
for Japan in its fitful efforts to become more than just a
financier greasing the wheels of world markets and giving handouts
to needy nations -- often with an eye to bolstering its own business
interests in those nations.
</P>
<P>
   But obstacles abound to Japan taking a wider Asian role.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is the suspicion Japan still evokes among neighbors
for its brutal invasion of Asia in the decades leading up to World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo's inability to offer an unambiguous apology for wartime
atrocities has created an uncomfortable imbalance between the close
economic rapport it enjoys with its neighbors and their often
frosty diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
   Any sign that Japan may try to expand its military clout by
revising its pacifist constitution or beefing up its defense
capabilities is also greeted by protests from China and other Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
   And Japan's current leadership has aggravated that problem.
</P>
<P>
   While Foreign Minister Yohei Kono is known as a political dove
with well-honed diplomatic skills, Mori, who will host the G-8
leaders summit, has made blunder after blunder with comments
evoking Japan's militaristic past.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no denying that Japan has made progress in
forging a new leadership role in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it became the first major industrialized nation to
conclude an agreement on terms for China's accession to the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The accord came amid acrimony with the United States over the
bombing of Beijing's embassy in Yugoslavia, and may have helped
defuse tensions between China and the West.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's plan in 1997 to create a
regional monetary fund to help economies battered by the Asian
currency crisis was quashed by Washington, but received widespread
support among countries burdened by the harsh conditions imposed by
the IMF.

<HEADLINE> Senate Battle Waging Over Parks  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Western senators are challenging Clinton
administration actions and rules that have expanded national
parklands and limited the recreational activities allowed on them.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate planned to vote Tuesday on a proposal by Senate
Majority Whip Don Nickles, R-Okla., that would block President
Clinton from creating any additional national monuments. With
several Republican senators from politically moderate Northeastern
states facing re-election in November, the language seemed likely
to be rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, many Westerners have opposed Clinton's use of a 1906
law to add nearly 2 million acres this year alone to the federal
lands protected as national monuments. The lands are nearly all in
Arizona, California, Colorado, Oregon and Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   Also expected was a vote on an effort by Sen. Craig Thomas,
R-Wyo., to block a National Park Service ban on snowmobiling in
nearly all national parks, monuments and recreation areas. The
administration has said the ban, issued last April, is aimed at
reducing noise and environmental damage in the parks. It has been
opposed by the recreation industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issue is access to lands that belong to the people of this
country,'' Thomas said during debate on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Both proposals were offered as amendments to a $15.5 billion
measure financing the Interior Department and federal cultural
programs in the coming fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved a $14.6 billion version of the bill last
month containing no language on snowmobiles or national monuments.
House opponents of Clinton's monument designations lost an effort
to virtually undo all the monuments he has named this year.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate versions of the bill both face an
administration veto threat because they provide less than Clinton
wants for parkland purchases, some programs for Indians, and the
National Endowment for the Arts.

<HEADLINE> White House Proposes Wiretap Law  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House is asking Congress to update
wiretapping rules so that legal protections that apply to telephone
calls are extended to e-mail and other electronic communication.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would require law enforcement officials to obtain
high-level approval before applying for a court order to intercept
the content of e-mail -- in line with current rules that govern
listening to phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically, the same communication, if sent different ways --
through a phone call or a dial-up modem -- is subject to different
and inconsistent privacy standards,'' White House Chief of Staff
John Podesta said Monday in announcing the proposals. ''It's time
to update and harmonize our existing laws to give all forms of
technology the same legislative protections as our telephone
conversations.''
</P>
<P>
   The wiretap proposal also addresses so-called ''trap and trace''
orders which allow law enforcement officials to identify the source
of a phone call or an e-mail, but not its content. Under the
proposal, law enforcement officials would only need one order --
even to trace an e-mail or a phone call that may travel through
multiple phone carriers or Internet providers.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also could trace such communications without prior
approval in an emergency situation, such as when a computer is
under attack.
</P>
<P>
   But for the first time, the administration is proposing that a
federal or state judge independently determine whether the facts
support such a trace order.
</P>
<P>
   Officials were asked how those changes would affect the new
''Carnivore'' system, which the FBI is using to obtain e-mails of
investigative subjects with a search warrant. When Carnivore is
placed at an Internet service provider, it scans all incoming and
outgoing e-mails for messages associated with the target of a
criminal probe.
</P>
<P>
   If the Carnivore system is being used to intercept the content
of electronic communications, then law enforcement officials would
need high-level Justice Department approval before obtaining a
court order and stricter standards limiting its use would apply,
Podesta said. Officials would need an independent judge to review
an order if the system is used for tracing, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI says the tool already is subject to intense oversight
from its own internal controls, the Justice Department and the
courts -- with signification penalties for misuse of the system.
</P>
<P>
   But the American Civil Liberties Union chided the
administration, saying the practical impact of the legislative
proposal on the Carnivore system is limited. It called for outright
suspension of the tool.
</P>
<P>
   ''Carnivore represents a grave threat to the privacy of all
Americans by giving law enforcement agencies unsupervised access to
a nearly unlimited amount of communications traffic,'' said Barry
Steinhardt, ACLU associate director.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed measures would also address inconsistencies in how
current law applies to different networks carrying Internet
traffic. For example, now that cable systems are being upgraded to
offer two-way services, laws that apply to dial-up modems over
phone lines should be extended to cable connections, Podesta said.
</P>
<P>
   Computer hacking laws would also be modified so that multiple
small attacks would be treated as one large attack, but mandatory
jail time would be eliminated for less serious offenses. Federal
prosecutors would have jurisdiction over juveniles in serious
computer attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The plan could be meshed with pending legislation in Congress.
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., has written a wide-ranging Internet
privacy bill and applauded the administration for its efforts ''to
focus attention on privacy from government snooping.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, Sen. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah, who has introduced another measure, said he would work with
the White House on a bill that would balance law enforcement
interests with privacy rights.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Dempsey of the Center for Democracy and Technology said the
administration's plan effectively combines both goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration also announced Monday updates to its
export control policy for powerful data and voice-scrambling
technology. American companies now can sell encryption products to
any end user -- government or nongovernment -- in the European Union
or these eight other trading partners: Australia, Norway, Czech
Republic, Hungary, Poland, Japan, New Zealand and Switzerland. The
policy change will also remove a previous technical review waiting
period of 30 days.

<HEADLINE> Gingrich Discusses Clinton Legacy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich says
President Clinton should not be indicted after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   ''No. We don't want to go down the path that destroyed the Roman
republic,'' Gingrich said in a taped interviewed broadcast Tuesday
on NBC's ''Today.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't imagine how it would help America to get in the habit
of indicting former politicians,'' the Georgia Republican said.
</P>
<P>
   Independent Counsel Robert Ray has said the investigation of
Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky affair is continuing and that a
judgment will be rendered ''when the president leaves office.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said of Clinton: ''He'll go down in history with the
record he has. I think it's a tragic record that could have been
far more brilliant because he's personally a much more brilliant
person that he was able to achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   The ex-speaker, who retired after Republicans lost much of their
House majority in the 1998 election, said the Senate was right to
acquit Clinton ''and the House was right to impeach him.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was clear that the country had reached the conclusion that
while it (Clinton's testimony in the Lewinsky case) was an offense
and they were offended, it was not legitimate to deprive him of the
office he had won in 1996.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Set To Cut Marriage Tax  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are on the brink of sending
President Clinton a centerpiece of the GOP election-year tax relief
agenda, a bill cutting income taxes $248 billion over 10 years for
millions of married couples.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate was expected to pass the ''marriage-penalty'' bill
Tuesday and send it to the House. But instead of simply passing
that version, GOP leaders will seek to change the bill so that it
provides more tax relief in 2001 instead of waiting until later
years, Republican aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are aiming to send the legislation to Clinton before
the GOP's national political convention begins July 31 in
Philadelphia in hopes of drawing public attention to their
differences with Democrats on tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will see who supports marriage-tax relief, and we will see
who thinks American families are not entitled to this relief,''
said Sen. William Roth, R-Del., the Senate Finance Committee
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he could sign the measure into law only under
one condition: that Congress also send him an acceptable bill
creating a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare program. White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart accused Republicans of playing
politics by passing the tax-cut bill alone to force a veto.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can make political points, pass bills so they can talk
about them at their convention, or we can get marriage penalty
relief and prescription drugs for seniors,'' Lockhart said. ''It's
up to them: politics or substance?''
</P>
<P>
   Elimination of the marriage penalty was the centerpiece of the
$792 billion Republican tax cut that Clinton vetoed last year.
Republicans have spent this year passing bite-sized pieces of that
larger tax cut using the huge anticipated budget surplus, hoping to
frame clearer election-year distinctions between themselves and
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   A Treasury Department analysis of seven GOP tax measures that
have passed the House Ways and Means Committee this year said that
together, 76 percent of the cuts would go to the 23 million
wealthiest families. The remaining 91 million families would get
just over 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told reporters the
administration prefers tax cuts targeted at low- and middle-income
taxpayers instead of ''large tax cuts that are heavily backloaded
and primarily benefit the highest-income Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The marriage-penalty bill gradually would enlarge both the 15
percent and 28 percent tax brackets so they apply to a greater
share of a married couple's income. Today, two single people enjoy
wider tax brackets than a comparable married couple, resulting in
an average tax bill $1,400 higher for 25 million couples.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not just tax relief, it's a tax correction,'' said
Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also would boost a married couple's standard
deduction in 2001 so that it equals that of two single people -- in
2000 dollars, an increase from $7,350 to $8,800. It would increase
the income cap for low-income couples who claim the earned-income
tax credit and ensure that the alternative minimum tax is not
triggered when couples claim any of several personal credits.
</P>
<P>
   On a 50-46 vote Monday, the Senate defeated a Democratic
alternative costing $54 billion over 10 years that would have given
couples the choice of filing joint tax returns or as two singles,
whichever benefits them more, with benefits phasing out at incomes
between $100,000 and $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say the Republican bill would cut taxes of millions of
married couples who don't now pay penalties, usually those in which
one spouse earns considerably more than the other, and would give
unnecessarily large tax cuts to upper-income people.
</P>
<P>
   ''This isn't a marriage-penalty bill. It's a tax cut disguised
as a marriage-penalty bill,'' said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans planned action on two other tax bills this week:
</P>
<P>
   --The House is expected to pass legislation gradually raising
contribution limits for individual retirement accounts from $2,000
to $5,000 annually and for 401(k)s from $10,500 to $15,000. Total
cost: About $17 billion over five years.
</P>

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks slumped at the open Tuesday despite some
strong profit reports by major companies and a generally
unsurprising inflation report.
</P>
<P>
   After the first 15 minutes of trading, the Dow Jones industrial
average was off 31.11 at 10,773.16.
</P>
<P>
   Among broader market indicators, the Nasdaq composite index was
down 49.86 at 4,224.81, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 was down 8.84 at
1,499.26, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was off
4.25 at 540.93.
</P>
<P>
   Before the open, the Labor Department reported that consumer
inflation jumped 0.6 percent in June, chiefly reflecting surging
gasoline prices and a record rise in the cost of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   Most other prices posted modest increases. June's performance,
close to the 0.5 percent rise in consumer prices many analysts were
expecting, was the largest increase since March.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates six times over
the past 13 months to slow economic growth and keep inflation in
check. Some economic reports have suggested that the Fed's rate
increases are working to slow economic growth. Given that, some
economists believe the central bank will leave rates unchanged at
its meeting on Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch and General Motors led the morning parade of
reports on second-quarter profits with better-than-expected
results. Among other leading companies, Honeywell and Phillip
Morris matched most Wall Street profit forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   On a more worrisome note, Aetna issued a waning that its
second-quarter results would come in well below analyst
expectations.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Coverdell in Serious Condition  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Sen. Paul Coverdell remained hospitalized in
serious condition Tuesday after undergoing surgery to relieve
pressure on his brain from a cerebral hemorrhage.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gary Gropper, the neurosurgeon who performed the two-hour
operation Monday at Piedmont Hospital, said the surgery was a
success, but it was unclear what lasting effects the Georgia
Republican would have.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think over the next 48 hours we'll have a better idea how
he's doing,'' Gropper said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a serious condition. Any time that you have a cerebral
hemorrhage and you require my services, it's serious,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gropper said doctors operated on a blood clot in one of
Coverdell's temporal lobes, a portion of the brain that controls
visual recognition, auditory perception, memory and emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, 61, was in the hospital's intensive care unit Tuesday
morning, nursing supervisor Kristy Bachman said. The hospital would
give no details.
</P>
<P>
   The senator, who had reported no serious health problems in the
past, was admitted Saturday night after complaining of severe
headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Tests revealed the hemorrhage and his condition worsened, making
the surgery necessary, said Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., a doctor who
is a friend of Coverdell's family.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to go into details of the diagnosis other than
that,'' said Frist, who appeared at a news conference with Gropper.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, who served as Peace Corps director in the Bush
administration, was first elected to the Senate in 1992 by
defeating incumbent Democrat Wyche Fowler Jr. He serves as the
Senate's GOP Conference secretary and sits on several committees,
including agriculture, finance and foreign relations.
</P>
<P>
   He has been the Senate liaison for Gov. George W. Bush's
presidential campaign. The candidate issued a statement saying he
and his wife ''join the people of Georgia in sending our love and
best wishes'' to the senator and his family.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Bars Cuba Confiscation Suit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has suspended for an
additional six months a law that would allow Americans whose
property was confiscated by Cuba to sue foreigners who use those
assets to do business, his spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The right to sue is contained in sanctions legislation approved
by Congress in 1996. But Clinton has the authority under the law to
waive or enforce the provision at six-month intervals.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has consistently exercised his waiver authority since
the legislation was approved.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said the action was taken in
the national interest and because it is the best way to secure the
act's objective of a ''transition to democracy in Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Clinton has cited as his reason for waiving the
provision an increase in international efforts to promote
democratic change in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart offered the same rationale on Tuesday, asserting that
the pro-democracy message from the international community ''has
been more emphatic than ever'' over the last six months.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both publicly and privately, key leaders pressed senior Cuban
officials on the need for improved respect for human rights and
increased democratic opening,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-General Faces Trial in Sri Lanka  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- A retired general has been charged in
the deaths and disappearances of thousands of leftists, the first
high-ranking military officer to face trial in the more than
decade-old murders.
</P>
<P>
   The trial against retired Maj. Gen. Ananda Weerasekera and two
of his subordinates will begin July 31, according to an order
issued Monday by Judge Sumudhu Premachandran in the central city of
Anuradhapura.
</P>
<P>
   The men are charged with murder, abduction and unlawful
detention in connection with the disappearances of members of the
People's Freedom Front.
</P>
<P>
   The Marxist group, known as JVP, has been blamed for killing
hundreds of political opponents and government officials during a
1987-89 attempt to topple the government and seize power.
</P>
<P>
   In retaliation, human rights groups say, death squads abducted
suspected JVP supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Unmarked mass graves still turn up in the mountains and forests
of this Indian Ocean island.
</P>
<P>
   Weerasekera was the commander of an army camp in Anuradhapura
when JVP members disappeared from the area. A state appointed
commission found Weerasekera and his subordinates responsible for
the disappearances and deaths of JVP members, prompting authorities
to order a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the general nor his attorneys were available for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The JVP, which has rejoined mainstream politics, says 60,000 of
its members and supporters were killed during the uprising and
10,000 during a previous revolt in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Formed in 1965, the JVP was banned twice after 1971. The
government lifted the ban in the early 1990s and the party
estimates it now has 50,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   The JVP won 10 percent of the votes in provincial elections this
year.

<HEADLINE> TV Can Be a Crystal Ball  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- By one measure, the end of the world was
foretold a year ago with the shearing of Keri Russell's mane.
</P>
<P>
   While the fleecing of Felicity certainly didn't do the show's
ratings any good (by January, viewership had dropped by more than
15 percent), the impact was felt far beyond one TV series. Hair
grows back. But would anything else ever be right again?
</P>
<P>
   Doubtful, if you consider all the signs since then of an
apocalypse just around the corner. They are there to see on any
television screen:
</P>
<P>
   -- the human consumption of rats. In prime time!
</P>
<P>
   -- Dennis Miller as an announcer for ''Monday Night Football.''
</P>
<P>
   -- the Battle of Armageddon (well, kind of) waged last May
between media titans Walt Disney Co. and Time Warner, plunging ABC
into 39 hours of darkness for more than 3 million cable
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   -- and don't forget the people eating rats!
</P>
<P>
   These are clearly aberrant events, proving the end is surely in
sight. And for those who choose to look, here are more
transfigurations:
</P>
<P>
   -- Cable's USA losing its punch.
</P>
<P>
   For years, ratings leader USA had it all: off-network reruns,
cheesy woman-in-peril TV movies and second-rate original series.
But what really put USA over the top was its ''sports
entertainment'' from World Wrestling Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Now the end is in sight for USA's top-rated shows like ''WWF
Sunday Night Heat'' and ''Raw Is War.'' Last month, a court
decision gave WWF the right to take its pugilistic fare to Viacom's
TNN and MTV cable networks.
</P>
<P>
   Without The Rock, what will USA build on?
</P>
<P>
   -- No more Kathie Lee Gifford to kick around. She's exiting the
talk show she has shared with Regis Philbin for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   As you know, her ''Live!'' reign has been a fairy tale. A
melodrama. A righteous crusade. A marketing blitz. (Hmmm. That's
also a fair description of WWF wrestling.) But now -- well, who can
fathom the void she will leave by Reege's side?
</P>
<P>
   Her last ''Live!'' is July 28. Plan to take the day off. Be with
your loved ones. And hope for the best. Kathie Lee's departure from
her TV state-of-being could hurl the natural order further out of
control than Regis in mid-rant.
</P>
<P>
   -- Mourning becomes ''The Early Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad enough that host Bryant Gumbel was recently caught on camera
making what appeared to be a profane slur about a guest he had just
interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   But worse than that, the loose-lipped Gumbel shares the camera
with newsreader Julie Chen, around whom (as Inside.com put it last
week) ''the thin membrane of journalistic legitimacy ... has
officially dissolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen, of course, has expanded her ''informational'' duties
beyond the CBS News-produced ''Early Show'' to serve as host,
interrogator and carnival barker for the network's
entertainment-reality series ''Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   For CBS' purposes, Chen is a journalist second, and, first of
all, a TV personality much in need of a prime-time boost for
herself and her little-watched morning program.
</P>
<P>
   The need to wake up the world to ''The Early Show'' was
demonstrated on last Thursday's ''Big Brother'' when the 10
houseguests were overheard discussing Chen:
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never seen her before.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Neither have I.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What does she do?''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe a newswoman peddling ginned-up news isn't really the end
of the world. But does she have to tempt fate by appearing to like
it?
</P>
<P>
   -- The fallen season.
</P>
<P>
   You may uncover many secrets in the networks' new fall series.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Fox will introduce ''Dark Angel,'' a science
fiction series set in post-apocalyptic America that follows a
genetically enhanced human prototype who is chased by her military
handlers.
</P>
<P>
   You may find even more vivid revelations in the new ABC sitcom
''The Trouble With Normal.'' First announced as ''People Who Fear
People,'' then retitled (eureka! Let it travel under an assumed
name; that will fool everyone), it mines the bottomless pit of
comedy about paranoid schizophrenics.	   ''I ripped my phone out of the wall,''
says one man in group
therapy, ''because I thought it was listening to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Pretty telling. But now listen to this: A publicity campaign for
the ABC sitcom ''The Norm Show'' calls for equipping public urinals
with the voice of series star Norm Macdonald.
</P>
<P>
   Forcible exposure to Norm's wisecracks while you try to relieve
yourself? Even for viewers who tune out the apocalypse, this is a
doomsday scenario.

<HEADLINE> House Votes For W-2 Form Disclosure  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A worker's annual W-2 tax form would have to
also include how much the employer pays in Social Security and
Medicare taxes under legislation that passed the House Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the measure, which passed by voice vote and now
goes to the Senate, contended that employees don't realize how much
employers pay for Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Employees and employers split the 12.4 percent Social Security
tax and the 2.9 percent Medicare tax, but only the employee share
shows up on the W-2 form.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, said sponsor Rep. Peter Hoekstra, R-Mich., ''helps
workers understand the constraints employers face when seeking to
create jobs, increase pay and compete effectively in a global
economy, and shatters the myth that taxes and mandates can be
placed on employers without affecting the workers themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers ''are entitled to know the whole truth about how
Washington secretly takes more of their hard-earned money than they
might realize,'' said Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Bob Matsui, D-Calif., said there was no secrecy
involved because the Social Security Administration this year has
begun sending out annually the aggregate amount, broken down
between employee and employer, an individual has paid in payroll
tax over his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 1264.

<HEADLINE> CBS May Replace Rosie As Tonys Host  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS is reportedly searching for someone other
than Rosie O'Donnell to serve as host of the Tony Awards show.
</P>
<P>
   According to the New York Daily News, the daytime talk show host
irritated the network by using her musical director, John McDaniel,
on the show, as well as such friends as Susan Lucci and Kathie Lee
Gifford.
</P>
<P>
   She also insisted actor Nathan Lane serve as co-host of the June
4 telecast, the newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The show's producers say it's a proposal that hasn't been
discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't begun to think about next year,'' spokesman Keith
Sherman said Monday. ''We haven't even met with CBS.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratings last month for the 2000 awards ceremony were the worst
ever, despite O'Donnell's appearance after a year's hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell, who is a big Broadway booster on her own program, had
raised the Tony ratings in her first year as host in 1997.
Viewership slipped a bit the following year, and O'Donnell bowed
out in 1999, citing other commitments.

<HEADLINE> Univ. Addresses Graham Legacy Debate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FROSTBURG, Md. (AP) -- Officials at Frostburg State University
are scrambling to shield the school from a fight over the legacy of
dancer Martha Graham.
</P>
<P>
   A three-week program for high school and college students from
around the country opened Sunday, but not exactly as planned.
Instead of the ''Martha Graham Summer Dance Retreat,'' college
officials hastily changed the title to ''Dance Legends.'' And a
performance of Graham's 1934 ''Panorama,'' was replaced with that
of another modern dance pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after the school got caught last week in the
cross fire over more than 180 Graham works.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute pits Graham's legal heir, Ron Protas, against
dancers from the foundering Martha Graham Center of Contemporary
Dance in New York. The dancers are urging other dance companies not
to license Graham's choreography from the Graham Trust, which
Protas controls.
</P>
<P>
   Protas demanded the dismissal of several teachers who opposed
his handling of the Martha Graham Trust.
</P>
<P>
   ''They told us that we cannot do the repertoire for any
performances unless these people are dismissed,'' program organizer
Barry Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
   Protas was dismissed earlier this year as the dance company's
artistic director amid tensions with the board of the Graham
Center, the company's parent organization. The board has
temporarily suspended operations because of financial turmoil.

<HEADLINE> Mitsubishi Starts Mass Recall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Mitsubishi Motors Corp. is recalling 514,700
vehicles and the government is looking into a possible cover-up
after investigators unearthed consumer complaints that were filed
with the automaker but never shown to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints relate to defects in engines, brakes, fuel tank
caps and other parts in the Japanese automaker's passenger cars,
sport utility vehicles and commercial trucks. Further details about
the defects were not immediately available, but Mitsubishi is
recalling vehicles that could have the same problems as those
involved in the complaints.
</P>
<P>
   None of the vehicles affected by the recall were exported,
Mitsubishi said. It said there were no reports of accidents or
injuries linked to the defects.
</P>
<P>
   The recall comes after Transportation Ministry officials said
they discovered complaints that the carmaker had not filed with the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said they found the documents in a company locker
room during a routine inspection last November. The documents
showed several thousand complaints dating back to 1998, the Kyodo
News agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   The government is investigating whether Mitsubishi hid the
documents, said Yukikazu Komiyama, the ministry's safety division
official. He said more recall orders may be coming.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi senior executive Hirotoshi Suzuki said he doesn't
believe a cover-up took place, Kyodo reported. The automaker has
started an internal investigation, Suzuki said.
</P>
<P>
   The recall, which includes the Galant sedan and Pajero sport
utility vehicle, among other products, is expected to cost
Mitsubishi $46.2 million -- a quarter of the $184.9 million in group
pretax profits the automaker forecast for this year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Mitsubishi said it is notifying owners of about
178,000 additional vehicles that are entitled to free, minor
repairs.
</P>
<P>
   The recall comes as Mitsubishi is trying to boost sales and turn
its business around with an alliance with DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler, which has agreed to buy 34 percent of
Mitsubishi, said Tuesday the alliance is still on. ''We are going
to sign the contract in the near future,'' spokesman Michael
Pfister said in Stuttgart, Germany.

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Defendants Flew to Malta  </HEADLINE>
By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands (AP) -- Two Libyan men on trial in the
1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 flew to Malta the day before an
explosives-laden suitcase began its journey from that Mediterranean
island to the doomed airliner, according to testimony Tuesday in a
Scottish court.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors claim the two Libyans reached Malta on Dec. 20,
1988, and returned to Libya the next day -- the same day the bomb
blasted a hole in the luggage compartment of the Boeing 747 as it
flew over Lockerbie, Scotland en route to New York. All 259 people
aboard and 11 people on the ground died.
</P>
<P>
   On the witness stand Tuesday, Air Malta official Martin Baron
confirmed the authenticity of immigration cards registering the
arrival and departure of defendant Lamen Khalifa Fhimah and a man
by the name of Ahmed Khalifa Abdusamad, which allegedly was an
alias used by co-defendant Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say the men worked for the Libyan state airline in
Malta and were agents of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. They
allegedly planted the bomb on an Air Malta flight to Frankfurt with
tags routing it through London onto the Pan Am jet.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, which began May 3, the prosecution has sought
to place the men in Malta with access to material from which the
bomb was made and clothing that allegedly padded the bomb in a
suitcase.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Maltese-based travel agents identified Al-Megrahi,
saying he often checked in luggage at Malta's Luqa airport on
behalf of passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Both defendants have pleaded innocent to charges of murder,
conspiracy and endangering aircraft safety, which carry a maximum
life sentence, and claimed Palestinian terrorists were responsible.
</P>
<P>
   The trial adjourned early Tuesday to allow defense attorneys
time to look over a collection of depositions.

<HEADLINE> Arms Negotiator Cautious on China  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Although Russia strongly opposes a U.S.
national missile shield and European allies doubt its usefulness,
the toughest political obstacle may be China, the chief U.S. arms
control official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ones that we have to work on most assiduously are the
China concerns,'' Undersecretary of State John D. Holum told
reporters. ''It will take considerable work to demonstrate that
this system isn't aimed at them.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen met with President Jiang Zemin
and other top Chinese officials in Beijing last week but reported
making little headway in overcoming their objections to missile
defense.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing on Tuesday, Jiang and Russian President Vladimir
Putin released a joint statement accusing the United States of
using the system ''to seek unilateral military and security
advantages that will pose the most grave, adverse consequences'' to
China, Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly three hours of closed talks, Putin and Jiang urged
Washington to adhere to the 28-year-old Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty, which prohibits the missile defense system. Their statement
asserted that altering the treaty ''will trigger an arms race and
lead to an about-face in the positive trend that appeared in world
politics after the end of the Cold War.''
</P>
<P>
   China has only a couple dozen ballistic missiles of
intercontinental range. Although the Pentagon has said its proposed
U.S. national missile shield is designed to counter a threat from
North Korea, not China or Russia, it acknowledges that the system
could defend against as many as two dozen incoming missiles.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is expected to decide this summer or fall
whether to move forward with a plan that would build a force of 20
missile interceptors in Alaska, operating with a network of
tracking radars and high-speed computers, by 2005. The plan calls
for expanding that to 100 interceptors by 2007.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said that one of the factors he will consider before
making his decision is the likely international response, including
the likely effect on arms control arrangements with China and other
nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we tell them the system is not aimed at them, ... they
can say, 'Yes, but we have to focus on capabilities, not
intentions, and it looks to us like if you're building 100
interceptors and we have far fewer (offensive missiles) than that,
then you're building a capability against us,''' Holum said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact of the matter is, we're not,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Holum said it was his ''personal expectation'' that at some
point the United States will build a national missile defense,
despite objections by other nations. ''I think national missile
defense is in our future. It's something we'll have to come to
terms with.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 78; Nasdaq Drops 84  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks slumped Tuesday as investors locked in
some gains from the technology rebound despite some strong profit
reports by major companies and a mostly unsurprising inflation
report.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 77.87 at 10,726.40.
</P>
<P>
   Among broader market indicators, the Nasdaq composite index was
down 83.50 at 4,191.17, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 was down 16.03 at
1,494.46, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was down
7.43 at 537.75.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 438.27 million
shares, up from 417.91 million at the same point on Monday. Nasdaq
decliners led by nearly a 2-to-1 ratio.
</P>
<P>
   Before the open, the Labor Department reported that consumer
inflation jumped 0.6 percent in June, chiefly reflecting surging
gasoline prices and a record rise in the cost of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   Most other prices posted modest increases. June's performance,
which was close to the 0.5 percent rise in consumer prices many
analysts were expecting, was the largest increase since March.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates six times over
the past 13 months to slow economic growth and keep inflation in
check. With recent reports suggesting that the Fed's rate increases
are working, some economists believe the central bank will leave
rates unchanged at its meeting Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch, General Motors and Johnson &AMP; Johnson led the
morning parade of reports on second-quarter profits with
better-than-expected results. However, the day's most anxiously
awaited reports, from Intel and Microsoft, weren't due until after
the close.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Merrill fell $2.063 to $129.938, while GM rose 31.3
cents to $61.688 and J&AMP;J rose 76.6 cents to $95.125. Among other
leading companies, Honeywell, down 31.3 cents at $36.75, and Philip
Morris, up 68.8 cents at $24.188, matched most Wall Street profit
forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   On a more discouraging note, Unisys dropped nearly 20 percent
after the struggling computer systems company posted disappointing
results, falling $2.75 a share to $11.375.
</P>
<P>
   Health insurance stocks fell sharply after Aetna issued a
warning that its second-quarter results would come in well below
analyst expectations. Shares of Aetna were down $9.313 at $57.313,
a loss of nearly 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.98 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 0.05 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 1.05 percent, and France's CAC-40 was
down 1.05 percent.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Restricts Soldiers in S. Korea  </HEADLINE>
By JAE-SUK YOO
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Amid growing anti-American sentiment,
the U.S. military in South Korea has instructed soldiers not to go
out at night and told them to travel in pairs and stay out of
trouble, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The restrictions, similar to those imposed on U.S. servicemen in
Okinawa, Japan, stem from recent anti-U.S. demonstrations in Seoul
and the stabbing death last month of an Army doctor, said Kim
Yong-kyu, a U.S. command spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Some 37,000 American troops are stationed in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor, Maj. David Berry, was killed in broad daylight by a
South Korean man with a record of mental illness. The military says
the attack was unprovoked.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of South Koreans took to the streets Saturday after
the U.S. military acknowledged it had dumped formaldehyde into
Seoul's Han River, a major source of drinking water for Seoul's 12
million people.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters lobbed toy rockets into the U.S. military
compound and pelted a nearby building with red paint, demanding
punishment for those responsible.
</P>
<P>
   The military said the 20 gallons of formaldehyde was treated by
the sewage system before it entered the river, and was therefore
not harmful to the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean media criticized the chemical dumping as
''disregarding the South Korean people.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you in the United States dump such poisonous chemicals into
the Potomac River?'' asked a recent editorial in the Chosun Ilbo
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the uproar, the U.S. command also extended
patrols by its military police in major night spots in Seoul that
are frequented by American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Many shops and bars reported a sharp drop in business, with
fewer American visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sales have dropped as much as 30 percent,'' said Hahm Ji-won
at Nashville Extension, a bar in Itaewon, a neighborhood near the
army base.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military imposed a late-night curfew and a drinking ban
on all its service members in Okinawa earlier this month after
several of them allegedly committed crimes that have enraged Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The order seemed aimed at calming the community ahead of
President Clinton's visit to the island for an international summit
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Most South Koreans support the stationing of U.S. troops in
their country as a deterrent to military threats from communist
North Korea. But many are worried about crimes and other
controversies allegedly involving American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Protests have been on the rise since early May, when a U.S. Air
Force fighter jet dropped six bombs on the Koon-Ni Range near the
west coast village of Mae Hyang, 50 miles southwest of Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers say six people were slightly injured and walls were
cracked and windows shattered by the impact.
</P>
<P>
   Together with activist groups, the villages have been staging
sometimes violent rallies, demanding the relocation of the range.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 activists have since been detained for violent
protests.

<HEADLINE> India To Upgrade Aircraft Fleet  </HEADLINE>
By INDRANIL SINGH
<TEXT>
<P>
   PATNA, India (AP) -- India on Tuesday promised to work more
swiftly to modernize its aircraft fleet in the wake of the crash of
an aging Boeing 737-200 that killed 56 people.
</P>
<P>
   ''New aircraft will be bought,'' Civil Aviation Minister Sharad
Yadav said a day after the state-owned Alliance Air plane crashed
into a housing complex. ''The Alliance Air planes are old and we
have asked the government to speed up the bidding process.''
</P>
<P>
   The jet that crashed was 20 years old and was part of a fleet
that was to be phased out in two years. It was last checked
thoroughly March 19, in accordance with regulations concerning
older aircraft, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, officials of the airline said the plane was
airworthy and denied allegations the company had been lax on
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Tuesday, experts investigated whether a sudden burst
of wind may have pushed down the jetliner.
</P>
<P>
   P.N. Bopanna, an engineer who survived the crash, told reporters
hours after he was rescued that that plane lurched and wobbled
before it went down.
</P>
<P>
   When wind shear occurs, a sudden gust of air initially pushes
the aircraft forward. The air current then pushes the plane toward
the ground. The phenomenon occurs especially during takeoffs and
landings.
</P>
<P>
   Civil Aviation Ministry secretary A.H. Jung told reporters
Monday that the pilot may have been flying too low as he made his
second approach to Patna. ''He had lost height or partially
misjudged it, according to our regulations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A judge will head a team of experts to investigate the crash.
Engineers have recovered the ''black boxes,'' the sealed units that
record flight data and the conversation in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, the body of the 56th victim of the crash was
recovered, said S.P. Modi, director of the airport authority of
Patna. It was apparently the remains of one of five people killed
in the housing complex, where several people were also injured.

<HEADLINE> Britain Wont't Try Bombing Suspect  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Britain said Tuesday it will not prosecute a
Northern Ireland woman who is wanted for the IRA bombing of a
British army barracks in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Roisin McAliskey was freed from jail in Britain two years ago on
compassionate grounds after supporters argued that her physical and
mental health had declined while she was in prison, where she gave
birth to a daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Home Secretary Jack Straw ruled at the time that the medical
condition made her unfit for extradition to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement to Parliament on Tuesday, the Crown Prosecution
Service said it did not have enough evidence to try McAliskey, 26,
for the 1996 bombing of a British army barracks in Osnabruck,
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution service said that because of the time that has
elapsed since the bombing, McAliskey could claim that she would not
receive a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   McAliskey is still wanted by German police in the attack, which
damaged buildings but injured no one.
</P>
<P>
   They believe McAliskey, the daughter of former lawmaker
Bernadette McAliskey, was part of an Irish Republican Army unit
that carried out the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   She could have been prosecuted in the Britain under the terms of
a European counterterrorism agreement.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Sports Boss Convicted for Doping  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL GEITNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- East Germany's former sports chief and his medical
director were convicted Tuesday for their roles in a top secret
doping program in the former communist country that turned
promising young female athletes into souped-up Olympic champions.
</P>
<P>
   Manfred Ewald, 74, and Manfred Hoeppner, 65, were each convicted
of 20 counts of being accessories to causing bodily harm for
secretly administering steroids to the athletes. The men allegedly
told the athletes they were giving them vitamins.
</P>
<P>
   Ewald was sentenced to 22 months probation; Hoeppner was given
18 months. The court found them innocent of more serious charges
that could have brought jail time.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say the 20 female athletes involved in the case
suffered serious side-effects from the drugs, and that Ewald and
Hoeppner knew of the potential danger.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those responsible have been called to account,'' said Michael
Lehner, the attorney for the women.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers said they were considering an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the communist party's central committee, Ewald was
president of East Germany's sports federation from 1961-88 and of
its National Olympics Committee from 1973 until the country ceased
to exist in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In its verdict, the court said Ewald was the ''driving force''
behind the doping program and kept it going with ''merciless
hardness.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoeppner, as the country's top sports doctor, worked out the
details of the doping program -- including the secrecy rules -- and
distributed the steroids to the sports doctors and coaches, the
court found.
</P>
<P>
   Both shared responsibility for the ''systematic and overall
doping in (East German) competitive sports,'' from 1974 until the
Berlin Wall came down in 1989, the court found.
</P>
<P>
   The court said it handed down a lesser sentence to Hoeppner
because he had apologized to the athletes and cooperated with
prosecutors in other doping cases. Ewald never made a direct
apology.
</P>
<P>
   Former track star Brigitte Michel, who was in court Tuesday,
said she ''can live with'' the verdict even though the men most
likely won't have to serve any time behind bars. They faced a
maximum of two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no verdict anyway that can make up for the damage
suffered,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The athletes were seeking a conviction on a more serious charge.
They say the drugs caused them to develop excessive body hair and
deep voices and also caused gynecological problems. The baby of one
former athlete was born with deformities allegedly linked to the
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But the court said a direct connection could not be established
between the steroids and each individual's specific illness.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the steroid program were dramatic: East Germany,
with fewer than 17 million people, went from 20 gold medals in 1972
to 40 in 1976. East Germans won 11 of 13 events in women's swimming
in 1976 and again in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 former East German coaches, doctors and others have
been convicted and given fines, suspended sentences or both.

<HEADLINE> Chernobyl Nuclear Plant Restarted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- The only working reactor at the Chernobyl
atomic power plant, site of the world's worst nuclear accident, was
restarted this week after repairs, plant officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The reactor was shut down due to flooding caused by a storm July
10; two of its electric generators needed repairs.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday evening, one electric generator was restarted. The
other needs further work, the Chernobyl press service reported. The
reactor will work at 50 percent of capacity until the second
generator is restarted July 24, the press service said.
</P>
<P>
   A reactor at Chernobyl exploded and caught fire in 1986,
contaminating large areas in Ukraine, Russia and Belarus and
spewing a radioactive cloud across Europe. At least 8,000 people
have died as a result of the disaster, most of them from
radiation-related diseases, according to Ukrainian officials. An
estimated 3.4 million people in Ukraine still suffer from its
effects.
</P>
<P>
   Ukraine has promised to permanently shut down the plant's only
working reactor on Dec. 15.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Missile Shield Plans Denounced  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- In a throwback to the early years of the Cold
War, China and Russia joined Tuesday to condemn what they consider
U.S. attempts to dominate the global order and pledged to stand
together in defiance of American power.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Chinese counterpart,
Jiang Zemin, put their burgeoning partnership on display during a
one-day summit in the Chinese capital. Among the five documents
they and their aides signed at a public ceremony, two took aim at
the United States, singling out the proposed national missile
defense system.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders' language was not confrontational, but they agreed
to closer cooperation on international affairs and denounced the
anti-missile shield. In a joint statement, they accused Washington
of using the shield ''to seek unilateral military and security
advantages that will pose the most grave, adverse consequences'' to
China, Russia and the United States itself.
</P>
<P>
   Putin and Jiang urged Washington to adhere to the 28-year-old
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which prohibits the missile defense
system. Their statement warned that altering the treaty ''will
trigger an arms race and lead to an about-face in the positive
trend that appeared in world politics after the end of the Cold
War.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington argues that its proposed national shield is not aimed
at China and Russia but at stopping missiles from North Korea and
other smaller states hostile to U.S. interests. Putin and Jiang
said ''the pretext of a missile threat is totally unjustified.''
</P>
<P>
   They also criticized a U.S. proposal for a more limited
anti-missile system to protect its troops and allies in East Asia,
which Beijing fears would undermine its claim to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen met with Jiang and other top
Chinese officials in Beijing last week but reported making little
headway in overcoming their objections to missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ones that we have to work on most assiduously are the
China concerns,'' Undersecretary of State John D. Holum told
reporters in Washington on Tuesday. ''It will take considerable
work to demonstrate that this system isn't aimed at them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the documents Jiang and Putin signed after almost three hours
of closed-door meetings, they blasted ''hegemonism'' and attempts
to interfere in countries' internal affairs. Those were thinly
veiled attacks on NATO, U.S. bullying and last year's war on
Yugoslavia, all of which have been roundly criticized in the past
by the giant neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang and Putin also issued a separate statement committing
China and Russia to ''work together in the international arena to
promote peace and stability in the world.'' Their aides signed
agreements on banking and energy cooperation. One accord will see
Russia build an experimental fast neutron reactor in China.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's meeting was Jiang and Putin's second in three weeks,
after a Central Asian summit.
</P>
<P>
   After a 21-gun salute, Jiang squired Putin along a red carpet to
review a military honor guard on Tiananmen Square. The presidents
then met privately for two hours before their foreign and defense
ministers and other officials joined them for formal talks.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Jiang and Putin said their talks cemented already
strong ties. Putin invited Jiang to visit Moscow next year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our two countries presently share a common position on the
global security balance,'' Putin was quoted saying by Russia's
Interfax News Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The common stance was a reminder the 1950s, when Mao Tse-tung's
regime was Russia's ''little brother'' in the communist camp. They
worked then to spread communism and fight what they labeled U.S.
imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing eventually chafed at playing second fiddle, and the two
became bitter rivals in the later decades of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   But now China has all but jettisoned its socialist economy,
while Russia ditched communism a decade ago. The reduction of
hostility between them and common concerns about American influence
have brought them closer than at any time in more than three
decades.
</P>
<P>
   The new relationship is based on principles they hold in common.
Those include nonintervention in nations' internal affairs, as well
as the need for mutual support and cooperation on border issues and
security, said Jia Qingguo, an expert in international relations at
Peking University.
</P>
<P>
   China and Russia will likely cooperate in developing
technologies to defeat the U.S. missile shield if the United States
presses ahead with it, although they are unlikely to enter into a
military alliance, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their concerns, China and Russia can ill afford to
alienate the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Their economic fortunes largely depend on foreign investment,
and that investment is aided by smooth relations with the West. And
Beijing's large-scale purchases of Russian weapons aside, trade
remains at low levels between China and Russia despite repeated
promises by their leaders to boost economic ties.

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 50; Nasdaq Drops 63  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks slumped Tuesday as investors locked in
some gains from the technology rebound despite some strong profit
reports by major companies and a mostly unsurprising inflation
report.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 50.21 at 10,754.06 after falling as much as 101
points.
</P>
<P>
   Among broader market indicators, the Nasdaq composite index was
down 63.38 at 4,211.29, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 was down 15.01 at
1,495.48, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was down
5.08 at 540.10.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly a 3-to-2 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 725.12 million
shares, up from 709.72 million at the same point on Monday. Nasdaq
decliners also led by a 3-to-2 ratio.
</P>
<P>
   Before the open, the Labor Department reported that consumer
inflation jumped 0.6 percent in June, chiefly reflecting surging
gasoline prices and a record rise in the cost of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   Most other prices posted modest increases. June's performance,
which was close to the 0.5 percent rise in consumer prices many
analysts were expecting, was the largest increase since March.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates six times over
the past 13 months to slow economic growth and keep inflation in
check. With recent reports suggesting that the Fed's rate increases
are working, some economists believe the central bank will leave
rates unchanged at its meeting Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch, General Motors and Johnson &AMP; Johnson led the
morning parade of reports on second-quarter profits with
better-than-expected results. However, the day's most anxiously
awaited reports, from Intel and Microsoft, weren't due until after
the close.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Merrill fell $3.125 to $128.875, while GM rose 12.5
cents to $60.50 and J&AMP;J rose 51.6 cents to $94.875. Among other
leading companies, Honeywell, down 25 cents at $36.813, and Philip
Morris, up $1.063 at $24.563, matched most Wall Street profit
forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   On a more discouraging note, Unisys tumbled 22 percent, falling
$3.125 a share to $11 after the struggling computer systems company
posted disappointing results.
</P>
<P>
   Health insurance stocks fell sharply after Aetna issued a
warning that its second-quarter results would come in well below
analysts' expectations. Shares of Aetna fell $7.85 to $58.75, a
loss of 12 percent.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Is Okinawa Summit Dean  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Three new faces -- the prime ministers of Japan and
Italy and
Russia's new president -- will be at the table when the leaders of
the world's major industrial countries sit down Friday at their
26th annual economic summit in Nago on the Japanese island Okinawa.
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton is the dean of the gatherings. The Okinawa
summit will be his eighth, tying the American record held by
another two-term president, Ronald Reagan. The overall record is
held by former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who attended 16.
</P>
<P>
   The annual meetings of rich countries were begun in 1975, in
response to the first global oil shock, when Gerald Ford was
president. The group reached its current size of eight countries by
officially adding Russia in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A look at the leaders who will be around the table:
</P>
<P>
   UNITED STATES:
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's last economic summit will be in the country
where he attended his first one, Japan. The administration is
making much of the contrast between then and now. In 1993, the
United States was in a weak recovery from recession with high
unemployment and record budget deficits, which America's allies saw
as a threat to the global economy. On Okinawa, Clinton will have
bragging rights, with the United States in the midst of its longest
economic expansion and enjoying record budget surpluses. The good
economy has kept Clinton's approval ratings high, even during his
impeachment travails, and his current approval ratings are around
60 percent. The major flaw in the good economy is a record trade
deficit, which has added to protectionist pressures. The
administration also suffered a fiasco in the riot-marred failure to
launch a new round of global trade talks in Seattle last December.
In an effort to demonstrate that globalization can work for poor
nations, Clinton will be pushing an agenda of debt relief for the
world's poorest as well as support for education and health
assistance in undeveloped countries.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA:
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir Putin is one of the new heads of government,
attending his first summit as successor to Boris Yeltsin. Elected
to a four-year term by a substantial margin in March, Putin
currently enjoys a 62 percent approval rating despite a continuing
bloody war in Chechnya that contradicts the Kremlin's claim that it
has broken the back of resistance in 10 months of fighting. The
Russian economy, long a basket case, is performing better, but much
of that results from recent high oil prices. If prices should fall,
Russia, a leading oil exporter, easily could see its economy stall
again. Seeking to restore some of Russia's lost global power, Putin
was making stops in China and North Korea on his way to Japan. At
the summit, he will push Clinton to abandon plans to build a
national missile defense system, which Russia sees as a significant
threat to its security.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN:
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori was elevated to host of this year's
summit only last spring after the late Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
suffered a stroke in April. Mori's short time in office has been
marked by a series of gaffes, including his reference to Japan as a
''divine nation,'' which stirred up painful memories of the
nationalistic rhetoric that led the country into World War II. A
poll showed this month a disapproval rating for Mori's Cabinet at
61.4 percent, much of the voter unhappiness stemming from Japan's
decade-long economic stagnation. Some positive signs have emerged
as the economy managed to eke out a growth rate of 0.5 percent for
the year ending in March. Unemployment remains high, however, and
government spending to stimulate the economy has driven the public
debt to record levels.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY:
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has gained in stature since playing
host to last year's summit in Cologne. He has been helped by a
slush fund scandal engulfing Helmut Kohl, his predecessor, and a
booming German economy. The growth rate is expected to be the
highest this year since German unification in 1990. A big worry for
Schroeder going into the summit is Russian debt. Germany is
Russia's biggest creditor, accounting for half the debt owed by the
government in Moscow. Germany is ready to grant generous
rescheduling terms but adamantly opposes forgiving any of the debt.
German officials worry that the Clinton administration will push
its allies to go further and offer some degree of a debt write-off
to help Putin's new government.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN:
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair, who took office after a landslide
victory in 1997, is suffering midterm blues and looks vulnerable
after a string of embarrassments, including being booed and heckled
during a speech to a women's group and the recent arrest of his
16-year-old son Euan on a charge of being drunk in a public square.
Blair's problems include a public perception that there has been
little progress improving government services or cutting waiting
times for the National Health Service. Still, polls show Blair's
Labor Party with a double-digit lead over the opposition
Conservatives. Much of this comes from the strong British economy,
which has pushed unemployment to a 20-year low. Blair, like the
other G-8 leaders, plans to stress how rich countries can help the
poor in debt relief, education, health and technology.
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE:
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac slightly trails Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin in the public opinion polls as both have found
''cohabitation'' between a conservative president and a Socialist
prime minister to be trying. Globalization is a major issue in
France, where it is often a code word for what the French see as
America's overbearing stance on international issues. Jose Bove, a
radical French farmer who vandalized a McDonald's restaurant as a
blow against globalization is a folk hero in France. Chirac will
try for support to regulate globalization to ensure that national
cultures, traditions and products can survive in the new world
economic order.
</P>
<P>
   CANADA:
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Jean Chretien, who took office in 1993, is the
second longest-serving G-8 leader after Clinton. Unlike the U.S.
president, who is constitutionally limited to two terms, Chretien
has said he wants to run for a third term next year. He still has
the strongest poll numbers of any major political figure in Canada,
and his Liberal Party is considered the likely winner in federal
elections expected within a year. Chretien has supported free trade
and globalization. Officials of the Canadian government said that
Chretien would use the summit to increase Third World countries'
access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ITALY:
</P>
<P>
   Guiliano Amato was sworn in as head of Italy's 58th postwar
government in April on the resignation of Massimo D'Alema after a
poor showing in regional elections by the ruling center-left
coalition. Amato, a Socialist-turned-independent, is the third
premier from the center-left since that bloc won power in 1996
parliamentary elections. The 10-party governing coalition, which
includes Communists, environmentalists and former Christian
Democrats, has squabbled constantly and has yet to decide on a
premier candidate, although Amato has hinted he would resign before
his term ended if the center-left should choose another candidate.
High unemployment, the government budget deficit and rising
inflation are the biggest economic issues facing the country. On
the eve of the G-8 summit, Italy's parliament pledged to forgive
more than $4 billion in debt owed by 62 poor countries over the
next three years under easier terms than those set by the others.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Adoption Treaty Measure  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation needed to implement an
international treaty on foreign adoptions passed the House on
Tuesday after months of gridlock over whether it would allow gay
adoptions.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty, known as the Hague Convention on Intercountry
Adoption, was created to establish guidelines for international
adoptions and include provisions to end smuggling and fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The bill the House passed would give various federal agencies
the authority to implement the treaty once it is ratified by
two-thirds of the Senate. The United States signed the measure in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Senate aides say lawmakers there may take up the measure soon
and even ratify it before Congress leaves for its August recess.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope this Intercountry Adoption Act will not only
demonstrate America's commitment to the child ... but will enable
those adoptions to go more smoothly and more rapidly,'' said Rep.
Nancy Johnson, R-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The measure had hit a snag in recent months as lawmakers debated
whether it would allow gay adoptions.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., successfully lobbied for a provision
that requires the United States to adhere to the laws of countries
that may have marriage requirements or guidelines dealing with
sexual orientation. Several countries, such as China, Romania and
Bulgaria, prohibit gay adoptions.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters have said international guidelines on adoptions are
needed to ease and streamline the adoption process as well as
prevent abuses like trafficking, misrepresentation of a child's
medical condition and fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ''Documented abuses range from the charging of exorbitant fees
by so-called 'facilitators' in some countries to child
kidnapping,'' said Rep. William Delahunt, D-Mass. and the father of
a daughter who came to the United States from Vietnam in the early
1970s, before the fall of Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   ''This bill will help ensure that adoptions are safe, that they
are in the best interest of the child, the birth parent and the
adoptive parent,'' said Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   More than 15,000 international adoptions are expected to take
place this year. The majority of children adopted in the United
States will come from China, official said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to giving authority to various federal agencies to
implement the treaty, the House measure also includes guidelines
for federal authorities to begin accrediting adoption agencies that
work internationally.

<HEADLINE> Cholesterol Puts Young Men at Risk  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- If you think people in their 20s and 30s don't
have to worry about their cholesterol, think again.
</P>
<P>
   A study found that even men under 40 with high cholesterol run
an increased risk of heart disease and premature death,
underscoring the importance of early screening and preventive
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   High cholesterol in middle age is known to be a major risk
factor for heart disease and heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings suggest that younger men with high cholesterol
face a greater long-term risk than men diagnosed with the condition
in middle age, in part because the longer high levels exist, the
more damage they can cause.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are contained in an analysis of studies on nearly
82,000 men ages 18 to 39 who were followed for up to 34 years. The
results appear in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The study was led by Dr. Jeremiah Stamler, emeritus professor of
preventive medicine at Northwestern University Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   The findings clearly support existing guidelines that recommend
cholesterol tests at least every five years for adults starting at
age 20, Dr. Scott M. Grundy of the University of Texas Southwestern
Medical Center in Dallas said in an accompanying editorial.
</P>
<P>
   However, some insurance companies will not pay for screening
tests, and some primary-care doctors are too busy to worry about
long-term prevention, Grundy said.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion that cholesterol-lowering drugs or a change in
diet can be started later in life without any harm is not accurate,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Heart disease, the nation's No. 1 killer, is largely preventable
and Stamler's study ''has demonstrated the immense value of
long-term prevention,'' said Dr. David A. Meyerson, a Johns Hopkins
cardiologist and spokesman for the American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
   Total cholesterol levels of 200 milligrams per deciliter or
below are considered healthful; readings of 240 and above are
considered high.
</P>
<P>
   The research evaluated 81,488 men followed through the 1990s in
three previous studies. Men were at greater risk for heart
disease-related death if their total cholesterol at the outset was
above 200.
</P>
<P>
   Those with high levels were two to 3&AMP;frac12; times more likely to die
of a heart disease-related death than men with healthful levels.
They died four to nine years earlier than men with healthful
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with men ages 40 to 59, the studies showed that for
every 40 points that cholesterol levels increased, young men faced
nearly twice the risk or more of dying of a heart attack during the
follow-up years.

<HEADLINE> Satisfaction High With Mastectomies  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Seventy percent of women who had their healthy
breasts removed in hopes of avoiding breast cancer reported being
satisfied with their decision some 14 years later, a Mayo Clinic
study found.
</P>
<P>
   The study looked at the psychological consequences of the most
drastic treatment available to women who run a high risk of breast
cancer because of a family history of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   A related Mayo study of 950 women suggested that the surgery is
also the most effective option. That study, published in 1997,
found that high-risk women who had both breasts removed reduced
their cancer risk by about 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The psychological study was reported in Wednesday's Journal of
the American Medical Association. The participants were mostly
studied before screening became available for the so-called BRCA
gene mutations that are linked to breast cancer, but many of the
women had a strong family history of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic breast cancer is rare, accounting for between 5 percent
and 10 percent of all cases, but at least half of all women with
susceptible genes will develop the disease by age 70, according to
the American Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   The options for high-risk women include regular screening;
tamoxifen, a potent drug with potential side effects; and having
both breasts removed before cancer even occurs. The surgery is
called a bilateral prophylactic mastectomy.
</P>
<P>
   Lori Edell said she doesn't think about cancer every day now,
three years after she decided to have surgery to remove both her
breasts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have two small children who I want to see grow up, so it was
an easy decision,'' said Edell, a 41-year-old New Jersey pharmacist
who was not involved in the research.
</P>
<P>
   Edell said if she hadn't had the surgery, she probably would
have ended up like her mother and aunt, ''going through early
detection, knowing they were probably going to get breast cancer
anyway, and they died from it.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers questioned 572 of the 950 women who had
prophylactic mastectomies at the Mayo Clinic between 1960 and 1993.
Participants included six women who developed cancer after
undergoing mastectomies, and all said they still were
psychologically satisfied with their decision.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen percent were dissatisfied, mainly because they were
unhappy with their altered body appearance, said Marlene Frost, a
Mayo nurse researcher and the lead investigator. Eleven percent
were neutral.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the satisfied women said they worried less about cancer
and experienced no change in their sex lives and feelings of
femininity.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 20 percent of high-risk women say they would consider
prophylactic mastectomies, and even fewer actually choose to have
the surgery, Frost said.
</P>
<P>
   The exact number of women who have the surgery is uncertain, but
Frost and other scientists said it has probably become less common
since genetic testing became available.
</P>
<P>
   Before, the surgery was presented as an option for women with a
strong family history of the disease. Now, it generally is
considered only by women known to be BRCA carriers, said Dr. Funmi
Olopade, director of the University of Chicago's cancer risk
clinic.
</P>
<P>
   The findings should be reassuring for women at genetic risk who
may be considering preventive surgery, said Dr. Eric Winer,
director of breast oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   But he also said the 19 percent who were dissatisfied shouldn't
be discounted, especially since the study suggests they may have
felt pressured by their doctors. Because surgery is drastic and
irreversible, the decision ultimately should be up to the patient,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Study Links Reflux, Genetics  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Researchers have zeroed in on a possible genetic
cause for a common ailment in children that has been linked to
recurring respiratory illnesses and perhaps even some crib deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The study was small and the findings are preliminary, but it
could eventually lead to better diagnosis and treatment of
gastroesophageal reflux disease, scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   The study in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical
Association comes less than a week after Propulsid -- a drug that is
commonly used to treat the disease in infants but has been linked
to serious heart problems and 80 deaths -- was taken off the market.
</P>
<P>
   Using genetic mapping techniques on five families with affected
children, investigators found a marker suggesting there is a gene
that causes at least one form of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't actually find the gene but discovered evidence that
one exists.
</P>
<P>
   Previous research suggested the ailment is inherited. The study
is believed to be the first to locate a genetic marker.
</P>
<P>
   The disease affects an estimated 10 million children each year,
though the researchers said it is vastly underdiagnosed. It causes
stomach acid to back up into the esophagus, usually because of a
relaxation of the valve-like muscle that keeps the lower end of the
esophagus closed after eating or drinking.
</P>
<P>
   In children, the main symptom is spitting up or coughing. Most
youngsters outgrow it. It is also believed to be a cause of
recurring colds and upper respiratory infections.
</P>
<P>
   In very few cases, experts think it is a cause of some choking
deaths mistakenly attributed to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, said
Dr. Christopher Post, a co-author of the study by researchers at
Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Heartburn is the major symptom in 40 million adults affected by
the ailment. It can cause constant throat irritation that can lead
to esophageal cancer. Treatment includes diet, drugs and sometimes
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   If a culprit gene is found, doctors may be able to diagnose the
disease with a simple blood test instead of an invasive procedure,
Post said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors outside the study agreed it could be a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's novel, it's provocative and I think it raises a lot of
important things that need to be looked at long-term,'' said Dr.
Benjamin D. Gold, director of pediatric gastroenterology and
nutrition at Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   One drawback is that so few families were studied, said Dr.
Frank Hamilton of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive
and Kidney Diseases. Still, he called the results promising.

<HEADLINE> Archaeologist to return Indian remains, artifacts under settlement  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMBURG, N.Y. (AP) - An archaeologist who dug up remains at an
Indian burial site and stored them in boxes in an office hallway
will return them to the Senecas under a settlement that state
officials say will protect sacred grounds in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The Seneca Nation of Indians, Tonawanda Seneca Nation and
Attorney General Eliot Spitzer last year sued R. Michael Gramly
under a 1990 federal statute to protect Indian remains and
artifacts. It was the first such action taken by a state under the
Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, Spitzer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gramly was accused of digging up graves at the site of a 17th
Century Indian village about 15 miles south of Buffalo as part of a
field course offered at Canisius College, where he is an adjunct
professor. The excavations took place over two years beginning in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dr. Gramly had come to this site, dug up artifacts and abused
them, taken them back to his office, and human artifacts simply
laid in boxes, unpreserved,'' Spitzer said at the site Tuesday.
''No effort was made to ensure the integrity of those artifacts.''
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said the college was not aware federal law was violated.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, Gramly, a former curator at the Buffalo
Museum of Science, agreed to repatriate all human remains and
cultural items to the Indians and to refrain from excavating any
other Native American burial grounds in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Gramly did not return telephone calls to his business seeking
comment. His lawyer, Richard Yellin, described Gramly as a
professional and told The Buffalo News Gramly only undertook the
excavation because the land owner wanted to build at the site.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there is no protection, this is what happens,'' said Seneca
Nation President Duane Ray.
</P>
<P>
   David Schenne, an antiques dealer from Brant, said in court
papers that he saw boxes of bones in the hallway at Gramly's
office.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gramly said they contained the remains of seven Native
Americans from the Kleis site,'' Schenne said. He said Gramly also
told him a ceramic pot displayed in his office was also from the
site.
</P>
<P>
   Ray said death begins a journey for Native Americans. ''When
these sites are disturbed ... that journey stops.''
</P>
<P>
   The remains and other items have been reburied on the Tonawanda
reservation, said Richard Hill, chairman of the Haudenosaunee
Standing Committee on Burial Rules and Regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement removes some of the sadness over seeing the site
disturbed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's kind of amazing in the year 2000 that our dead people are
considered archaeological resources that are meant for study,''
Hill said. ''They're not artifacts. They were real live people at
one time.''
</P>
<P>
   The site across from the Erie County Fairgrounds, known as the
Kleis Site after its former owner, was believed to have been a
village of the Erie tribe from 1620 to 1640.
</P>
<P>
   The Eries were defeated in a 17th Century battle with the
Senecas and were either eliminated as a tribe or incorporated into
the Senecas.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said the settlement would establish a template for
protection of all Indian burial sites. The 1990 statute requires
that lineal descendants of those buried approve excavations and
requires permits be obtained.

<HEADLINE> Sleep Evasive at Camp David  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- There's something about Middle East
peacemaking that just doesn't lend itself to anyone getting a good
night's sleep.
</P>
<P>
   As at past peace summits, the negotiators at the 8-day-old Camp
David talks have taken to pulling all-nighters in their final push
to hammer out an accord.
</P>
<P>
   ''A variety of people have been up for most of the night for the
last three nights, so I think you can expect that they're tired,
but they're staying at it,'' said President Clinton's chief
spokesman, Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   With late nights the norm at Camp David, the presidential
retreat in the Catoctin Mountains, negotiators at parallel talks
being held in nearby Emmitsburg, Md., were burning the midnight oil
as well, the American organizers said.
</P>
<P>
   It helps that Clinton is a confirmed night owl, as are his
negotiating partners, Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, talks by Barak and Arafat are usually late at night.
The Palestinian leader, in particular, has a reputation for wearing
out his aides with the grueling hours he routinely keeps.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, Clinton headed into a meeting with Barak that
didn't break until after 4 a.m. Tuesday, the White House said. But
the night's work still wasn't over -- he then conferred with aides
before turning in.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president's night, or more accurately morning, ended at
about 5 a.m.,'' Lockhart told reporters. Clinton was up again at
about 10 a.m. to meet with his negotiating team.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping long hours is a time-honored bargaining tactic at Middle
East summits. When Israel and the Palestinians talked peace two
years ago at Wye River, Clinton several times led talkfests that
lasted into the early morning, insisting the sessions continue long
after some participants wanted to beg off and go to bed.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts in the Israeli press afterward suggested Clinton had
cannily used sheer fatigue to wear down the parties and get them to
soften their positions. The summit resulted in an interim peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
   At the first Camp David summit, in 1978, then-President Jimmy
Carter spent one sleepless night not in negotiations, but fretting
about the health and well-being of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.
</P>
<P>
   After Sadat retired unexpectedly early one night, former
National Security Council staffer William Quandt related in a
memoir about the watershed negotiations that Carter called the
Secret Service at 4 a.m., worried that something might have
happened to the Egyptian leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the sun rose, Sadat was out for his usual morning walk,
and Carter breathed a sigh of relief,'' Quandt wrote.
</P>
<P>
   With the current Camp David talks facing an unofficial deadline
of Wednesday, when Clinton is to depart for Japan, Lockhart was
asked if the president was prepared to once again talk all night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sure,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Au Pair's Ex-Lawyer:Claim Was False  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHESTER, England (AP) -- A former lawyer for Louise Woodward
testified at the trial of the British au pair's parents on Tuesday
that an expense claim submitted by the couple was ''a complete
forgery.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan and Gary Woodward are charged with defrauding an appeal
fund set up in their daughter's name by claiming false expenses.
The couple claimed $15,400 to cover Susan Woodward's accommodations
in Boston, where Louise Woodward was tried on murder charges in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   But the lawyer, Elaine Whitfield Sharp -- who represented Louise
Woodward during her trial for the death of a baby in her care --
said she had put Susan Woodward up at her home before the trial
free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   The invoice -- which Whitfield Sharp called ''a complete
forgery'' -- was submitted to the Louise Woodward and Family Trust,
stating that the lawyer charged Woodward $2,200 a month to stay in
her spare bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   The Woodwards, both 44 and now estranged, deny fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning by prosecution lawyer Bernard Lever, Whitfield
Sharp told the court, ''That would be outrageous. It would be
extortionate.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Apart from the fact I wouldn't charge somebody to stay in the
spare bedroom after inviting them into my home, I think $2,200 is
an outlandish figure.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said the Woodwards had sold an interview to a British
newspaper without telling her.
</P>
<P>
   ''They denied they had sold any story. Indeed, a press release
was issued under my name denying a story had been sold when in fact
it had,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Louise Woodward was charged with killing 8-month-old Matthew
Eappen while working as an au pair at his parents' home. She was
convicted of second-degree murder in October 1997, but the trial
judge reduced the verdict to manslaughter and she was freed after
spending 279 days in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Whitfied Sharp rejected accusations by defense lawyer Nick
Johnson that she ''had it in for the Woodwards'' and that her
husband had been paid thousands of dollars in cash by Gary
Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   Louise Woodward, now 22, is listed as a defense witness in the
trial, which is expected to last three weeks.

<HEADLINE> Herbal Supplemented Food Criticized  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A cereal and a ''memory elixir'' iced tea
claim to boost brain power. Snack chips purport to contain ''an
effective antibiotic.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of foods illegally contain purported herbal medicines
that deceive Americans with false health claims and, worse, may be
dangerous, consumer advocates charged Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Science in the Public Interest joined with
Connecticut's top attorney and a renowned herbal expert to petition
the Food and Drug Administration to halt sales of 75 so-called
''functional foods.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The FDA has done a woefully inadequate job of protecting
consumers'' from ''modern-day snake oils,'' said CSPI attorney
Bruce Silverglade.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no scientific evidence to support these outlandish
and ridiculous claims,'' said Connecticut Attorney General Richard
Blumenthal, who is investigating the foods and said he soon will
announce a crackdown on deceptive products sold in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ''State action will be forthcoming if the federal government
can't do better'' at preventing manufacturers from ''betraying
consumers,'' Blumenthal added, saying he is asking attorneys
general in other states to investigate, too.
</P>
<P>
   Functional foods claim to have added ingredients that provide an
extra nutrition boost, and even CSPI acknowledges some are very
healthy. The classic example: Already-nutritious orange juice
pumped up with bone-strengthening calcium. Other examples are
cereals containing heart-healthy fiber, and FDA-approved margarines
that contain cholesterol-lowering ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   But the latest fad in food takes this concept a step farther:
adding unproven and largely unregulated herbal dietary supplements
to foods.
</P>
<P>
   ''Herbs are drugs,'' said Varro Tyler, a professor emeritus at
Purdue University and an internationally known herbal expert.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not add Viagra to soup. We do not spray Prozac on corn
chips,'' Tyler said, yet numerous companies claim to add herbs
strong enough to affect health to foods eaten daily by children,
pregnant women and others who could be at risk.
</P>
<P>
   If the herb doses really are strong enough to affect health,
that ''is a disaster waiting to happen,'' he said. If the doses
aren't that strong, then the foods are safe but deceptive.
</P>
<P>
   The Grocery Manufacturers of America defended the $16 billion
functional food industry, accusing the consumer advocates of
''frenzied overreaction.'' The FDA properly regulates foods and
brand-name manufacturers only sell safe products, the industry
group insisted.
</P>
<P>
   But a General Accounting Office report to Congress last week
echoed the state-level concern, calling the FDA's efforts
inadequate to ensure consumer safety.
</P>
<P>
   FDA's top food officials refused comment Tuesday. But the agency
has contended that it does not have enough money to crack down on
overall functional foods and instead investigates them
case-by-case.
</P>
<P>
   Among CSPI's complaints:
</P>
<P>
   --GinkgO's brand cereal promises ''sharp thinking,'' as does
Arizona's Rx Memory Elixir tea, because they contain the herb
ginkgo, alleged to improve blood flow in the brain. But ginkgo is
not proven to help memory. Plus, it thins people's blood, leading
doctors to warn that anyone using regular aspirin or other blood
thinners could risk a stroke if they also consume ginkgo.
</P>
<P>
   --Snapple's Moon Tea, Apple &AMP; Eve's Tribal Tonics Relaxation
Cocktail and Hansen's ''d-stress'' sparkling drink contain kava
kava, an herb Tyler called a potent muscle relaxant and sedative.
People in California and Utah have been charged with driving while
intoxicated while under kava's sedative effects, CSPI said.
</P>
<P>
   --Robert's American Gourmet Echinacea Shells snack claims that
''echinacea facilitates the healing process and ... can be an
effective antibiotic.'' The FDA warned Robert's last January that
the antibiotic claim -- which scientists say is completely unproven
-- was a federal violation. Plus, Tyler said echinacea can cause
allergic reactions, particularly in ragweed-allergy sufferers.

<HEADLINE> Treasury Secretary Promotes Savings  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the rate of personal savings at a record
low, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers announced some measures
Tuesday aimed at boosting participation in retirement savings
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must raise the level of personal saving, by encouraging
individual Americans to save more,'' Summers said in a speech at a
Labor Department event underscoring the importance of saving for
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 75 million Americans do not participate in any
retirement savings plan and have little or no savings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Summers said that the Internal Revenue Service is
issuing new rules making it easier for small businesses, public
schools, charitable organizations and state and local governments
to automatically enroll employees in retirement savings plans.
</P>
<P>
   Under automatic enrollment, employers that sponsor retirement
savings plans such as 401(k) plans can assume employees are
participating and deduct a stated amount from their pay to
contribute to the savings plan. Employees have the right to opt out
of these plans. Traditionally, employees must specifically request
to participate in a retirement savings plan.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, House lawmakers are expected to consider legislation
Thursday intended to beef up tax-free contributions and deductions
to private retirement plans. The measure, among other things, would
gradually raise the current $2,000 annual contribution limit for
traditional and Roth individual retirement accounts to $5,000 in
2003. The limit would thereafter rise each year based on inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The new IRS rulings extend the option of automatic enrollment to
so-called 403(b) retirement plans, which serve millions of
employees of public schools and other educational and charitable
organizations, and to 457(b) plans that serve employees of state
and local governments, Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   Another IRS ruling allows the automatic enrollment to be offered
in standardized retirement plans most often used by small
businesses. And, under another IRS ruling, employers are allowed to
automatically roll over a departing employee's balance to an IRA
set up for that employee, unless the employee explicitly directs
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   In the first three months of 2000, the nation's personal savings
rate -- savings as a percentage of disposable income -- fell to a
quarterly low of 0.3 percent. That's not as dire as it seems
because the rate doesn't capture such things as rising stock values
and higher real-estate values for homes.

<HEADLINE> Hunt Continues for Penguin  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- Scientists want to study him,
journalists want to photograph him and millions of South Africans
just want reassurance that their beloved Peter is OK after he
survived an oil spill and swam 470 miles back to his home.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem is no one knows exactly where the celebrity
penguin is.
</P>
<P>
   Driving rain and howling wind prevented people from taking the
boat trip to Peter's home to greet the 18-inch tall hero on his
return Tuesday to Robben Island.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists, who glued a tracking device to his back, know he's
there somewhere. But even when boats begin running again, the
search for Peter will be a difficult one: the device tracks him
only to within about 500 feet, and the island, four miles off Cape
Town, is covered with thick bush under which the penguins nest in
burrows.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will take a couple of days of astute detective work to
track him down,'' said Les Underhill of the University of Cape
Town's avian demography unit, which has been tracking the birds.
</P>
<P>
   Peter was among 20,000 penguins trucked to the town of Port
Elizabeth and released to make the long swim home, giving
authorities time to clean up an oil spill from a tanker that sank
June 23.
</P>
<P>
   About 23,000 other penguins, which had been coated by oil, are
being cared for by volunteers and the Southern African National
Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds in rehabilitation
centers in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
   But authorities were not able to capture all the penguins soiled
or threatened by the spill, and there has been no estimate on how
many birds were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The local media, meanwhile, have turned Peter, along with two
other tracked penguins, Percy and Pamela, into celebrities, and
thousands have followed their progress via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Percy, who lives on Dassen Island about 40 miles northwest of
Cape Town and was released July 5, was expected home within a day
or two. Pamela, who was released July 3, was taking her time
getting back, swimming only about 25 miles a day.
</P>
<P>
   African penguins, which are listed as vulnerable to extinction,
are found only off the coast of southern Africa. The population is
estimated at between 150,000 and 180,000 -- 10 percent of what it
was thought to be 100 years ago, according to the World Wildlife
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Dassen Island, where an estimated 55,000 birds lived, holds the
world's largest colony of African penguins. The third-largest
colony is on Robben Island, a nature reserve and museum that used
to serve as a prison for apartheid-era political prisoners,
including former President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists want to weigh Peter and check his condition after his
19-day swim, which began June 30, while television crews and
photographers are scrambling for pictures of him after his odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   ''Welcome home Pete, wherever you might be,'' read a headline on
the front page of Tuesday's Cape Times newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of tagged penguins taken from Dassen Island to Port
Elizabeth had begun arriving home, some of them taking as little as
11 days to complete the trip using their natural homing instinct,
Underhill said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, more than 8,000 of the captured, soiled birds have
been washed, and the first batch of 300 were released Tuesday in
Port Elizabeth, said Simon Pope of the International Fund for
Animal Welfare, which has flown in international bird experts to
help cope with the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 400 captured birds had died, Pope said.
</P>
<P>
   Bird experts are hailing the rehabilitation project as one of
the most successful ever undertaken.
</P>
<P>
   The Panamanian tanker the Treasure was carrying 1,300 tons of
oil when it sank. About 205 tons of the oil remaining in the wreck
have been pumped into other vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Bill Dernier of the South African Maritime Authority
said while salvage operations had been halted by bad weather it
seemed as if no more heavy bunker oil was trapped in its tanks.

<HEADLINE> Haiti Risks Aid for Election Result  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Defying threats of an international
aid cutoff, Haiti's leaders are sticking with disputed election
results that could give former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide a
stranglehold on power for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   After more than a week there are no results from the second
round of voting -- but Aristide's Lavalas Party seems firmly in
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Hotly disputed first-round results gave Lavalas the Senate and
local posts key to wielding and perpetuating power, and the second
will almost certainly give it the lower house of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Since Aristide truly is popular, many ask why Lavalas would
bother to cheat.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lavalas would have won, even if it had played fair,'' said
taxi driver Marc Descollines, 32. ''But it wanted to wipe out the
opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   It is widely considered inevitable that Aristide, whom many see
as a savior, will win back the presidency in voting later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   That has helped his party. Hungry and hopeless while their
politicians bickered and enriched themselves, Haitians tired of
government gridlock; many voted for Lavalas -- which didn't control
the outgoing Parliament but has the presidency and the real strings
of power -- to ensure lawmakers and local leaders could work with
the president.
</P>
<P>
   But opposition leaders say Lavalas wanted more. They say they
were intimidated during the campaign, robbed of a proper
poll-watcher presence, and denied victories in fraudulent counting
of the May 21 first round.
</P>
<P>
   They fear the goal is not only single-party rule but a one-party
state.
</P>
<P>
   That would make a mockery of the 1994 U.S.-led invasion to
restore Aristide -- the first freely elected Haitian ruler, deposed
in an army coup three years before -- and the multibillion-dollar
international aid effort that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Some $500 million is currently frozen, awaiting a legitimate
government -- a situation oddly reminiscent of the international
sanctions during military rule that left Haiti in utter ruin.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union, the United States and Canada -- Haiti's
biggest donors -- all threatened last week to further withhold aid
if there are no new elections for Senate seats improperly awarded
to Lavalas.
</P>
<P>
   Haitian law requires an absolute majority to win -- but officials
counted ballots cast for only the top four contenders,
unapologetically skewing percentages for Aristide candidates who,
while front-runners, would have faced a second round.
</P>
<P>
   Electoral council chairman Leon Manus, who fled to the United
States last month fearing for his life, said Lavalas won five seats
in the 27-seat Senate, and not 16 of the 17 contested seats as
announced. Manus also cited the ''active role played by some
elements of the police in certain fraudulent acts: theft of ballot
boxes and falsification of tally sheets.''
</P>
<P>
   Haitian authorities ignored international pleas for new
elections and went ahead with July 9 runoffs that opposition
parties boycotted. Less than 10 percent of voters turned out --
compared to 55 percent in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition points to first-round results giving Lavalas 80
percent of city halls and a majority of urban and rural councils --
bodies that appoint judges and shape the electoral council that
will organize voting for the next nine years.
</P>
<P>
   ''In one fell swoop, Aristide has won decisive power over future
elections and control of the judicial system,'' said Myrlande
Manigat, a professor of constitutional law who was an opposition
Senate candidate. ''What is at stake is control of Haitian
institutions for at least a decade.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also fears Lavalas might eliminate the clause in
Haiti's constitution forbidding consecutive terms -- restoring a
tradition of one-man rule through lifetime presidencies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Aristide for life!'' supporters yelled at a rally last week.

<HEADLINE> NRC to begin hearing on spent fuel storage  </HEADLINE>
dsnldrh
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) - With no solution in sight to the need
for a nuclear fuel dump, Northeast Utilities is asking federal
regulators to increase the capacity of the Millstone Three spent
fuel rod pool.
</P>
<P>
   The Atomic Safety and Licensing Board is reviewing Northeast
Utilities' plans and the concerns of area residents and
anti-nuclear activists during at least two days of hearings this
week.
</P>
<P>
   A public hearing was scheduled for Tuesday night. A formal
hearing before the board was scheduled for Wednesday, continuing
Thursday if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Northeast Utilities says the spent fuel rod pool is designed to
hold many more used rods than its license allows. The company is
asking to increase the number of fuel rods permitted in the pool.
</P>
<P>
   The system looks like a 40-foot-deep, L-shaped swimming pool.
The fuel rods are stored in bundles called assemblies, which are
held on racks submerged at the bottom of the pool.
</P>
<P>
   Water laced with boron is circulated around the pool to keep the
fuel cool and prevent a nuclear reaction.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has attracted attention on both sides of Long Island
Sound near the Waterford nuclear complex. Anti-Millstone groups
from Connecticut and New York have been given permission to
participate in the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the Millstone Three pool contains about 450
assemblies. The plant is licensed to store up to 756 assemblies. NU
wants to store up to 1,800 but says the pool is big enough to
safely accommodate 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Company spokesman Joe Pillittere said the storage plan is safe
and has been analyzed from many angles as required by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ''To put this in terms a homeowner would understand, we're not
talking about adding a new room to our house. We're just finishing
the basement,'' Pillittere said.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear plant operators need to store spent fuel on site because
the federal government has not yet come up with a permanent storage
place.
</P>
<P>
   Some anti-nuclear activists believe it would be safer to store
the fuel in secure concrete vaults, since the water storage system
could fail if pumps broke or water leaks out.
</P>
<P>
   Others oppose any expansion of the fuel storage capacity at all,
hoping that the plant will have to shut down if there is no place
to store the waste.

<HEADLINE> 'Survivor' Thrives in TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Maybe NBC should force major league baseball's
all-stars to dine on rats or live together in the same house for a
couple of months.
</P>
<P>
   Anything to stem the loss of viewers. In a week when the CBS
series ''Survivor'' continued on its ratings roll, baseball's
annual All-Star Game had the fewest number of households tuned in
since 1969, Nielsen Media Research said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 14.7 million people watched the American League's
victory last week, an audience barely more than half of what the
game routinely drew in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   It couldn't even nudge NBC out of third place in last week's
ratings race, although the network narrowly won among the 18-49 age
demographic it covets.
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor'' was again the week's most-watched program, with an
estimated 24.5 million people watching the Pagong and Tagi tribes
merge into the Rattana tribe.
</P>
<P>
   ''Big Brother'' routinely draws a much smaller audience. But in
one positive development for CBS, the reality show beat a rerun of
''Friends'' on Thursday as the houseguests nominated two of their
own for banishment.
</P>
<P>
   Summer TV viewership took its traditional dive. The top four
broadcasters had an average prime-time viewership of 34 million
last week, compared to the 45 million they draw on a typical week.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, with the help of three new ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' editions, won the week with an average viewership of
9.6 million (6.6 rating, 12 share). CBS had 9.2 million viewers
(6.5, 12) and NBC had 9 million viewers (6.3, 12). Fox had 6.2
million viewers (4.0, 7)
</P>
<P>
   UPN led the smaller networks with 3.1 million viewers (2.1
rating, 4 share), the WB had 2.4 million viewers (1.8, 3) and Pax
TV had 1.3 million (1,0, 2). The premiere of the WB's summer
series, ''Young Americans'' was the network's second most-watched
show.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ''Nightly News'' dominated the evening news ratings race
with 9.5 million viewers (7.1 rating, 16 share). ABC's ''World News
Tonight'' had 8.6 million viewers (6.7, 15), while the ''CBS
Evening News'' had 7.5 million viewers (5.8, 13).
</P>
<P>
   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
   For the week of July 10-16, the top 10 shows, their networks and
ratings were:
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor,'' CBS, 15.0; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
(Thursday), ABC, 14.7; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Tuesday),
ABC, 14.1; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Sunday), ABC, 13.7;
''20/20 Downtown,'' ABC, 10.2; ''Major League Baseball All-Star
Game,'' NBC, 10.1; ''The Practice,'' ABC, 9.5; ''Law and Order,''
NBC, 9.1; ''Everybody Loves Raymond,'' CBS, 8.8; ''Judging Amy''
special, CBS, 8.4.

<HEADLINE> Hearing for suspect in 1975 rapes scheduled for Friday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OSWEGO, N.Y. (AP) - Gary Burns eluded prosecution for raping two
Oswego County teen-age girls in 1975, and all these years later
he'll try to avoid the witness stand again.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer representing Burns, 60, who now lives in Canon City,
Colo., goes to court Friday to have the case against his client
dismissed, arguing that Burns never received a speedy trial.
</P>
<P>
   Burns eluded prosecution by leaving the state in 1976 after
being indicted on two counts of first-degree rape, a felony, said
Chief Assistant District Attorney Donald Dodd. Although authorities
in Texas picked him up on a warrant shortly afterward, Burns
challenged his extradition and a Texas judge let him go, Dodd said.
</P>
<P>
   Burns has been out of sight since then, local authorities said.
Until January, when a state police investigator tracked him down
again and brought him back to answer the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Burns' lawyer, Jim Nicholson, paints a different picture. He
said Burns was arrested three other times in Texas since the judge
set him free and questions whether authorities tried hard enough to
find Burns over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson filed a motion in June to dismiss the case. Nicholson
and Dodd are scheduled to argue the motion Friday in front of
Oswego County Court Judge Walter Hafner.
</P>
<P>
   Burns is accused of committing two rapes in July and November
1975. When he was indicted, Burns fled to Texas, Dodd said.
Authorities there caught him on a warrant based on the indictments.
</P>
<P>
   Burns spent three months in jail during the extradition process,
Nicholson said.
</P>
<P>
   Burns contested the warrant and placed the burden on the
authorities to justify his detention and extradition, Dodd and
Nicholson said. A judge threw out the extradition papers as
defective, Nicholson said.
</P>
<P>
   Burns thought that was the end of his case in New York,
Nicholson said. It wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   In early January, state police Investigator Lee Pavlot plugged
Burns' name into the same database to which the U.S. marshals
subscribe and came up with possible leads to Burns' whereabouts in
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Pavlot is with the state police violent felony warrant squad,
responsible for tracking down people charged with such crimes as
rape or murder, he said. He had recently begun using the marshal's
database, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, the process wasn't quite so simple, Pavlot said.
</P>
<P>
   The warrant squad, formed in 1979, gets a weekly printout of all
outstanding warrants in its jurisdiction, and Burns has been on
that list for about 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Without access to the marshal's database, investigators would
periodically plug the fugitives' names into a national crime
information database. All that would show is whether a warrant was
still valid, Pavlot said.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the catch: When someone is arrested, police across the
country are supposed to check the database for an outstanding
warrant. If there is one, police are supposed to notify the
previous police agency, he said. If that doesn't happen, the
original police agency is left in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Burns was arrested three times in Texas after the judge first
set him free in 1976, and even went to jail once, Nicholson said.
</P>
<P>
   But the information apparently never was passed on to Oswego
County. Dodd said he was not aware of those arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Pavlot followed up on the initial lead from the marshal's
database and found an address for Burns in Canon City, in central
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   A marshal and two Canon City police detectives knocked on the
door and arrested Burns without a struggle on Jan. 19, said Chief
Deputy Larry Homenick of the U.S. marshals office.
</P>
<P>
   Two Oswego County sheriff's investigators brought Burns back to
New York in April, Sheriff Reuel Todd said. Burns has been in the
Oswego County jail since, held without bail.

<HEADLINE> Spitzer gets a little help from his family  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer's
campaign committee raised $851,874 during the first six months of
this year, including $200,000 from his mother and father, records
showed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Spitzer's filing with the state Board of Elections
showed he had $767,878 on hand as of the end of June for his
expected re-election race in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The filing also showed his father, New York City real estate
developer Bernard Spitzer, gave his son's campaign committee
$100,000 while his mother, Anne Spitzer, also kicked in $100,000
earlier this year. Spitzer's brother, Dr. David Spitzer,
contributed $6,000 to his brother's campaign committee.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer unsuccessful run for attorney general in 1994 and his
winning run in 1998 were financed in large part by loans from his
father and bank loans taken out against Spitzer's real estate
holdings. Spitzer spent more than $10 million on his 1998 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The latest campaign filing shows Spitzer ''will run in 2002 with
a solid financial base,'' spokesman Darren Dopp said.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's list of contributors for the first six months of this
year runs to 57 pages.

<HEADLINE> Judge weighs whether Cayugas deserve interest on jury award  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - According to real estate notebooks from
the late 1700s, the land around Cayuga Lake was classified as of
particular high value, an anthropologist testified Tuesday at the
trial that will determine whether the Cayuga Indian Nation gets
interest on its $37 million land claim award.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Peter Whiteley, an expert in America's indigenous
societies from Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, N.Y., said
that New York state got a real deal when it purchased land from the
Cayugas, who by the early 1800s were basically landless.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Cayugas had no other means of economic support'' (at that
time),'' Whiteley said. ''New York State paid $4,800 for land
valued at least three times that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Whiteley, the first witness called as the Cayugas attempt to
convince U.S. District Judge Neal McCurn to increase their land
claim award, also said that in the mid-1800s the New York state
Legislature approved measures saying that the Cayugas should be
compensated for the differences between the purchase price and sale
of their land. In both instances, funds were never provided, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Whiteley, who is being paid $120 an hour by the Cayugas for
research and testimony in the case, also testified that a special
investigator recommended to top state officials to pay $247,609 to
the Cayugas a century ago and that both sides agreed. However, the
governor did not, and a later report from the state attorney
general's office advised against settling for that figure.
</P>
<P>
   McCurn will hear from as many as 13 witnesses as he decides
whether to increase the Cayuga's award. The trial, which began
Monday, is expected to last at least four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A jury in February awarded the Cayugas $36.9 million in damages
for the loss of 64,027 acres of ancestral homelands in Cayuga and
Seneca counties.
</P>
<P>
   McCurn ruled in 1994 that New York illegally acquired the land
in 1795 and 1807 by purchasing it from the Cayugas without the
federal government's required approval.

<HEADLINE> French Troops Battle Angry Serbs  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Angry over the arrest of a
Serb militant for allegedly attacking ethnic Albanians, thousands
of Serbs blocked roads Tuesday into their part of this Kosovo city
and staged mass rallies to demand the suspect's release.
</P>
<P>
   French soldiers backed by six armored personnel carriers blocked
the main bridge over the Ibar River, which divides the Serb and
ethnic Albanian community, refusing to allow even U.N. employees to
cross.
</P>
<P>
   Serb leaders warned of more violence if the suspect, one of a
group of tough Serb men who guard the north side of the bridge, was
not released. A Serb delegation was to meet U.N. officials
Wednesday to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. spokesman Mike Keats said the trouble started after the
suspect, Dalibor Vukovic, was arrested Monday evening on charges of
setting fire to Albanian cars June 9.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of angry Serbs laid siege to the main U.N. police
station in the Serb area, pelting it with stones until French
peacekeepers fired tear gas and stun grenades to disperse them.
</P>
<P>
   French officials said four Serbs and two U.N. policemen were
injured in the Monday night clash. Serb media put the figure at
nine Serbs injured, including a 15-year-old boy who suffered a
gunshot wound.
</P>
<P>
   An unidentified U.N. policeman was seized by the crowd Monday
night but later released after a local Serb leader intervened on
his behalf, U.N. police said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest provoked a strong public reaction here in the largest
Serb community remaining in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred Serbs -- men, women and children -- massed Tuesday
afternoon in front of the police station, and speakers claimed the
detention was another example of U.N. and NATO favoritism toward
the ethnic Albanian majority.
</P>
<P>
   ''The international bad guys are provoking us,'' a member of the
Serb National Council, Dr. Milan Ivanovic, told the crowd. ''We
cannot stand idly by and see the Clintons and the Albrights do
whatever they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbs in the crowd said that unless Vukovic was freed Tuesday,
they would attack U.N. and NATO targets here in Kosovo's most
ethnically tense city.
</P>
<P>
   But the United Nations refused to release Vukovic. After hours
of meetings between Serb leaders and U.N. officials, Serbs later in
the day barricaded all roads leading into their part of the city
with trucks and tractors.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 of them staged another rally Tuesday evening, with
leaders vowing daily protests.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the last 10 months, during clashes around bridges, we had
more than 100 people injured and not a single Albanian is jailed,''
Serb leader Oliver Ivanovic told The Associated Press.
''Fifty-three Serbs were killed or abducted and not a single
Albanian is in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the south bank of the river, dozens of U.N.
employees who live and work on the Serb side milled about, stranded
by the bridge closure. The United Nations moved reinforcements --
special Pakistani riot police -- into the Albanian side in case
unrest on the Serb side got out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   As the sun set, Polish infantry in full combat gear were seen
taking positions on the Albanian-controlled south bank, presumably
to prevent extremists from that ethnic community from exploiting
tension by firing weapons across the river.
</P>
<P>
   The unrest happened while NATO Secretary-General Lord Robertson
and ambassadors of the NATO-member states were visiting Kosovo for
a firsthand look at the situation here, more than a year after the
beginning of the NATO peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson told reporters that he had come with a warning to both
Serbs and ethnic Albanians that they must do more to halt the
ethnic violence, which he called a cancer threatening the
province's future despite the presence of peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are determined that we will finish the job that we set out
to do and that means by protecting all of the people, not simply
one group,'' Robertson told reporters in Pristina. ''Both of these
leaderships have a heavy, heavy responsibility to move on from the
bloodshed of the past and present to something decent and honorable
for the future.''

<HEADLINE> Niagara Falls Council split on plan for truck lane on bridge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y. (AP) - A resolution that seeks more
information on a plan to add a dedicated truck crossing at the
Whirlpool Bridge has been narrowly approved.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the resolution - passed by the Niagara Falls City
Council - called it anti-bridge and said the truck bridge proposal
is an opportunity for potential jobs and economic development in
the city's distressed North End.
</P>
<P>
   But the four Council members supporting it said the resolution
doesn't support or oppose the concept, just makes it clear the
Council has concerns it wants the Niagara Falls Bridge Commission
to address when it makes another presentation to the Council on
Sept. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Charles A. Walker, one of the initial sponsors of the
resolution, said he would like the Council to decide by then if it
will support or oppose the bridge commission plan.
</P>
<P>
   According to opponents a truck crossing could create jobs and
economic development because of the amenities it would require. But
according to others the resolution was premature because many of
the details are not known yet.
</P>
<P>
   The four sponsoring Council members said that is part of their
problem with the plan. Councilman John G. Accardo said an
appearance by Allen Gandell, general manager of the bridge
commission, two weeks ago left him with more questions than
answers.
</P>
<P>
   He and Walker also said the Council had not received any
information until they sponsored a resolution opposing the plan,
which they withdrew after Gandell's appearance and redrafted for
Monday's meeting.

   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Peruvian air force fighter jets shot down a
small plane suspected of narcotics running in the central Amazon
near the border with Brazil, authorities said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The jets downed the plane with machine gun fire Monday over
dense jungle about 370 miles northeast of Lima after its pilot
failed to respond to radio messages and ignored warning shots, the
air force said.
</P>
<P>
   Police were searching for the wreckage. The fate of the plane's
occupants was not known.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, President Alberto Fujimori adopted tough
anti-narcotics policies to eliminate Peru's infamous title as the
world's largest producer of coca, the raw material used to make
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   The measures included shooting down some 25 drug planes en route
from camps in Peru's Amazon to Colombian cocaine refineries.
</P>
<P>
   The air force said Tuesday that the last time a suspected plane
was shot down was in 1997.

   But that doesn't mean the network is throwing good taste or its
popular shows to the wind, NBC executives Scott Sassa and Garth
Ancier told the Television Critics Association on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to abandon what I think is the hallmark of our
network, quality dramas and sitcoms, but we can't ignore this
(reality trend) as something that may go away a year from now or
two years from now,'' Sassa said.
</P>
<P>
   NBC, home of top-rated shows including ''ER'' and ''Friends,''
is discussing a deal for the woman-in-chains show. As with many
other reality concepts, it originated in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a relationship show. ... It's a pretty fun show. It adds
a little diversity and spice to your schedule,'' said Ancier.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything can't be 'West Wing,''' he said of the White House
drama.
</P>
<P>
   Shows like CBS' ''Survivor'' and ''Big Brother'' are pushing
TV's envelope of acceptability, the executives said, and the limits
have to be determined on a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
   Sassa, NBC's West Coast president, reportedly has faced sharp
criticism from his bosses for missing the reality TV bandwagon
carrying ABC (''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'') and CBS to ratings
success.
</P>
<P>
   ''We weren't as aggressive as we should have been in this
area,'' Sassa admitted. He's assembled a team to develop reality
programs, especially for the summer rerun season.
</P>
<P>
   The reality genre, Sassa said, appears to be more than a fad.
Other networks are pursuing more such shows, including ABC's
planned ''The Chase'' and ''The Mole.''
</P>
<P>
   In other announcements, NBC said it is planning ''In His Life:
The John Lennon Story,'' a two-hour movie on the late
singer-songwriter set to air this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The network also is beefing up the casts of a number of its fall
series. Among those coming aboard new shows are Bebe Neuwirth, Tom
Conti, Lili Taylor and Hope Davis on ''Deadline'' and Tim Meadows
and William Devane on ''The Michael Richards Show.''
</P>
<P>
   The ''Michael Richards'' additions are part of a reworking of
the series, which the network was dissatisfied with, said Ancier,
NBC's entertainment president.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment hits three-decade low in New Jersey  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - State unemployment dropped to 3.4 percent
in June, the lowest since Richard Nixon was president and Jimi
Hendrix was living, breathing and playing guitar.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Labor Commissioner Mark Boyd called it a spectacular
sign of a spectacular economy, not so much for the one-month mark,
which is based on surveys with a certain error margin, but for the
fact that for five out of the last six months, unemployment in New
Jersey was below 4 percent and trending downward from there.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are tracking it, and we are amazed. This is fantastic
economy, and there are so many opportunities,'' Boyd said, noting
that when job vacancies are taken into account, there are probably
more openings than there are people looking for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said this low rate signifies virtually full
employment in the state. May unemployment was 3.8 percent, and the
June rate was the lowest record since the 3.3 percent unemployment
mark set in March 1970. The state's record low is 3.2 percent set
in January 1970.
</P>
<P>
   June also marked the 33rd straight month that the state's
unemployment rate has remained under 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is sort of a Mark McGwire economy. This is the equivalent
of getting 70 home runs,'' said Rutgers University economist James
Hughes. ''As we are in this 3 percent range, it doesn't get any
better than this, at least from the perspective of a job seeker.''
</P>
<P>
   The June mark was well below the national unemployment rate of 4
percent and marked the largest one-month drop since the state's
unemployment rate slipped below 4 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
   But the ever-diligent economist can find a dark spot to this
bright picture.
</P>
<P>
   The tightness of the labor market and the duration of this
tightness set off the warning that New Jersey employers may soon
begin to find it so difficult to fill high-technology, high-skill
jobs, they will begin toning down their ambitions to expand.
</P>
<P>
   ''What has happened with this shortage of labor is that it is
now impacting economic output,'' Hughes said. ''It is what would be
expected after 97 months of economic expansion in New Jersey: After
97 months, were have essentially run out of labor.''
</P>
<P>
   David Rosen, an economic forecaster with the nonpartisan Office
of Legislative Services, said when unemployment hits the bottom
extreme, it creates a risk of inflation because employers may start
artificially increasing the wages they offer to an ever smaller
pool of applicants.
</P>
<P>
   ''The other fear traditionally has been that when unemployment
gets this low, that it fuels inflation because then you get salary
competition,'' Rosen said. ''(But) we haven't yet seen any strong
evidence of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said if Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan saw
unemployment rates like this across the United States, he probably
would become terrified of an upward jolt in inflation and would
immediately boost interest rates a full percentage point to throw
ice on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Greenspan has been using quarter-point increases in
the interest rate to keep the heat in check.
</P>
<P>
   But Hughes added low unemployment could not have this sort of
inflation effect in a single state or region since many New Jersey
salaries are covered by national sales of such products as
prescription drugs and over-the-counter health supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd would not have his enthusiasm doused, noting the
consistency of the good employment news in all corners of the
state. ''I have an unemployment rate that is falling all across the
state. It is falling in urban centers. It is falling all across
South Jersey,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey employers had 3.931 million people on their payrolls
in June, which is actually down 3,500 positions since May, a drop
largely attributed to layoffs by the Census Bureau as it scales
back its temporary field workers. Manufacturing also fell by about
1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Among more permanent jobs, construction increased by 700,
wholesale trade by 500 and retail trade by 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   But the unemployment rate is not measured by jobs. It is
measured by polls asking people if they are working or looking for
work, then comparing those numbers and adjusting the results to
project the trend for the entire state.

<HEADLINE> New York spraying to kill African virus that causes encephalitis  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - An African encephalitis virus that killed seven
New Yorkers last year has returned, some borne by Asian mosquitoes
believed to have arrived in shipments of used tires.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time this year, the West Nile virus was detected
in dozens of mosquitoes and birds from Long Island, to New York
City, to suburban Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   A human infection ''would be the next step we would expect to
see,'' said Barbara Reynolds, a spokeswoman for the federal Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce that possibility, health officials on Tuesday were
mobilizing trucks to spray insecticides.
</P>
<P>
   ''But the big message we're trying to get out is, people should
use common sense and take preventive action: Wear long shirts and
pants, and use mosquito repellant containing DEET,'' said spokesman
John Signor of the state Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   In Suffolk County on Long Island, health officials took
aggressive measures including spraying. On Tuesday, trucks were
ready to roll in the towns of Lindenhurst and West Babylon from 7
p.m. to 10:30 p.m., according to county health officials, who also
are distributing free repellant.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm afraid of being infected,'' said Robert DiPalo, a
22-year-old employee of the Stuff-A-Bagel bakery in Lindenhurst.
''I'm putting on repellant and just basically making sure there's
no water collecting near the house.''
</P>
<P>
   When he sees a mosquito, ''I kill it immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   One bug got through a few days ago. The day after, DiPalo said,
''I was sweating, I was very cold and I had no idea what it was.''
It was a false alarm, probably just ''a normal bug,'' said DiPalo,
who called spraying ''a good thing - as long as we don't get
infected.''
</P>
<P>
   The town of Huntington went high-tech with its war on infected
bugs: At the central water treatment plant, a ''mosquito magnet''
was set up that attracts mosquitoes with a plume of warm carbon
dioxide, then sucks them to their death.
</P>
<P>
   Fire Island, a popular Suffolk beach resort, was to be sprayed
on Tuesday from 5:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. in the Point O'Woods area.
</P>
<P>
   And the New York City borough of Staten Island was braced for
spraying, beginning at 10 p.m. Wednesday to 5 a.m. Thursday in the
Rossville and Westerleigh neighborhoods. Two infected crows were
found dead there earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The next night, Westchester County joins in, spraying the
insecticide in the communities closest to where infected birds and
mosquitoes have been found: New Rochelle, Eastchester, Tuckahoe,
Bronxville, Mamaroneck and Scarsdale in the south and North Castle,
Mount Pleasant, New Castle, Pleasantville, Mount Kisco, Pound
Ridge, Lewisboro and Bedford in the north.
</P>
<P>
   New Castle includes Chappaqua, where President and Hillary
Rodham Clinton have a home.
</P>
<P>
   People and pets are advised to stay indoors during spraying.
</P>
<P>
   The West Nile virus first appeared in the Western Hemisphere
last summer, killing seven people in the New York area and
infecting 62 others. The outbreak prompted a massive campaign of
aerial and ground spraying.
</P>
<P>
   If a mosquito transfers the virus to human blood, the bite can
cause encephalitis, a swelling of the brain that is sometimes
fatal. Early symptoms include a stiff neck and a fever.
</P>
<P>
   The virus that appeared in New York last year apparently
survived the winter, in hibernating insects.
</P>
<P>
   This time, state health officials were ready with a huge
preventive effort: They have tested 700 birds, 55,000 mosquitoes
and 200 humans so far.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, State Health Commissioner Antonia Novello announced
that the virus had been found in mosquitoes collected in early July
in Westchester and Suffolk counties.
</P>
<P>
   In the Westchester hamlet of Armonk, it was detected in the
Aedes japonicus, a type of mosquito that feeds on blood round the
clock. Last year, the virus was found only in the common house
mosquito, Culex pipiens, which is active from dusk to dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Aedes japonicus, native to Japan and Korea, is believed to have
arrived in the Northeast in recent years, traveling in shipments of
used tires, said Signor. Water collects in tires, providing a good
breeding site.
</P>
<P>
   In Army tests, japonicus was found to be even better at
spreading the West Nile strain than Culex pipiens.
</P>
<P>
   In Armonk, a pool of 10 of the Asian mosquitoes, destroyed and
tested as a lump, came out positive for West Nile, Signor said. At
about the same time, the virus was found in a pool of 26 Culex
pipiens mosquitoes collected in the Suffolk town of Babylon.
</P>
<P>
   In the past month, 19 birds tested positive in all of New York
state, including 11 in Rockland County, three in Suffolk, three in
Westchester and the two on Staten Island. They included 14 American
crows, three bluejays and two redtailed hawks.
</P>
<P>
   Birds, like humans, get the virus from mosquitoes.

<HEADLINE> Study: Stress Tests Unnecessary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Stress tests are unnecessary for most people age
75 and up who want to exercise, a Yale University analysis says.
</P>
<P>
   Stress tests, in which patients walk on a treadmill while
doctors use imaging techniques to examine the effect on the heart,
are often recommended to detect heart disease in people who want to
start exercising.
</P>
<P>
   But testing is costly. Also, older people often have abnormal
electrocardiogram readings that reduce the accuracy of treadmill
tests but are no reason to rule out exercise, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, regular exercise such as slow jogging or heavy
gardening would only negligibly increase the risk of a heart
attack, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, based on a review of several previous studies,
appear in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
The analysis was led by Dr. Thomas M. Gill of Yale's medical
school.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that many elderly people could benefit from
exercising regularly, but too few of them actually do, researchers
said.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said that older people who want to exercise
should consult their doctors to rule out conditions that might make
working out dangerous, such as high blood pressure, heart failure
and recent heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Climbing or cycling exercises in the doctor's office are better
ways to determine fitness than a stress test, the researchers said.

<HEADLINE> New law aimed at saving abandoned babies  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HILL
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Mothers who abandon their newborns in
hospitals or other safe havens will be protected from prosecution
under a measure signed into law Tuesday by Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   The new law is aimed at reducing incidents of babies left to die
in places like trash bins, woods and bathroom stalls. Parents who
desert their newborns are now shielded from facing child
abandonment charges, provided the baby is unharmed and left in a
safe place.
</P>
<P>
   ''This new law will help save lives by giving often young,
desperate mothers an opportunity to place their child in a safe
place,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, parents will not be prosecuted if they deliver an
unabused baby not more than five days old to a safe location and
promptly notify someone. Local law enforcement officials have
latitude in deciding whether the baby was left in a safe haven.
</P>
<P>
   The law went into effect Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some district attorneys in New York have already been holding
off on pursuing child abandonment charges in certain cases.
Rensselaer County District Attorney Ken Bruno, speaking at Pataki's
bill signing ceremony, described it as a lifesaving policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would much rather save the life of a newborn baby than
prosecute a mother for murder,'' said Bruno, whose father - Senate
Majority Leader Joseph Bruno - also spoke at the bill-signing
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Bruno cited gruesome cases of a baby being suffocated in a
toilet bowl and another left to die in the woods, but speakers at
the state Capitol ceremony could not quantify how widespread the
problem was. Federal statistics show that of the 105 known
abandoned babies in 1998, 33 were found dead. That's up from 1991,
when 65 babies were left in public places and eight died.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen other states have similar laws and many more have
abandonment bills on the table. But New York's law is unique in
allowing local prosecutors to determine what a safe have is, said
state Sen. Nancy Larraine Hoffmann, a prime sponsor of the New York
bill. Hoffmann said other states' laws specifically list the sorts
of places infants may be left.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffmann, a Republican from Onondaga County, said new mothers
who because of their age or distraught mental state are inclined to
abandon babies in trash bins might get newborns into safe hands if
they knew they would not be prosecuted as criminals.

<HEADLINE> Report: Romania PM To Run for Pres.  </HEADLINE>
By ALISON MUTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Romania's prime minister reportedly
told a colleague Tuesday that he will seek the presidency, entering
a contest that could determine whether the country moves toward
greater democracy or the communist-style leadership of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Reports that reform-minded Prime Minister Mugur Isarescu will
campaign for Romania's top job came after President Emil
Constantinescu announced Monday that he would not seek another
term.
</P>
<P>
   Though polls showed his chances of re-election were slim,
Constantinescu's surprise statement left politicians here
scrambling to figure out how to capitalize on his withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Isarescu, who previously said he wanted to return as governor of
the National Bank after November elections, apparently revealed his
change of plan Tuesday, national radio reported.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said nothing about it Tuesday and party officials
said he would not announce officially for another month.
</P>
<P>
   Ion Diaconescu, the chairman of the Peasant Party and head of
the Chamber of Deputies, said Isarescu would run for president,
national radio reported.
</P>
<P>
   Isarescu's entry into the race could change the complexion of
the contest, transforming it into a vote for choosing between the
economic hardship of free-market reform or retaining the safety net
of the communist-era system.
</P>
<P>
   The average monthly salary is less than $100 and inflation is
expected to be nearly 30 percent this year. Foreign investors
complain of corruption, bureaucracy and shifting legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Romania's center-right parties, who are faring poorly in opinion
polls ahead of November elections, hope that Isarescu can attract
voters. A former central bank governor, Isarescu is respected by
Western officials for his efforts to reform Romania's public
administration and to help Romania's institutionalized children.
</P>
<P>
   He will likely face two key former communist leaders, Ion
Iliescu and Teodor Melescanu, who have both criticized efforts to
dismantle the inefficient government.
</P>
<P>
   Iliescu, 69, a top communist official educated in Moscow, took
over during the 1989 anti-communist revolt and was elected
president twice in 1990 and 1992, before losing to Constantinescu
in 1996. Iliescu's party relies on his popularity as a
father-figure among rural voters and older people, and the party
has no obvious candidate to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some members of his own party think it is time for him to
step aside in favor of a younger candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Melescanu was a high-ranking diplomat before 1989 and was
Iliescu's foreign minister before leaving to form his own party.

<HEADLINE> Ground spraying ordered for half of county  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - Officials reluctantly ordered a double
dose of insecticide on Tuesday for about half of Westchester County
after mosquitoes infected with the West Nile virus were found in a
trap in Armonk.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a very difficult decision for me personally, and
certainly in a county like Westchester that is so environmentally
conscious,'' said County Executive Andrew Spano. ''But we have made
that decision. We feel we have been given enough warning.''
</P>
<P>
   So beginning at 11:30 p.m. Thursday, a contractor's tanker
trucks will wind through 1,500 miles of streets and highways,
spreading a mist of the insecticide sumethrin, or Anvil, through
communities near where infected birds or mosquitoes have been
found.
</P>
<P>
   The affected towns are New Rochelle, Eastchester, Tuckahoe,
Bronxville, Mamaroneck and Scarsdale in the south and North Castle,
Mount Pleasant, New Castle, Pleasantville, Mount Kisco, Pound
Ridge, Lewisboro and Bedford in the north.
</P>
<P>
   New Castle includes Chappaqua, where President and Hillary
Rodham Clinton have a home.
</P>
<P>
   The same areas will be resprayed - ''a booster shot,'' Spano
called it - after the weekend. Spano said there are no plans now
for aerial spraying, which was undertaken last year when the virus
first appeared. The county then undertook an aggressive campaign to
kill mosquito larvae and eliminate breeding grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Westchester's spraying, which will cost $195,000, will follow
similar applications in Suffolk County, the other area where
infected mosquitoes have been found, and Staten Island in New York
City, where infected crows were found.
</P>
<P>
   Spano said West Nile's high mortality rate - he pegged it at 12
percent - was another reason to spray, whereas Lyme disease or
ehrlichiosis, which are spread by ticks and are also summertime
scourges, have much lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our first priority is human health,'' said County Health
Commissioner Joshua Lipsman, ''and for that reason we are going
ahead with the ground spraying.''

<HEADLINE> World Bank To Resume Aid to Kenya  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE MWANGI
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- The World Bank will resume aid to Kenya
after a three-year suspension with a $150 million loan to reduce
poverty and help achieve reforms, a bank official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kenya, which is suffering its worst economic crisis since
independence from Britain in 1963, with severe drought and
nationwide power and water shortages, depends on multilateral
lending institutions and grants from donors for development
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis is so severe that Kenya will have to import almost
half of its corn over the next 18 months because of a worsening
drought in the drought-stricken Horn of Africa, a U.N. food agency
recently announced.
</P>
<P>
   The bank, along with the International Monetary Fund, suspended
aid to the East African country in 1997 demanding it end corruption
and speed up the privatization of state corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's board agreed to the new loan in June and it is in the
process of finalizing the administrative details of the package,
the official, who did not want to be named, told The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   He said the loan would be announced officially in August.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Mamphela Ramphele, a World Bank director, told
reporters the release of the money was a ''matter of negotiations
between bureaucrats at the bank and bureaucrats in the Kenyan
government.''
</P>
<P>
   The drought is particularly serious for farming households,
whose economies have collapsed and livestock died.
</P>
<P>
   Kenya will have to import at least 1.4 million tons of corn, its
staple food, the Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization said
in its announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The FAO also said there were conflicts over scarce water and
children in some areas were dying of starvation.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 percent of Kenya's food is grown during the rainy
season, which normally lasts from March to May. But the FAO said it
hasn't rained for months in most of the country,including the Rift
Valley Province, Kenya's breadbasket, and the usually
self-sufficient Central Province.
</P>
<P>
   In order to meet donor demands, President Daniel arap Moi has
initiated a series of reforms during the last 12 months that
include paring down the bloated civil service.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, Moi appointed renowned paleontologist Richard Leakey,
a third-generation white Kenyan, to push through the reforms as
head of the civil service.

<HEADLINE> Train-Whistle Plan Criticized  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER LOVEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thousands of families in Rita Mullins'
bustling Chicago suburb would get blasted with train horns about 70
times a day under a government plan requiring trains to sound their
whistles at all crossings lacking state-of-the-art safety devices.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will effectively destroy everything the state of Illinois
has fought so hard to achieve,'' the mayor of Palatine, Ill., told
a House Transportation panel Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A long line of witnesses, including House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, echoed her plea that was aimed less at the largely
sympathetic congressional panel than at the Federal Railroad
Administration, which made the proposal as it attempted to meet a
1994 congressional mandate.
</P>
<P>
   An FRA analysis concluded crossings with conventional gates but
no whistles have 62 percent more accidents than those where horns
are blown. But the agency has been inundated with complaints since
announcing its plan earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Those testifying warned that if the regulation is adopted as
proposed, the quality of life would be ruined for residents near
the 2,058 railroad crossings around the country where tooting
trains are now banned. About a third of those crossings are in the
Chicago area. Wisconsin, Minnesota, Indiana and Virginia also have
large numbers of crossings where train horns are not alllowed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The impact to my constituents and the people of Illinois
cannot be underestimated,'' said Hastert, who represents a suburban
Chicago district crisscrossed by railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert and Rep. Bill Lipinski, D-Ill., have proposed an
alternative to the FRA that would exempt all intersections that
have been accident-free for five years and those with conventional
gates and lights that have had fewer than three accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Their plan also would extend from two years to 10 years the
deadline for communities to upgrade crossings before the horns must
start to blow. It also would count as an acceptable upgrade
lower-cost, less-intrusive methods such as automated horns blown
only at the crossing.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are modifications to the proposed rule that must be made
if we are going to be able to accept this,'' Lipinski said.
</P>
<P>
   John Wells, an FRA deputy administration, stressed that the
regulation would look much different when finalized. He suggested
one acceptable option -- not now included -- might be a combination
of conventional gates and flashing lights with aggressive
enforcement and public awareness.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, the current proposal already contains
significant flexibility that could minimize the changes needed.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those testifying said the FRA proposal could lessen
safety rather than increase it.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Mathias, chairman of the Illinois Commerce Commission,
said it would divert limited funds to already safe crossings in
whistle-ban communities and away from improving crossings in rural
areas that often have little more than a sign.
</P>
<P>
   Mathias noted Illinois has seen a 79 percent drop in crossing
accidents in two decades while traffic has increased 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Illinois' program is working, it is successful, it is saving
lives, and it is achieving all of this without the sounding of the
horns,'' testified Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.

<HEADLINE> Coaster accident's family files negligence suit  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   OCEAN CITY, N.J. (AP) - A man whose wife and daughter were
killed in a roller coaster accident last summer filed suit Tuesday
against the amusement park's owners, saying the accident should not
have happened.
</P>
<P>
   John J. Bailey Jr., of Pomona, N.Y., who lost his wife Kimberly,
39, and 8-year-old daughter Jessica, says the park's owners knew
the Wild Wonder was defective but failed to close it down before
the Aug. 28, 1999, accident.
</P>
<P>
   The family is seeking $275 million for Bailey and his 5-year-old
daughter, who tried to accompany her mother and sister but couldn't
because she didn't meet the height requirement for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   She watched the accident happen, according to the suit.
</P>
<P>
   It names ride manufacturer Zamperla Inc., of Parsippany,
Gillian's Wonderland Pier of Ocean City, Air Tech Systems, of
Barnegat, and Point Machine Shop, a Somers Point machine shop that
fabricated replacement parts for the coaster after earlier
malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not going to replace the wife and daughter he lost,''
said Bailey's lawyer, Michael Grossman. ''If we can't settle it for
something fair and just, we're going to go to trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The Baileys died after the car they were riding in slipped on a
35-foot incline that started the ride. The car plummeted backward
and rounded a 90-degree turn, ejecting both. They were thrown
against a steel support structure.
</P>
<P>
   A probe by state safety investigators blamed the accident on a
faulty replacement brake and an improperly fastened restraining bar
inside the car.
</P>
<P>
   It said an anti-rollback device on the ride, which has sharp
steel teeth designed to bite into the rails and prevent slipping,
was made from steel much weaker than what was called for by the
ride's maker and was badly worn.
</P>
<P>
   The park's owners had replaced the original anti-rollback device
on Aug. 17, installing a new one made by Point Machine Shop,
according to the state, which fined Gillian's $25,000 and Zamperla
$30,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''The defendants knew or should have known that the Wild
Wonder's anti-rollback device and other component parts were made
with inferior materials and were not reasonably fit for their
intended purpose,'' according to the 14-page complaint filed
Tuesday in Superior Court for Morris County, in Morristown.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was lodged there because Zamperla is based in
Parsippany, Grossman said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses to the accident told state investigators that the
ride, which was brand new when it opened July 1, malfunctioned less
than two hours before the Baileys' accident, injuring two riders.
</P>
<P>
   Gillian's officials could not be reached for comment on the suit
Tuesday. Jay Gillian, general manager of the park, did not return
two telephone messages. The park's lawyer, Lary Zucker, was not in
his office Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A Zamperla spokeswoman said company officials had not seen the
lawsuit yet.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not seen the document or been served the papers. Until
we do, we don't believe we can comment intelligently,'' said
Deborah Israel, director of public relations.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who answered the telephone at Point Machine Shop
referred calls to lawyer Andrew Siegeltuch, who was out of his
office Tuesday and could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Air Tech Systems, which is based in Barnegat, installed the
ride, according to the suit. Officials there could not be reached
Tuesday; there was no telephone listing for Air Tech.
</P>
<P>
   No dollar figure was cited in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   But in a notice of claim filed last November, Bailey said he
would seek $100 million for each victim, $50 million for ''loss of
services'' for his wife and $25 million for loss of services for
his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman said Bailey, 40, a firefighter in Scarsdale, N.Y., was
shattered by the loss of his wife and daughter and is in
counseling, as is Kathryn Bailey, now 6.
</P>
<P>
   She suffered ''severe and permanent emotional distress, mental
anguish and suffering'' seeing her mother and sister die, the suit
said.
</P>
<P>
   A worker on the Wild Wonder who saw the earlier malfunction told
the victims of it that the ride would be closed, according to
Grossman.
</P>
<P>
   ''He (Bailey) feels that if they'd done what they'd said they
would do, his wife and daughter would be here today. And he's not
wrong,'' Grossman said.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton proposes expanding Children's Health Insurance Program </HEADLINE>
By KAREN MATTHEWS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton said Tuesday that if
elected to the Senate she would work to expand a federal health
insurance program for children to include families earning up to
three times the poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States is, to our shame, the only industrialized
nation that does not extend health care coverage to its people,
even to its children,'' Clinton said in a speech at New York
Presbyterian Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Health Insurance Program, passed in 1997,
provides health insurance to children in working poor families that
do not qualify for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   The program provides coverage to children in families that earn
up to twice the federal poverty level, or $34,000 for a family of
four. Clinton said that under her plan children in families earning
up to three times the poverty level, or $51,000 for a family of
four, would qualify.
</P>
<P>
   ''That will enable us to cover the vast majority, if not
completely, all the families that are caught between Medicaid and
affordable insurance either from an employer or that they pay for
on their own,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As she has in the past, Clinton said that her failed attempt at
a national health insurance plan taught her that the best way to
implement change was incrementally.
</P>
<P>
   ''I decided at the end of 1994 to just get back to work,'' she
said. ''And I took with me in that work the lessons that I learned
from that experience. And one of the biggest lessons that I took
away from it is that in our political system the most effective way
to get things done is to work step by step, making the changes that
are needed toward achieving the same larger goal.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to expanding the existing federal insurance program
to include more children, Clinton said she favored expanding it to
include parents and other adults.
</P>
<P>
   She said she would propose a ''carrot-and-stick approach'' of
financial incentives to reward states that succeed in enrolling
children who are eligible for Medicaid and the Children's Health
Insurance Program and penalize those that do not.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said her plan would provide access to health insurance
to at least 1.1 million New Yorkers including 700,000 children. She
did not say how much the proposals would cost but said,
''Everything I've proposed would be part of a balanced budget.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Cal Col, the campaign manager for her Republican
opponent in the Senate race, Rep. Rick Lazio, said in a news
release that Clinton ''is now keeping secrets about the financing
of her health care scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   Dal Col alluded to Clinton's ''disastrous 1993 plan to socialize
the nation's health care system'' and asked, ''If Mrs. Clinton was
wrong on health care then, how can New Yorkers trust that she's not
wrong on health care now?''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady spoke as controversy continued over an allegation
that she uttered an anti-Semitic slur 26 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not take questions, but her spokesman Howard Wolfson
said, ''I think this dust-up will pass, I think people will see
this for the garbage that it is, and they'll know that Hillary
Clinton is a strong advocate of a safe and secure Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, three Jewish members of Congress from New York
sent a letter to Lazio scolding him and his campaign for using ''a
false allegation of anti-Semitism for political gain.'' Lazio has
expressed doubts about the first lady's denial, calling the
statement ''disturbing''
</P>
<P>
   ''Your political use of this ridiculous allegation will only
hurt our efforts to combat true anti-Semitism,'' said the letter
signed by Reps. Nita Lowey, Jerrold Nadler and Anthony Weiner.

<HEADLINE> Kids call President Clinton world's most important person  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MAHWAH, N.J. (AP) - Impeached by Congress, embarrassed by his
affair with a 25-year-old intern, President Clinton still reigns
supreme among American children.
</P>
<P>
   He beat out Pope John Paul II, Microsoft founder Bill Gates,
astronaut John Glenn and retired NBA star Michael Jordan in a
survey that asked children to name the world's most important
person.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, conducted by the World Almanac for Kids, offered
readers aged 6 to 14 the chance to win prizes by naming their picks
and explaining why they chose them. It was contained on the last
page of the 2000 edition of the book.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, the choice of 30 percent of the respondents, was cited
because of his peacekeeping negotiations, his improvements to
education and because he is ''the ruler of a free world.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope, who got 20.6 percent, helps make the world a better
place, the children said. Neither poor health nor an assassination
attempt could stop him, one said. ''That is a sign of a truly
inspirational person,'' the child said.
</P>
<P>
   ''My Mom'' got 20.4 percent, ''My Dad,'' 15.8 percent, and Gates
15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Others receiving votes: civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks,
astronaut Neil Armstrong, ''Harry Potter'' author J.K. Rowling,
slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., first lady
Hillary Clinton, talk show host Rosie O'Donnell and soccer star Mia
Hamm, who beat out God by a slight margin.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mix of names on the list of most important people chosen
by these kids is just fascinating,'' said Ken Park, the almanac's
publisher. ''Almost one-third of the respondents chose President
Clinton. We wonder how many more there might have been had there
been no scandals last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank McGuire, 10, of Orlando, Fla., won top prize - an
expense-paid trip to Washington, D.C. - for his entry, which named
Bill Gates, Nelson Mandela and Chinese president Jiang Zemin. The
entry was designed like a newspaper page and listed each of his
choices' contributions to society.

	   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - John Grasso is no stranger to instant
riches. As a slot machine supervisor at Harrah's Atlantic City, he
gets to deliver them all the time.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the 43-year-old Hammonton man is in the money himself.
</P>
<P>
   Grasso won $1 million from iWon.com, an Internet portal that
gives away $10,000 daily, $1 million once a month and $10 million
once a year to users.
</P>
<P>
   ''Usually, I pay out jackpots. It's nice to be on the other
side,'' said Grasso, a 20-year employee of the casino.
</P>
<P>
   He said he plans to keep working, but will use the money - about
$40,000 a year for 20 years, before taxes - to finance his sons'
education, pay off his debts and take a nice vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Through the years, I have watched so many people win enormous
amounts of money. But I'm always the one who gives the money away.
And now it's me, the winner. I'm still in shock,'' Grasso said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Officials say virus likely to reappear in Connecticut  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - It is just a matter of time before
mosquitoes carrying a deadly virus reappear in Connecticut, state
environmental officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 100 birds and 38,000 mosquitoes tested so far this year in
Connecticut have all tested negative for the West Nile-like and the
Eastern Equine strains of the encephalitis virus. For the week of
July 18, 13,042 mosquitoes were tested from 46 sites statewide.
</P>
<P>
   But the West Nile-like virus has been found recently in
mosquitos and birds in New York's Westchester County, Suffolk
County and Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Andreadis, chief entomologist for the Connecticut
Agricultural Experiment Station, said the virus is not likely to
recognize state border lines.
</P>
<P>
   ''I fully anticipate that with what is going on in the region,
that we are probably going to detect it soon,'' Andreadis said.
''The virus is re-emerging in multiple areas, and it could
re-emerge just about anywhere in lower Fairfield or New Haven
County where we had evidence of virus last year.''
</P>
<P>
   The West Nile virus first appeared in the Western Hemisphere
last summer, killing seven people in the New York area and
infecting 62 others.
</P>
<P>
   If a mosquito transfers the virus to human blood, the bite can
cause encephalitis, a swelling of the brain that is sometimes
fatal. Early symptoms include a stiff neck and a fever.
</P>
<P>
   The virus was found in birds and mosquitoes in Connecticut, but
not in humans.
</P>
<P>
   It apparently survived the winter, in hibernating insects.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the virus was found only in the common house
mosquito, Culex pipiens, which is active from dusk to dawn. But
this year it has been found in Aedes japonicus, a type of mosquito
that feeds on blood around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Aedes japonicus, native to Japan and Korea, is believed to have
arrived in the Northeast in recent years, traveling in shipments of
used tires, said Signor. Water collects in tires, providing a good
breeding site.
</P>
<P>
   In Army tests, japonicus was found to be even better at
spreading the West Nile strain than Culex pipiens.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance of the virus in New York has prompted officials
there to intensify insecticide spraying. In Connecticut, the
Department of Environmental Protection has provided larvicide to 41
shoreline communities.
</P>
<P>
   But state DEP Commissioner Arthur Rocque Jr. said spraying is
not likely to prevent the virus from appearing here.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea that we're going to wipe all these evil mosquitoes
off the face of Connecticut's map is just erroneous,'' he said.
''It is not going to happen.''

<HEADLINE> Police: Driver killed in boat crash was legally drunk  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   OCEAN CITY, N.J. (AP) - The driver of a speedboat involved in a
fatal crash last month was legally drunk when it happened, State
Police said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Toxicology tests conducted on the body of Dominick Laspata, 26,
of Westville, showed he had blood alcohol content above the 0.10
percent legal limit for drivers, according to Sgt. Al Della Fave.
</P>
<P>
   Della Fave said he was not permitted to release the exact BAC

<P>
   Laspata and three passengers in his 26-foot Sonic died June 11
when a cabin cruiser broadsided the boat in Peck's Bay, along the
Intracoastal Waterway.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the 30-foot cabin cruiser, John Lego, 52, of
Lansdale, Pa., has been issued summonses for failing to avoid a
collision. His toxicology tests came back clean: He had no alcohol
or drugs in his system, State Police said.
</P>
<P>
   No criminal charges have been filed in the accident. Laspata's
blood-alcohol reading will be considered by Cape May County
Prosecutor David Blaker as he decides whether to charge Lego,
according to Della Fave.
</P>
<P>
   Blaker said no determination has been made about whether to
charge Lego. Asked if Laspata's blood-alcohol content would
mitigate in favor of Lego, he said: ''I can't answer that question.
We have to review the whole file. It would be premature for me to
speculate.''
</P>
<P>
   Lego had hosted a graduation party for a group of North Penn
High School students the day of the accident. He was giving eight
of them a sightseeing ride when the accident occurred.
</P>
<P>
   According to State Police, the cabin cruiser was headed south
and attempting to maneuver to the left when it slammed into the
left side of the speedboat, which was heading north.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't clear whether the operators saw one another.
</P>
<P>
   Lego and all eight of his passengers were thrown overboard on
impact, but none were injured seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Laspata and his cousin, John ''Mickey'' Flynn, 42, of
Sicklerville died at the scene. The bodies of Jean Greenwood, 30,
and James G. Fisler, 25, both of Sewell, were recovered three days
later.
</P>
<P>
   Lego could not be reached for comment on Laspata's toxicology
findings Tuesday. His telphone number in Lansdale, Pa., is
unlisted, and no one answered the door at his bayfront condominium
in Ocean City.

<HEADLINE> Clinton accuser has colorful past  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - He can no longer practice law because someone
paid him to alter a court document.
</P>
<P>
   He suffered a brain disorder that led to memory loss and an
addiction to phenobarbitol.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote a letter to Hillary Rodham Clinton begging her
forgiveness for saying things about her ''without factual
foundation.'' And he holds a divinity degree from a Baptist
theological school.
</P>
<P>
   He is Paul Fray, the man who's accusing Clinton of calling him a
''Jew b------'' during an argument in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   The accusation - contained in a new book, ''State of A Union:
Inside the Complex Marriage of Bill and Hillary Clinton'' by Jerry
Oppenheimer - has rocked Clinton's New York Senate campaign and
become fodder for Web sites, newspaper headlines and cable TV news
shows.
</P>
<P>
   While other accusations - some sleazy, some unprovable - have
sometimes been ignored by the Clintons and unreported by the
mainstream press, this one spurred the first lady to action.
</P>
<P>
   She unequivocally denied the allegation during an emotional
press conference in the garden of her Westchester home. The
president phoned a New York Daily News managing editor and called
the accusation ''crap.''
</P>
<P>
   Fray did not return several calls placed for comment. But he
told the Fox News Channel Tuesday that he'd like a ''face-to-face''
meeting with the first lady ''and we'll get everything resolved and
this matter will go away. ... I don't want to adversely affect her
race. I do not want to get me into a position where I said this to
create problems for her.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ''I'm the victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Fray claims that Hillary Clinton made the comment in
Fayetteville, Ark., on the night that Bill Clinton lost a
Congressional election. Fray had worked on the campaign. He and his
wife, Mary Lee, went inside a room with Bill Clinton and his
then-girlfriend, Hillary Rodham, and an argument ensued. The fight
has been described in a half-dozen Clinton biographies, but
Oppenheimer's is the first to include Fray's assertion that Hillary
Clinton used an anti-Semitic slur.
</P>
<P>
   Fray holds a Master of Divinity degree from Southwest Baptist
Theological School in Fort Worth. But he told Oppenheimer that his
father was Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Another campaign aide, Neil McDonald, told Oppenheimer he heard
the comment while standing outside the door. Efforts to reach
McDonald on Tuesday were not successful.
</P>
<P>
   Fray has a colorful past. On Oct. 6, 1980, the state Supreme
Court of Arkansas accepted the surrender of his law license.
Individuals typically voluntarily submit to such a procedure in
lieu of having their licenses revoked by the state.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1984, Fray applied to have his license reinstated. In
denying the application, the court's Committee on Professional
Conduct wrote that Fray was altered a court document to erase a
drunken driving conviction for a client and ''stated that he did
not recall accepting $500 for the serious impropriety.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee also wrote that Fray later suffered a cerebral
hemorrhage which led to seizures, addiction to prescription pain
killer, erratic behavior and memory loss.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not satisfied that he possesses the good moral
character necessary for a law license,'' the committee wrote. ''The
alteration of the court record occurred before he suffered the
cerebral hemorrhage. The act demonstrates a basic lack of
integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   One committee member dissented, attributing Fray's behavior to a
medical condition.
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer said Tuesday he was ''completely 100 percent
satisfied that the Frays and Neil McDonald are telling the truth.''
Oppenheimer has worked for The National Enquirer, the Philadelphia
Daily News, the Washington Star and United Press International. He
says he is a liberal who voted for Clinton in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Sheehy, author of ''Hillary's Choice,'' said when she
interviewed the Frays, Mary Lee Fray mentioned the anti-Semitic
comment. Sheehy decided not to include it in her book because Paul
Fray ''skirted the issue. That's why I didn't use it. I realized
that even he didn't back it up.'' She added that she found the
Frays ''only moderately reliable. They were kind of flaky.''
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer dismissed the loss of Fray's legal license as
irrelevant. ''That's what the Arkansas Bar is now considering about
Bill Clinton too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Arkansas Supreme Court is considering whether to revoke the
president's law license on the grounds that he gave misleading
testimony regarding the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who didn't have a lot of nice things to
say about Hillary Clinton when he was running for Senate against
her before dropping out of the race, spoke up for her Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''What she did say or didn't say 26 years ago, I can't imagine
it has any relevance today,'' he said. ''I'm willing to accept her
at her word.''

<HEADLINE> Boy Scouts Charter Repeal Urged  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some Democratic lawmakers who support gay
rights want Congress to repeal an 84-year-old honorary charter of
the Boy Scouts because the organization has a policy against gays.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lynn Woolsey, D-Calif., said the Boy Scouts of America
claims to be open to all boys but, in a recent Supreme Court case,
scouting officials defended the organization's right to exclude
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not saying they're bad,'' Woolsey said Tuesday. ''We're
saying intolerance is bad, and I don't see any reason why the
federal government should be supporting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey planned to introduce legislation on Wednesday to repeal
the federal charter of the Boy Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   A charter from Congress is an honorary recognition given to
patriotic, charitable and education organizations. About 90 groups
have them. The Boy Scouts got its charter in 1916, six years after
it was founded.
</P>
<P>
   The charter is open-ended and does not need periodic votes to
reauthorize it. But it contains a clause noting that Congress has
the right to repeal or amend it at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Though the charter confers no tangible benefits, Woolsey said it
''gives the impression that an organization has a congressional
seal of approval.''
</P>
<P>
   Boy Scouts spokesman Gregg Shields said the organization is one
of many recognized by Congress as ''patriotic societies'' that
limit membership to certain people, such as Jewish War Veterans
U.S.A.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're honored to have such a charter,'' Shields said, ''but we
also ask other Americans to recognize our rights to freedom of
association as described by the Constitution and upheld by the
Supreme Court.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, ruled June 28 that
the Boy Scouts can bar homosexuals from serving as troop leaders.
The ruling may also permit the 6.2-million-member organization to
reject gay boys as members.
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey is a former Girl Scout, and her grown son is a former
Boy Scout. One of her constituents is Steven Cozza of Petaluma,
Calif., a 15-year-old Eagle Scout who founded a group called
''Scouting for All'' that advocates the elimination of the
prohibition on gays scouts.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 64; Nasdaq Drops 98  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE MEYERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks led the market lower Tuesday
as investors locked in some gains from that group's rebound despite
some strong profit reports by major companies and a mostly tame
reading on inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 64.35 to close at
10,739.92 after falling as much as 101 points during the session.
</P>
<P>
   Among broader market indicators, the technology-dominated Nasdaq
composite index fell 97.50 to 4,177.17, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
fell 16.75 to 1,493.74, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller
companies fell 8.90 to 536.28.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're getting some profit-taking in the market and that's
about it,'' said Richard A. Dickson, technical analyst at Scott &AMP;
Stringfellow Inc. in Richmond, Va. ''The Nasdaq gained 5.5 percent
last week. The Dow was up every day last week and off just 8 points
yesterday. So the market is just acting a little tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about a 3-to-2 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market. NYSE
composite volume came to 1.105 billion shares, almost even with
Monday's tally.
</P>
<P>
   Before the start of trading, the Labor Department reported that
consumer inflation jumped 0.6 percent in June, chiefly reflecting
surging gasoline prices and a record rise in the cost of natural
gas, but most other prices posted modest increases. Analysts had
expected the report to show a 0.5 percent increase in the Consumer
Price Index.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates six times over
the past 13 months to slow economic growth and keep inflation in
check. With recent reports suggesting that the Fed's rate increases
are working, some economists believe the central bank will leave
rates unchanged at its meeting Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch, General Motors and Johnson &AMP; Johnson led the
early parade of second-quarter profit reports with
better-than-expected results. However, the day's most anxiously
awaited reports weren't released until after the close, when both
Intel and Microsoft topped Wall Street forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the strong showing, shares of Merrill Lynch fell $3.75
to $128.25, while GM rose 43.8 cents to $60.813 and J&AMP;J rose 64.1
cents to $95.
</P>
<P>
   Intel fell $3.313 to $143 in Nasdaq trading before its report,
making it the Dow's biggest decliner, but then recovered to $144.25
in extended trading on other markets. Microsoft struggled higher in
advance of its report, rising 31.2 cents to $78.50, and then
advanced to $79.938 in extended trading.
</P>
<P>
   Among other leading names, Honeywell slipped 18.8 cents to
$36.875 and Philip Morris rose 56.3 cents to $24.063 after both
companies matched Wall Street profit forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Unisys tumbled nearly 18 percent, or $2.516 to $11.609, after
the struggling computer systems company posted disappointing
results. The stock continued lower to $11.25 in late trading.
</P>
<P>
   Health insurance stocks fell sharply after Aetna issued a
warning that its second-quarter results would come in well below
analysts' expectations. Shares of Aetna fell $6.937 to $59.688, a
loss of more than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.98 percent,
Germany's DAX index fell 0.32 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell
1.15 percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 1.58 percent.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks that were moving substantially or trading
heavily Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock
Market.
</P>
<P>
NYSE
</P>
<P>
   Aetna, down $6.937 to $59.688
</P>
<P>
   The insurer warned that second-quarter earnings may be well
below Wall Street expectations due to rising medical costs at its
health maintenance organizations. Aetna said HMO costs were between
10 percent and 12 percent higher compared with year-ago levels,
mostly from rising use of services such as emergency and outpatient
care.
</P>
<P>
   Unisys, down $2.516 to $11.609
</P>
<P>
   The computer system maker's second-quarter earnings declined to
$56.3 million, less than half of what it was for the same period a
year ago, and below Wall Street's already deflated expectations.
Unisys, which warned of weak business in June, blamed the shortfall
on the deferral of several large technology contracts, continued
weakness in its federal and financial services businesses and
unfavorable foreign exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch, down $3.75 to $128.25
</P>
<P>
   Second-quarter earnings at the brokerage rose 34 percent to $902
million, helped by strong underwriting revenue. The results beat
analyst expectations by a wide margin.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors, up 43.8 cents to $60.813
</P>
<P>
   Second-quarter earnings at the automaker rose 1 percent to $1.75
billion, topping Wall Street forecasts, with a variety of higher
costs in its automotive business offsetting growing revenues.

<P>
   Intel's shares pulled back sharply in advance of its
second-quarter profit report, which came out after the close of
trading and topped most Wall Street forecasts. Microsoft's shares
struggled higher before its quarterly report, which also exceeded
projections. Both stocks rose afterwards in extended trading on
other markets.
</P>
<P>
   Copper Mountain, down $29.5 to $94.188

   The maker of digital subscriber line systems posted
better-than-expected second-quarter results after Monday's close,
but failed to meet the more optimistic forecasts circulating among
investors before the report.

   A House bill that would have banned gambling on the Internet was
voted down late Monday afternoon by an unusual coalition of

<HEADLINE> Tests Making Blood Supply Safer  </HEADLINE>
By ERIN McCLAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- New genetic tests have made the nation's blood
supply safer, allowing donation banks to detect viral infections
sooner and keep them from slipping into transfusions, scientists
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Busch of Blood Centers of the Pacific said nucleic
acid testing, which can detect tiny amounts of viruses like HIV and
hepatitis C even before the body recognizes them, has stopped a
significant number of infections.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional testing has depended on antibodies that the immune
system develops to fight the virus, but those reactions can take up
to 80 days.
</P>
<P>
   Nucleic acid testing, or NAT, has cut that window down to less
than 20 days, Busch reported Tuesday at the International
Conference on Emerging Infectious Diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Busch said the American Red Cross used NAT to screen 7.7 million
blood donations from March 1999, when the procedure was introduced,
through last month. He said the testing found one HIV infection and
25 hepatitis C infections -- each of which could have been passed to
up to three patients by transfusion.
</P>
<P>
   Other blood banks used the process to screen about 9 million
donations, finding three HIV infections and more than 35 hepatitis
C infections, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration is strongly encouraging blood
banks to use genetic testing and hospitals to exclusively use
NAT-screened blood.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists hope NAT will eliminate the few cases of HIV annually
caused by donated blood and prevent most annual cases of hepatitis
C transmission through blood.

<HEADLINE> Virus Strikes State Dept. Computers  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- State Department computer equipment being used
in the Mideast peace talks to route, send and receive e-mail was
struck by a virus over the weekend, clogging computers with junk
messages.
</P>
<P>
   Unclassified computers used by the State Department's public
diplomacy section were affected by the virus, taking hold during
the weekend. The virus, called Stages, sent itself out to
journalists and other people in the contact lists of infected State
Department users.
</P>
<P>
   The Stages virus doesn't destroy any files, but multiplies
itself endlessly and can make infected companies shut down their
mail distribution servers. A State Department spokeswoman had no
specific information regarding the effects of this infection.
</P>
<P>
   Interscan, an antivirus program made by Cupertino, Calif.-based
Trend Micro that was designed to stop such attacks, went down
sometime during the weekend, said State Department spokeswoman
Julie Reside.
</P>
<P>
   The breakdown allowed the infection to travel through the
Internet gateway and affect the servers. The department's other
classified and unclassified servers were not affected, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Reside said that State technicians cleaned up the infection on
Monday, though iDefense, a security company in Alexandria, Va., has
received a report that the infection continued into Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Schrader, chief security analyst at Trend Micro, said
company officials had not received details of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   iDefense Manager of Intelligence Production Ben Venzke said
having redundant protection systems is important.
</P>
<P>
   ''As this demonstrates, if just one program goes down for a
brief period, it doesn't take much to bring about some damaging and
costly consequences,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the Stages virus caused four Fortune 100 companies to
shut down their e-mail systems.
</P>
<P>
   Security experts believe a virus writer calling himself ''Zulu''
created Stages, which looks like a harmless text file when it's
actually a dangerous program. Zulu, who is believed to be based in
Argentina, has created several other viruses in the past, Schrader
said.

<HEADLINE> Whitman, Menendez are top picks of NJ convention delegates  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - New Jersey convention delegates are playing
favorite son - and favorite daughter - when it comes to the search
for vice presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman is the No. 1 choice for the No. 2 spot
among Republican delegates from New Jersey, while Rep. Bob Menendez
is the preferred pick of Democrats, according to an Associated
Press survey of the state's convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine of the state's 54 GOP delegates offered their
thoughts on vice president, and more than half of them - 16 - named
Whitman as their top pick.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, the top choice among Republicans
nationally, was a distant second to Whitman in New Jersey,
collecting five votes.
</P>
<P>
   Menendez, D-Union City, was mentioned by 18 of the 82 Democratic
delegates who offered their thoughts on the vice presidential slot.
He trailed only ''undecided,'' which got 42 votes.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's an outstanding congressman, and he's right on the
issues,'' said Julio Mendez of Vineland, Democratic chairman in
Cumberland County, a delegate who named Menendez as his top pick
for vice president. ''His Hispanic-Latino background will help
bring in tremendous amounts of support in a lot of the key
states.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind Menendez, with six votes, was former New Jersey Sen. Bill
Bradley, who unsuccessfully challenged Al Gore for the Democratic
nomination and has made clear he is not interested in being No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   The top pick among Democrats nationally, Indiana Gov. Evan Bayh,
got only two votes from Garden State delegates. That's one vote
less than another favorite son, New Jersey Sen. Robert Torricelli,
who rarely makes any speculative vice presidential ''short list''
but who has indicated an interest in running for governor next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman and Menendez did less well among delegates nationally.
Whitman ended up in sixth place among Republicans with 53 votes.
Menendez was 12th among Democrats with 20 votes, meaning he was the
pick of only two delegates outside New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley got 106 votes nationally, placing him third behind Bayh
and California Sen. Dianne Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats who got at least one vote from New Jersey
delegates are Feinstein, Housing and Urban Development Secretary
Andrew Cuomo, Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, House Minority Leader
Dick Gephardt, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, Defense Secretary
Bill Cohen, North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt and Massachusetts Sen.
John Kerry.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Whitman and Ridge, New Jersey Republican delegates gave
two votes each to Sen. John McCain of Arizona and retired Gen.
Colin Powell.
</P>
<P>
   Getting one vote each were Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, New York
Gov. George Pataki, former Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole and Ohio
Rep. John Kasich.

<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Aetna warned Tuesday that its
second-quarter earnings were likely to be well below analyst
predictions, blaming an increase in medical costs for its health
maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna's share prices fell sharply Tuesday - closing at $59.688,
down $6.93, or 10.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna's share prices also fell sharply Monday - closing at
$66.625, down $4.50, or a little more than 6 percent - amid reports
that a deal was getting close to sell its financial services and
international businesses to the Dutch company ING Group.
</P>
<P>
   In its announcement Tuesday, Aetna predicted quarterly earnings
of 85 cents to 95 cents per share. Analysts surveyed by First Call
on Monday had estimate earnings in the area of $1.20 per share. The
company is scheduled to report its earnings Aug. 4.
</P>
<P>
   The second-quarter commercial HMO cost trend was up between 10
percent and 12 percent over last year's levels, Aetna said. Most of
the increase was due to more people seeking services, including
emergency room and outpatient care, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Costs are also up in its Prudential HMO and Medicare HMO
businesses, Aetna said.
</P>
<P>
   ''While our current-period information is not complete, we
wanted to alert our shareholders to this rise in medical costs,''
said Aetna's chairman and chief executive officer, William H.
Donaldson.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are highly focused on actions we are taking to address the
underlying causes of these higher costs and to offset their impact
on our customers and on earnings going forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from administrative cost-cutting, Aetna is looking at
beefing up its ''on-site'' consultations on medical practices and
planning to demand premium increases in health plans that renew in
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said it might retool its plans to use ''tiered
co-pays,'' which it said have an effect on demand for medical
service.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal and The Hartford Courant reported last
week that ING was again the leading candidate to buy the Aetna
businesses, despite the earlier collapse of exclusive talks.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna's board was reported to be considering the deal over the
weekend. The Courant, citing analysts, said a delay in announcing
any agreement may be due to the complexity of the deal, which Aetna
wants to structure so that it minimizes the tax consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wouldn't be shocking if that can hold up a deal for three
days,'' said Ken Abramowitz of Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna and ING have refused to comment on the reports.

<HEADLINE> German Hostage Returns Home  </HEADLINE>
By JUERGEN VOGES
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- The German woman held almost three months as a
hostage in the Philippines by Muslim rebels arrived back in Germany
Tuesday to headlines heralding her release and welcoming her home.
</P>
<P>
   ''Free! Free! Finally Free!'' the mass-market Bild newspaper
trumpeted, echoing the rest of the German media.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 hours after her release, Renate Wallert, 56, stepped
off a Lufthansa jet in Frankfurt supported by her son Dirk, 30.
Clutching a bouquet and looking tired but happy, she waved quickly
to gathered onlookers.
</P>
<P>
   A helicopter quickly whisked her away to Goettingen for
examination. Doctors said Tuesday the 56-year-old woman was in good
physical health, although exhausted and traumatized. During her
captivity, she suffered from high blood pressure and anxiety and
repeatedly pleaded to be set free to seek medical help.
</P>
<P>
   Left behind as captives in the Philippines were her husband,
Walter, 57, and her 27-year-old son Marc. They were on an Easter
holiday diving vacation at a Malaysian resort when they were
captured along with 18 other hostages and taken to Jolo island.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was not good,'' Wallert said of the hostage situation
before boarding the flight from the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the ordeal, neighbors have trimmed the family's lawn
and tended their garden, keeping faith that Wallert's captives
would set her free.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said Monday that while all of
Germany was excited about Wallert's release, the government
remained equally concerned about the fate of the remaining
hostages.
</P>
<P>
   That was a sentiment shared by Wallert's neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hostage takers are nothing but pirates,'' said next-door
neighbor Herbert Gatzemeier. ''The responsible governments should
negotiate with them and money should not play a role.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Monday that no ransom was paid to secure her
release, but Schroeder was vague.
</P>
<P>
   ''What had to be done was done,'' Schroeder said. ''It really
makes no sense to spread details now.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, who stopped in the Philippines
last week to push for a resolution to the hostage crisis, declined
to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf rebels abducted the hostages from a Malaysian
diving resort on April 23.
</P>
<P>
   The hostage negotiations were suspended for more than a month
after the rebels' demands began escalating. But contacts resumed
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Demands have included government assistance for various
development projects and creation of an independent nation for the
Philippines Muslim minority.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf is the smaller of two groups fighting for a
separate Islamic state.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Troops Said Taking Sides  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL COONEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesia's military admitted Tuesday
that some of its troops have taken sides in the long-running
Christian-Muslim war in the Maluku islands.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came as a boatload of 1,500 Maluku refugees,
mostly Christians, arrived Tuesday in West Timor, and were being
looked after by the Geneva-based International Organization for
Migration said.
</P>
<P>
   It was believed to be the first time that refugees fleeing the
fighting in the Malukus had gone to West Timor, where tens of
thousands of East Timorese are still living in refugee camps
following last year's fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after television footage showed Indonesian troops
fighting alongside Muslim militants, armed forces spokesman Rear
Air Marshall Graito Usodo said some soldiers have become
emotionally involved in the religious war.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are members of Indonesia's military who act emotionally,
either because of their family names or where they come from,'' he
said. ''This is inevitable and we admit the existence of these
cases.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that it was not the armed forces' policy to favor one
side over the other in the fighting that has killed some 4,000
people since January 1999 on the group of islands 1,600 miles
northeast of Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   Two people were shot and killed by snipers in fighting in the
region's main city of Ambon on Tuesday, said Ibnu Alwan, a Muslim
leader.
</P>
<P>
   In footage shot over the weekend by Associated Press Television
News, Indonesian soldiers and an armored vehicle were seen
providing covering fire for Muslim fighters attacking a Christian
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Christian clerics in the Malukus have warned that elements of
the Indonesian army were siding with Muslim paramilitaries who have
infiltrated the region from Indonesia's main island, Java.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to halt the bloodshed, the government imposed a
state of emergency last month. But the move did little to defuse
fierce street battles over the weekend that left almost 30 people
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Usodo said the military intends to send another infantry
battalion to the region, which would boost troop numbers to more
than 11,000.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged it was difficult for the soldiers to stop
the fighting saying there are ''psychological barriers when they
(soldiers) need to take stern actions in their duties.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Indonesia's Minister for Foreign Affairs Alwi
Shihab reiterated at a parliamentary hearing that the government
will not allow an international peacekeeping force into the region.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, President Abdurrahman Wahid said some international
assistance -- such as equipment or logistical help -- may be required
to end the sectarian violence.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Jean-Philippe Chauzy said the migration organization
would be providing help for the new mostly Christian arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of them have got families in West Timor, and obviously we
will be transporting these people to their families, but others
will be transported to a variety of shelters that have been
established in West Timor. Most of them are church shelters,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 4,000 people have died in 18 months of intercommunal
violence in the Malukus. Muslims make up about 90 percent of
Indonesia's 210 million people, but Christians are in the majority
in many parts of the Malukus.

<HEADLINE> Allergies, Mothers' Periods Linked  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The development of allergies in children may be
related to the age at which their mothers started having menstrual
periods, new research suggests.
</P>
<P>
   The prevalence of allergies and asthma has increased by as much
as 80 percent in the developed world over the last decade or so,
particularly in children, and scientists can't explain most of the
increase. On average, 20 to 25 percent of people in the United
States and elsewhere in the developing world have asthma or some
other allergic disorder.
</P>
<P>
   A study published this week in the British medical journal
Thorax found that allergies were more common among people whose
mothers started menstruating early and less prevalent among those
whose mothers had their first period later, particularly after age
15. It is the first time such a link has been made.
</P>
<P>
   The younger their mothers were when they had their first period,
or menarche, the more likely the subjects were to have allergies as
adults.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Baizhuang Xu, who led the study at Imperial College, London
University, said his preliminary findings support the idea that the
female sex hormone estrogen may play a role in allergies. Puberty
is triggered in girls by an increase in estrogen and experts have
noted that girls are reaching puberty earlier these days.
</P>
<P>
   Previous studies have suggested that women with high estrogen
concentrations may be more likely to suffer allergies and that
conditions in the womb might influence the development of allergies
later in life.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay Forbes, an asthma and public health researcher at Guy's
Hospital in London, said the findings were intriguing, but warned
they were preliminary.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may be causal, it may not be. There may be some
environmental factor that is common to both allergies and early
menarche,'' she said. ''But it's one of the possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   She said if the connection turns out to be real, while nothing
can be done to change the onset of menstrual periods, other
estrogen-related influences such as hormone replacement therapy and
the contraceptive pill can be controlled.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are encouraging for further research investigating
a possible link between estrogen and allergies, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Xu noted indirect evidence suggesting the hormone might have a
role.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Fernando Martinez, director of the Respiratory Sciences
Center at the University of Arizona, said while the findings were
plausible they do not take into account the fact that first-born
children are more likely to develop asthma and allergies. The study
does not distinguish between first-born and later-born children.
</P>
<P>
   Allergies and asthma are more prevalent in young boys than
girls, but by puberty, the opposite is true.
</P>
<P>
   Women have a higher incidence of allergies than men until the
age of about 40 or 50, when menopause sets in. The prevalence of
allergies is balanced equally between men and women after that age,
except for women who are taking hormone replacement therapy, Xu
noted.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts believe the age of onset of menstrual periods could
be an indicator of a woman's estrogen levels. The earlier she
starts menstruating, the higher her estrogen levels are in
adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   Estrogen can also affect the functioning of the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Xu's study involved 5,188 people born in Finland in 1966. In
1997, at the age of 31, they were given a skin prick test to
determine whether they had allergies. Their medical records
included the time they were in the womb and showed at what age
their mothers had their first periods.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, 33 percent of the men and 28 percent of the women had
allergies. The average for the general Finnish population is about
30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 35 percent of those whose mothers started
menstruating at 12 or younger had allergies. For those whose
mothers' first period was at 13, the rate was 32.8 percent. It was
30.2 percent for children of women who reached puberty at 14 and 30
percent for those with mothers whose first period came at 15.
</P>
<P>
   Only 26.4 percent of people whose mothers started menstruating
at 16 or later had allergies.
</P>
<P>
   That means those whose mothers had their first period at 12 or
younger were 1.5 times more likely to suffer allergies than
children of women who began menstruating later.
</P>
<P>
   Xu acknowledged the association is not strong, and said research
needs to be done in other countries, and with a direct measurement
of estrogen instead of using menstrual periods as an indicator.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is possible that differences in the maternal estrogen
environment, represented by varying age at menarche, could program
the immune system of the fetus in a manner that could affect the
(allergy) status later in life,'' the study said.

<HEADLINE> Broadway producer David Merrick remembered  </HEADLINE>
By MARY CAMPBELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Broadway producer David Merrick, last of the
independent, flamboyant impresarios, was remembered Tuesday as a
showman, tyrant and publicity wizard at a memorial service at the
St. James Theater, where his ''Hello, Dolly!'' and ''42nd Street''
ran for years.
</P>
<P>
   Zack Manna, executive director of the David Merrick Arts
Foundation, said Merrick ''was the last of the great American
showmen, respected, feared, admired and hated but never ignored. He
was no saint and he worked hard making sure people understood
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrick died April 25 in London. He had been ill for some time,
having suffered a stroke in 1983 that left him severely disabled
and forced him to use a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Merrick dominated New York theater in Broadway's Golden Age
after World War II, producing more than 80 shows including
''Oliver!,'' ''Carnival,'' ''Fanny,'' ''Look Back in Anger,''
''Becket,'' ''Irma La Douce,'' ''Play It Again, Sam,'' ''A Taste of
Honey,'' ''Stop the World - I Want to Get Off,'' ''Cactus Flower,''
''Philadelphia, Here I Come,'' ''Forty Carats,'' ''I Do! I Do!''
and ''Promises, Promises.''
</P>
<P>
   About 800 people attended the memorial service. Music from his
productions played a focal part.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Barrett sang the title song from Merrick's first success,
''Fanny,'' and Melissa Brezinsky sang from an opera Merrick
produced on Broadway, Gian Carlo Menotti's ''Maria Golovin.'' Brian
Stokes Mitchell, whose first leading part on Broadway was in
Merrick's ''Oh, Kay!,'' sang from ''Dolly,'' and Karen Ziemba from
''42nd Street.'' Howard McGillin, star of ''Mack and Mabel'' in
London, sang ''I Won't Send Flowers'' from that show.
</P>
<P>
   Clive Barnes, the theater critic of the New York Post, said
Merrick liked to terrorize theater critics. Then he could believe
their bad notices were spite and their good notices were the result
of terror, he said. He added that Merrick had the courage to close
failures, like ''Breakfast at Tiffany's'' and ''Mata Hari.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Kissel of the Daily News, author of a Merrick biography,
joked that Merrick timed his death well - a few days after that of
his lifelong Broadway producer rival Alexander Cohen. Cohen's
obituary ran on a Saturday and Merrick's in better-read midweek
editions, and on page 1.
</P>
<P>
   Merrick liked playing stunts as a way of getting publicity,
Kissel said. One of his most famous involved the musical ''Subways
Are for Sleeping,'' which received tepid notices from the critics.
Undeterred, Merrick placed a newspaper ad with rave quotes from
seven men who just happened to have the same names as the critics
for New York's seven daily newspapers. The ad ran in one edition of
the New York Herald-Tribune before it was noticed - and then
yanked.
</P>
<P>
   Kissel said Merrick wanted to be known as a crude tyrant, which
he was, but he also loved theater and was a monumental figure in
American theater.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Liff, an associate producer who worked with Merrick on 45
Broadway shows between 1963 to 1973, said Merrick was a master
showman and someone who had guts and hated to lose. He loved a
fight, Liff said, citing one with Actors Equity that he knew he'd
lose, saying, ''Otherwise, where's the fun?''
</P>
<P>
   His productions won countless Tony Awards - ''Hello, Dolly!''
alone picked up 10 Tonys in 1964 - as well as other theater prizes
including the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award and London's
Olivier Award.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dolly'' was one of the producer's biggest triumphs. It was
based on Thornton Wilder's ''The Matchmaker,'' which Merrick had
produced successfully on Broadway nearly 10 years earlier with Ruth
Gordon as Dolly Levi.
</P>
<P>
   Merrick was not above bringing culture and serious drama to
Broadway either, particularly the work of British playwrights. He
imported plays by John Osborne, Tom Stoppard, Shelagh Delaney and
Joe Orton, as well as Irish author Brian Friel.

<HEADLINE> Whitman signs school construction bill  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CRANFORD, N.J. (AP) - From the poorest neighborhood to the
richest enclave, schools throughout New Jersey will be repaired and
replaced under landmark legislation signed into law Tuesday by Gov.
Christie Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   The state will borrow $8.6 billion - $6 billion for the state's
30 so-called special needs districts, $2.6 billion for all other
schools - to finance the construction project, New Jersey's largest
ever.
</P>
<P>
   The law's enactment comes more than two years after the state
was ordered by the state Supreme Court to provide full funding to
improve overcrowded and aged facilities in the 30 poor districts.
</P>
<P>
   But the legislation also provides aid to wealthier districts,
such as this Union County town where the governor staged a bill
signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Cranford, where residents enjoy a municipal pool and clay tennis
courts, was considered too wealthy to qualify for state aid under
the old funding formula. But like all school districts, it is now
eligible for a minimum 40 percent state reimbursement for any new
construction project.
</P>
<P>
   To mark the bill's impact on the poor schools, Whitman later
Tuesday traveled to Burlington City, one of the 30 poor districts,
to tour a 79-year-old school earmarked for demolition. City school
officials are eager to replace the school, where two years ago, an
auditorium ceiling fell on vacant seats occupied just hours earlier
by children attending an assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today marks the delivery of the most important promise of all:
making sure we provide safe, secure and sturdy schools for all
students,'' the governor said in Cranford. ''This bill answers the
Supreme Court mandate responsively and responsibly.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Economic Development Authority will oversee most of
the construction. It will be a huge undertaking, but the governor
gave the agency a vote of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ''The EDA has a long history of completing projects and doing
them well,'' she said. ''This is an awful lot of money to spend,
but I think we'll do a very good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said some maintenance jobs may start this school year,
but predicted that large-scale building projects will have to wait
until spring 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The governor thanked lawmakers for finally passing the bill,
despite two years of political haggling over its terms. The version
she signed Tuesday contained changes she previously suggested in an
earlier conditional veto of the original measure.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the sponsors of the bill, Whitman singled out
Senate President Donald DiFrancesco for special thanks. The bill
signing was held in his legislative district.
</P>
<P>
   DiFrancesco, who negotiated the final version of the legislation
with the governor in the last frantic weeks before summer recess,
said he was ''on pins and needles'' when the bill was before the
state Assembly for final passage last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a difficult bill to get through,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I appreciate you finally putting your pen to this
legislation,'' DiFrancesco told the governor. ''Children can now
look forward to brighter, safer and improved schools and school
boards and parents can look forward to the tax benefits,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill continues the trend of shifting the costs of public
education from the local property taxpayer to the state, the Senate
president said.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Strickland of the Garden State Coalition of Schools said
suburban taxpayers will appreciate the relief. Richer districts
previously had to shoulder a far larger share of local building
projects, she noted.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're grateful the state recognized the needs that affect our
communities and kids,'' she said. ''We are awed at the task
ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Belluscio, spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards
Association, said taxpayers in poor districts also deserve, and
will receive, tax relief under the new law.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are developments for the community that are of historic
proportion,'' agreed Burlington City School Superintendent Edward
Gola.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a fresh coat of paint, and careful attention to
maintenance, the Watts Middle School in the city is not prepared to
meet the educational challenges of the new century, Gola said. It
is not air-conditioned; the classrooms are too small and can't
accommodate high technology.
</P>
<P>
   The school would cost $11 million to replace. Under the new law,
the state will foot the entire bill.

<HEADLINE> Hearing Examines Distracted Drivers  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- You're driving and glance over as another car
passes. To your amazement, the man behind the wheel is talking on a
cellular phone -- while shaving.
</P>
<P>
   This occurred recently on Interstate 95 near Washington. It's an
egregious example of what federal authorities say is a growing
problem: drivers doing lots of things besides paying attention to
the road.
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of gadgets like cell phones and mapping
systems has exacerbated a problem that has existed since people
started driving.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are experiencing a dramatic change in driver behavior,''
said Rosalyn Millman, deputy administrator for the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration. ''If we underestimate this potential
risk to highway traffic safety and do not moderate drivers' use of
in-vehicle systems, the price may be very steep, indeed.''
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA held a public hearing Tuesday to discuss ways to curb
driver distractions. Representatives from the government, auto
industry, safety organizations, cellular phone makers and others
attended.
</P>
<P>
   The participants agreed little information is available to
determine how risky certain distractions can be and what activities
are most dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Network of Employers for Traffic Safety, which
has organized a campaign encouraging responsible use of new vehicle
technologies, distracted drivers cause at least 4,000 accidents a
day and perhaps as many as 8,000.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 study in the New England Journal of Medicine found
talking on a phone while driving quadrupled the risk of an accident
and was almost as dangerous as being drunk behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Tessmer, a NHTSA statistician, estimated 20 percent to 30
percent of fatal accidents are due to distractions, but said it's
impossible to know for sure because only a few states document
distractions in accident reports.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just because we are not collecting data on distractions
involved in fatal accidents doesn't mean they aren't there,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce White came to the meeting from Florida to tell the story
of her 21-year-old daughter, who was killed along with a friend
when their car collided with a police car driven by an officer
talking on a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   ''My daughter's death demonstrates how lethal driving and
telematics can be,'' said White, who did not disclose her hometown.
''I, for one, don't want any other mothers, sisters or friends to
go through what I've gone through.''
</P>
<P>
   Some at the meeting called for laws to prevent drivers from
using cell phones, mapping systems and other distracting gadgets
while the vehicle is in motion. But White said education is a
better way to reduce accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Several countries have banned the use of cell phones while
driving, but no states have done so. Only California, Florida and
Massachusetts have laws limiting cell phone use in moving vehicles,
according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, though
dozens of U.S. communities are considering restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's certainly a lot of driver education that needs to take
place because there is a lot of new technology coming on the
scene,'' Brian Gratch, a marketing director at Motorola Inc., which
makes cellular phones, said at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers say they are concerned but do not want NHTSA to start
regulating what can be installed in new vehicles. They are looking
at ways to make gadgets safer, such using voice-activated systems
so drivers keep their hands on the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Consumers are demanding more in-vehicle communications,'' Vann
Wilber of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers told the
hearing. ''We believe that vehicles should be designed to allow the
minimal chance for driver distractions.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   On the Net: NHTSA has set up a Web site that lets citizens log
complaints about distracted drivers. The address is

<HEADLINE> Review Clears Army Commanders  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Army review of the circumstances in which a
gay private was beaten to death by a fellow soldier at Fort
Campbell, Ky., last year has concluded that no officers should be
held responsible for the killing and that there is no general
''climate'' of homophobia at the base, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the Army's inspector general, Lt. Gen. Michael
Ackerman, found troublesome anti-gay attitudes among some members
of D Company, 2nd Battalion, 502nd Infantry Regiment of the 101st
Airborne Division -- in which the killing took place, according to
senior defense officials who have seen the report.
</P>
<P>
   But it concluded that the 101st Airborne as a whole has no
unusual degree of homophobia, the officials said. The officials
agreed to discuss the report's conclusions on condition they not be
identified.
</P>
<P>
   The report's results are expected to be made public on Friday,
along with the findings of a Defense Department advisory group that
Defense Secretary William Cohen formed last spring to draft an
''action plan'' for each of the military services to address the
problem of harassment of gays.
</P>
<P>
   The panel appointed by Cohen will recommend that service members
of all ranks receive more tailored forms of training on how to
properly implement the Clinton administration's ''don't ask, don't
tell'' policy on homosexuals, in which gay service members are
allowed to serve as long as they don't reveal their sexual
orientation, officials said. Cohen appointed the panel after the
Defense Department inspector general reported in March that
harassment based on perceived homosexuality is widespread in the
military.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, declined to comment on either
the Army report or the advisory panel's findings.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Kutteles of Kansas City, Mo., mother of the slain
soldier, 21-year-old Pfc. Barry Winchell, said in an interview that
she had not read the report, ''but we're appalled at what we're
hearing. We're very disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Her Washington lawyer, Charles Butler, said the Army has
evidence that Winchell's company commander was alerted to anti-gay
harassment before the killing but did not act.
</P>
<P>
   The Army inspector general's investigation at Fort Campbell was
requested by Maj. Gen. Robert T. Clark, who was commander of the
101st Airborne at the time. Clark has since been assigned to an
important post in the Pentagon, and the report concludes that he
should be not be held responsible for the killing last July.
</P>
<P>
   The report's conclusions are to be reviewed by Clark's
successor, Maj. Gen. Richard A. Cody.
</P>
<P>
   As first reported Monday by CBS News, the inspector general's
report says no commanders at Fort Campbell are to be faulted for
the circumstances under which Winchell was bludgeoned to death in
his barracks.
</P>
<P>
   Pvt. Calvin Glover was convicted by a military court and
sentenced to life in prison for beating Winchell to death with a
baseball bat. Winchell's roommate, Spc. Justin R. Fisher, was
sentenced to 12&AMP;frac12; years in prison for his role in the killing. At
Glover's trial, soldiers testified that Winchell has been
relentlessly taunted with anti-gay slurs in the months leading up
to his slaying.
</P>
<P>
   The incident renewed a national debate over the Clinton
administration's ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy, which critic say
does not work because it has failed to protect perceived
homosexuals from harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Benecke, co-director of the Servicemembers Legal
Defense Network -- a leading critic of the Pentagon's policy on gays
-- said Tuesday she had not seen the Army inspector general's report
but has questioned the Army's commitment to ensuring that
commanders be held accountable for anti-gay behavior on their
posts.
</P>
<P>
   Benecke said she was aware of news reports that the inspector
general found no fault with Fort Campbell's commanders.
</P>
<P>
   ''If that is true, they Army report will not have a shred of
credibility,'' she said Tuesday. Her group, which has interviewed
many soldiers at bases across the country, including Fort Campbell,
believes that harassment of soldiers perceived to be gay is a major
problem not being addressed by commanders.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clear to everyone -- except, it seems, the Army -- that
anti-gay harassment is a problem,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Benecke said her group has talked to 20 soldiers at Fort
Campbell, and they all agreed that ''anti-gay harassment and
threats are as common as the uniform.'' Many soldiers there were
unwilling to express their concerns to the Army inspector general's
office, Benecke said, out of fear they would be suspected of being
gay and therefore subjected to harassment.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers say Boy Scouts should lose honorary charter  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Some Democratic lawmakers who support gay
rights want Congress to repeal an 84-year-old honorary charter of
the Boy Scouts because the organization has a policy against gays.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lynn Woolsey, D-Calif., said the Boy Scouts of America
claims to be open to all boys, but in a recent Supreme Court case,
Scouting officials defended the organization's right to exclude
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not saying they're bad,'' Woolsey said Tuesday. ''We're
saying intolerance is bad, and I don't see any reason why the
federal government should be supporting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey planned to introduce legislation on Wednesday to repeal
the federal charter of the Boy Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   A charter from Congress is an honorary recognition given to
patriotic, charitable and education organizations. About 90 groups
have them. The Boy Scouts got its charter in 1916, six years after
the organization was founded.
</P>
<P>
   The charter is open-ended and does not need periodic votes to
reauthorize it. But it contains a clause noting that Congress has
the right to repeal or amend it at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Though the charter confers no tangible benefits, Woolsey said it
''gives the impression that an organization has a congressional
seal of approval.''
</P>
<P>
   Boy Scouts spokesman Gregg Shields said the organization is one
of many recognized by Congress as ''patriotic societies'' that
limit membership to certain people, such as Jewish War Veterans
U.S.A.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're honored to have such a charter,'' Shields said, ''but we
also ask other Americans to recognize our rights to freedom of
association as described by the Constitution and upheld by the
Supreme Court.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, ruled June 28 that
the Boy Scouts can bar homosexuals from serving as troop leaders.
The ruling may also permit the 6.2-million-member organization to
reject gay boys as members.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge to Scout policy was brought by James Dale, who was
ousted as an assistant scoutmaster in New Jersey when the
organization learned he is gay.
</P>
<P>
   Dale's attorneys pointed to the congressional charter as one of
many signs that the Boy Scouts is not entirely a private
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey is a former Girl Scout, and her grown son is a former
Boy Scout.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know the value of Scouting,'' she said. ''That's why I want
Scouting to be open and available for all children.''
</P>
<P>
   One of her constituents is Steven Cozza of Petaluma, Calif., a
15-year-old Eagle Scout who founded a group called ''Scouting for
All'' that advocates the elimination of the prohibition on gays
scouts.
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scouts has its share of supporters in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the members of Congress in 1999 had participated
in Scouting in their lifetimes, including 10 senators and 31
representatives who had been both Scouts and Scout leaders,
according to a survey by the Boy Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that seven senators and 16 representatives
were Eagle Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey scheduled a news conference Wednesday morning to discuss
her bill.

<HEADLINE> Deal Reached on Fighter Planes  </HEADLINE>
By LIB QUAID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional negotiators have paved the way
for St. Louis-built F-15E Strike Eagles to keep rolling off the
production line through 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate and House are expected in the coming days to approve
$400 million for five more of the Boeing Co. fighters. It's part of
an agreement completed Tuesday on annual defense spending
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri and Illinois lawmakers for two years have struggled to
keep alive a program that at full production employs more than
5,000 workers in St. Louis. The Air Force and the White House would
rather spend all the available money on the next-generation F-22
Raptor, which eventually will replace the F-15.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., said the measure puts his
colleagues ''on record in supporting the F-15 as the best
air-to-ground weapons system in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The set of skills and talent that go into the production of
this aircraft truly constitutes a national crown jewel that must be
protected,'' said Bond, a member of the Appropriations Committee
defense spending panel.
</P>
<P>
   He and other F-15 supporters, including House Minority Leader
Dick Gephardt of St. Louis, argue the Pentagon should keep buying
Strike Eagles because production has yet to crank up on the
Georgia- and Texas-made F-22 ''Stealth'' fighter, which is made by
Lockheed Martin Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ''This funding allows Boeing's St. Louis workers to continue
production of an aircraft that remains the backbone of our military
superiority,'' Gephardt said.

<HEADLINE> Phillies Send Down Coggin, Shrenk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Philadelphia Phillies sent right-hander
David Coggin to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre on Tuesday one day
after he beat the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Coggin allowed three earned runs in five innings for his second
major league win as Philadelphia won 10-8. He was 2-0 with a 5.33
ERA in five starts. Right-hander Steve Schrenk was also demoted.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies recalled catcher Gary Bennett from Scranton and
activated left-hander Mark Holzemer from the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, who was hitting .335 with nine homers and 40 RBIs at
Scranton, was needed as insurance after starting catcher Mike
Lieberthal sprained his left ankle Monday. Lieberthal is expected
to miss 3-4 games.
</P>
<P>
   Holzemer, out with a strained left hamstring, was activated
after making three rehab starts at Double-A Reading. He had a 2.38
ERA in 11 1-3 innings with the Phillies before getting hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Schrenk went 2-3 with a 7.33 ERA with the Phillies.

<HEADLINE> Pirates 8, Dodgers 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jason Kendall had three RBIs, including a
go-ahead two-run homer, and Wil Cordero hit a three-run shot as the
Pittsburgh Pirates snapped a season-high six-game losing streak
Tuesday with an 8-6 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Josias Manzanillo (1-0) got credit for the win after replacing
starter Todd Ritchie, who squandered a 5-0 lead he helped create
with an RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Manzanillo held the Dodgers to an infield single over 3 2-3
innings to earn his sixth major league victory and first since May
15, 1995, with the New York Mets. The right-hander struck out four,
including Gary Sheffield and Shawn Green back-to-back to end the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Judd (0-1), called up from Triple-A Albuquerque to start
because of Carlos Perez's five-game suspension, allowed seven runs,
four hits and three walks in his season debut. The right-hander
retired nine straight batters before issuing a leadoff walk to
Warren Morris in the fifth, followed by Kendall's ninth homer.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, given a second chance in the seventh when third baseman
Adrian Beltre dropped his foul pop for an error, doubled and scored
Pittsburgh's eighth run on Brian Giles' sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Pirates reliever Jason Christiansen slipped a called third
strike past pinch-hitter Mark Grudzielanek with the bases loaded to
end the seventh. Mike Williams, the sixth Pittsburgh pitcher, got
three outs for his 13th save in 15 chances.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers took a 6-5 lead in the third with two-run singles by
Green, Eric Karros and Kevin Elster against Ritchie, who allowed
six runs and nine hits over 2 1-3 innings in his shortest of 20
starts this season. The right-hander is 0-1 with an 8.35 ERA in
four starts since beating the Chicago Cubs with a three-hitter on
June 27, his first major league shutout.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching on nine days rest, except for a couple of bullpen
sessions, Judd fell behind 3-0 before retiring a batter. He walked
Morris and hit Kendall with a 2-2 pitch before surrendering
Cordero's 16th home run.
</P>
<P>
   This was the fourth time this season that Cordero has driven in
at least three runs, including a six-RBI game on July 5 at Wrigley
Field. After batting .182 in April, Cordero is hitting .326 since --
including six homers and 12 RBIs in 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates increased their margin to five runs in the second.
Ritchie, 2-for-20 at the plate in nine previous starts, doubled
inside first base to drive in Mike Benjamin from first. Ritchie
scored on a single by Kendall, who has reached base in 19
consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Dodgers manager Davey Johnson missed his third straight
game while being hospitalized for an irregular heart rhythm that is
now under control. Publicity director Julio Sarmiento read a
statement from Dr. Michael Mellman that said, ''Davey Johnson is
doing well and undergoing further tests at Centinela Hospital. He
remains in good spirits and good health.'' ... OF Bruce Aven, out
since June 30 because of a strained left hamstring, was activated
from the 15-day disabled list following a three-game rehab stint
with Triple-A Nashville. The Pirates made room for him by optioning
Chad Hermansen to Nashville. Hermansen started four games in RF
following his July 7 recall, going 3-for-14 with no RBIs. ...
Morris has four hits and three walks in 10 plate appearances,
following an 0-for-18 drought. ... Dodgers catcher Paul LoDuca also
dropped a foul popup, by Cordero in the second inning. Cordero then
struck out.

   CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago White Sox recalled pitcher Lorenzo
Barcelo from Triple-A Charlotte before Tuesday night's game against
the Milwaukee Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   Barcelo, who takes the roster spot of Cal Eldred, was 5-6 with a

disabled list Monday with a tender elbow.
</P>
<P>
   White Sox manager Jerry Manuel said Barcelo, a right-hander,

next week against Kansas City. Another rookie, Mark Buehrle, will
start in Eldred's spot Wednesday at Minnesota.

<HEADLINE> Injured Guard Gets More Eligibility  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Nebraska guard Cookie Belcher, who sat out
most of last season because of an injured wrist, has been granted
an extra year of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher was a senior last season, but only played in four games
because his right wrist had not fully recovered from offseason
surgery. He sat out the rest of the season and applied for a
medical hardship.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska associate athletic director Bob Burton said Tuesday
that Belcher had been granted another season of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher averaged 11.8 points as a junior. Without Belcher
running the offense last season, the Cornhuskers finished 11-19.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are looking forward to Cookie's contributions both on the
basketball court and as a leader on our team,'' coach Barry Collier
said. ''I know he's excited about being able to play healthy after
sitting out for more than a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Collier, who had been at Butler, replaced Danny Nee as coach of

<HEADLINE> NABC: Move Flag or Move Tournament  </HEADLINE>
By DAN LEWERENZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- The National Association of Basketball
Coaches has renewed its objection to holding an NCAA regional in
Greenville in 2002 unless the state removes the Confederate flag
from its current location on the Statehouse grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not see the situation as having been cleared up, and we
think the NCAA should move the site out of Greenville,'' NABC
director Jim Haney said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He said the group's NCAA Division I coaches voted Sunday at
their meeting in Las Vegas to continue their opposition to South
Carolina serving as a host for an NCAA tournament event while the
Confederate flag remains in a prominent location.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the flag was removed from the Statehouse
dome and the House and Senate chambers. A similar, more
historically accurate flag was then raised near a monument to
Confederate war dead on the Statehouse grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Haney said coaches were concerned because the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People and other groups
have objected to the flag's new location, saying it is too
prominent a position for what they consider a reminder of slavery
and a symbol of Southern oppression of blacks. Flag supporters say
it represents Southern heritage and is not a symbol of racism.
</P>
<P>
   ''The discussion on this topic in Las Vegas centered around the
fact that the NAACP once again had indicated that although the flag
had come off the Statehouse ... it was still not satisfactory in
their eyes in terms of the new location of the flag,'' Haney said
from the group's Overland Park, Kan., office.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the NCAA said it would move championship events,
including the regional scheduled for Greenville, and two
cross-country events, unless the state removed the flag from the
dome. After lawmakers voted in May to move the flag to the
Confederate soldier monument, a statement from the NCAA said the
group was ''pleased that the governor and state Legislature have
been able to reach agreement on the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   NCAA spokeswoman Jane Jankowski said Tuesday that she knew of no
plans to discuss the flag at the group's Aug. 11 executive
committee meeting, but that NCAA officials would consider the issue
if contacted by the NABC.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly if we do indeed receive a request from the NABC,
it's something that will be discussed,'' Jankowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Furman University and the Southern Conference,
co-hosts of the Greenville regional, said they would follow the
NCAA's lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the NCAA tells us to move the tournament, we will move the
tournament,'' Southern Conference spokesman Steve Shutt said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just speaking for myself and not for Furman, I think it would
be a shame for the people of Greenville and of South Carolina to
lose out on an event like this,'' said John Block, Furman vice
president for intercollegiate athletics.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the conference asked the Legislature to remove the
Confederate flag from the Statehouse dome. Shutt would not say
Tuesday whether the conference thinks the flag's new location is
acceptable or whether it should be moved.
</P>
<P>
   The NABC first called for the regional to be moved in January,
and sports figures have been among the most prominent people in the
campaign to move the flag. Clemson and South Carolina's football
and basketball coaches participated in a march in April aimed at
bringing down the flag, and Serena Williams withdrew from the
Family Circle Cup tennis tournament because of the flag
controversy.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Refugee Official Enters Debates  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The top U.N. refugee official weighed in Tuesday
on the U.S.-led campaign to better care for the world's
''internally displaced,'' saying the debate sparked by U.S.
Ambassador Richard Holbrooke was obscuring the real issues.
</P>
<P>
   Sadako Ogata, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, said she
welcomed the new spotlight that Holbrooke has placed on the plight
of the internally displaced -- people who flee their homes but don't
cross borders to seek asylum as refugees do.
</P>
<P>
   But she said the debate has been ''too narrowly focused'' on the
disparity in care between the internally displaced and refugees --
as well as the responsibilities of the various U.N. agencies in
helping them.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the talk of mandates and comparative advantages obscures
certain hard realities,'' Ogata said in a speech sponsored by the
Center for the Study of International Organization, a joint project
of New York University and Princeton University.
</P>
<P>
   The real issue is about solving the wars and other conflicts
that spawn mass population flows -- and moblizing the international
community to try to help end them, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke has launched a campaign of sorts for the United
Nations to better care for the world's internally displaced, saying
they should have the same protections as refugees.
</P>
<P>
   International law gives special protections to people who seek
asylum in different countries after being driven from their homes,
and the refugee group was created a half-century ago specifically
to care for them.
</P>
<P>
   But today, the internally displaced number 20 million to 25
million compared to some 15 million refugees.
</P>
<P>
   It's more difficult to provide care for the internally displaced
than for refugees, because aid agencies have to get approval from
governments to gain access. That can get tricky when it is the
government or its policies that the people are fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to level the playing field, Holbrooke has suggested the
United Nations refer to the internally displaced as ''internal
refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ogata even cautioned against that seemingly innocuous and
semantic suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Blurring the distinction between refugees and internally
diplaced people may suggest to some that protection provided within
borders is equivalent to the international protection afforded to
refugees,'' Ogata said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must take care not to undermine the unique legal status of
refugees or to lend encouragement to strategies aimed at containing
displacement. The asylum door has to remain open for people who
genuinely need protection,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Senate Rejects Blocking Monuments  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate rejected an effort by Western
Republicans on Tuesday to curb President Clinton's ability to
create any new national monuments as part of his effort to preserve
federal lands.
</P>
<P>
   But across the Capitol, GOP senators joined a fresh battle
against the White House by pushing a bill through a committee that
would make it harder for the Justice Department to pursue the
multibillion-dollar federal lawsuit against the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   The action came as lawmakers on both sides of the Capitol
focused on spending bills for fiscal 2001, which begins Oct. 1.
Just one of the 13 annual bills has so far been signed into law,
and House and Senate leaders are trying to complete as many as
possible before lawmakers take their August recess for the
political conventions.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate began the day by approving a $15.5 billion measure
financing the Interior Department and federal cultural programs.
</P>
<P>
   The measure -- similar to a House-approved bill -- faces a White
House veto threat because it trims Clinton proposals for federal
land purchases and some energy efficiency programs. It also
contains provisions he opposes like letting ranchers who lease
public lands renew their leases without getting environmental
reviews.
</P>
<P>
   But in a 50-49 vote, senators rejected an amendment by Senate
Majority Whip Don Nickles, R-Okla., that would have forbidden
Clinton to name any new national monuments without congressional
approval. Clinton has so far this year set aside nearly 2 million
acres of federal land as monuments, a designation that limits the
type of allowable recreational and commercial uses.
</P>
<P>
   ''I happen to be in favor of national monuments,'' Nickles said.
''But I think we should have local input.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has designated the monuments under a 1906 law that lets
him do so without consulting lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., contrasted Nickles' proposal with
the actions of President Theodore Roosevelt, a Republican who led
early 20th century efforts to create national parks.
</P>
<P>
   ''The party of Teddy Roosevelt officially abandons its
commitment to his environmental legacy,'' Durbin said of Tuesday's
vote.
</P>
<P>
   The vote highlighted the sensitivity that environmental issues
have in an election year. Of the six GOP senators who voted ''no,''
five are up for re-election in November.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, by a single 28-0 vote, the Senate Appropriations
Committee approved a pair of bills: a $36.6 billion measure
financing the Commerce, Justice and State departments, and a $22.5
billion bill financing energy and water projects and nuclear
weapons testing.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce-Justice bill contains language forbidding federal
agencies from transferring money to the Justice Department so it
can continue its suit against cigarette companies. With the legal
action, the government hopes to recover its costs of treating the
elderly, veterans and others for tobacco-related illnesses -- an
effort that federal officials say will cost $20 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., offered an amendment to provide
the Justice Department with $20 million for the lawsuit's costs
next year. It was rejected on a 14-14 tie, with only Sen. Arlen
Specter, R-Pa., crossing party lines to vote for Hollings'
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the House dealt the cigarette industry a defeat on
the same issue, voting to let Justice accept money from other
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce-Justice bill also provides $500 million for
supporting U.N. peacekeeping missions, nearly $239 million less
than Clinton wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the House Appropriations Committee used a voice vote
to approve a $29.1 billion bill financing the Treasury Department
and some smaller agencies.
</P>
<P>
   That bill would pave the way for a 2.7 percent cost-of-living
salary increase for members of Congress, which next January would
add $3,800 to their current $141,300 salaries. An amendment by Rep.
Virgil Goode, R-Va., to block the increase lost by voice vote.
</P>
<P>
   The bill faces a White House veto threat because of cuts to
Clinton proposals for the Internal Revenue Service and some
anti-terrorism programs.

<HEADLINE> Tigers Place Juan Gonzalez on DL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Juan Gonzalez, out with a sore left ankle, was
placed on the 15-day disabled list by the Detroit Tigers on
Tuesday, retroactive to July 8.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, batting .284 with 13 homers and 35 RBIs, has missed 24
of Detroit's 90 games due to a variety of injuries this season, but
this was the first time he has gone on the disabled list since
1997, when he played for the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who will be a free agent at the end of the season, has
missed 11 of the Tigers last 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   A CT scan Monday on the ankle failed to disclose the problem.
Gonzalez underwent a bone scan Tuesday, but results of that test
weren't immediately known.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers were unsure if they would recall a player from the
minor leagues to fill Gonzalez's spot on the roster.

<HEADLINE> Japan Economic Summit Retooled  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and other leaders of the
world's richest nations, joined by Russia, have retooled their
annual economic summit in an effort to persuade poor countries that
a world that is growing more connected economically can work for
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the agenda for this week's meetings at the 26th
annual economic summit, being held this year on the hot,
subtropical Japanese island of Okinawa, was set last December on
the cold, damp streets of Seattle, where massive protests doomed
efforts to launch new global trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-globalization protesters came from a collection of
labor unions and human rights and environmental groups who got
worldwide attention with their complaints that globalization
benefits corporations and has done nothing for the world's poor.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of those protests, this year's annual Group of Eight
summit of the top industrial countries -- the United States, Japan,
Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada, joined by Russia -- will
have a much broader agenda than the usual talk about economic
growth and currency exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   ''For so many years, international finance has been the domain
of a very small elite in a few countries,'' said Greg Mastel,
director of policy at the New America Foundation, a liberal think
tank in Washington. ''The message the G-8 leaders got from Seattle
is that they need to make their policy discussions more relevant to
the general public.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's new look will be evident even before the formal
opening of the three days of talks Friday on Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time ever, some of the G-8 leaders, including
Clinton, will meet Thursday with leaders from four developing
nations to hear their concerns about how their nations are being
left out of the information technology revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Japan achieved a breakthrough on the trade
front Tuesday when Japan agreed to cut the interconnection rates
Nippon Telegraph &AMP; Telephone charges U.S. and other foreign
telecommunication companies to use its lines by 35 percent over the
next two years, providing savings of $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called the deal reached by negotiators in Tokyo a
''win-win for the United States and Japan'' and ''an important step
as we prepare to discuss the impact of information technology at
the summit.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to closing the digital divide, the G-8 leaders will
also search for ways to narrow the gap between the haves and
have-nots in such areas as education, where 100 million children in
poor countries are not in school, and in health care, particularly
in the battle against AIDS, which is expected to leave 44 million
children orphans in poor countries over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the same time there is heightened prosperity in parts of
the world, there is growing disparity with the poorest nations,''
said Lael Brainard, the White House aide who helped prepare this
year's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   As always, foreign policy issues will intrude.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent the week leading up to the summit involved in
tense Middle East peace negotiations at Camp David. He will brief
the other leaders on those discussions and lobby them to be
generous in contributing to what is expected to be a hefty tab for
implementing a final peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin, attending his first summit
after winning a lopsided victory to succeed Boris Yeltsin in March,
was exerting his influence even before he got to Japan, with visits
to China and North Korea. He is expected to press Clinton during
their private talks Friday to abandon the proposed national missile
defense system, something Clinton will hear from other G-8 leaders
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, chairman for this year's
gathering, hopes the summit will bolster his shaky political
standing, as well as help his nation restore some of its lost
economic prominence.
</P>
<P>
   Okinawa, Japan's poorest region, was chosen as the site for this
year's summit by Mori's predecessor, the late Keizo Obuchi, who
believed the gathering would give a boost to Okinawa's efforts to
attract tourists. The island's economy is now heavily dependent on
the presence of more than 30,000 U.S. military personnel. The
American bases are a sore point for Okinawans, who resent their
intrusion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to issuing an Okinawa charter on the global
information society and the usual mix of grand dinners and working
lunches, the summit will close Sunday with a joint communique
addressing other issues, ranging from poverty relief for the
world's 40 poorest countries to joint efforts to combat money
laundering and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are complaints that the G-8 summits try to deal
with too many issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''The summits have deteriorated into glorified photo-ops with
long laundry lists of items with little strategic focus,'' said C.
Fred Bergsten, head of the Institute for International Economics
and co-chairman of a group of international luminaries who issued a
report Monday calling for the G-8 to narrow its focus to a few big
issues.

<HEADLINE> Angels 3, Padres 2  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Troy Glaus tripled with two outs in the 11th
and scored on Trevor Hoffman's wild pitch as the Anaheim Angels,
who blew a ninth-inning lead, beat the San Diego Padres 3-2
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With the Padres down to their last strike in the ninth, Ruben
Rivera tied the game by hitting an inside-the-park home run off
Troy Percival, who blew his second save in this series.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman (2-4) started the 10th and retired five straight batters
before Glaus' hit to right. Eric Owens broke back on the ball, then
had to come in and the ball took an odd hop, allowing Glaus to take
third. He then scored when Hoffman's pitch to Bengie Molina hit the
plate and bounced away.
</P>
<P>
   Percival struck out the first two Padres batters in the ninth
and was one strike away from his 23rd save when Rivera, who struck
out 22 times in his previous 11 games, lifted an 0-2 pitch to right
field. The ball bounced off the padding near the top of the fence
and Orlando Palmeiro tried to make a leaping catch, crashing into
the fence and falling. Center fielder Garret Anderson didn't back
up the play and the ball caromed several feet toward the infield.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera was rounding third as Palmeiro was throwing the ball to
shorstop Benji Gil, and Rivera beat Gil's throw home for his 11th
homer of the year.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 13th inside-the-park homer in Padres history, and the
first since Tony Gwynn had an inside-the-park grand slam at Dodger
Stadium on June 26, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It was Percival's seventh blown save of the year and second in
this series. He and San Diego closer Trevor Hoffman each blew saves
in Sunday's series opener, which the Padres won 6-5 in 10 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The win went to Al Levine (2-2), who took the loss Sunday when
he dropped Owens' bases-loaded bunt with two outs in the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Major league hits leader Darin Erstad had a solo homer with two
outs in the fifth inning to give the Angels a 2-1 lead. It was his
19th, tying his career-high, and came on a 90 mph fastball from
rookie Brian Tollberg.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad has 155 hits and is on pace for 267, which would break
George Sisler's record of 257 set in 1920. Erstad had six hits in
the series as the Angels won two of three, and has gone 24-for-52
(.462) with 11 RBIs in the last 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   The teams traded solo homers for the game's first two runs. San
Diego's Al Martin hit a towering shot off Ken Hill with two outs in
the third, his 11th, and Anderson hit a leadoff homer in the
fourth, also off Tollberg, his 27th.
</P>
<P>
   Tollberg got his fourth straight no-decision following victories
in his first two big league starts. He gave up two runs and four
hits in seven innings, struck out five and walked one. Hill allowed
one run on four hits in six innings and struck out eight for the
second straight start.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels loaded the bases with one out in the eighth, on two
singles and a walk off rookie Kevin Walker, but Glaus lined out to
shortstop Damian Jackson, who doubled Palmeiro off second.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Padres RHPs Brian Boehringer and Carlton Loewer underwent
season-ending operations on their pitching shoulders Tuesday
morning. Doctors Lewis Yocum of the Anaheim Angels and Jan Fronek
of the Padres operated. Doctors cleaned and smoothed Boehringer's
labrum, biceps tendon and rotator cuff. Boehringer had surgery on
his rotator cuff in August 1999. Doctors repaired a partial tear in
Loewer's rotator cuff. ... Angels OF Tim Salmon had an injection to
treat his inflamed left shoulder.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Women's Open in TV Conflict  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   GURNEE, Ill. (AP) -- The U.S. Women's Open is the premier event
on the LPGA Tour schedule, a major championship with a history and
tradition -- not to mention a purse -- that no other tournament can
match.
</P>
<P>
   And yet when the women tee off Thursday at the Merit Club,
they'll be going right up against the British Open and Tiger Woods'
bid to complete the career Grand Slam.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, I think we'd all prefer to have the week to
ourselves as far as the attention goes,'' said Karrie Webb, the
world's No. 1 golfer.
</P>
<P>
   So why don't they? Blame television. And the PGA of America.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Golf Association, which puts on the Women's Open,
didn't plan for things to work out this way. When it initially
chose the Merit Club to play host to the U.S. Open, it gave the
club the 1999 tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But then the PGA of America decided the 1999 PGA Championship
would be played at Medinah Country Club, in another Chicago suburb.
Throw in the Western Open and the Ameritech Senior Open, and the
Chicago area would be playing host to a PGA major, an LPGA major
and two other high-profile golf tournaments in a span of just six
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of competition. Too much competition, the USGA
decided, and gave the Merit Club the 2000 Women's Open, instead.
</P>
<P>
   When it came time to pick a date for the 2000 tournament,
officials from the USGA, Merit Club and NBC, which is televising
the event, looked at their options and decided this was the best
weekend to hold the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, most of the regular golf media would be in Scotland
covering the British Open. And yes, there are PGA Tour (the B.C.
Open) and Senior PGA Tour (Instinet Classic) events this week.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike most other weeks of the year, the ''only'' real
competition would be the British Open, and its television coverage
would end before the Women's Open's began.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whenever you do it, you're going to have a conflict,'' said
Marty Parkes, senior director of communications for the USGA. ''Now
you've got golf on in the morning and then there really isn't a lot
of competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Added LPGA commissioner Ty Votaw, ''In looking at how do you
make lemons out of lemonade, they said, 'At least we'll have TV
audiences to ourselves in the afternoon.'
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a 'Glass is half-full guy,''' he added. ''There are
negatives, but there are positives to be pointed out, too. ...
Certainly, having the golf audience to ourselves will hopefully
generate one of the largest TV audiences we've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   History seems to support that thinking. In 1998, when Se Ri Pak
beat Jenny Chuasiriporn in a playoff on Monday, the Women's Open
drew a 2.6 rating on Sunday, said Jon Miller, senior vice president
of NBC Sports.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, when the Women's Open went head-to-head with
Woods' victory at The Memorial, it only drew a 1.4 rating.
</P>
<P>
   ''We initially chose this weekend because we wanted to avoid a
head-to-head competition,'' Miller said. ''By having the British
Open going off the air before ... we are free and clear all
afternoon long from any men's golf.''
</P>
<P>
   But will people want to spend an entire summer day watching
golf? Or will most people watch the British Open and then turn off
the television and head outside?
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know that people necessarily get 'golfed out.' I don't
know anyone who will watch all five hours of the British Open,''
Miller said. ''If you've got a compelling event and you've got
stars like Juli Inkster, Karrie Webb and Annika Sorenstam, people
are going to find their way to the T.V. set.''
</P>
<P>
   Players have mixed feelings about the scheduling. While they're
happy about the potential increase in ratings, they'd rather not
share the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Especially not for this tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard,'' admitted Inkster, the defending champion. ''I
wish it wasn't up against the British Open. But you know, this is
our tournament. This is our national championship. This is our
biggest tournament of the year, and we're just going to have to go
out there and play some good golf and bring the media to us.''

<HEADLINE> No Indians in New Fiji Cabinet  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL ALEXANDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- The swearing-in of Fiji's Cabinet was
postponed Wednesday after the island's new president became ill,
delaying a process aimed at helping Fiji recover from a paralyzing
hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The postponement came just one day after the lineup for the
panel was revealed, an announcement that drew protest from George
Speight, who threw Fiji into crisis in May when he led an armed
gang into Parliament and took dozens of hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Speight said enough of his supporters weren't in the Cabinet and
he objected to not having been adequately consulted in the
formulation process.
</P>
<P>
   There was speculation that he convinced his people not to show
up for the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Local radio reported that five of the 20 Cabinet ministers did
not show up along with four of the 12 assistant ministers. it was
not immediately clear how many of those who didn't attend were
supporters of Speight.
</P>
<P>
   President Ratu Josefa Iloilo ''is ill disposed this morning,''
said Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase. ''So regrettably, the swearing
in ceremony is deferred until further notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Details of Iloilo's condition could not be independently
verified. The frail and elderly tribal chief, who suffers from
Parkinson's disease, was sworn in as president Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Speight's May 19 coup was carried out in the name of
guaranteeing political superiority and affirmative action for
indigenous Fijians and promising redistribution of resources to
benefit them.
</P>
<P>
   The last 18 of the dozens of legislators taken hostage in
Parliament were freed last Thursday as part of a deal that Speight
said would disenfranchise ethnic Indians, who make up 44 percent of
the population but who dominate the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Confusion was apparent after Qarase's announcement, though there
were no immediate signs of unrest. Two Landrovers, however, were
found torched in front of Parliament Wednesday morning. They were
believed to have been burned overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are peeved,' said Kaliopate Tavola, tapped to be foreign
minister in the new Cabinet, of the postponement. ''We want to go
ahead,'' he said, but added that ''there is obviously a genuine
reason for it.''
</P>
<P>
   At his swearing-in ceremony Tuesday, Iloilo committed himself to
forging reconciliation in his ethnically divided South Pacific
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are one, as one nation and one people,'' Iloilo said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Speight promised further unrest over the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fun is just beginning,'' he said. ''They are treading on
some dangerous ground. I think they are going to meet some stiff
resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   The British government said Tuesday it was recalling its top
diplomat in Fiji for talks about the deal that won the hostages'
release but left the large ethnic Indian minority with little
representation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Relief at the safe release of all the hostages should not
obscure the fact that the crisis for Fiji is not over,'' Foreign
Minister John Battle said in announcing the recall of British High
Commissioner Michael Dibben.
</P>
<P>
   In the Cabinet named Tuesday, members of Fiji's ethnic Indian
minority initially accepted posts but later withdrew ''due to
concern for the safety of their families,'' according to a
statement from President Ratu Josefa Iloilo's office. Indo-Fijians
make up 44 percent of Fiji's population, but the only Indian in the
new administration will be George Shiu Raj, one of two assistant
ministers for multiethnic affairs -- a non-Cabinet post.
</P>
<P>
   Qarase, who retains the interim post he was appointed to last
week, has released a blueprint for Fiji's future guaranteeing
political superiority and affirmative action for indigenous Fijians
and redistribution of resources to benefit them.
</P>
<P>
   The coup has left Fiji badly damaged: The crucial tourism
industry is in tatters, the hundreds of thousands of Indo-Fijians
have as much as been told they're second-class citizens and many
are planning to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of ethnic Indians and presence of Speight supporters
in the Cabinet is likely to prompt more nations to follow New
Zealand's lead, slapping sanctions on Fiji to press for a return to
multiracial democracy. Australia announced Tuesday it would slash
non-humanitarian aid to Fiji, cut most military ties, impose travel
bans on students and athletes and recall its most senior diplomat
for consultations.
</P>
<P>
   Iloilo said Tuesday that the new Cabinet would not allow ethnic
Indians to be completely sidelined.
</P>
<P>
   ''As head of state and as the symbol of national unity in Fiji,
I cannot appoint a Cabinet that is expressly committed to excluding
a particular community,'' he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, at his swearing-in ceremony, Iloilo committed
himself to forging reconciliation in the ethnically divided nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are one, as one nation and one people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The government has a mandate to guide Fiji to elections in about
18 months.

<HEADLINE> Los Alamos Judge Rejects Motion  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD BENKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Evidence seized in a search of the home
of a scientist accused of breaching security at Los Alamos National
Laboratory can be used at the man's trial, a judge ruled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge James Parker rejected defense arguments that
the April 1999 search of Wen Ho Lee's home by federal agents was
illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Parker said personal items that prosecutors decide not to use
should be listed for the court by Thursday and promptly returned to
Lee.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-year-old scientist is charged with 59 counts, most
alleging he transferred restricted information from secure to
unsecure computers and computer tapes. He has pleaded innocent and
his trial is due to begin Nov. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's lawyers contended the search warrant allowed agents to
seize virtually anything. Among books seized was the collected
plays of Tennessee Williams. Defense attorneys Mark Holscher and
John Cline wanted the entire search ruled illegal and the evidence
barred.
</P>
<P>
   But Parker said the fact that agents seized less than 10 percent
of what they searched showed the warrant's specificity.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Cline nor prosecutor George Stamboulidis would comment
on the ruling. A message was left seeking comment from Holscher in
Los Angeles.

   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- The special U.S. envoy for North Korea,
Charles Kartman, will meet on Wednesday in Berlin with North Korean
Vice Foreign Minister Kim Gye Gwan, a senior U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the meeting is to make arrangements for a meeting
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright plans to hold next week in
Bangkok, Thailand, with North Korean Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun.
</P>

<HEADLINE> AN AP ENTERTAINMENT REVIEW  </HEADLINE>
By MATT WOLF
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The three female stars of ''The Witches of
Eastwick'' fly high -- literally -- at the end of the first act of
the much-awaited musical version produced by blockbuster king
Cameron Mackintosh.
</P>
<P>
   As long as its leading ladies join forces vocally, not to
mention aerially, the show flies, too.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, that's often enough to keep director Eric
Schaeffer's production mostly airborne, despite some dead patches
in the second act and a game if underpowered leading man.
</P>
<P>
   The $7 million Anglo-American venture was inspired both by the
John Updike novel and the subsequent Hollywood film.
</P>
<P>
   Ian McShane, stepping into Jack Nicholson's film shoes as the
devil, gives off the air of a fearless neophyte swimmer wading in
over his head. Brave indeed is the man willing to share a musical
stage with Lucie Arnaz, in ravishing voice and figure in her
British stage debut, as well as local favorites Maria Friedman and
Joanna Riding.
</P>
<P>
   Inheriting the roles played in the 1987 Warner Bros. movie by
Cher, Michelle Pfeiffer and Susan Sarandon, Arnaz, Friedman and
Riding constitute a trio worth treasuring -- both separately and
together -- as they forge their own serious sisterhood.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know the movie will recall the outlines of the story,
even if book writer John Dempsey has fashioned a plot whose
specifics largely bypass Michael Cristofer's screenplay in favor of
John Updike's far subtler 1984 source novel.
</P>
<P>
   Subtlety, however, isn't the point here. Fun, pizzazz and a
thinly veiled message are.
</P>
<P>
   At its core, this ''Witches of Eastwick'' tells of a coven of
sorcerers who discover that the secret to life lies within
themselves. Think of the show as a study in self-affirmation wedded
to a battery of special effects, and you'll have exactly the good
time that is the musical's unpretentious goal.
</P>
<P>
   That's quite a contrast, admittedly, from several of the 1980s
blockbusters backed by Mackintosh, who built up a musical empire
with the help of the French Revolution (''Les Miserables'') and the
Vietnam War (''Miss Saigon'').
</P>
<P>
   ''Witches,'' by contrast, occupies a small, churchgoing New
England town -- Eastwick, R.I. to be precise -- that seems to belong
to the less fractious era previously evoked on the musical stage in
''Bye Bye Birdie,'' ''Bells Are Ringing'' and even ''Grease,'' each
of which ''The Witches of Eastwick'' at various times recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while Updike's novel makes allusion to such 1960s
reference points as Janis Joplin, the Pentagon and Ralph Nader, the
musical deliberately chooses to be vague.
</P>
<P>
   When precisely, for example, does the show take place? Judging
by a hairdo or two -- like Rosemary Ashe as the show's chief victim,
the loony Felicia -- the 1950s would be a good guess. But some of
the racier language is far more contemporary. (Those sensitive to
the mention of body parts should stand forewarned.)
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, McShane's amiable Darryl conveys the easygoing
loucheness of a slightly seedy Hugh Hefner, all of which would
suggest that the show is happening at whatever moment in time its
audience wants it to. After all, lovelessness -- its heroines'
shared condition -- has no limitations when it comes to place or
time.
</P>
<P>
   And so we have Arnaz as Alexandra, the sassy den mother of the
three, a sculptress whose erotic objets d'art flourish once Darryl
joins the fold.
</P>
<P>
   How he inspires transformation of the other women is even more
profound -- Friedman's Sukie begins as an inarticulate, sheepish
reporter and blossoms into a deft wordsmith who stops the show with
her first-act patter song, ''Words, Words, Words.'' Her second-act
solo, ''Loose Ends,'' cannot compare.
</P>
<P>
   Cellist Jane sheds her glasses and, with them, her inhibitions,
though not before Riding socks her own character-defining song --
''Waiting for the Music to Begin,'' with Jane finding a very
playable instrument in the libidinous Darryl -- out of the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey and Dana P. Rowe's score is at its brassiest and best
asserting the women's needs. It is considerably less good when it
puts center-stage McShane -- a star who has to carry two second-act
company numbers that mostly make you cringe.
</P>
<P>
   That's too bad. Because, when he's not attempting to sing or
dance, McShane cuts an attractive roue who matches up perfectly to
the ''bearish, dark man'' described in Updike's novel. He's far
less hammy, too, than Nicholson, which isn't saying much, though it
anchors the show in a way unavailable to the movie's over-the-top
star turn.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, it remains ladies' night throughout.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Witches of Eastwick'' can be said to dispatch its male
anti-hero in more ways than one. ''Look at Me,'' sing the women in
the final number, as they advance upon an audience that for much of
the show would find it hard to look anywhere else.

<HEADLINE> Agent: Titans, George Reach Deal  </HEADLINE>
By TOM SHARP
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Eddie George became one of the
highest-paid running backs in the NFL on Tuesday when the Tennessee
Titans announced they gave the three-time Pro Bowl selection a
$41.25 million multiyear contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   The deal extends George's contract for six years and gives him
the option to play a seventh, for an extra $4 million. It also
includes a $10 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Indianapolis Colts signed rookie running back
Edgerrin James to a seven-year, $49 million contract, while the St.
Louis Rams signed Marshall Faulk to a seven-year, $45 million deal.
Jamal Anderson of the Atlanta Falcons picked up a five-year, $32
million contract last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans had made signing George their top priority after
giving coach Jeff Fisher a new contract in the offseason. George,
the 1995 Heisman Trophy winner from Ohio State, has been the focus
of the offense since he was drafted in 1996. He said he wanted the
deal done before reporting for training camp Friday.
</P>
<P>
   George, who turns 27 in September, has not missed a game in his
first four seasons and has 25 100-yard games with the Titans
winning 20 of those. He turned in a career-high with 1,762 combined
yards and a career-best 13 touchdowns last season as the franchise
reached its first Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   George is one of four running backs to rush for at least 1,200
yards in each of their first four seasons, along with Eric
Dickerson, Earl Campbell and Barry Sanders.

<HEADLINE> State sues factory owners over Coxsackie cleanup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A $7 million lawsuit has been filed by the
state Attorney General's Office to recoup cleanup costs for the
toxic waste site of a former factory in Greene County
</P>
<P>
   The suit charges that Jack Guterman and his son Frederick
violated the state's Superfund law and created a public nuisance at
the American Valve Manufacturing Corp. in Coxsackie. The company
operated the factory from 1920 until 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The site was declared a state Superfund hazardous waste site in
1991 after engineering tests uncovered polluted soil and surface
water leaching onto adjoining properties, as well as hazardous
materials stored in the building.
</P>
<P>
   The pollution includes lead-laden sand and perchloroethylene, a
toxic solvent that was dumped there and contaminated the
groundwater.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the state began emergency cleanup efforts, stopping the
polluted soil and surface water from flowing onto adjoining parcels
and removing pollutant laden-drums from the factory.
</P>
<P>
   Though state Department of Environmental Conservation officials
said last year that the company's owners were hard to find and that
the state might have to pay the bill, the Attorney General's Office
said it had located the Gutermans, who now operate American Valve
in Greensboro, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The long-delayed site cleanup is expected to begin in the fall.
The state decided in 1999 to make the project a one-phase effort
instead of two.

<HEADLINE> Sherman Prepares For Training Camp  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Mike Sherman believes all the pieces are
in place for the Green Bay Packers to be a contender again. He says
it's up to him to put those pieces in the right order.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman, the Packers' third head coach in 19 months, realizes
the enormity of the task facing him in his first training camp,
which gets under way Wednesday. He must combine his new players and
coaching staff with the Packers' veterans, and then he must
convince everyone that Green Bay is still a championship city.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a huge undertaking,'' he said. ''But I'm looking
forward to it. I've been waiting my entire career for this
challenge, and I'm glad I got it in Green Bay.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Rhodes -- hired last season to replace Sherman's mentor, Mike
Holmgren -- had a one-year term as the Packers' coach that ended
hours after Green Bay beat Arizona in the season finale. The
Packers finished 8-8 and missed the playoffs for the first time in
seven seasons.
</P>
<P>
   After one dynamite interview with general manager Ron Wolf,
Sherman was named the 13th coach in the Packers' 80-year history in
January. He spent the offseason holding four minicamps and
shuffling a new coaching staff into town, all in preparation for
the task awaiting them this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman also made the rounds for speeches and public
appearances, all designed to convince the team's fan base that the
Packers' glory days aren't over. Sherman and Wolf both believe
Green Bay doesn't need to rebuild; it needs only to recapture the
drive and acumen that led the team to consecutive NFC titles less
than three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers' rookies, free agents and quarterbacks reported to
the dorms at St. Norbert College in De Pere on Tuesday. They'll be
joined by the veterans on the weekend, with just two weeks to
prepare for the Aug. 4 preseason opener against the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Early indications are that Sherman, a stickler for preparation
who said he already had scripted out the first four weeks of
training camp by April, will run a more structured workout regimen
than either Holmgren or Rhodes. Practices begin promptly at 8:45
a.m. almost every day, with the second session of the day usually
lasting past 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman said the first two weeks of camp will be critical. While
Green Bay will still use the West Coast offense, the Packers will
be learning an entirely new defense brought to town from Denver by
new defensive coordinator Ed Donatell, and the teaching process
will take weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay's veteran defensive stalwarts -- LeRoy Butler, Santana
Dotson, Vonnie Holliday and others -- will be changing their games
toward a smaller, faster style of play anchored by new nose tackle
Russell Maryland. And though Donatell will largely run that show,
Sherman is the one who must sell it to his players and the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have the size up front that we used to have, but we
do have a tenacious style of defense and defenders that hopefully
can make things happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with his fan-friendly attitude, Sherman also has
opened to the public an extra week of practices. The crowds of
Green Bay faithful who gather daily at the Don Hutson Center will
now be allowed to watch until Aug. 24, just 10 days before the
Packers' regular season opener against the Jets on Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The players will once again be housed in dorms on the St.
Norbert campus. To foster a spirit of camaraderie, Sherman, a
former English teacher, used team buses to transport players to the
Don Hutson Center during minicamps, and he plans to continue the
practice in training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just a way to get guys feeling like a team,'' Sherman
said. ''We're out here to learn and to teach, but we're also here
to get to know each other. These guys already know a lot about how
to play football. We have to learn to work with each other and for
each other.''

<HEADLINE> Argentine Court Takes Over Inquiry  </HEADLINE>
By OSCAR SERRAT
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- The Supreme Court has decided to
take over an investigation into charges that top military
commanders kidnapped children born in captivity during Argentina's
''dirty war.'' The judicial decision drew protests Tuesday from
human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled Monday after military officials brought charges
of incompetence against a judge leading the probe into whether
there was a system for illicitly adopting babies born to leftist
dissidents in military custody.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is very serious, and could signal a series of political
decisions by the court and government,'' said Alberto Pedroncini, a
lawyer for the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, a human rights
group whose suit spurred the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina's highest court is expected to rule eventually on the
judge's capacity to head up the investigations, a decision that
could affect whether the probe moves forward.
</P>
<P>
   Rights groups say the cases represent their best hope of
bringing the former military leaders to justice. All were pardoned
by former President Carlos Menem in 1990, five years after
receiving life prison sentences for human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The investigations prompted the arrest of nine of the military
regime's prominent leaders, including former Gen. Jorge Videla, the
regime's first president, and former navy Chief Adm. Emilio
Massera. Both were leaders of the military junta that overthrew
President Isabel Peron in 1976 and ruled until 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the officers are currently under house arrest, as
allowed under Argentine law for detainees over the age of 70.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether military officials systematically arranged
for the adoption of more than 200 children born during the
military's seven-year campaign against leftists and political
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The children's mothers are among at least 9,000 Argentines who
vanished during the so-called dirty war. Human rights groups put
the figure closer to 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation was prompted by a report from the Grandmothers
of the Plaza de Mayo which identified some 60 children born to
mothers who eventually disappeared during the military regime. The
mothers were often bound and blindfolded while giving birth in
detention centers, the group says.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Minister Ricardo Gil Lavedra called for the Supreme
Court to return the cases to Adolfo Bagnasco, a federal judge whose
investigations have yielded the arrests. ''I hope this issue is
resolved quickly and the case can again proceed normally,'' he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Estela de Carlotto, president of the Grandmothers of the Plaza
de Mayo, said she hoped Bagnasco would again head up the
investigations. The Supreme Court decision ''should worry all
Argentines,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment from the Supreme Court.

<HEADLINE> O.J. Simpson Going on Internet  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA DEUTSCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- O.J. Simpson will go on the Internet next
week to field questions from the public and try once again to
convince America that he didn't kill his ex-wife and her friend.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not opposed to talking to the public about my case,'' he
said Tuesday. ''Most of them don't know the facts of my case. When
I talk to them there's usually a 180-degree change in attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ''My guilt was established in the public eye, not in the
courtroom. It was established in the media,'' Simpson said in a
phone interview from Florida, which will soon be his new home. He
said he plans to lease a house in the Miami area where he will live
with his two younger children.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson was acquitted of murder in a criminal trial but was
found liable for the deaths in a subsequent civil trial and was
ordered to pay the victims' families $33.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   He said his two-hour stint on the Internet on July 27 will take
place in Tampa, the headquarters of Entertainment Network Inc., the
company sponsoring the event.
</P>
<P>
   He said he will receive no payment for his participation except
a pledge from the company to contribute money to his three favorite
charities. Those who sign on to his ''chat room'' will pay a fee to
talk with him.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson said he didn't know how much it would cost to log on,
how much was going to charity or the address for the Web chat. A
spokesman for Entertainment Network Inc. did not return a call for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   He said those with the right computer equipment will be able to
see and hear him. Others will receive answers typed in by a
stenographer present in the room with him.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson said the company sponsoring the two-hour chat has become
known for its voyeuristic Web sites in which people can look in on
places such as college dorms.
</P>
<P>
   He expects that some will sign on just to berate him, but said
he's become used to that and is confident he can get people to
listen to his side of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson, who insists he is innocent, said he still receives tips
about possible leads in the case and hopes the Internet site may
attract people with helpful information.
</P>
<P>
   As for his move to Florida, he said he had wanted to move there
for the past 10 years, even before his ex-wife Nicole and her
friend Ronald Goldman were slain in June 1994. Had it not been for
a prolonged custody battle over his children, he said he would have
relocated earlier.

<HEADLINE> Raceway takes another punch to its purse  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONTICELLO, N.Y. (AP) - Hit hard by shrinking crowds and
dwindling receipts, Monticello Raceway was disappointed again.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Off Track Betting won't be simulcasting Monticello
races, at least for July. The halt could cost the track about
$6,000 per racing day, which management shares evenly with the
horsemen.
</P>
<P>
   The reason depends on whom you believe.
</P>
<P>
   The president of OTB said there's just not enough daytime space
on the OTB broadcast schedule. OTB has commitments to simulcast
thoroughbred racing during the day. Thoroughbred tracks bring OTB
at least $300,000 each a day in bets. Monticello, a harness track,
brings in about $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's just no room,'' said Bill Carnevale, the president of
OTB, who said the track could be back on the air by August.
</P>
<P>
   Raceway president Cliff Ehrlich, along with the new head of the
horesmen's association, wonder. The raceway didn't support a bill
to allow night simulcasting of out-of-state thoroughbred races.
With more betting opportunities, they say less would be bet at
Monticello and other harness tracks.

<HEADLINE> Titans, George Reach 6-Year Deal  </HEADLINE>
By TOM SHARP
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Eddie George became one of the
highest-paid running backs in the NFL on Tuesday when the Tennessee
Titans announced they signed the three-time Pro Bowl selection to a
$41.25 million multiyear contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   The deal extends George's contract for six years and includes an
option for a seventh for an extra $4 million. It also includes a
$10 million signing bonus in what general manager Floyd Reese
called ''probably the biggest deal we've ever done.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to keep our core players. That's the way to build a
team,'' said team president Jeff Diamond. ''He hasn't missed a game
in his career, he's a solid guy on and off the field, a great
credit to the team and the community. You have to have confidence
in the type of people you make these commitments to.''
</P>
<P>
   The contract takes George through the 2006 season, which would
be his 11th in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not often a professional athlete stays with one
organization his whole career, and I have an opportunity to do
that,'' George said. ''I'm glad we could get it done. It's a big
weight off my shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Indianapolis Colts signed rookie running back
Edgerrin James to a seven-year, $49 million contract, while the St.
Louis Rams signed Marshall Faulk to a seven-year, $45 million deal.
Jamal Anderson of the Atlanta Falcons picked up a five-year, $32
million contract last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans had made signing George their top priority after
giving coach Jeff Fisher a new contract in the offseason. George,
the 1995 Heisman Trophy winner from Ohio State, has been the focus
of the offense since he was drafted in 1996. He said he wanted the
deal done before reporting for training camp Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It really doesn't matter who is the highest paid,'' he said.
''I've always concerned myself with fair-market value.''
</P>
<P>
   Reese said George, known for his devotion to fitness, ''is
probably one of the few guys who could make seven years and maybe
go farther.''
</P>
<P>
   George said he does not believe the contract will change his
role on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing that changes is my bank account,'' he said.
''I'll continue to challenge myself and my teammates to have a
better season than we had last year. ... I'll take it a season at a
time and hopefully at the end I'll have seven rings.''
</P>
<P>
   George, who turns 27 in September, has not missed a game in his
four seasons, and has 25 100-yard games with the Titans winning 20
of those. He turned in a career-high with 1,762 combined yards and
a career-best 13 touchdowns last season as the franchise reached
its first Super Bowl.

<HEADLINE> House Again Votes on China Trade  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Two months after voting to end the annual
battle over trade with China, the House debated and defeated a
resolution again Tuesday to block renewal of normal trade relations
in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   The vote became necessary because the Senate has yet to take up
the bill the House passed in May that grants China permanent normal
trade status in conjunction with China's approaching entry into the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in past years, Tuesday's outcome was never in doubt. The
House voted down on a 281-147 vote a resolution to reject President
Clinton's decision extending normal trade status to China for
another year.
</P>
<P>
   The debate did give critics of China another chance to express
views that China, because of its human rights violations, weapons
proliferation and trade practices, does not deserve low tariffs and
other privileges enjoyed by other U.S. trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been sold a bill of goods,'' said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher,
R-Calif., the resolution's sponsor. China's persecution of
dissidents and weapons transactions ''have been going in the wrong
direction'' since the previous vote on permanent normal trade
relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Archer, R-Texas, the House Ways and Means Committee
chairman, countered that he was disappointed that the House had to
return to China trade after it approved the bill to provide
''unprecedented access to China's once forbidden markets.''
Agriculture exports alone would triple as a result of permanent
trade status, Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   Since China's 1989 suppression of the Tiananmen student
movement, anti-communist and human rights advocates from both right
and left have tried to block the president's annual renewal of
China's trade status. They came close but failed to overcome a
majority who argued that unilateral sanctions do not work, and
expanded trade with China is the best way to promote a more open
and democratic Chinese society.
</P>
<P>
   As part of China's agreement to remove trade barriers so that it
can join the WTO, the House voted 237-197 in May to extend
permanent trade status, which supposedly ended the annual debates.
</P>
<P>
   While support for permanent status is strong in the Senate,
however, hopes of a vote in July, before Congress leaves on its
August recess, have faded because of a dispute over a companion
bill that would impose sanctions on China for future violations of
weapons proliferation treaties.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., suggested Tuesday
that the Senate might begin debate next week but wouldn't complete
work on the trade bill until lawmakers return to Washington in
September.
</P>
<P>
   The White House called Lott's comment ''a positive step.
</P>
<P>
   ''But with wide bipartisan support for this agreement, it is
critical that the Senate lock in the final vote,'' said White House
spokesman Jake Siewert.
</P>
<P>
   Senate GOP leaders have argued the anti-proliferation bill,
sponsored by Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., must be taken up first.
That tactic was partly to fend off possible amendments to the trade
bill offered by lawmakers insistent that the United States not give
up its ability to punish China when it violates international norms
of behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has opposed the Thompson bill, and
efforts to reach a compromise on a bill to monitor China's weapons
sales have broken off.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today's announcement is a positive step, but with wide
bipartisan support for this agreement, it is critical that the
senate lock in the final vote.'' White House Spokesman Jake Siewert
</P>
<P>
   Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
among the staunchest opponents of the trade bill, opened two days
of hearings Tuesday on the human rights and national security
effects of the legislation. ''It seems to me regrettable that many
in this town have deluded themselves into believing that a trade
deal with China will somehow transform that communist dictatorship
into a normal government that behaves itself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At least one longtime foe of granting China normal trade status,
Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., admitted ''the House has spoken on
this issue'' with its vote last May.
</P>
<P>
   ''What choice do I have but to see this as an opportunity,'' she
said, speaking of the permanent trade bill's creation of a
commission to monitor China's human rights activities.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

   National Crime Rate at Lowest Level in 20 Years
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- The national crime rate fell last year to its
lowest level in two decades, new statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics Canada released figures Tuesday indicating the crime
rate, based on police data, fell five per cent -- the eighth
consecutive annual drop.
</P>
<P>
   Youth crime was down 7.2 per cent and was 21 per cent lower than
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Substantial drops in the three largest provinces drove the
overall decline. The crime rate fell 7.8 per cent in Quebec, 7.4
per cent in Ontario and 4.9 per cent in British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of violent crime fell 2.4 per cent in 1999, the seventh
consecutive drop. However, the rate was still five per cent higher
than in 1989 and 57 per cent higher than in 1979.

   Prime Minister Looks at Alberta Tornado Aftermath
</P>
<P>
   PINE LAKE, Alberta (AP) -- Prime Minister Jean Chretien got a
first-hand look Tuesday at the ''incredible destruction'' left by a
deadly tornado in central Alberta and offered sympathy and help to
the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Chretien said his heart went out to survivors of the tornado,
which claimed the lives of 11 people after it ripped through the
Green Acres campground and trailer park Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   He was escorted by park owners Danny and Lexy Fisher, who
explained that the site has been a holiday destination for 53 years
and visited by four generations of families. The Fishers knew all
the regulars and lost several friends to the twister. Chretien
wished them luck in rebuilding their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is certainly a very difficult period and I'm here to
offer my sympathy to all concerned and to have a look at the
damage,'' he said.

   Cops Release Drawings of Suspect Who Stabbed Doctor
</P>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Police released two composite
drawings Tuesday in the hopes they will generate leads across North
America on a man they believe stabbed abortion provider Dr. Garson
Romalis.
</P>
<P>
   Const. Anne Drennan, spokeswoman for the Vancouver police, said
officers are hoping the composite sketches of the man, drawn with
information obtained from two independent witnesses, will jog
someone's memory.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both of these witnesses had substantial opportunity to view
the suspect prior to the stabbing of Dr. Romalis,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both witnesses describe these composites as a very good
likeness of the suspect.''

   Databank To Trace Antibiotic Resistance
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- A new national system to track antibiotic
resistance -- recently deemed a major threat to global health by the
World Health Organization -- is being set up across Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The Surveillance Network was announced Tuesday by Bayer Inc. The
pharmaceutical giant is funding the project, which will amass and
crunch data from 67 contributing sites across Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The system will give doctors up-to-date information on
resistance trends, allowing them to refine patient care and
prescribe antibiotics more appropriately.
</P>
<P>
   ''The surveillance system not only helps you make decisions
about therapy, but it also makes you aware of or allows you to see
emerging trends that you might not have expected otherwise,'' said
Dr. Donald Low, acting chief of microbiology at Mount Sinai
Hospital in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The tracking system is the second in the world, following on the
heels of a system established in the United States. It, like the
Canadian database, is run by a company called MRL, of Herndon, Va.,
which specializes in monitoring antimicrobial resistance.

   Propane Spill on Vancouver Island Raises Explosion Fears
</P>
<P>
   LANGFORD, British Columbia (AP) --Tourists, truckers and
residents whisked from their homes, vehicles and campsites near
Victoria remained stranded Tuesday after a truck carrying
potentially explosive propane flipped over and began to leak.
</P>
<P>
   The Trans Canada Highway, the main artery between Victoria and
Nanaimo, was closed after the crash, which occurred at 10 p.m.
Monday and killed the driver.
</P>
<P>
   The truck was carrying 38,000 litres of liquid propane. As it
leaks, it turns to gas.
</P>
<P>
   It was Tuesday morning before officials could even get near the
spill.
</P>
<P>
   Stew Young, mayor of Langford, a suburb of Victoria, said a
propane industry emergency response team from Vancouver would
siphon off the propane into another holding tank.
</P>
<P>
   Officials worried the slightest spark could cause an explosion.

   Ontario Government Apologizes for Water Report Reluctance
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- The Ontario government apologized Tuesday for its
initial reluctance to release a report that details water-quality
problems at more than 100 towns, cities and campgrounds across the
province.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are no excuses, this information should have come out
sooner,'' said Tim Hudak, Minister of Northern Development and
Mines.
</P>
<P>
   Hudak, who faced an angry throng of reporters in place of
vacationing Environment Minister Dan Newman, released the document
Tuesday -- a day after it came to light in a newspaper report.
</P>
<P>
   The incident is the latest in a series of setbacks for the
Environment Ministry, which has repeatedly come under fire since
mid-May, when E. coli-infested tap water in the Ontario farming
community of Walkerton killed six people and sickened 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Hudak insisted Tuesday the ministry is committed to disclosing
all information about water quality, and suggested it had been a
mistake not to release the Environment Ministry report sooner.

<HEADLINE> Grizzlies Sign Stromile Swift  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Fresh off a week of workouts
with new Vancouver Grizzlies teammate Shareef Abdur-Rahim, Stromile
Swift signed his first pro contract Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-10 forward from Louisiana State, the No. 2 overall
pick in last month's NBA draft, signed for the maximum allowed
under the collective bargaining agreement, $8.388 million for three
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Swift signed the deal, then hit the floor at the Grizzlies'
training facility for the first of four days of workouts with 20
free agents and undrafted rookies hoping to get a spot on the team
Vancouver will take to Salt Lake City next week for six summer
league games.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just ready to get started and looking forward to having
fun,'' said Swift, who averaged 16.2 points and 8.2 rebounds last
season as a sophomore at LSU.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm taking everything as a learning experience, try to learn
some things I can take with me to the real training camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Swift spent last week at Abdur-Rahim's offseason home in
Atlanta, where the two worked on ballhandling and shooting and
lifted weights. Abdur-Rahim is a notoriously hard worker and Swift
said his biggest challenge was trying to ''keep up with him.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was real good,'' Swift said. ''He has a nice facility in
his home and we had some good workouts. When we finish with summer
league, I'm going back to Atlanta and we'll probably talk a little
more about what I need to expect in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ''I realize there's a lot he can teach me. I'm ready to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Swift, a native of Shreveport, La., left school after only two
years, but his mother Mary made him promise to return to school and
finish his degree in sports medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver struggled to a 22-60 record last season and was ranked
26th in the league in scoring and 17th in points allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Swift joins Abdur-Rahim, Mike Bibby, Michael Dickerson and
Othella Harrington in a young lineup slowly taking shape.
</P>
<P>
   Grizzlies president Dick Versace said he and general manager
Billy Knight are continuing to actively pursue free agents with a
view to adding some backcourt depth.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a wonderful pair of starting guards and then there's
just a big drop off there. That has to be attacked and we plan on
doing that,'' Versace said.

<HEADLINE> Congress Pays Tribute to Coverdell  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY McMURRAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With his slight frame and a less-than-fiery
speaking style, Paul Coverdell often got lost in the media shuffle
of the Senate. But to Republican leaders, the Georgia senator was
their go-to guy -- willing to take on any task, glamorous or
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers from both parties said they lost more than a colleague
Tuesday when Coverdell, 61, died from a stroke. They also lost a
rising star, a man who seldom sought credit despite his potential
to climb much higher on the leadership ladder.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was just a gentleman -- a Georgia peach in every sense,''
said Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga. ''Quiet, calm leadership, gets the job
done.''
</P>
<P>
   When news of Coverdell's death spread, senators observed a
moment of silence on the floor and the House clerk read a
resolution honoring him.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., was visibly choked
up. New York Democrat Pat Moynihan called Coverdell ''a man of
peace,'' and close friend Bill Frist, a Tennessee Republican,
called him a ''mentor.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to take a while for people to realize what they've
lost,'' said Rep. John Linder, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Linder won his primary election Tuesday night against challenger
Vince Littman, but he said dealing with the death of his friend was
his top priority.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, Linder and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich are
credited with redefining the Georgia Republican Party. A small
group met every Friday afternoon to map out a strategy for
elevating GOP candidates into key offices.
</P>
<P>
   ''Paul was the guy who pushed things,'' Linder said. ''He was
the logistical guy. When some of us would take a weekend off to
play golf, he would take time away to study politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He wasn't necessarily the headlines guy or the bombastic
speaker, but he could organize parties and gather support like
nobody else,'' said Georgia Republican Chairman Chuck Clay. ''While
he may not have got a lot of the credit, you can rest assured most
legislation had the footprints and fingerprints of Paul Coverdell
all over it.''
</P>
<P>
   At state conventions, Coverdell would facilitate business from
behind a screen in the back. Seldom would he get up to speak. He
followed the same pattern in Congress, quietly accepting tasks Lott
handed him.
</P>
<P>
   ''When asked, a lot of people say: 'Thank you very much, but
I've got more than I can say grace over,''' said Sen. Don Nickles,
R-Okla. ''Paul Coverdell was the type of senator who would take it
on. This is the most depressing thing that's happened to us in a
long, long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's latest project was scripting Republican priorities
for the budget surplus -- a list led by Social Security and Medicare
preservation. It was unknown whether he heard the Congressional
Budget Office's announcement Monday that it had underestimated the
next decade's surplus by almost half.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, Lott gave Coverdell the somewhat dubious honor of
steering debate on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act,
currently stuck in legislative limbo. Coverdell knew Democrats
would probably block the GOP effort, but he worked late into the
night on it all the same.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to come to understanding the legislative process or
it will drive you crazy,'' Coverdell said several weeks ago, after
the debate reached a standstill. ''The ultimate goal is making
things better, and the interim frustrations are just part of the
system. They've made me a more patient person.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Promotes Victims' Rights  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Accused by Republicans of killing a crime
victims' bill of rights, Al Gore proposed his own constitutional
amendment Tuesday in a campaign appearance centered on the grisly
stories of seven victims.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president sat in an intimate Rhodes College library to
listen -- nodding and ''mmm-hmming'' sympathetically -- to the
testimonials of women who said they had been brutalized and now are
frightened.
</P>
<P>
   Anne White said her rapist watched as she testified at his
parole hearing. ''It had been eight years and I didn't want him to
get an update of what I looked like,'' she said. ''So he could
track her down,'' explained Gore, beside her on a loveseat.
</P>
<P>
   Across the room, Jodie Gaines Johnson, who said she had been
held hostage, starved and raped for five days by three men, pleaded
for information when attackers are released.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have four kids and I don't want to be in the grocery store
and run into one of them because I'm not that strong,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore promised that under his amendment, Johnson and other
victims would be notified if their attackers escaped or were
released.
</P>
<P>
   ''The accused criminals have all kinds of rights and we all
understand why it's part of our system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But here's the point: When those rights are enshrined in the
Constitution and the rights of victims are not, whenever the two
are in conflict, it's not even a close contest. The victims are put
in the back seat and sometimes completely ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying he has ''always been very reluctant'' to amend the
Constitution, Gore added: ''I think that our Founders did a great
job, but they anticipated that there would be times when we had to
amend their handiwork and this is one such time.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides cited the Equal Rights Amendment as the only other
proposed amendment that Gore supports. He has opposed efforts to
amend the Constitution to outlaw burning the American flag.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not mention victims' rights at an evening rally in
Kansas City, where he also collected $125,000 for the Democratic
National Committee over a lobster dinner. He focused instead on the
union workers -- sheet metal workers, plumbers, sprinkler fitters,
asbestos workers, operating engineers and roofers -- who displayed
banners on his stage. Gore promised he would fight for their
interests.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier stop in Nashville, in Gore's home state of
Tennessee, where he holds only a small lead over Bush, dovetailed
with the Democratic National Committee's most recent TV ad
featuring Gore pledging to fight for victims' rights.
</P>
<P>
   His proposal borrows heavily from one introduced in the Senate
by Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl, who withdrew it in April, blaming Clinton-Gore
administration opposition, called Gore's latest campaign promise
''fraudulent.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been AWOL from this fight,'' Kyl said in a conference
call to reporters summoned by the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore framed his support for victims in the same rhetoric he has
used in recent days to try and cast himself on the side of average
people -- and his Republican presidential opponent, George W. Bush,
as siding with the rich and powerful.
</P>
<P>
   ''My whole approach is to fight for the people, not the
powerful, and what a lot of those who've suffered from crime have
found out is that sometimes the most powerless people -- and those
who feel the most powerless -- are the victims of crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposal would give victims the right to be heard on
sentencing, have their safety considered in determining probation
or parole and be eligible for restitution from a convict.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also called for legislation allowing victims to take time
off work to attend legal proceedings. And, he promised to restore
the provision of the Violence Against Women Act that was struck
down by the Supreme Court earlier this year: the right for
sex-crime victims to sue attackers for lost earnings, medical
expenses and other damages.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl said his amendment died after the White House insisted it
include language that would require judges to rule in favor of
defendants over victims in cases of competing constitutional
interests.
</P>
<P>
   ''They basically said that, in the case of a tie, the defendant
always had to win,'' Kyl said. ''It bothers me now that Al Gore is
trying to use this politically and in a fraudulent way because he's
never been helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   ''His administration just killed a bipartisan bill two months
ago,'' said Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two states have enacted some form of victims' rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic committee ad, which pictures Gore with uniformed
police officers, began airing in 17 states last week. Under
campaign finance laws, the party, which uses unregulated ''soft
money'' for the ads, is not supposed to coordinate them with Gore's
presidential campaign.

<HEADLINE> Pedestrian struck by falling debris from building  </HEADLINE>
By DEEPTI HAJELA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A Pennsylvania man was badly injured Tuesday
when a part of a brick facade fell on top of him as he walked along
Seventh Avenue, near Madison Square Garden, police said.
</P>
<P>
   John Edward, 37, was taken to Bellevue Hospital where he was
listed in serious condition and was scheduled for surgery Tuesday
night, a hospital spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The debris fell from the roof of a 14-story office building at
423 Seventh Avenue, near 34th Street, at about 4:30 p.m., police
said. The area is heavily traveled by pedestrians and vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic along Seventh Avenue was blocked as police investigated
the accident's cause. It appeared that decorative material above a
14-story window had broken off and fallen, but police were still
interviewing witnesses to determine exactly what had struck the
victim.
</P>
<P>
   Edward, of Dressler, Penn., was in New York for a religious
convention taking place at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Zakia Davis was sitting in a restaurant at the building's lobby
level when she heard what ''sounded like a bomb was going off.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw this man on the ground lying in a pool of blood,'' she
said, adding that chunks of concrete were scattered around him. The
victim kept lapsing in and out of consciousness, and did not move
for a while, Davis added.
</P>
<P>
   Falling debris has injured or killed several pedestrians in the
city over the past two years. Last July, two women walking through
a Queens street fair were killed when the facade of a clothing
store collapsed on them.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1999, a 15-foot metal rod tumbled 22 stories from the
top of 1 Times Square, injuring three women.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1998, bricks from a Bear Stearns building in midtown
fell 39 stories onto Lexington Avenue, injuring one woman.

<HEADLINE> Workers Race to Contain Oil Spill  </HEADLINE>
By MARCELO BALLVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Hundreds of workers dug runoff
channels and strung barriers across a river in southern Brazil on
Tuesday in a race to contain the country's worst oil spill in 25
years.
</P>
<P>
   State oil company Petrobras said late Tuesday that its crews
succeeded in containing the spill near Balsa Nova, a town about 25
miles downstream from the Getulio Vargas oil refinery.
</P>
<P>
   But Jose Antonio Andreguetto, president of Parana State's
Environmental Protection Agency, disputed those reports saying at
least 20 percent of the slick had breached the barriers.
</P>
<P>
   A pipe in the Petrobras-owned refinery burst Sunday and spewed
more than 1 million gallons of crude oil into a tributary of the
Iguacu River.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday night, a Petrobras official who declined to be
identified, said the spill was smaller than the company had
initially believed, though he didn't provide a new estimate of its
size.
</P>
<P>
   He said crews already had removed more than 85,000 gallons of
oil from the river, and at least 20 percent of the oil already had
evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists said the chances were remote that the oil
could reach Iguacu Falls, 400 miles away. Iguacu is one of the
world's biggest water falls and a major tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very optimistic about our ability to stop the oil before
it reaches the falls,'' Andreguetto said. ''But the possibility
cannot be discarded.''
</P>
<P>
   Dead fish, birds and mammals coated in oil were washing up on
the Iguacu's banks, environmental officials said. Egrets and
capybaras -- the world's largest rodent -- were particularly hard
hit. Riverside residents were instructed to stop irrigating crops
and cooking with the water.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists said their goal was to keep the spill from
reaching Uniao da Vitoria, a city of 70,000 people about 125 miles
below the slow-moving slick. The city depends on the Iguacu for
drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   Andreguetto said the spill already has hurt the water supplies
for about 10,000 riverside residents. And while the water quality
could recover within two or three days, environmentalists said the
oil-coated river bed and banks will take longer to bounce back.
</P>
<P>
   ''Plants and animals are significantly affected,'' said
Andreguetto. ''The rehabilitation of the ecosystem will take a long
time and will be very difficult.''

<P>
   More than 1,000 oil workers, firefighters, civil defense workers
and environmentalists worked through the night Monday in freezing
temperatures to check the spill.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, three barriers were set up across the 150-foot-wide
river. Bulldozers and backhoes dug runoff channels to collect the
contaminated water and oil workers with hoses sucked it off the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   A dam and a reservoir immediately downstream will collect
whatever oil slips by the barriers, Andreguetto said.
</P>
<P>
   The Parana State Environmental Protection Agency has said it
will fine Petrobras $28 million. On Tuesday, federal officials said
they would fine Petrobras $56 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''Petrobras must answer for this,'' Environment Minister Jose
Sarney Filho said. ''This is absolute negligence.''
</P>
<P>
   Petrobras President Henri Phillipe Reichstul said the company
accepts full responsibility for the accident and that ''unlimited''
resources will be used to repair the environmental damage.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's worst oil disaster was in 1975, when an oil tanker from
Iraq dumped nearly 8 million gallons of crude into Guanabara Bay.
The oil washed up on Rio's famous beaches, which were closed for
nearly three weeks.

<HEADLINE> Yankees 3, Phillies 1  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Denny Neagle made quite a first impression at a
most opportune time for the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching in pinstripes for the first time, Neagle took a shutout
into the eighth inning as the Yankees beat the Philadelphia
Phillies 3-1 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   David Justice hit a solo homer and Bernie Williams added a
two-run triple off Curt Schilling (5-6) for New York. Schilling
finished with a four-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Neagle's night.
</P>
<P>
   His only contributions in his first four days in New York were
making kooky sounds of train whistles and barking dogs. But when he
took the mound Tuesday wearing Roger Clemens' old No. 12, Neagle
(1-0) showed why the Yankees gave up four prospects to acquire him
from Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   He pitched ahead in the count and let the Phillies hit flyballs
to all parts of spacious Yankee Stadium. He got 16 outs in the air,
and the few that were hit hard were right at fielders until Ron
Gant hit a solo homer with two outs in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle struck out Bobby Abreu to end the eighth and walked off
the field triumphantly to chants of ''Denny! Denny!''
</P>
<P>
   With his parents in the stands watching, Neagle couldn't have
scripted a better Yankees debut.
</P>
<P>
   The left-hander, who was 8-2 for the Reds, allowed one run and
five hits in eight innings. He struck out three and walked two.
</P>
<P>
   He was at his toughest when the Phillies put runners on base,
holding them to one hit in 12 at-bats in those situations.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle's performance came at a time when questions surround the
Yankees as pitching staff. Orlando Hernandez was placed on the
disabled list before Tuesday's game and David Cone lost his
career-high sixth consecutive decision on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle overshadowed those problems for at least one night and
gave manager Joe Torre the perfect 60th birthday present.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, also coveted by the Yankees before they traded for
Neagle, was even more dominating early. He allowed only one hit in
the first four innings before running into trouble from an old
nemesis in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Justice, who entered the game 9-for-25 with three homers off
Schilling, led off with a line drive that barely cleared the
right-field fence for his 24th homer. As Justice rounded the bases,
Schilling looked at the fence in astonishment, apparently surprised
the ball was high enough to be a home run.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees added two insurance runs in the sixth. Chuck
Knoblauch walked with one out, went to second on Derek Jeter's
single and both runners advanced on a groundout. Williams, who
entered the game third in the AL with 85 RBIs, lined a drive into
the left-center field gap for a two-run triple.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling pitched his third complete game of the season. He
struck out five and walked three.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Rivera pitched the ninth for his 22nd save.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Neagle beat Philadelphia 7-0 on May 2. He allowed one hit
in six innings. ... Phillies C Mike Lieberthal and SS Desi
Relaford, who both left Monday's game with injuries, did not start.
Lieberthal will miss 3-4 games with a sprained left ankle and
Relaford is day-to-day with inflammation in his right shoulder. ...
The Phillies are 1-7 at Yankee Stadium. ... Philadelphia finished
interleague play 9-9; the Yankees are 11-6 with a possible makeup
game against Florida left.

<HEADLINE> Inmate families take concerns to Rowland's hometown  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA TOMMELLEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATERBURY, Conn. (AP) - Until more prison space is available in
Connecticut, state prison officials plan to renew a contract with
Virginia to house hundreds of inmates in that state.
</P>
<P>
   ''We may only need to manage people for a year in Virginia, but
Connecticut hasn't offered us any options,'' state Department of
Correction spokeswoman Christina Polce said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Since October, the state has transferred about 480 prisoners to
Wallens Ridge Prison in Big Stone Gap, Va.. The move, officials
said, is needed because of cramped prisons, save the state money
and weed out troublesome prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Polce said the state spends an average of $62 a day per prisoner
in Virginia compared with $71 a day in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   But families of those inmates say money should be no object when
it comes to human rights. A group of about 30 family and friends
gathered on the steps of the Waterbury Superior Courthouse early
Tuesday to protest the transfers, claiming the prisoners have been
abused and beaten by Virginia guards.
</P>
<P>
   Two Connecticut inmates have died at Wallens Ridge. The death of
David Tracy earlier this year that was ruled a suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence James Frazier, a diabetic inmate convicted of rape,
died on July 4 after struggling on June 29 with correctional
officers who repeatedly used a stun gun on the prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials have said the stun gun was not a factor in
Frazier's death.
</P>
<P>
   One of the protesters, Randy Taylor, a Waterbury resident and
co-founder of an organization known as Friends and Families Who
Care, said they are not opposed to inmates serving their sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ''But they should not be abused by the system. The system is not
above the law,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said his group corresponds with at least 60 inmates at
Wallens Ridge. He said families, relatives and friends are
frustrated with the lack of response from officials. The protesters
chose the courthouse in Gov. John G. Rowland's hometown to make
their case.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Rowland sent them there. The racist rednecks in
Virginia can't treat the inmates like human being and Governor
Rowland should bring them back,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the governor said Rowland maintains his support
for the transfers, especially if it removes the most violent
criminals out of state.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's in order to keep both the Connecticut prison population
safe as well as the correction employees,'' Chris Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia authorities have denied any wrongdoing. Delegations
from Connecticut have traveled to Wallens Ridge to inspect the
prison and the treatment of inmates, and members of the state
Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities next month will
investigate allegations that guards have used excessive force and
racial slurs against Connecticut inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Polce said the agreement is automatically reinstated if the
state doesn't notify Virginia that it intends to terminate the
pact.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since we have chosen not to terminate the contract, it will
automatically rollover at the end of October,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Correction also is in the process of
trying to find more prison space in the state.
</P>
<P>
   A recent letter went out to every city and town asking local
officials to consider building a prison or expanding existing new
prisons. A informational meeting will be held at the department's
Cheshire training complex on Wednesday, July 26, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Tracy's family were at the protest including his
father, Thomas Tracy, who said the relatives are frustrated by a
continued lack of information. Tracy insisted his son did not hang
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''We put our trust in Henry Lee and he betrayed us,'' Tracy
said, referring to the state's top forensic expert, who observed
the autopsy and said Tracy died from a lack of blood to the brain -
an injury consistent with a hanging suicide.
</P>
<P>
   A state-sponsored bus trip last week took several relatives to
the Virginia prison to visit their loved ones. Karen Brown, whose
fiance is serving time for manslaughter, refused to go.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going on no bus trip. I'm not encouraging it or
influencing it because I want him to come back,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think he shouldn't be punished for what he did, but I
don't think he should be sent to Virginia just because the state
wants to save money,'' said Brown, of Waterbury. ''I mean you're in
jail and you lose a lot of rights, but you're still human.''
</P>
<P>
   She said they intend to marry when his sentence is up in two
years, ''If he's alive.''

<HEADLINE> NCAA Men's Hoops To Expand by One  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The field for the NCAA men's basketball
tournament will expand by one next season with an ''opening-round''
game the Tuesday before the first round begins.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA, which confirmed the 65-team field Tuesday, said the
winner of the game between two of the lower-ranked conferences will
move into the brackets as a No. 16 seed.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament field is expanding because 31 conferences will
receive automatic bids next year, two more than last season. The
committee always selects at least 34 at-large teams.
</P>
<P>
   The additional automatic bids will go to the year-old Mountain
West Conference and the Western Athletic Conference, which didn't
have one last season after eight members left to form the Mountain
West.
</P>
<P>
   The Division I Men's Basketball Committee is recommending the
opening-round game be played on Tuesday, March 13, at the
University of Dayton Arena, which is a host site for first- and
second-round games. Then again, that team might have to play
somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ''They could play at Dayton,'' NCAA spokesman Bill Hancock said.
''They will be seeded into line No. 16 and if, on selection Sunday,
the committee believes that the No. 1 seed should be assigned to
Dayton to play No. 16, then that team could stay in Dayton.''
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA's Division I Championships/Competition Cabinet will
decide Aug. 3 whether to adopt the recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   The 65-team field will be a first, but it won't be the first
time the NCAA has given more than 64 teams a shot at the
championship. In 1991, 33 conference champions received automatic
bids and six of the teams competed in three play-in games. Those
three winners joined 61 other teams in the tournament field.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Thompson, the Mountain West commissioner, chaired the
basketball committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to do everything we can to ensure that the
student-athletes who compete in the opening-round game get the full
flavor of participation in this great championship. The University
of Dayton has a strong history of drawing tremendous crowds to NCAA
tournament competition,'' Thompson said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA said the teams playing the Tuesday game will be
determined on Sunday, March 11, with the remainder of the
tournament field. The NCAA will try to assign the Tuesday winner to
a site playing host to first-round games on Friday, rather than
Thursday. Dayton's first-round games will be played Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''They could stay in Dayton, but they could also move, and that
won't be known until selection Sunday,'' Hancock said.
</P>
<P>
   Both opening-round participants will get a full share of revenue
for playing in the tournament, Hancock said.

<HEADLINE> Elian Shown Reading Castro Message  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- With Fidel Castro in the wings, Elian Gonzalez was
shown on state television Tuesday night reading the book that the
Cuban president gave him to commemorate the boy's successful
completion of first grade.
</P>
<P>
   As the camera panned over the dedication that the Cuban leader
wrote to Elian in the ''The Golden Age,'' a children's book by
Cuban independence hero Jose Marti, Castro's voice could be heard
in the background reading it aloud.
</P>
<P>
   ''For when you are in the fourth or fifth grade and can enjoy
one of the most tender works of Marti,'' Castro read off-camera. It
was signed, ''Affectionately, Fidel Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   But Castro himself was never shown during the 45-minute program
on Elian's life in Cuba since his return on June 28.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of Elian's return to Cuba had predicted that Castro
would parade the boy around like a poster boy for the revolutionary
government.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't occurred. But there have been television images of
Elian laughing and swimming in a pool, Elian singing Cuba's
national anthem, Elian writing his cursive letters on a blackboard
and in a composition book, Elian dancing with maracas, Elian
placing yellow gladiolas at a bronze statue of Marti.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba state media on Saturday revealed very few details when they
reported last week's meeting between the 73-year-old head of state
and the 6-year-old boy. It was the first reported reunion of the
pair since Elian's repatriation.
</P>
<P>
   Castro had promised that Cuba would avoid a media circus upon
Elian's return to Cuba. He was even conspicuously absent at the
boy's airport homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Elian has been kept away from the media in a house
in west Havana, where the child, his family and a group of
classmates and teachers have been living.
</P>
<P>
   State television reported Friday night that Elian had received
his first-grade diploma after a special effort by teachers to help
him recover the time lost during his tumultuous stay in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Although the government initially said that Elian and his family
would take a week's holiday after the boy completed his studies,
uniformed police Tuesday continued to block all traffic around the
house -- an indication that they may still be there.
</P>
<P>
   The government initially said that after the weeklong vacation,
the Gonzalez family was to return to their home in Cardenas, a
small port city two-hours east of Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Elian survived a boat sinking that killed his mother and 10
others.
</P>
<P>
   After the child was rescued on Nov. 25, he became the subject of
an international custody dispute between his father in Cuba and
their relatives in the United States, who fought unsuccessfully all
the way to the Supreme Court to block his repatriation.

<HEADLINE> New policy could jeopardize funding for Boy Scouts  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID RISING
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) - The United Way of Southeastern New
England announced plans Tuesday to cut funding for groups that
discriminate against gays, including the Boy Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   The rule is part of a nondiscrimination policy the agency
adopted, prompted by the debate over whether homosexuals could join
the Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   The new guidelines, developed after months of discussion,
threaten $200,000 the agency provides annually to the Scouts'
Narragansett Council, based in Providence, for programs for poor
and disadvantaged children.
</P>
<P>
   In order to continue to receive the funding, the Boy Scouts and
about 150 other agencies must certify by year's end they are
complying with United Way standards. The agencies cannot
discriminate on the basis of a person's age, sex, color, race,
veteran status, religion, national origin, sexual orientation or
disability.
</P>
<P>
   Seven other United Way organizations nationwide have similar
anti-discrimination policies, United Way of America spokesman
Philip Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The Narragansett Council, which covers Rhode Island and parts of
Massachusetts and Connecticut, abides by the Boy Scouts of
America's ban on ''open and avowed homosexuals'' and plans to
continue to comply unless the national group directs them
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Narragansett Council is not in any position to adopt
anything that is counter to the policy of the national
organization,'' said David Preston, a Narragansett Council
spokesman. ''When you accept the charter of the national
organization it's contingent on abiding by the national policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a 16-year-old Eagle Scout filed a complaint with the
Rhode Island Human Rights Commission saying he was denied a job at
a Scout camp because he is gay.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the teen's complaint, the local council asked the
national organization to review its membership policies.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the Boy Scouts can bar
homosexuals from serving as troop leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Murphy, president of the United Way of Southeastern New
England, said the new policy is designed to avoid punishing those
who benefit from the programs.
</P>
<P>
   Donors who give the United Way money for specific charities can
continue to do so, even if the groups don't comply with the
nondiscrimination policy. Funding withdrawn from groups will be
redirected to maintain services for people the programs served.
</P>
<P>
   Preston said the Narragansett Council would make sure the boys
in the Scouts' United Way funded program ''are not abandoned or
forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   The other United Way groups with nondiscrimination policies are
in New Haven, Conn., Somerset County, N.J., Santa Fe, N.M., and
Portland, Maine, and in San Francisco, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz
in California.
</P>
<P>
   The United Way of Southeastern New England provides about $9
million a year to programs in the region.

<HEADLINE> FTC Warns Web Sites of Child Law  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission is warning Web
sites for children that they could face lawsuits if they don't
comply with a recent law barring them from obtaining personal
information from kids without first getting permission from
parents.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC checked several children's sites to make sure they were
in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, or
COPPA, which went into effect April 21. A quarter of the sites
visited did not collect any personal information, but of the sites
that did collect such data, roughly half had ''substantial
compliance problems,'' according to the FTC.
</P>
<P>
   ''Protecting children's privacy is a priority for the FTC,''
said Jodie Bernstein, director of the agency's Consumer Protection
Division. ''We intend to ensure that Web sites collecting personal
information from kids are complying with COPPA and that kids'
information is protected, not exploited.''
</P>
<P>
   The sites warned by the FTC received an e-mail informing them of
the problem. An FTC statement this week said there are several
COPPA-related investigations under way, but none of them have been
made public yet. The agency plans to review the Web sites again in
September, and may bring lawsuits against them then if they still
don't comply with the law.
</P>
<P>
   COPPA requires that Web sites obtain ''verifiable parental
consent'' before collecting, using or disclosing any personal
information, such as a name or address, from children under 13.
Consent can be verified through postal mail or a telephone call.

<HEADLINE> AF Asks Judges Toss Out Gay Suit  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTINE HANLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The Air Force has asked a federal judge to
throw out a lawsuit by a gay officer discharged under the
military's ''Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy, and renewed its demand
that he pay back more than $70,000 the Air Force spent to send him
to medical school.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force attorneys maintain that John Hensala deliberately
timed his announcement that he is gay to get out of his four-year
military commitment and insist he is obligated under Air Force code
to reimburse the government for his education.
</P>
<P>
   Hensala argued in his May 18 lawsuit that the Air Force could
not recoup the funds because he had indicated he wanted to fulfill
his four years of active duty after disclosing his homosexuality,
but he was denied the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Hensala said the Air Force noted in his discharge notice of
February 1997 that it could only collect educational expenses if he
had voluntarily failed to complete his service, had been found
guilty of misconduct or had made a homosexual statement or engaged
in homosexual conduct for purposes of triggering separation.
</P>
<P>
   But in a brief response filed Monday, the Air Force argued that
Hensala never expressed a desire to continue serving, disputed the
contents of the discharge notice and said Hensala waived his right
to a full hearing before a discharge board.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force also argued that Hensala was relying on
reimbursement rules that don't apply to him, and he is not entitled
to a jury trial.
</P>
<P>
   Hensala said Tuesday he had not seen the response and would not
comment until he did. His attorney, Stephen Collier, was on
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   An Air Force spokesman and Justice Department attorney working
on the case did not return messages.
</P>
<P>
   The next hearing is scheduled for Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Hensala, 35, lives and practices psychiatry in San Francisco.
His lawsuit is the first filed by an ousted gay service member to
fight reimbursing the government for education costs.
</P>
<P>
   Hensala earned a medical degree at Northwestern University under
the Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship Program in 1986,
serving 20 weeks of active duty over four years in exchange for
tuition.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force agreed to defer his active duty service during his
three-year residency at Yale, and then put it off again while he
took a two-year fellowship in child psychiatry at the University of
California at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in 1994, the Air Force told him that his four years of
active duty would have to begin the following year. Days later,
after he hired a lawyer, Hensala told his superiors that he is gay.

Paul Coverdell
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Sen. Paul Coverdell, a longtime Republican
politician in Georgia who became a congressional workhorse and
quickly ascended to a leadership post, died Tuesday of a stroke. He
was 61.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, who served as Peace Corps director in the Bush
administration, was first elected to the Senate in 1992 by
defeating incumbent Democrat Wyche Fowler Jr.
</P>
<P>
   He became the fourth-leading Republican in the Senate, serving
as GOP Conference secretary and sitting on several committees,
including agriculture, finance and foreign relations.
</P>
<P>
   He also was the Senate liaison for George W. Bush's presidential
campaign and had been busy preparing for the Republican National
Convention, which begins in Philadelphia in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's signature issue in the Senate the past four years
was education, specifically his proposal to expand higher education
savings accounts to allow tax-free withdrawals for school expenses
from kindergarten through high school.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton vetoed the measure in 1998, and forced
Republicans to pull it from a year-end budget bill in 1997 under
threat of a veto. The president maintained that the measure would
hurt public schools and benefit only wealthy families. Coverdell
had been pushing the legislation again this year.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell also was one of Clinton's most outspoken critics in
the Senate, both on domestic and foreign policy issues.
</P>
<P>
William Russell Mote
</P>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) -- William Russell Mote, who rescued a small
marine laboratory on Florida's Gulf Coast and turned it into a
major conservation and education institution, died Tuesday. He was
93.
</P>
<P>
   Mote founded the marine laboratory in 1965 when he came across
the small Cape Haze Marine Laboratory that was on the verge of
shutting down.
</P>
<P>
   Now Mote Marine is home to 30 researchers and draws more than
400,000 visitors a year to the lab and its aquarium. It includes
the National Center for Shark Research, an international effort to
understand and preserve the species.
</P>
<P>
   Its mission is marine conservation and protection of species,
but the laboratory often makes news for rescuing injured marine
animals and nursing them back to health.
</P>
<P>
   Mote was awarded the International Oceanographic Foundation's
Gold Medal Award which recognizes the layperson who does the most
to promote the study of the sea.
</P>
<P>
Aligi Sassu
</P>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Italian painter, sculptor and engraver
Aligi Sassu, a pioneer of Italian contemporary art, died Monday
following a lengthy illness. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Sassu, who was most famous for his futurist painting, started in
the world of art as a teen-ager, exhibiting his work at a Milan
gallery in 1927.
</P>
<P>
   He was soon widely accepted in the futurist movement, which
emphasized the dynamism, speed and power of the machine. He also
wrote a movement manifesto called ''Dynamism and Muscular
Strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Sassu went to Paris in the 1930s where he studied Impressionist
masters, abandoning futurism and moving toward post-Impressionism.
</P>
<P>
   Among Sassu's most famous paintings are the 1931 ''Uomini
Rossi'' or ''Red Men,'' and the 1944 ''Martiri di Piazzale Loreto''
or ''Martyrs on Piazzale Loreto.''
</P>
<P>
Jose Angel Valente
</P>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Spanish poet Jose Angel Valente, whose
mystical and metaphysical poetry won him dozens of literary awards,
died Tuesday of cancer. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   Valente, a winner of Spain's prestigious Queen Sofia Poetry
Award, was 18 when he published his first poems in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   He also held positions with the Spanish government and the
United Nations, and was an assistant professor at the University of
California-Irvine, where he taught a course on the Spanish civil
war.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote poems in Spanish and in Galician, the language of the
coastal northwest region of Spain where he lived.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Police have charged a Staten Island man on
Tuesday in connection with the death of a Staten Island police
officer who was killed when he crashed his unmarked car into a
utility pole while chasing a motorcycle with stolen plates.
</P>
<P>
   Guido Tritto, 43, was charged with manslaughter and other counts
including reckless endangerment and leaving the scene of an
accident. He was arrested Tuesday morning at his home by officers
acting on a phone tip, police said. He has an arrest record dating
back to 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Officer John Kelly, 31, died Monday, the second officer to die
in the line of duty this year.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, who was in uniform and working alone, was apparently
chasing the motorcycle when he crashed. His 1999 Chevy Lumina was
heavily impacted on the driver's side.

<HEADLINE> Indians 8, Astros 2  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Manny Ramirez, whose future in Cleveland could
be determined in the next two weeks, hit a pair of two-run homers
and drove in five runs Tuesday night, leading Dave Burba and the
Indians to an 8-2 win over the Houston Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, eligible to become a free agent after the season, hit
his 15th homer in the fifth inning off Shane Reynolds (6-7). He
added another two-run shot in the sixth -- his 1,000th career hit --
as the Indians improved to 5-1 since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Alomar went 2-for-4, scored twice, drove in two runs for
Cleveland and recorded his 400th career steal.
</P>
<P>
   He also combined with shortstop Omar Vizquel to turn four double
plays, including a jaw-dropping final one that earned the pair a
well-deserved curtain call.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, Alomar backhanded a hard grounder up the middle
and flipped the ball with his glove to Vizquel, who caught it
barehanded and threw to first in one motion to complete the double
play.
</P>
<P>
   Burba (9-4), aided by three double plays, allowed one run and
nine hits in seven innings to get his first win since June 21. The
right-hander walked three and struck out six, including Richard
Hidalgo with the bases loaded in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds was charged with eight runs and seven hits in 5 2-3
innings. He walked a career-high six, three of which scored.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Biggio went 3-for-4 for the Astros, who went 6-9 in
interleague play.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez has now homered three times and is batting .409
(9-for-22) with nine RBIs since returning from the disabled list
last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The right fielder's agent, Jeff Moorad, told the Associated
Press during Tuesday's game that he has had talks with Indians
general manager John Hart about Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   Moorad said the Indians have not made a contract offer, and have
indicated they are willing to hold off on serious talks until the
end of the season as long as they are still in contention for a
playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   With the July 31 trading deadline approaching, the Indians have
to decide if it's worth the risk of possibly losing Ramirez if they
can't re-sign him after the season.
</P>
<P>
   Hart confirmed that he has spoken to Moorad.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had on-going conversations,'' Hart said from his Jacobs
Field suite shortly after Ramirez connected for his second homer.
''We did talk about some of the parameters of a contract. ... But I
still get the sense that I've gotten all along, that Manny wants to
explore the (free-agent) market.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the Indians would make Ramirez an offer before the
trading deadline, Hart said, ''Before or after. I'm not going to
pin it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Alomar doubled with one out in the fifth, and stole third to
become the 36th player since 1898 to steal at least 400 career
bases. Ramirez followed by hitting a 2-2 pitch into the stands in
left-center to make it 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   After the Indians added two more runs in the sixth on left
fielder Moises Alou's error and Alomar's sacrifice fly, Ramirez
again connected, this time to right-center to make it 8-1.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Alomar was given the third-base bag after his 400th steal.
Ramirez was given the ball following his 1,000th career hit. ...
Hidalgo stranded five runners in his first two at-bats and grounded
into a double play his next time up. ... LHP C.C. Sabathia, the top
pitching prospect in Cleveland's organization, will be called up to
start Monday's Hall of Fame exhibition game against Arizona in
Cooperstown, N.Y. In nine Double-A starts, Sabathia is 3-3 with a
3.51 ERA.

<HEADLINE> Williams a No-Show at Cowboys Camp  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas (AP) -- Pro Bowl right tackle Erik Williams
didn't show for the first day of practices at the Dallas Cowboys'
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not here and he's not on his way,'' team owner Jerry
Jones said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jones indicated Williams' absence was not a surprise to the team
and gave no details.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a good visit with him last week and was aware of some
issues and concerns,'' Jones said. ''When we counted heads
yesterday, we thought he might be a late arrival. Then we started
visiting with his agent and realized he wouldn't be here.''
</P>
<P>
   His agent, Alan Herman, did not immediately return a message
left at his New York office by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is due $1.85 million this season and next under a
six-year deal he signed after the 1995 season. By comparison,
Cincinnati recently signed right tackle Willie Anderson to a
six-year deal that averages $5.1 million, just higher than the
$5.08 million per year deal Philadelphia gave tackle Jon Runyan.
</P>
<P>
   If Williams isn't holding out for more money, it could be to
avoid some of the grind of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether he is fined or how much, that's an internal matter,''
Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is coming off his third Pro Bowl selection in four
years and the fourth of his nine-year career.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas will replace him with second-year lineman Solomon Page,
who started one game in Williams' place last season and allowed no
sacks in 21 pass plays. He started six games in all as a rookie and
played in 14, working at both tackle and guard.
</P>
<P>
   ''He might be the best athlete of our group of offensive
linemen,'' coach Dave Campo said. ''I'm confident he'll be able to
step in and play.''
</P>
<P>
   With Page moving to the first team, Tony Hutson and Jorge Diaz
will see more playing time on the second team.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is missing a chance to become more familiar with
Dallas' new, motion-filled offense. His absence also is the first
roadblock Campo has faced in his six-month tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a business, people have to remember that,'' Campo
said. ''I look at it from the standpoint we'd like to see the whole
football team here and I think Erik Williams is part of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't look at it as a crisis at this point. You may talk to
me two weeks from now and I may look at it as more of a crisis.''

<HEADLINE> NFL Camps Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Eddie George became one of the highest-paid running
backs in the
NFL on Tuesday, when the Tennessee Titans announced a $41.25
million six-year contract extension.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The deal gives George the option to play a seventh year, for an
extra $4 million. It also includes a $10 million bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not often a professional athlete stays with one
organization his whole career, and I have an opportunity to do
that,'' George said. ''I'm glad we could get it done. It's a big
weight off my shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Indianapolis Colts signed rookie Edgerrin James to
a seven-year, $49 million contract, while the St. Louis Rams signed
Marshall Faulk to a seven-year, $45 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   George, who turns 27 in September, has not missed a game in four
seasons and has 25 100-yard rushing games. The Titans are 20-5 when
he rushes for 100 yards, and George had a career-high 1,762
combined yards and a career-best 13 touchdowns last season as the
franchise reached its first Super Bowl in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing that changes is my bank account,'' he said.
''I'll continue to challenge myself and my teammates to have a
better season than we had last year. ... I'll take it a season at a
time and hopefully at the end I'll have seven rings.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Chris Samuels is also a multimillionaire, signing a deal
worth anywhere from $31 million to $55 million with the Washington
Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Samuels, on offensive tackle from Alabama chosen third overall
in the NFL draft, got his first taste of NFL practice later
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Unheralded rookie defensive tackle Jerry DeLoach put Samuels on
the ground twice, the second time with a takedown.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got whipped early,'' said Samuels, who didn't allow a sack
his junior or senior year. ''I hadn't hit since the SEC
championship. He won that battle then, but I got better as the day
went.''
</P>
<P>
   Although veteran Andy Heck is listed first on the depth chart at
left tackle, Samuels is expected to start right away.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't draft the guy with the third pick in the draft as a
backup,'' offensive line coach Russ Grimm said. ''He's a big strong
guy that's got quick feet. Most tackles, especially left tackles,
are more your finesse guys. They've got real good feet, but they're
not powerful run blockers. This guy has a chance to excel in
both.''
</P>
<P>
   With No. 2 overall pick LaVar Arrington close to signing an even
wealthier deal and Pro Bowl running back Stephen Davis also
unsigned, the Redskins will have the most expensive NFL roster in
history. They have already paid about $35 million in signing
bonuses this year, a figure likely to exceed $50 million once
Arrington and Davis are signed.
</P>
<P>
   A gap of about $500,000 between Tennessee and NFL career sack
leader Reggie White is too wide to coax the defensive end out of
retirement, according to coach Jeff Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of work to be done and the biggest hurdle is to
at least get into the same range of numbers that would work for
both sides,'' Fisher said in a story in The Tennessean on Tuesday.
''The sooner the better, out of fairness for both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans won't bring the former Green Bay and Philadelphia
star in for a physical and discussions about his potential role
with the team until the numbers are closer on what is believed to
be an incentive-laden, one-year deal.
Cowboys:
</P>
<P>
   Four-time Pro Bowl selection Erik Williams was a no-show for the
first day of Dallas' training camp, and team owner Jerry Jones said
the absence was not a surprise to the team and gave no details.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm disappointed he's not here,'' Jones said. ''What his
status is and where we go have to evolve. It is an internal matter.
I thought he would be a late arrival, and I talked to his agent and
realized he wasn't coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the team will treat the absence as if Williams, a
tackle, was injured and make temporary lineup adjustments. He said
Williams could be subject to a fine.
Rams:
</P>
<P>
   Al Saunders was promoted to associate head coach and Bobby
Jackson to offensive coordinator Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders, 53, joined St. Louis in 1999 as wide receivers coach.
He was head coach of the San Diego Chargers from 1986-88, and
assistant head coach and receivers coach for the Kansas City Chiefs
from 1989-98. He will continue as wide receivers coach.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, 60, joined St. Louis in February as running backs coach
after five seasons with the Washington Redskins.
Giants:
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Conrad Hamilton was waived by the Giants after
failing a team physical.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton made just three appearances last season, including two
starts, after injuring his knee and ankle in the team's first
intrasquad scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   He started at cornerback in 1998, after Jason Sehorn's
season-ending knee injury. Hamilton had a career-high 91 tackles,
17 passes defended and one interception.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton originally joined the Giants as a seventh-round draft
choice from Eastern New Mexico in 1996.
Eagles:
</P>
<P>
   John Frank, Philadelphia's sixth-round draft pick, retired from
football even before his NFL career started.
</P>
<P>
   Frank, a defensive end from Utah, reported to the Eagles for a
team meeting Saturday -- but never reported for practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was personal reasons. It was a situation where he intended
to come,'' director of football operations Tom Modrak said. ''He
had gone through some of the minicamps and at the last minute he
changed his mind. It caught us all off guard. It was probably a
very difficult decision for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank forfeits a signing bonus of about $63,000.
</P>
<P>
   Frank had a school-record 27 sacks at Utah, and was the 1999
Mountain West Conference defensive player of the year.
Browns:
</P>
<P>
   Running back Terry Kirby will miss 7-10 days of practice with
two small fractures in his left eye socket.
</P>
<P>
   Kirby was hurt Sunday during a blocking drill. At first the
injury was thought to be just a bruise.
</P>
<P>
   Kirby started the first nine games in 1999 and was the Browns'
leading rusher with 452 yards and six touchdowns. Errict Rhett, who
signed with the Browns as an unrestricted free agent, is the
expected starter at running back.
</P>
<P>
   ''I already know the offense,'' Kirby said. ''Hopefully, I'll be
out only about seven days. I'll be ready for the preseason
opener.''
</P>
<P>
   The Browns open July 30 against the Philadelphia Eagles.

<HEADLINE> Activists oppose Millstone plan to expand fuel rod storage  </HEADLINE>
dcdsnldrhjc
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) - A proposal to expand storage of spent
fuel rods at the Millstone Three nuclear power plant drew sharp
criticism at a hearing Tuesday night from activists and area
residents, who said they were concerned about a potential meltdown
or other accident.
</P>
<P>
   About 65 people from Connecticut and Long Island, including
model Christie Brinkley, attended a hearing before the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board. No decisions were made. A formal
hearing before the board was scheduled for Wednesday, continuing
Thursday if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   With no solution in sight to the need for a nuclear fuel dump,
Northeast Utilities, which operates Millstone Three, is asking
federal regulators to increase the capacity of the plants' fuel rod
pool.
</P>
<P>
   NU officials want to store up to 1,860 spent fuel rod assemblies
at the plant's pool, which currently is approved to store 750 such
assemblies. NU spokesman Joe Pillittere said the pool was built to
store up to 2,000 assemblies, and he said the proposal was studied
thoroughly and deemed to be safe.
</P>
<P>
   Brinkley, the former Sports Illustrated swimsuit model and a
Long Island resident, said she was worried about the safety of her
children and other area residents.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not qualify as a scientist, a politician or a lobbyist,''
Brinkley said. ''But I do qualify as a mom. I have three happy,
healthy children, and their health and the health of all of us is
being jeopardized by this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Thompson, executive director of the Institute for
Resource and Security Studies in Cambridge, Mass., said the
expansion possibly could lead to a nuclear meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   ''The plume of radioactivity would be substantially great than
Chernobyl,'' Thompson said, referring to the massive nuclear plant
accident in the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson also said there was the chance of a fire occurring in
the spent fuel rod pool.
</P>
<P>
   The system looks like a 40-foot-deep, L-shaped swimming pool.
The fuel rods are stored in bundles called assemblies, which are
held on racks submerged at the bottom of the pool.
</P>
<P>
   Water laced with boron is circulated around the pool to keep the
fuel cool and prevent a nuclear reaction.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has attracted attention on both sides of Long Island
Sound near the Waterford nuclear complex. Anti-Millstone groups
from Connecticut and New York have been given permission to
participate in the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Pillittere said the storage plan is safe and has been analyzed
from many angles as required by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ''To put this in terms a homeowner would understand, we're not
talking about adding a new room to our house. We're just finishing
the basement,'' Pillittere said.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear plant operators need to store spent fuel on site because
the federal government has not yet come up with a permanent storage
place.
</P>
<P>
   Some anti-nuclear activists believe it would be safer to store
the fuel in secure concrete vaults, since the water storage system
could fail if pumps broke or water leaks out.
</P>
<P>
   Others oppose any expansion of the fuel storage capacity at all,
hoping that the plant will have to shut down if there is no place
to store the waste.

<HEADLINE> Leaked Memo Plagues Blair Party  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The image of Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor
Party is ''badly contaminated,'' according to a memo from a close
adviser published by newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The leaked memo, written by public opinion guru Philip Gould,
comes two days after newspapers printed a similar private memo from
Blair himself, warning that the government was perceived as ''out
of touch.''
</P>
<P>
   In the latest memo, written in early May, Gould warned that
''the New Labor brand has been badly contaminated.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the object of constant criticism, and even worse,
ridicule,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Blair, Gould feared that the government was out of step
with public opinion on issues such as health care and crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''How many ministers genuinely want to be tough on crime?'' he
asked.
</P>
<P>
   In his leaked memo, Blair warned that Labor appeared to be ''out
of touch with gut British instincts'' on issues such as law and
order, asylum, dissent and the family and called for ''eye-catching
initiatives'' to help the government regain momentum.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the prime minister's Downing Street office
dismissed the latest leak as an opposition ploy to draw attention
away from the $64 billion spending package unveiled by Chancellor
of the Exchequer Gordon Brown on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Downing Street confirmed that Cabinet Secretary
Richard Wilson was overseeing an inquiry into the leaked Blair
memo.

<HEADLINE> Labor Party Unveils Spending Plan  </HEADLINE>
By MARA D. BELLA
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The government unveiled its three-year spending
proposals Tuesday, promising a $64 billion cash injection for
hard-pressed public services -- notably education, health and
transportation -- if voters give the Labor Party a second term.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown also promised to hike
defense spending to $37 billion a year by 2004 -- the first
real-term increase since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The boost in public services spending was viewed as a bid to
shore up support for Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor Party ahead
of the next general election -- likely to be held next year.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition politicians contended the government was embarking on
a risky spending binge that would ultimately lead to higher taxes,
and also accused Labor of starving public services during its first
three years in power to allow for a massive pre-election spending
increase.
</P>
<P>
   ''This government has been prudent for a purpose,'' Brown told
lawmakers in the House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said lower welfare costs, a $30.4 billion budget surplus,
dropping debt and other savings allowed him to finally provide the
multibillion-dollar boost to public services.
</P>
<P>
   The package, which would take the government through 2004, comes
at a critical time for Blair's government, which has been plagued
in recent weeks by public relations gaffes and falling poll
results. The government must call an election by the spring 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Brown defended the increases, but the Conservative Party warned
that allowing spending to grow above the actual growth rate of the
economy was not sustainable.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has a surplus today. He now proposes to spend that and take
us back into deficit, and that's why the future under Labor must be
more tax rises again,'' said Michael Portillo, the Tories' treasury
spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Garciaparra: .400 Just a Number  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Nomar Garciaparra has the same attitude about
batting .400 that he had about the rookie of the year award, the
batting title and every other accomplishment on his baseball
resume.
</P>
<P>
   He ignores it, and he hopes everyone else does, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''I won't listen,'' the Red Sox shortstop said Tuesday when
asked about the attention that will inevitably surround him as he
chases Ted Williams, whose .406 average in 1941 was the last to top
.400. ''I'm more about playing. I'm concerned about making the
postseason more than anything. The other stuff I don't know
anything about.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra brought a .400 average into Tuesday night's game
against the Montreal Expos before going 1-for-3 and see his average
drop to .399. Larry Walker, who was hitting .402 on July 18, 1997,
was the last player over .400 this late in the season.
</P>
<P>
   But Walker -- like John Olerud and Tony Gwynn and George Brett
and everyone else who has flirted with .400 since 1941 -- didn't
last, finishing at .366. Gwynn of the San Diego Padres finished
with a .394 average in the strike-shortened 1994 season -- the
highest since Williams' .406.
</P>
<P>
   ''(Hitting) .400 is a six-month deal. It's not five, it's not
five-and-a-half, it's six months. You've got to be able to do it
for six months, and no one's done it since Ted Williams,'' Gwynn
said. ''George Brett gave it a run, Rod Carew gave it a run, I
guess I gave it a halfhearted run, but the bottom line is it's a
six-month deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn, who's been watching Garciaparra on television while
recovering from knee surgery, said he is hoping someone does break
the .400 barrier -- even if it isn't him. In this age of home runs,
he wouldn't mind a little attention for the contact hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wouldn't that be something? Everybody's talking about home
runs so much and then at the end of the year everybody (would be)
talking about hitting .400 and getting 258 hits?'' Gwynn said,
noting that Anaheim's Darin Erstad was batting .385, and his 155
hits puts him on a pace to break George Sisler's 80-year-old record
of 257.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're doing the grunt work in major league baseball. It
would be remarkable for me to see the hit record broken and
somebody hit .400 in a year where people just figure somebody was
going to hit 70, 80 home runs,'' Gwynn said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If home run records can fall, it could be that time where
somebody hits .400, or somebody breaks the hit record. And who
knows what else is out there?''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not Garciaparra, who has done his best to ignore every
statistical furor he has ignited.
</P>
<P>
   ''I remember when he had that hitting streak. He didn't want to
talk about it,'' Red Sox catcher Scott Hatteberg said. ''It's just
a theory of not getting too wrapped up in the moment. He's also a
superstitious guy. I don't know if that has anything to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   ''If anyone's got a chance, it's him. But it's a long way off to
be talking about .400.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra already has a slew of accomplishments in 3&AMP;frac12; years,
including the 1997 AL rookie of the year award, a rookie-record
30-game hitting streak and a league-leading .357 batting average
last season.
</P>
<P>
   But he doesn't covet individual awards, and he doesn't celebrate
them afterward, either.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not that I don't enjoy it,'' he said. ''I just don't look
back.''

<HEADLINE> Georgia Sen. Coverdell Dies at 61  </HEADLINE>
By ERIN McCLAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Sen. Paul Coverdell, a longtime Republican
politician in Georgia who became a congressional workhorse and
quickly ascended to a leadership post, died Tuesday of a stroke. He
was 61.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell had surgery Monday to relieve pressure from a cerebral
hemorrhage but died from swelling in the brain, Piedmont Hospital
said. The senator, who had reported no serious health problems in
the past, was hospitalized Saturday night after complaining of
severe headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, who served as Peace Corps director in the Bush
administration, was first elected to the Senate in 1992 by
defeating incumbent Democrat Wyche Fowler Jr.
</P>
<P>
   He became the fourth-leading Republican in the Senate, serving
as GOP Conference secretary and sitting on several committees,
including agriculture, finance and foreign relations.
</P>
<P>
   He also was the Senate liaison for George W. Bush's presidential
campaign and had been busy preparing for the Republican National
Convention, which begins in Philadelphia in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Paul Coverdell was one of the kindest and most decent men I
met in my entire life,'' former President Bush said in a statement.
''We shall miss him as we would miss our own son.''
</P>
<P>
   Added George W. Bush: ''Paul's soft-spoken, hard-working ways
will be sorely missed by all of us who knew him and loved him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes, a Democrat, has the option of appointing a
successor to serve until a special election in November. The last
senator to die in office was Rhode Island Republican John Chafee,
who died from heart failure last October.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell built a reputation as an effective, behind-the-scenes
operative for Senate Republicans, working long hours to organize
his colleagues into a unified voice.
</P>
<P>
   He became a close ally of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, who
affectionately referred to him as ''Mikey,'' handing unglamorous
tasks or pointed media questions to Coverdell with the comment,
''That's a job for Mikey.'' Aides said the reference came from the
1970s TV commercial in which a boy named Mikey agrees to try Life
cereal after his friends won't.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, who announced Coverdell's death in the Senate, expressed
his sympathy to Coverdell's widow. ''Our hearts break also,'' Lott
said, his voice choked with emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's signature issue in the Senate for the past four
years was education, specifically his proposal to expand higher
education savings accounts to allow tax-free withdrawals for school
expenses from kindergarten through high school.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton vetoed the measure in 1998, and forced
Republicans to pull it from a year-end budget bill in 1997 under
threat of a veto. The president maintained that the measure would
hurt public schools and benefit only wealthy families. Coverdell
had been pushing the legislation again this year.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell also was one of Clinton's most outspoken critics in
the Senate, both on domestic and foreign policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Tuesday night, Clinton honored Coverdell ''for
his years of service as a solider, a public servant, and a
statesman.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Paul Coverdell spent a lifetime serving the people of Georgia
and our country,'' Clinton said. ''He was a tireless advocate who
worked to ensure that all children have access to quality
education.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich were the
architects of the modern Republican Party in Georgia. During 16
years in the Georgia Senate, Coverdell was the best known GOP
office holder in a state that was dominated from top to bottom by
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   His party-building efforts paid off in 1998, when Coverdell
became the first Republican to win re-election to the Senate from
Georgia since Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell was born Jan. 20, 1939, in Des Moines, Iowa, and
received a bachelor's degree in journalism in 1961 from the
University of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   He served two years in the Army in Okinawa, Korea and Taiwan
before helping his parents start their Atlanta insurance and
financial services business, Coverdell &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Nancy. They had no children.

<HEADLINE> Twins 3, Cardinals 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Matt Lawton singled home the go-ahead run in
the eighth inning Tuesday night and the Minnesota Twins beat the
St. Louis Cardinals 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Cristian Guzman doubled and Jay Canizaro walked before Lawton's
hit. Guzman slid home just ahead of the throw from left fielder
Shawon Dunston.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Radke (7-10) allowed eight hits in eight innings. He struck
out six and walked two in winning back-to-back starts for the first
time since April 18-23.
</P>
<P>
   LaTroy Hawkins pitched the ninth and earned his sixth save in as
many chances.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Benes (10-4) gave up seven hits in his first complete game
of the season. He walked five and struck out four.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins turned four double plays but hit into three
themselves. Minnesota also had two runners thrown out by St. Louis
catcher Mike Matheny, who picked off David Ortiz at second base
with no outs in the seventh and score tied at 2.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals outfielder Eric Davis was ejected in the fourth after
arguing with home plate umpire Mike Winters. Davis struck out
looking in the first and fourth innings, and had an eight-game
hitting streak snapped.
</P>
<P>
   Benes blanked the Twins on one hit for five innings before a
wild throw helped the Twins score twice in the sixth to make it
2-all.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Moeller led off with a single and scored when third baseman
Craig Paquette threw Guzman's infield hit into right field. Guzman
took third on the two-base error and scored on Canizaro's
groundout.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals took a 1-0 lead in the third inning on consecutive
singles by Placido Polanco, Fernando Vina and Paquette.
</P>
<P>
   They made it 2-0 in the fifth inning on singles by Polanco and
Vina and Paquette's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Cardinals went 7-8 in interleague play this season, the
same record they had last year. ... The Twins were 7-11 in
interleague games. ... Minnesota played again without manager Tom
Kelly, who has missed all six games since the All-Star break. He is
with his ailing father in Florida.

<HEADLINE> Camp David Talks Head to Showdown  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- With tense Mideast peace talks at a
crossroads, President Clinton searched Tuesday for settlement terms
that balance the diverse demands of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   As the clock ticked down to his scheduled departure for Japan on
Wednesday morning, Clinton had dinner on a patio of his cabin at
Camp David, Md., and met with his advisers. ''We will work the
night'' through, said White House spokesman P.J. Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's focused on moving the parties forward,'' the spokesman
added.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was an agreement before Clinton departed for a weekend
summit with leaders of seven other nations. He could delay takeoff
up to a day and still arrive in time for the meetings in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are intense discussions and negotiations going on now
between the two parties,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said
as evening set in over the serene Catoctin Mountains. ''I think
they understand what they're up against, so far as the issues and
the timing.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll just have to wait and see,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met with his staff for about 1&AMP;frac12; hours. ''He stands ready
to talk to either leader separately, together, the negotiators --
whatever we think is peaceful and constructive,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Any agreement is likely to provide Arafat with the Palestinian
state he has long sought, but Barak was said to be holding firm on
East Jerusalem not falling under Palestinian sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's political support is shaky. He faces another
non-confidence vote in the Israeli parliament mounted by the Shas
orthodox religious party, which quit his coalition before the Camp
David summit. Consequently, U.S. mediators are conscious of Barak's
need for gains he could point to in any deal with Arafat that might
help calm opposition to concessions on statehood.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, Israel's parliament speaker, Avraham Burg, said
the talks could end with a partial deal in which Israel recognized
a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   ''Listen, let's not fool ourselves, OK?'' Burg said, having
talked frequently to Barak throughout the summit, now in its eighth
day. ''If it walks like a duck, if it talks like a duck, if it
sounds like a duck, it's a Palestinian state.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton negotiated until dawn Tuesday, the second of
two sessions with Barak ending at 4:30 a.m. Clinton then met with
his staff. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Sandy Berger,
the president's national security assistant, met simultaneously
with Arafat until 5 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Later Tuesday, it was Clinton's turn to meet with the
Palestinian leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''A variety of people have been up most of the night for the
last three nights, so I think you can expect that they're tired,
but they're staying at it,'' Lockart said.
</P>
<P>
   A press plane that was to take reporters to Japan Tuesday night
to cover Clinton's visit to Japan was rescheduled to leave
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, meanwhile, canceled a trip to London in which she was
supposed to speak to the American Bar Association on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding Jerusalem, the toughest of all issues, Barak came to
the summit prepared to offer a deal in which some large Jewish
settlement on the West Bank would come under Israeli sovereignty,
while Palestinian control of areas of the city would be expanded to
predominantly Arab villages in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   But Hasan Abdel Rahman, the Palestine Liberation Organization's
envoy to Washington, said: ''Our position on Jerusalem has not
changed. East Jerusalem is occupied territory, and we have not
changed our position on sovereignty over it.''
</P>
<P>
   During the day, some reports surfaced of progress on the
Jerusalem front. They were attributed to anonymous Palestinian
sources.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart discounted the reports.
</P>
<P>
   With the talks in their eighth day, Lockhart underscored the
urgency of completing the negotiations. ''People understand that
there is not an open-ended or unlimited amount of time, so people
understand the pressure that they're under because the stakes are
high here and the issues are important,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if preparations were under way for a signing ceremony at
the White House, Lockhart said arrangements could be made on a
moment's notice. Underscoring the difficulty of the talks, he said,
''It is very, very difficult to bridge the gap.''

'Marriage Penalty' Eliminated by Senate
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite a veto threat from President Clinton and
Democratic criticism, Republicans won Senate passage today of a bill that would
eliminate the ''marriage penalty'' by cutting taxes for virtually all married
couples. The bill would cut taxes for approximately 45 million couples,
including about 25 million two-earner households in which couples pay more than
they would if single. The legislation, approved on a 61-38 vote, would reduce
government revenue by $248 billion over 10 years.

<HEADLINE> Family Says Rightists Killed Lucio  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Right-wing militias executed a former
leftist guerrilla and senator, family and associates said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials had no immediate information about the apparent
slaying of Carlos Alonso Lucio, a one-time member of the M-19 rebel
group.
</P>
<P>
   But Lucio's father, Alonso Lucio, said he had received word from
rightist militias that they killed his son and a close political
associate, Jaime Moreno, in the northern mountains of Colombia on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''All our sources indicate that he was assassinated,'' Alonso
Lucio said in an interview with RCN television.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Alonso Lucio, 35, returned to Colombia earlier this year
from Cuba, where he fled to escape Supreme Court charges of making
false statements in a case involving a questionable bank loan he
received.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Padilla, a spokesman of the small political movement
Lucio and Moreno headed, claimed they were killed for their role in
promoting peace talks between the government and Colombia's
second-largest rebel group.
</P>
<P>
   The leftist National Liberation Army, or ELN, is engaged in
preliminary peace negotiations with President Andres Pastrana over
the bitter objection of rival rightist militias, headed by national
paramilitary boss Carlos Castano.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Colombia's two main political parties denounced
Lucio's apparent murder on Tuesday, and praised his peace efforts.

<HEADLINE> Gore Suggests Bush Will Up Interest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Al Gore suggested Tuesday that rival
George W. Bush's proposed tax cuts and other fiscal plans would
overheat the economy and push interest rates up. Already, Gore said
of the economy, ''We're pushing the envelope.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the Democratic presidential candidate, told contributors
to the Democratic National Committee Tuesday night that Bush and
his fellow Republicans justify what Gore called ''this huuu-uge tax
scheme'' by saying it will ''stimulate higher levels of economic
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore then gave his $5,000-per-plate dinner party of just 25
people a lesson in Economics 101:
</P>
<P>
   ''You know, the economy is growing pretty fast right now. And,
one of the problems that people talk about when they look at the
economy isn't the need for higher levels of economic growth. That's
not what I hear. That's always great; in fact, we're pushing the
envelope and, with the so-called new economy, we're now getting
higher levels of economic growth without the inflation that has
come with them in the past. But the problem people worry about and
that the stock market types are focused on is, will the growth get
too high and cause a ripple in the market that results in monetary
policy being clamped down and interest rates going up.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes deeper into his speech, an older man across the
table from Gore called out too loudly: ''Mr. vice president, we're
with you all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore took the cue and abruptly sat down to laughter. ''I rest my
case. I made a sale. Let's eat.''

<HEADLINE> White Sox 7, Brewers 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Mike Sirotka struck out a career-high 10 and the
Chicago White Sox took advantage of two errors to beat the
Milwaukee Brewers 7-5 Tuesday night for their fourth straight
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Singleton hit a two-run single in a four-run third and
Greg Norton drove in two runs as the White Sox finished interleague
play 12-6.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers, who lost their fourth straight game, went 6-9
against the AL.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee scored four times in the ninth, with Marquis Grissom
breaking an 0-for-19 slump with a two-run single. Kelly Wunsch got
the final out with runners on first and second for his first major
league save.
</P>
<P>
   Sirotka (9-7) allowed one run and six hits in eight innings. He
became the first White Sox left-hander to strike out at least 10
since Wilson Alvarez got 12 on May 11, 1997, against Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Jamey Wright (5-3) gave up seven runs -- five earned -- on nine
hits and five walks in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Norton hit an RBI double in the Chicago second for a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox batted around in the third. Ray Durham and Jose
Valentin walked and Frank Thomas doubled home a run.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Konerko walked and Singleton singled, scoring two runs, and
Norton added an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Aggressive baserunning and two Milwaukee miscues led to two more
runs in the Chicago fifth. With two outs, Singleton walked and Lee
bounced a single that left fielder James Mouton threw over the head
of third baseman Charlie Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   The ball rolled to the fence behind home plate and Wright
retrieved it, but made a wild throw to the plate that allowed Lee
to score.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Casanova hit an RBI single in the sixth to make it 7-1.
Notes: Sirotka's previous strikeout high was eight, accomplished
twice. ... Norton entered the game with four hits in his last 40
at-bats (.100). ... Chicago's regular third baseman Herbert Perry
was scratched with discomfort in Achilles tendon and calf in both
legs. He was available for pinch-hitting. ... The White Sox last
swept the Brewers May 24-26, 1996, when both were in the AL.

<HEADLINE> Pope Urges Angola's Foes Find Peace  </HEADLINE>
By CASIMIRO SIONA
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUANDA, Angola (AP) -- Pope John Paul II on Tuesday urged
Angola's warring parties to find a peaceful solution to the
conflict that has displaced millions of people over the past two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   ''I ask that the parties involved take bold and courageous
decisions so that once violence is defeated and the gap of hatred
and division is bridged, the Angolan people may finally know a
peaceful living,'' the pope said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   His appeal for reconciliation was read by the Vatican's
representative in Angola, Aldo Cavalli, as the Congress for Peace --
a three-day conference aimed at persuading the government and UNITA
rebels to return to the negotiating table -- got under way in the
Angolan capital.
</P>
<P>
   The government and UNITA, a Portuguese acronym for the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola, began fighting after
Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975. Three peace
accords have since collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Angolan church leaders, senior government officials and
opposition politicians, grassroots movements and international
observers were attending the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pope's plea, old feelings of mutual mistrust were as
present as ever.
</P>
<P>
   State-run media reported Tuesday that the government had
intercepted a message from UNITA hard-liner Paulo Lukamba Gato
saying the timing was not right for peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   But in a communique released Tuesday in Lisbon, UNITA reportedly
said it was ready ''to heed the nation's appeal for peace as soon
as (President) Jose Eduardo dos Santos is willing to.''
</P>
<P>
   As the conference began, some 200 European figures ranging from
politicians to journalists urged Angola's warring parties to
negotiate and the United Nations to lift sanctions imposed against
UNITA in a bid to cripple its ability to make war. They said both
sides failed to make peace.
</P>
<P>
   Dos Santos' government and Jonas Savimbi's UNITA rebels resumed
their two-decade-long war a year and a half ago when a 1994
U.N.-brokered peace accord unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   The call for dialogue is not new. Angola's religious leaders
recently have led an intensive campaign for peace and offered to
mediate talks between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no end in sight. After the government launched a
sweeping offensive late last year, the two sides have been engaged
in low-intensity fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The government has financed its war effort with lucrative oil
exploration deals with foreign companies, some of which include
multimillion-dollar signing bonuses destined for the ruling elite's
pockets, human rights groups allege.
</P>
<P>
   Although an international ban on UNITA's diamond trade has
diminished the rebels' ability to wage war, the guerrillas continue
to receive fuel and arms shipments and are still able to disrupt
the vast country with hit-and-run attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an estimated 1 million people -- about a tenth of the
population -- rely on international aid. Food deliveries have been
hampered by road ambushes and fresh land mines planted by both
sides.
</P>
<P>
   The civil war has uprooted about 3.8 million people -- or
one-third of the southwest African country's population -- according
to state estimates. Many of them were living in makeshift camps,
and almost were relying on aid to survive.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Tiya Jones endured another day of
100-degree temperatures Tuesday in a ground-floor apartment with no
air conditioning, caught in a regional heat wave that has been
blamed for more than 10 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fan don't really do much, just one little fan,'' Jones,
17, said as her 10-year-old brother played with two friends beneath
the shade of a large oak tree outside. ''Everybody been sweating
around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones and her brother aren't alone.
</P>
<P>
   No relief was expected anytime soon from the deadly heat wave
also baking Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, Arkansas, Louisiana,
Oklahoma and Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   The heat has been blamed for the deaths of 12 Texas residents.
In Louisiana, three deaths were being investigated as possibly heat
related. Two of the deaths were elderly residents of a hotel for
homeless and poor people that did not have air-conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Hotspots in Alabama were Tuscaloosa and Evergreen, where the
temperature reached 101 degrees. The mercury edged past 100 in
Tuscaloosa at about 5 p.m. making it a record 14th straight day
that the temperature in the west Alabama town had broken the
century mark.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures of 100 degrees were reported in Montgomery and
Dothan.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures climbed past 100 for the seventh day in a row
Tuesday in north Texas, while readings elsewhere peaked into the
upper 90s.
</P>
<P>
   The high temperature in Louisiana was in the northern community
of Monroe, which peaked at 101. It was 97 in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The hot weather and little rain added to concerns about
dwindling water resources and damage to Alabama's farmers.
</P>
<P>
   All 67 Alabama counties have been declared federal disaster
areas by Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman.

<HEADLINE> Black Leaders To Rally Beating  </HEADLINE>
By TINA MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Black religious leaders said Tuesday they
can no longer ask their congregations to remain calm about the
police beating of a black suspect that was caught on videotape last
week by a TV news helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Vernal Simms, pastor of Morris Brown AME Church, said
it was time to ''mobilize'' and scheduled a rally Sunday evening at
his church -- which sits a few blocks from where officers kicked and
hit suspected carjacker Thomas Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ''We came out asking the community to be calm,'' Simms said.
''But how long, how long can we tell black folk to be quiet and
take it easy?''
</P>
<P>
   Simms, president of Black Clergy of Philadelphia, said the rally
was being sponsored his group and the Nation of Islam.
Majority-white churches, including the Archdiocese of Philadelphia,
were also being invited.
</P>
<P>
   Simms' church holds about 1,000 people, and if more than that
attend, religious leaders said, demonstrators will move into the
street.
</P>
<P>
   ''There may be more than that because the community really is
outraged,'' said the Rev. Joseph Patterson of Hickman Temple AME
Church. ''Not because they apprehended him, but for the atrocious
way they did it. I watched it on television again, and there were
officers running around trying to find a spot to beat him.''
</P>
<P>
   A television news camera captured white and black officers
kicking and hitting Jones last Wednesday, after a chase and
shootout in which he and an officer were both shot and wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 30, still hospitalized in good condition Tuesday, is
charged with the attempted murder of a police officer, assault,
resisting arrest and other offenses. He was also charged with three
purse-snatchings and is a suspect in other crimes, police said.
</P>
<P>
   No charges have been filed against the police in the beating,
and clergy members have been critical of District Attorney Lynne
Abraham.
</P>
<P>
   ''The district attorney always seems to find a way for them to
go free,'' Simms said.
</P>
<P>
   Cathie Abookire, a spokeswoman for Abraham, said the district
attorney would not comment on Simms' remarks.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, top police officials faced outrage at a
community meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner John F. Timoney and other top officials were
joined by politicians and community leaders who struggled to calm
emotions among the overflow crowd of about 200 people at Christ Our
Redeemer Freewill Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   ''Police officers are allowed to use force. The issue is ... did
they use unnecessary force, did they cross the line? You cannot
tell on the basis of that tape because you don't know what's going
on underneath,'' said Timoney, who was drowned out by shouts and
jeers.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that a
satirical T-shirt depicting a scene from the incident was being
sold by police officers. The T-shirt reads ''Welcome America,'' a
Philadelphia tourism slogan.
</P>
<P>
   Timoney said he was outraged and threatened to fire any officers
involved.

left Monday's game with injuries, did not start. Lieberthal will
miss 3-4 games with a sprained left ankle and Relaford is
day-to-day with inflammation in his right shoulder. ... The
Phillies recalled C Gary Bennett from Triple-A
Scranton/Wilkes-Barre as insurance for Lieberthal. ... RHP Robert
Person, who made a minor league rehab start on Monday, is expected
to return to the rotation Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: RHP Jason Grimsley, tired of the media circus at
either side of his locker, found a quieter spot in the clubhouse.
Grimsley moved from between David Cone and Dwight Gooden to a spot
between Chuck Knoblauch and Clay Bellinger. ... OF Ryan Thompson,
who had five RBIs in his first two games before leaving 12 men on
the last two, sat out against Curt Schilling. ''Schilling's a tough
pitcher and he's fighting it right now,'' manager Joe Torre said.
... Torre, who turned 60 on Tuesday, was not bothered by reaching a
milestone age. ''If we lose it does,'' he joked. ''I'm over that
being bothered stuff.''
Expos-Red Sox:
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: Boston starter Pedro Martinez was 55-33 with the Expos
from 1994-97. ... The Expos are 3-11 without Rondell White in the
starting lineup. ... Jose Vidro and Vladimir Guerrero entered the
game as the top two in the NL in hits, with 124 and 119,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: OF Carl Everett was given the night off because of an
injury to his right hand. ''He said it was bothering him a little
bit,'' manager Jimy Williams said. Darren Lewis started in his
place and batted ninth. ... Everett is waiting to hear how long his
suspension will be for head-butting an umpire on Saturday. ... 1B
Mike Stanley (shoulder) was eligible to come off the 15-day

they were defeated 5-0 by the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: RHP Hideo Nomo, will be making his 21st start when he
goes against the New York Yankees on Wednesday night. Nomo, looking
for his fourth win, was 12-8 with a 4.54 ERA in 28 games last year
for Milwaukee. He has had nine no-decisions for Detroit.
Astros-Indians:
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: In addition to leading all NL rookies with 10 homers, C
Mitch Meluskey is first among rookies in RBIs, walks, extra-base
hits and entered Tuesday night's game tied for first in doubles.
... Already the club's all-time leader in doubles, 2B Craig Biggio
needs one double to become the first Astro to hit 400 in his
career. ... Jose Lima treated some Cleveland reporters to his
singing during the Astros stopover at Jacobs Field. Lima has
released two CDs, the most recent titled, ''El Mambo de Lima.'' The
debut single from the CD included the lyric, ''Step up to the
plate, I'm going to strike you out.'' In the off-season, Lima is in
a 13-member merengue band. But based on his 2-13 record, he'd be
better off singing the blues.
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: LHP Cameron Cairncross is the latest pitcher to join
the Indians' roster, recalled Tuesday from Double-A Akron.
Cairncross, a side-arming left-hander, is the first Australian to
play for the Indians and the 10th to be on a major league roster.
Cairncross had to sit out two seasons after undergoing ''Tommy
John'' surgery on his elbow. He has a long scar on the inside of
his arm, and he'll sometimes tell people he got it while battling
sharks in Australia. ''Give me a couple of beers and I can tell
some yarns,'' he said. ... Manager Charlie Manuel said RHP Tim Drew
earned another starter after getting his first major league in on
Monday night. ''I liked what I saw,'' Manuel said. ... Apparently,
OF Ricky Ledee is having a hard time saying goodbye to New York.
Ledee, traded by the Yankees to the Indians, is still wearing his
Yankees-issued shower sandals and his two New York jerseys are
hanging in his clubhouse locker.
Mets-Blue Jays:
</P>

15-day disabled list with a bruise in his right rotator cuff.
</P>

Syracuse. To make room, they demoted RHP Pasquel Coco to Double-A
Tennessee, who gave up four runs in four-plus innings on Monday.

visited Chipper Jones in the Braves clubhouse and presented the
third baseman with an autographed baseball.
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: DH Jose Canseco (strained left heel) was activated
from the disabled list and played for the first time since May 24.
OF Randy Winn was optioned to Triple-A Durham to make room on the
roster ... LHP Tony Saunders, who broke his pitching arm in May
1999, is scheduled to throw 75 pitches, or roughly five innings, in
a simulated game Thursday at Toronto ... The Devil Rays are one of
three AL teams who have less than 100 home runs. The others are
Kansas City and Minnesota.
Marlins-Orioles:
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: Marlins P Alex Fernandez, who is lost for the season,
will have arthroscopic examination on his right shoulder performed

first inning Tuesday and has at least one hit in 34 of his last 49
games.
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: Brady Anderson started in RF for the Orioles. He last
played in the position in August 1994 and hadn't been a regular
there since his rookie season with Boston in 1988. ... Albert
Belle, the regular RF, got his 12th start at DH and rookie Luis
Matos started in center.
Cardinals-Twins:
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: The Cardinals are the second-best draw among major
league road teams in 2000, averaging 35,547 in 44 dates thus far.
Only the Yankees' 36,640 average is better. Even with Mark McGwire
on the disabled list, the Twins-Cardinals games drew 30,116 fans
Sunday and 20,171 Monday.
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: The Twins played again Tuesday night without manager
Tom Kelly, who has missed all six games since the All-Star break.
Kelly is with his ailing father in Florida.
Brewers-White Sox:
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: Monday night's losing pitcher Jason Bere, who was hit
in left calf by a Paul Konerko line drive, is not expected to miss
a start. ... The Brewers announced that Indianapolis will continue
to be the home of their Triple-A team through the year 2002. This
is the first season Indianapolis has been Milwaukee's top minor
league affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: C Josh Paul, who started the season with the White Sox
before being sent to Triple-A, visited Tuesday with team doctors to
check the status of his broken left ring finger. He was injured
July 4 on a backswing and has been on the minor league disabled
list since. ''It's not as bad as we thought,'' said Paul, who was
greenlighted to play again in two weeks. He hit .258 in 24 games
for the White Sox and was hitting .277 in 29 games for Charlotte.
... RHP Lorenzo Barcelo was recalled from Triple-A Charlotte prior
to Tuesday's game with Milwaukee. Barcelo was originally acquired
in the ''White Flag'' trade with San Francisco on July 31, 1997.

blister on the middle finger of his pitching hand. After the game,
pitching coach Rick Peterson said Mathews also had a sore elbow.
... SS Frank Menechino became the first position player to pitch
for the A's since Kevin Seitzer on May 2, 1993. He is the seventh
to do so in club history. ... Reliever Omar Olivares, on the
disabled list since June 17 with a strained right shoulder, said he
hopes to return in two weeks. ''It's been sore and the healing has
taken a long time,'' Olivares said. ''I know the team needs me. I
hope I can go on rehab soon and be back in two weeks. That's the
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: Rockies slugger Larry Walker has driven in more runs
than any other Canadian-born player. With three RBIs in Monday's
opening game of a day-night doubleheader, Walker raised his total
to 888. Jeff Heath had the previous mark of 887 from 1936-49.
Walker already is his country's career leader in hits, doubles,
home runs and runs scored. He has 1,501 hits, a plateau that is
matched among active players only by Tony Gwynn, Frank Thomas and
Edgar Martinez. ... Of the 62 runs Tom Goodwin has scored, 20 have
come after a steal. ... Todd Helton had his 500th career hit on
Tuesday. He also stands at 299 RBIs. ... Colorado's 21 hits on
Tuesday were the third-most in team history; the record is 24
against Montreal last May 3. The 18 runs also tied for third-most;
the Rockies have had 19 twice.
Rangers-Giants:
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: LHP Darren Oliver is still on the disabled list, but he
is scheduled to be activated Thursday and start that night's game
in Anaheim. Oliver has been sidelined since June 17 with weakness
in his left shoulder. No decision yet on who will be sent down to
make room for Oliver . . . Texas has won the AL West three of the
last four years, but this year's Rangers have been in last place
for 41 straight days.
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: Tuesday's game was Dusty Baker's 1,161st as
manager of the Giants, moving him ahead of Leo Durocher for third
place on the franchise list. No. 1 is John McGraw (4,405), and Bill
Terry (1,484) is second . . . The Giants have recalled pitcher
Miguel Del Toro from Triple-A Fresno and sent pitcher Scott
Linebrink back to Fresno. Baker said, ''Del Toro has more
experience. He pitched for a long time in the Mexican League. He's
started more, so he can give us four or five innings in the middle
of a game if we need it.'' . . . The Giants are projected to break
the 2 million mark in attendance Wednesday night against San Diego.
It will be only the fourth time in franchise history that the
Giants have attracted more than 2 million fans. They also did it in
1989, 1993 and 1999.
Mariners-Diamondbacks:
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: DH Edgar Martinez got his second start this season and
the ninth of his career in an NL stadium. He has played first base
each time. The last time was June 9 at San Francisco. ... Martinez
had a career .591 batting average against Arizona starter Brian
Anderson, but manager Lou Piniella said that wasn't why. ''You look
at John Olerud's stats (.400), and they're very impressive over
Anderson, too,'' Piniella said. ''We need to get Edgar some
at-bats. He missed three days during the All-Star break, and over
the past five days he's only gotten three at-bats. Edgar thrives on
at-bats, and I'm a little concerned that, missing the time that he
has, he might be a little rusty.'' ... The game was the last of
nine straight interleague contests for the Mariners, who went in
10-7 against the NL this season, their first winning interleague
record.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: The Diamondbacks optioned RHP Nelson Figueroa, who
started Sunday's 6-3 loss in the series opener, to Triple-A Tucson
to make room for RHP Geraldo Guzman. ... Guzman has allowed just
eight hits in 16 innings, with an 0.56 ERA in his two major league
starts. He beat the Mariners 7-0 Monday night, the 21st shutout in
franchise history and NL-best sixth. ... LF Luis Gonzalez is the
only Diamondbacks player to start all 94 games. ... ... LHP Nick
Bierbrodt, Arizona's 1996 selection with the first draft pick in
franchise history, may pitch in the Hall of Fame game against
Cleveland on Monday as a rehab assignment. Bierbrodt, who spent
five days with the Diamondbacks last year without making an
appearance, developed sore ribs and has spent the summer at the
team's Rehabilitation Center in Tucson.
Angels-Padres:
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: Darin Erstad hit a solo homer on Tuesday, pushing his
major league-leading hits total to 155. It was his 19th homer,
tying his 1998 career high. ... OF Tim Salmon didn't play after
having an injection in his sore left shoulder. ... When Troy
Percival blew the save in the ninth, it kept Ken Hill from winning
his 10th career decision against the Padres. Even so, his nine wins
against San Diego are his highest total against any team.
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: Ruben Rivera's ninth-inning, inside-the-park home run
was the first in San Diego since Jack Howell had one against
Atlanta on Aug. 16, 1991. ... With Tuesday's 3-2, 11-inning loss,
the Padres finished 5-10 against the AL West. The Padres batted
just .221 in interleague play and the staff had a 4.12 ERA and
allowed 19 homers.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Pirates-Dodgers:
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: OF Bruce Aven, out since June 30 because of a
strained left hamstring, was activated from the 15-day disabled
list following a three-game rehab stint with Triple-A Nashville.
The Pirates made room for him on the roster by optioning Chad
Hermansen to Nashville. Hermansen started four games in RF for the
Pirates following his July 7 recall, going 3-for-14 with no RBIs.
... Warren Morris has four hits and three walks in his last 10
plate appearances, following an 0-for-18 drought. ... Reliever
Josias Manzanillo's victory in Tuesday's 8-6 victory over Los
Angeles was his sixth in the majors and first since May 15, 1995,
with the New York Mets. ... Including his no-decision on Tuesday --
after blowing a 5-0 lead -- Todd Ritchie is 0-1 with a 8.35 ERA in
four starts since beating Chicago with a three-hitter on June 27
for his first major league shutout.
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: Manager Davey Johnson missed his third straight
game Tuesday while being hospitalized for an irregular heart rhythm
that is now under control. Dr. Michael Mellman said in a statement,
''Davey Johnson is doing well and undergoing further tests at
Centinela Hospital. He remains in good spirits and good health.''
... Bench coach Jim Tracy is 2-1 as acting manager during Johnson's
absence. ''It is a little uncomfortable, I have to admit, because I
know what my position is with this ballclub,'' Tracy said. ''So to
be thrust into a scenario like this is a little tough. But when
you're asked to do something for the manager you're working for,
you do it and you do the best you can.'' ... Gary Sheffield leads
the major leagues with 32 home runs. The only Dodger to lead the
majors in homers was Tim Jordan, with 12 in 1906 -- during the
dead-ball era. No Dodger has led the NL in home runs since 1956,
when CF Duke Snider hit a franchise-record 43 for Brooklyn.

<HEADLINE> Council Approves Lambeau Agreement  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- A proposed agreement on how to market
naming rights for Lambeau Field was passed by the City Council on
Tuesday night, clearing the way for scheduling a referendum on a
sales tax to help pay for renovating the Green Bay Packers'
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Paul Jadin said the revised agreement was approved 8-4
after about two hours of debate Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The council needed to approve a naming rights deal by July 28
for a stadium commission to set a Sept. 12 referendum on a proposed
half-percent sales tax in Brown County to raise $160 million for
the $295 million renovation and expansion project.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel good that we were able to move this forward,'' Jadin
said, adding however that there still was a ''lot of ill will'' in
the community over the project.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents will do almost anything to try to block it, while
those on the other side are just as determined to see it
accomplished, Jadin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers, who proposed the project early this year, have
described the improvements to the 43-year-old stadium as critical
to keep the team financially competitive in the National Football
League.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to adding 10,000 seats, the proposal would add a
five-story, mall-like atrium to make the stadium more of a
year-round tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers hope to begin work next January and complete the
improvements in time for the 2003 season.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council a week earlier had deferred any action on the
naming rights agreement, which requires that the city and the
Packers equally split the proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   The latest version had revised language to allow seeking
proposals for a $120 million naming rights deal as early as 2002,
rather than 2003 as specified in the original proposal worked out
between the city and the Packers.
</P>
<P>
   The new agreement also allows the council to consult with
experts on the best time to market naming rights -- which a company
can buy to have its name used on a property.
</P>
<P>
   It also includes language saying the council should ask the
County Board to call a referendum on whether to sell naming rights.
</P>
<P>
   A naming rights referendum is to be followed by a council vote
to solicit proposals from companies interested in buying the
stadium's name.
</P>
<P>
   The rights could then go to the highest bidder, as long as the
company offers at least $120 million. If no company bids that
amount, the council could seek new proposals and accept the highest
bid of at least $100 million. If that amount is not reached, the
city and the Packers would determine whether to accept the best
offer.

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Thousands of city workers are threatening to
go on strike July 25 -- a week before the Republican National
Convention -- if their union and the city do not agree on a contract
by then.
</P>
<P>
   If a strike happens and it continues beyond the start of the
Republican National Convention on July 31, that could mean piles of
uncollected garbage all over the city just as thousands of people
come to town.

seen little progress in three weeks of negotiations.

<P>
   He said he hopes that setting a strike deadline will put
pressure on city negotiators.
</P>

   About 14,000 AFSCME members are eligible to strike. Police
officers and firefighters are forbidden by law from striking.

<HEADLINE> Police chase man from New Jersey to New York before apprehending him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A 20-year-old man who led police on a car chase
from New Jersey into New York and then tried to carjack an off-duty
police officer was apprehended on the Cross Bronx Expressway, a
Port Authority spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Burnett stole a black BMW from a car dealership in
Tenafly, N.J., and led several officers on a chase across the lower
level of the George Washington Bridge onto the expressway around 7
p.m. Tuesday, Port Authority spokesman Bill Cahill said.
</P>
<P>
   After encountering traffic, Burnett jumped out of the car, ran
along the expressway and climbed into a black jeep driven by an
off-duty New York police officer, Cahill said. He then exited the
jeep and continued running.
</P>
<P>
   New York and Port Authority police officers used their cruisers
to box in Burnett, who tried to climb a wall before the officers
grabbed him, Cahill said.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett was charged in New York with multiple crimes, including
grand larceny and resisting arrest. New Jersey charges were
pending.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 3, Expos 1  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Javier Vazquez nearly matched Pedro Martinez, but
the Montreal Expos didn't have anyone to answer Darren Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez struck out 12 to earn his first victory since June 8,
and Lewis broke a seventh-inning tie with a suicide squeeze Tuesday
night to give the Boston Red Sox a 3-1 victory over Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ''He (Lewis) really had a nice game all the way around,'' Red
Sox manager Jimy Williams said after Lewis made a tough catch in
the outfield, singled to help score Boston's first run and then
bunted home the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra went 1-for-3 to see his major league-leading
batting average drop from .400 to .399. Martinez (10-3) allowed
five hits and three walks in eight innings, and Derek Lowe pitched
the ninth for his 21st save.
</P>
<P>
   ''We scored. We did something a lot of big league teams don't
do,'' Expos manager Felipe Alou said. ''We scored against Pedro.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 1-1 when Bernard Gilkey doubled to lead off the seventh,
then moved to third on Ed Sprague's fly ball to right. Javier
Vazquez (7-5) threw the next pitch at Lewis' eyes, but he pushed it
to the right of the mound as Gilkey, running all the way, scored
easily.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tried to make a high pitch so he'd foul it or pop it up, but
he made a great play,'' said Vazquez, who allowed three runs on
nine hits and one walk, striking out five for his first complete
game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis also made a catch against the wall in left-center to
retire Michael Barrett and end the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll do whatever I have to do to help my team win,'' Lewis
said. ''That's the way I've played the game for nine years and I'm
not going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez started the season 9-2 before posting one loss and
three no-decisions sandwiched around a trip to the disabled list.
The 1999 AL Cy Young winner still leads the league in strikeouts
(162) and the majors in ERA (1.49).
</P>
<P>
   He gave up a double to Peter Bergeron on the first pitch of the
game, but then didn't allow another hit until the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox took a 1-0 lead in the third when Sprague, Lewis and
Jose Offerman hit consecutive singles. The Expos tied it 1-1 in the
seventh when Geoff Blum tripled and scored on Fernando Seguignol's
double.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox added an insurance run in the eighth when
Garciaparra and Troy O'Leary hit consecutive doubles. O'Leary, who
went 3-for-4, is batting .388 with 14 RBIs in 12 games since
returning from the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Martinez has recorded 10 or more strikeouts nine times this
season, 36 times with the Red Sox and 63 times in his career. ...
Red Sox pitcher Bret Saberhagen made a rehab start for Single-A
Lowell against Auburn and went three innings, striking out five and
walking none while allowing just one hit. He threw 28 of his 36
pitches for strikes before leaving with a 1-0 lead. ... Paxton
Crawford threw a seven-inning no-hitter for Triple-A Pawtucket at
Ottawa, striking out seven and walking one. ... The Expos are 3-12
without Rondell White in the starting lineup. ... Everett was given
the night off because of an injury to his right hand. ''He said it
was bothering him a little bit,'' manager Jimy Williams said.
X-rays were negative. Everett is waiting to hear how long his
suspension will be for head-butting an umpire on Saturday. ...
First baseman Mike Stanley (shoulder) was eligible to come off the
15-day disabled list, but he wasn't ready, Williams said. ...
Vladimir Guerrero is the only Expo to play in every game this
season.

<HEADLINE> Bush, Gore Pay Tribute to Coverdell  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush and Al Gore separately paid
tribute Tuesday to the late Sen. Paul Coverdell, who died of a
stroke soon after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, 61, was a close family friend and Senate liaison to
Bush, the likely Republican nominee and governor of Texas. And he
was a colleague to Democrat Gore, who as vice president serves as
president of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of a speech to a $3 million party fund-raiser
in Chicago, Bush announced Coverdell has passed away, drawing an
audible gasp from a crowd of Republicans. He asked them to observe
a moment of silence for ''my great friend and friend of America.''
</P>
<P>
   After the observance, Bush said: ''May God bless him and his
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell served as Peace Corps director in the Bush
administration and had worked in the presidential campaigns of the
candidate's father.
</P>
<P>
   ''Paul's death is a huge loss to his family, his friends, his
constituents in Georgia and our country,'' Bush said in a statement
released earlier through his campaign office. ''Paul was a great
friend to Laura and me and we shared family and political ties for
more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''He listened to the people of Georgia and he was a leader for
them, at home and in Washington. Paul's soft-spoken, hard-working
ways will be sorely missed by all of us who knew him and loved him.
Our prayers are with Nancy and his family and the people of Georgia
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   At a campaign stop in Kansas City, Gore cited his constitutional
role as president of the Senate as he opened the campaign rally
with a moment of silence for Coverdell.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a partisan gathering, but we are all Americans,'' Gore
said, ''and when something like this happens we join together in
thinking of the family and thinking of our country and honoring the
service of an individual who helped to make our constitution work
and served in a distinguished way.''
