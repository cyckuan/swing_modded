<HEADLINE> Thai Banks Shun Loans to Real Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Despite having a higher
monetary base than the month before, Thailand's commercial banks
continued to refrain from providing new loans to the real economic
sector in July, making the Bank of Thailand's attempts to increase
liquidity in the sector unsuccessful, a central bank report
available Saturday said.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that the country's monetary base at the end
of July was 448.1 billion baht (11.2 billion U.S. dollars), a 0.05
percent increase from a month ago, due to a rise in deposits by
financial institutions with the central bank.
</P>
<P>
However, total credit of banks fell 0.0043 percent to 4.63
trillion baht (115.7 billion dollars) during the same period.
</P>
<P>
The figures indicated that liquidity problems in the domestic
money market had eased, as evidenced by several banks' move to cut
deposit and lending rates.
</P>
<P>
Deposit rates currently range between 8 and 9 percent, while
interest spreads range from between 5 and 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that banks were using the gain from the
widening spread to subsidize their non-performing loans (NPLs),
and some analysts had suspected that the banks were using the new
money for overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
As the report stated, the central banks is still facing the
challenging task of encouraging commercial banks to extend new
loans to the real sector, given that banks are reluctant to incur
the higher risks of such extensions at the moment for fear that
their NPLs will escalate sharply.

<HEADLINE> Communists Reiterate Call for Yeltsin's Ouster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Communist Party
Saturday planned a nationwide campaign for October 7 to demand the
ouster of President Boris Yeltsin, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said a meeting of the
Communist Party central committee decided that the October
campaign would also call for an end to the current government
policy and the establishment of a new "government of national
interests."
</P>
<P>
The meeting instructed Communist lawmakers to seek changes to
the constitution and to the government law so that the government
"does not depend on Mr. Yeltsin's mood" and does not leave office
without making a report to the legislature, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party is the largest faction in the State Duma,
or lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov said the Communists' attitude towards the government
of Yevgeny Primakov would depend on its program and "concrete
steps."
</P>
<P>
He said the left-wing opposition planned to demand that the
Primakov cabinet support Russian manufacturers, set an official
subsistence minimum and take every measure to stabilize the
situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The committee also elected 180 delegates for a congress of the
Union of Communist Parties-Communist Party of the Soviet Union, an
association of Communist parties in former Soviet republics,
Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Censors International Film Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 19 (Xinhua) -- All film entries for
Thailand's first international film festival were subject to
censorship before being shown, festival organizers said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A censorship board has been set up to view all film entries to
ensure that they meet the country's strict censorship law, said
the organizers.
</P>
<P>
At least one entry, Bugis Street, by Singaporean director
Yonfan, has already officially been banned from the festival that
began on Friday. Others were likely to be withdrawn for failing to
conform with the censorship law.
</P>
<P>
Bugis Street features transvestites who populated Singapore's
notorious red-light district in 1960. The censorship board deemed
it pornographic.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Film Festival was scheduled to screen 50 features
and 80 short films and documentaries from 18 countries between
September 18-26. It intended to highlight independent films
produced by dedicated film makers on shoe-string budgets,
organizer Brian Bennet said.
</P>
<P>
The film circles in Thailand want to turn Bangkok into a film
festival hub. But film critics said this dream would face real
problems because of the censorship.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Five Iranians arrived here
Saturday night by a special plane from the southern Afghan city of
Kandahar.
 The five Iranians were released Friday by the Afghan Taliban
militia as "a goodwill gesture" to the Iranian side. The Taliban
had already released five Iranians on September 3.
Senior Taliban official Maulvi Rehmatullah told reporters
Saturday upon his arrival that "it is Iran's turn to take
practical steps to reduce the current tension" between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
"We demand that Iran should remove its troops from the
Afghan-Iran border. We don't want war with Iran. We don't want
second war with any country," he said.
He also said the killing of Iranian diplomats in Mazar-i-Sharif
were done by "renegades."
It is a problem deliberately created by some people for the
Taliban, he added.
Rehmatullah said that the Taliban authorities have set up a
commission to investigate the incident and will apprehend and
arrest the "culprits."

<P>
ATHENS, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Two people were killed and 30
others were injured Saturday in a bus accident near the Greek town
of Krioneri, Attica province.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred when a Halkida-Athens inter-city bus fell
in a 10-meter-deep ravine.
</P>
<P>
Road accidents kill about 3,000 people and injure some 30,000
in Greece per year with drunk drive and high speed being blamed
for most of the accidents.
</P>
<P>
To reduce the number of car accidents, Greek traffic police
have reportedly made substantial inroads in strictly carrying out
alcohol breathalyser tests and imposing stiff penalties introduced
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Traffic police have tested 202,000 drivers nationwide from
August 1997 to August 1998, while a total of 1,707 cars have been
impounded just to be given back after court hearings. Out of the
202,000 drivers tested, traffic police found 14,000 individuals
over the limit (0.5 parts per thousand).
</P>
<P>
In Attica alone, of 76,000 breathalysers tests carried out over
the last year, 6,704 drivers were found to have high levels of
alcohol in their blood.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Rwandan
Education Minister Joseph Karemera said Saturday that his
government did not rule out the possibility of engaging in war
against the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Karemera said the
genocide committed against Tutsi people in Congo (K) must be
stopped.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda, a Hutu-dominated country, has been ruled by Tutsi
people since July, 1994 as the Rwandan Patriotic Front guerrillas
swooped down from Uganda on the country to stop the genocide of
half a million Tutsis and Hutu moderates.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers of Congo's ethnic Tutsis rebelled in early August
against President Laurent Kabila and Congo accused Rwanda of
invading to back the rebellion.
</P>
<P>
Karemera denied the allegations that Rwandan soldiers were
involved in the Congo crisis which has lasted since August 2.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan minister also criticized Zimbabwe, Angola and
Namibia, who have deployed troops in support of the Congolese
government headed by President Kabila, saying that they should
reconsider their decision.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Militia Ready to Withdraw Under Certain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Pro-Israeli South Lebanon
Army (SLA) chief Antoine Lahd said Saturday that his forces are
ready to withdraw from their controlled town Jezzine in southern
Lebanon provided the government meets its demands.
</P>
<P>
He told foreign news agencies here that the demands are that
the government agrees to send its troops to Jezzine and
maintain its security, and promises not to allow other military
groups to enter the area.
</P>
<P>
Lahd's comments came one day after his militia withdrew from a
SLA major post at Toumat Niha, east of Jezzine.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's independent Central News Agency quoted security
sources as saying that the SLA's redeployment represented the
first step of its withdrawal plan from Jezzine.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the SLA will implement its plan on
stages.
</P>
<P>
The SLA militia has been policing Jezzine and helping Israeli
forces patrol its security zone in south Lebanon since it was
established in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the self-declared security zone to allegedly
protect its north from cross-border attack by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Lahd said that the latest security measures he adopted in
Jezzine are not aimed at annexing the area to the "security zone,"
but for the area's security.
</P>
<P>
On September 10, Lahd announced that all residents of Jezzine
would have to apply for special travel permits 48 hours prior to
leaving or returning the area.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the measures were taken because of the rising
number of Hezbollah bombing attacks launched inside the district,
leading to heavy casualties of residents and SLA members.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah (Party of God) is spearheading a
guerrilla war trying to oust 1,000 Israeli troops and SLA
militiamen out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Congo Accuses Uganda of Occupying Congo Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Congolese Information
Minister Didier Mumengi Saturday accused Ugandan armed men of
taking the northeastern town of Isiro but said they were chased
out by Congolese army later, a report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
"A small group entered Isiro from Uganda but today we have
confirmation that Isiro is in the hands of Congolese forces,"
Mumengi, spokesman for President Laurent Kabila's government, was
quoted by the report from Kinshasa as saying.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Kabila's senior political aide and cabinet minister,
Pierre-Victor Mpoyo, said Isiro, a strategic town northeast of
the third city Kisangani, had been seized by Ugandan troops.
</P>
<P>
"This is the work of Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni," Mpoyo
said. "The attackers are Ugandans. They know that we don't have
money to buy artillery to confront them."
</P>
<P>
Nobody could confirm the situation in the town, which is in
Oriental province as is Kisangani, Congo's third largest city,
taken by ethnic Tutsi rebels earlier.
</P>
<P>
Mpoyo said he expected the inhabitants of Isiro to resist
foreign occupation just as residents of Kinshasa had foiled a
rebel bid to take it in the last week of August.
</P>
<P>
"They took the town by force but how can they hold it without
the people's support? The army will go in, and if the army fails
to expel them the people will expel them."
</P>
<P>
Mpoyo said the Congolese government had already started
distributing arms for a "people's war" that would end in Rwanda.
He accused Kigali of invading to back the rebels who took up arms
to oust Kabila since August 2.
</P>
<P>
Mpoyo said allied troops from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia who
drove out rebels from the west of Congo (K) were not keen to be
involved in fighting in the east.
</P>
<P>
In Kinshasa Saturday, handicapped people and groups from
Oriental province marched through the city to express support for
Kabila and condemn what they called international indifference on
foreign invasion.

ANKARA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz said here Saturday that no government establishment,
including the intelligence service, should use criminals in their
operations.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz's words came when allegations that some government
officials kept close relations with members of mafias were growing
louder.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz admitted that the National Intelligence Agency (MIT) had
used criminals "in the past" in its operations.
</P>
<P>
No major problems in Turkey could be solved unless the links
between crime gangs, state bureaucracy and politics were uprooted,
said Yilmaz.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister added that no government agency should use
any individual wanted in the country or sentenced by the courts.
</P>
<P>
He said use of criminals for any purpose by the state could not
reconcile with his understanding of state and government.
</P>
<P>
A special unit was set up at the Police Department to pursue
the gangs, said Yilmaz, adding that coordination was established
between the police and the MIT so that the two state agencies
could work more effectively against gangs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prime minister disclosed that 13.634 tonnes of
drugs have been seized since his government came to power in June
of last year.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's organized crimes have been on rise in recent years,
causing serious social trouble.

taxes on industrial products by 25 percent annually, starting
from January 1, 1999, until ultimately they become customs-free.
</P>
<P>
Jaber said after the signing ceremony that this is an
important step on the road toward liberating Arab economy and
establishing a free Arab trade zone.
</P>
<P>
For his part, the Kuwaiti minister who arrived here Friday to
open the first Kuwaiti products exhibition, welcomed the pact,
hoping it would provide an easy access for his country's
industrial products to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Lebanon signed a similar pact with Egypt and
an agreement to remove customs taxes on agricultural products with
its neighbor Syria.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon, which is recovering from its 1975-1990 civil war, is
attempting to restore its one-time reputation as a commercial
center in the region by promoting its free trade policy.
</P>
<P>
During the fair, Kuwaiti companies complained that they had
difficulties selling their products in Lebanon because of the
high customs rates.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon is imposing a 22 percent customs duty on industrial
products while in Kuwait it is 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries in 1997 stood at 77 million
U.S. dollars, of which 60 million dollars were Lebanese exports
to Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> African Police Urged to Fight Drug Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 19 (Xinhua) -- A Tanzanian official
has called on police forces of African countries to arm
themselves with necessary skills and join hands in fighting drug
traffickers, according to a press release reaching here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Time has gone when one country was able to combat this type
of crime alone, " Professor Philemon Sarungi, the Kilimanjaro
Regional Commissioner, said Friday in Tanzania's northern town of
Arusha.
</P>
<P>
Closing a five-day training seminar for drug law enforcement
personnel from eastern and southern African countries, Sarungi
pointed out that lack of properly trained law enforcement
officers diminished the chances of success.
</P>
<P>
He urged 30 drug personnel who attended the training course to
further improve efficiency in controling illicit drug business.
</P>
<P>
Sarungi said that close cooperation among police of different
states is not enough, and only skillful personnel have greater
chances of nabbing criminals.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the chairman of the seminar, Tanzania's Director of
Criminal Investigations Adadi Rajabu said: "We see this
particular training as a step forward toward a particular goal --
eradication of drugs trafficking."
</P>
<P>
The seminar came at a time when drug traffickers increasingly
turn Africa into a transit for their business.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was opened by Zanzibar Chief Minister Mohammed
Gharib Bilal Monday.

<P>
LUSAKA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The National Crime Foundation
of Zambia disclosed Saturday that 3,901 deaths and 15,140 serious
or permanent injuries were recorded in road accidents throughout
the country from 1994 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the foundations's workshop on the prevention of
crime in Zambia here, chairman of the organization Francis
Musonda said the driving of faulty vehicleso roads and other
factors have been leading to the decrease in the standard of
safety of the roads.
</P>
<P>
Musonda singled out bad driving habits and drunken driving as
the major problems causing major road accidents.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by the foundation has shown that awareness
of many road users on safety issues has declined, the Zambian
News Agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The one-day workshop was intended to mobilize community
resources, skill, talent and ideas to ensure that the Zambian
roads are safe.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Says Disarmament Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein's chief negotiator
Martin McGuinness said Saturday he believed the disarmament of
Northern Ireland's paramilitary organizations was possible.
</P>
<P>
However, McGuinness said decommissioning of arms could only
take place with the full implementation of the Northern Ireland
peace agreement on the political future of the province. The
agreement was reached last April by the main political parties in
the province.
</P>
<P>
This included the appointment of members of Sinn Fein, the
political wing of the Irish Republican Army, to seats in the new
Northern Ireland Executive, he said.
</P>
<P>
Terrorist arms are central to the future of the political
process in Northern Ireland. Over the past 30-year conflict, more
than 3,600 people have been killed by either the Protestant or
Catholic extremists.
</P>
<P>
McGuinness, who is Sinn Fein's go-between with the
international decommissioning body and the IRA, said, "Let's
understand that this process of removing the gun from Irish
politics is going to be a very lengthy one and very
problematical."
</P>
<P>
"I think it can be overcome and I think that we can, if all of
us come at this in a very sensible way, deal with the very complex
and sophisticated issues that are in there and they're best dealt
with in the context of removing the causes of conflict," he said.
</P>
<P>
McGuinness indicated that no progress could be made on
decommissioning until all the other terms of the peace agreement
had been met.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein has been facing increased pressure to deliver some
hand-over of IRA weapons. Northern Ireland First Minister David
Trimble, also the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, has
insisted that Sinn Fein cannot join the new executive until the
IRA gives up its arsenal.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses Turkey of Meddling in its Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Saturday accused
Turkey of interfering in its internal affairs, calling it
"unacceptable" and against the U.N. Charter and international laws
and principles.
</P>
<P>
The charge was made by a spokesman of Iraq's Ministry of
Culture and Information, in response to a statement made by a
Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman to the effect that northern
Iraq suffers from a power vacuum and needs a new administration.
</P>
<P>
"The statement of the Turkish official was a flagrant,
unacceptable interference in Iraq's internal affairs and a clear
violation of all the international laws and conventions," said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has been rendered ineffective in its control over
northern Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War, in which Iraqi troops were
defeated by U.S.-led allied forces. The U.S. and British forces
are imposing a "no-fly" zone there.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi spokesman said that Turkey has contributed since 1991
to the power vacuum in northern Iraq through providing military
base for the U.S. and British forces to interfere militarily and
illegally in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that the power vacuum would continue as long as Iraq's
central government was kept away from that part of the country and
that no new or provisional administration would be able to fill
the vacuum.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that Turkey's policy, which he said is hostile to
Iraq and other Arab countries, and its alliance with Israel, have
made it "but a tool of the U.S. strategy for the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
This goes against Turkey's own interests, he said. "What serves
Turkey's interests and stability is to pay attention to relations
with Iraq and the Arabs instead of alliance with the United States
and Israel," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that a final solution of the problem of northern Iraq
lies in the protection of Iraq's territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Turkey and Iraq have been tense since the
Gulf War when Turkey put one of its military bases at the disposal
of the U.S. and British forces for reconnaissance missions over
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkish troops crossed into northern Iraq many times since 1991
under the pretext of chasing rebels of the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party, who fight Ankara for an independent Kurdish state
across the border of northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq attacked the incursions as a violation of its sovereignty
and a threat to its security and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
The recent Turkish-Israeli alliance is another source of
tension between Baghdad and Ankara, as Iraq regards it a threat
targeting Iraq and the Arab nation.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Denies Arming Warheads With VX Gas Anew </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Iraq reaffirmed Saturday that
it did not arm its warheads with the deadly VX gas.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant General Amer Al-Saadi, an adviser to President
Saddam Hussein, told reporters here Saturday evening that the
samples that the Swiss and French experts had taken and analized
prove the validity of the Iraqi earlier statements.
</P>
<P>
The experts examined samples of more than 40 parts of warheads
under instructions of one of the representatives of the United
National Special Committee (UNSCOM) in charge of eliminating
weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Al-Saadi said the experts noticed that the French and Swiss
laboratories found no existence of the VX gas, adding that some
U.S. officials and the U.S. Department of Defense played down the
results of the findings of the Swiss and French laboratories.
</P>
<P>
The VX issue is the major obstacle in the chemical file,
according to Al-Saadi, and the results of the inspections will be
a positive step.
</P>
<P>
As for the recent crisis between Iraq and the UNSCOM, al-Saadi
said dialog was still going on with U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi high-level mission will leave for New York in the next
few days for talks with Annan as part of the consultations between
Annan and some U.N. Security Council members, the Iraqi official
added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the U.N. Security Council took tough action
against Iraq for freezing weapons inspections, suspending periodic
review of sanctions imposed on Iraq in 1990 after it invaded
Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Congo Accuses Uganda of Occupying Congo Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Congolese Information
Minister Didier Mumengi Saturday accused Ugandan armed men of
taking the northeastern town of Isiro but said they were chased
out by Congolese army later, a report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
"A small group entered Isiro from Uganda but today we have
confirmation that Isiro is in the hands of Congolese forces,"
Mumengi, spokesman for President Laurent Kabila's government, was
quoted by the report from Kinshasa as saying.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Kabila's senior political aide and cabinet minister,
Pierre-Victor Mpoyo, said Isiro, a strategic town northeast of
the third city Kisangani, had been seized by Ugandan troops.
</P>
<P>
"This is the work of Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni," Mpoyo
said. "The attackers are Ugandans. They know that we don't have
money to buy artillery to confront them."
</P>
<P>
However, Uganda denied the charge and said it had no troops
in Isiro, a town about 350 km west of Uganda's town of Arua and
200 km south of Sudan.
</P>
<P>
"Each time rebels are mentioned, Kinshasa substitutes Uganda
for the rebels," Uganda's Foreign Minister Amama Mbabazi said
in Kampala. "We have not been in Isiro," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Nobody could confirm the situation in the town, which is in
Oriental province as is Kisangani, Congo's third largest city,
taken by ethnic Tutsi rebels earlier.
</P>
<P>
Mpoyo said he expected the inhabitants of Isiro to resist
foreign occupation just as residents of Kinshasa had foiled a
rebel bid to take it in the last week of August.
</P>
<P>
"They took the town by force but how can they hold it without
the people's support? The army will go in, and if the army fails
to expel them the people will expel them."
</P>
<P>
Mpoyo said the Congolese government had already started
distributing arms for a "people's war" that would end in Rwanda.
He accused Kigali of invading to back the rebels who took up arms
to oust Kabila since August 2.
</P>
<P>
Mpoyo said allied troops from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia who
drove out rebels from the west of Congo (K) were not keen to be
involved in fighting in the east.
</P>
<P>
In Kinshasa Saturday, handicapped people and groups from
Oriental province marched through the city to express support for
Kabila and condemn what they called international indifference on
foreign invasion.

<HEADLINE> Anhui Vows to Score 10 Percent Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, September 20 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province
will certainly score a 10 percent economic growth rate despite of
severe floods this summer.
</P>
<P>
Provincial Governor Hui Liangyu made the remark recently in an
exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The summer floods killed 102 people, damaged 1.3 million ha. of
farmlands, destroyed over 270,000 houses, and affected a total of
15.72 million residents living along the Yangtze and Huaihe rivers.
</P>
<P>
The floods brought direct financial losses valued at 13 billion
yuan including 9.38 billion yuan in the farming sector to the
province, according to Hui, also secretary of the Provincial
Committee of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
Thank to the strenuous efforts of local people, no major
breaches have occurred on river dikes, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The governor attributed Anhui's flood-fighting success to the
remarkable achievements in building new homes and anti-flood
facilities built by the province since it was devastated by severe
floods six years ago.
</P>
<P>
Floods could bring about heavy losses as well as huge demands,
Hui said.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, severe floods brought direct financial losses worth
27.5 billion yuan to Anhui, but in the following six years, the
province achieved an average annual growth of 16.6 percent,
ranking among the fastest in all province-level areas in China, he
recalled.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1991 floods, the province carried out a well-planned
reconstruction program for homeless flood victims, he said, adding
the program has saved large tracts of cultivated land. The
rebuilding program won a U.N. prize in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the province has been readied for the summer
floods as leading government officials at all levels had been made
responsible for dangerous sections of river embankments.
</P>
<P>
Anhui's success has drawn nationwide attention. In late
August this year, a high-level conference attended by leaders
from flood-stricken provinces was held in Anhui to study its
flood-fighting and rebuilding experience.
</P>
<P>
The provincial leader expressed the hope that the floods could
serve as cohesiveness for local people to work harder in economic
fields.
</P>
<P>
Anhui is still among the underdeveloped areas in the country
but aims high, Hui said.
</P>
<P>
The province is now no longer an agricultural and
resource-rich province, as well as one of the most densely
populated areas in the country, according to Hui. Recent official
statistics show that more than 60 million people live in
Anhui which covers 135,000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, the province is expected to reach
the national average in terms of the gross domestic product (GDP),
according to Hui.
</P>
<P>
By 2010, Anhui's GDP is expected to exceed the national average
and the province is projected to become one of major industrial and
economic powerhouses in the country, he noted.

<HEADLINE> China Curbs Unfair Competition Among Local Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua) -- China has taken measures to
prevent escalating price wars among enterprises, in order to
curb profit losses by enterprises and drains of both taxes and
state properties, according to a senior government official.
</P>
<P>
Chen Bangzhu, vice-minister of the State Economic and Trade
Commission, says that China has become a buyer's market for many
industrial products like sugar, cashmere, engineering machinery
and soda ash.
</P>
<P>
However, some enterprises in have conducted unfair competition
by waging price wars to kick their competitors out and to slice
larger shares of the market.
</P>
<P>
The official explains that the price war has also caused
disorders in circulation of main industrial products, and the
profit rates of some industrial sectors have been declining.
</P>
<P>
What is worse is that most enterprises involved in
the price wars are state-owned ones, he says, adding that China's
efforts to pull state-owned businesses from the mud of
loss-making within three years might be aborted if the price
wars continued.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, local manufacturers of motor-driven farm-use vehicles
reported a total losses of more than two billion yuan in the
prices war, during which the state also lost 660 million yuan in
taxes.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that the practice of unfair competition and price
war has also been threatening the sound development of some
industries, and this problem has drawn serious concern of
the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has issued a circular demanding that
manufacturers reduce the output of products whose supply exceeds
demand, in order to stablize their prices and protect their
long-term interests.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the State Economic and Trade Commission has also set
"self-disciplined prices" for major manufactured goods, in a bid
to halt the rampant expansion of unfair competition and price war.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese government will not intervene the market,
and the "self-disciplined price" will never become a tool for the
government for intervention, Chen says.

<P>
Yang firmly carried out the CPC Central Committee's policies of
peaceful reunification and "one Country, two systems". He was
actively engaged in the work concerning Taiwan Authorities and
people and promoted the cause of China's Reunification by various
means.
</P>
<P>
He established extensive ties with patriotic public figures in
Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and overseas, which helped unite and win
support from them. At meetings with those figures, Yang often said
that although the two sides of the Taiwan Straits have been
separated for decades, reunification of the country is an
inevitable trend and represents the will of all Chinese people.
Taiwan's only option is to reunite with the mainland, and
practicing "one Country, two systems" is the best way to settle
the Taiwan Issue. He consistently called for the CPC and KMT to
engage in negotiations on an equal footing to realize "one
Country, two systems." He called on the Taiwan Authorities to
comply with the aspirations of the people to end hostilities and
remove obstacles in order to promote exchanges and economic
cooperation, and enhance the development of the relations between
the two sides. Yang's appeals had a major impact both at home and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
Yang was elected president of the People's Republic of China
during the first session of the 7th NPC in April 1988. He ignored
fatigue and conducted in-depth fact-finding missions to factories,
grass roots units, army units, construction sites and special
economic zones. He listened intently to suggestions voiced by
officials, common citizens and noted figures from various sectors
concerning economic development and the process of reform and
opening up. Yang also offered guidance for effective ways to solve
problems. Yang and and other Party and State leaders handled the
political turmoil between the Spring and Summer in 1989 and
maintained China's independence, dignity, security and
stability.

<HEADLINE> Main Opposition Leads in District Polls in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The main opposition
Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML)
repeated its feat by leading again in the district elections held
last Friday, results from eight of the 11 districts show.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML bagged four seats of chairmen in Dailekh, Surkhet,
Mugu and Jumla and five seats of vice chairmen. It won the
majority of the membership in the four districts with 12 other
members in Dang, Banke, Bardiya and Piuthan.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Nepali Congress (NC) followed with three chairman
posts and one vice chairman post.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML), which
broke away from the CPN-UML in March this year and joined the
government in late August, did not win a single key post so far.
</P>
<P>
It lost even in Bardiya district, the constituency of its
General Secretary Bam Dev Gautam where the NC and the CPN-UML
formed an alliance.
</P>
<P>
Eleven chairmen and 11 vice chairmen along with 177 members are
scheduled to be elected for the district development committees
(DDC) in the 11 districts of mid-western development region.
</P>
<P>
Counting is yet to be completed in Dolpa, Humla and Kalikot.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission said that polls were conducted
peacefully in all the 11 districts.
</P>
<P>
Political parties formed alliance with one another in the
elections, which are considered crucial for them in the general
elections due to be held before November 1999.
</P>
<P>
DDC elections in these districts should have been held last
year but were stalled because elections for village development
committees (VDC) there were not completed due to violence by the
ultra-leftist guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Polls were held last year respectively for VDCs and
municipalities in May and DDCs in July in 56 of the 75 districts
in Nepal, in which the CPN-UML won a landslide victory.
</P>
<P>
But most of the mayors, deputy mayors, DDC chairmen, vice
chairmen and members elected at that time have joined the CPN-ML.
</P>
<P>
As the CPN-ML and the splinter group of National Democratic
Party (RPP) led by former prime minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand
are yet to be recognized by the Election Commission as national
parties, their candidates contested the elections as independents.
</P>
<P>
An independent backed by RPP (Chand) won a vice chairman post
in Banke district.

Vietnamese Communist Party General-Secretary Do Muoi for his great
contribution to the development of friendly relations between the
two countries.
</P>

Yang joined other CMC leaders in actively merging and
reorganizing Military Area Commands, establishing a Group Army,
restructuring military colleges, founding the National Defense
University, modernizing China's naval and air forces, developing
strategic missile army units, and improving both militia and
military reserve units. He also joined them in putting stress on
major projects and in building well-trained elite troops, thus
enabling the PLA to achieve major progress in army building and
strengthening national defense.
</P>
<P>
Yang resolutely implemented Deng Xiaoping's strategic policy
decisions on reorganizing and streamlining the military.
</P>
<P>
In June 1982, he presided over a CMC forum and introduced
specific principles and reform measures concerning the size of
the military, streamlining command organizations, reducing and
merging redundant units and developing capable leadership.
</P>
<P>
Implementation of the Programs of Restructuring, Streamlining
and Reorganization of the PLA worked out by the forum helped solve
problems related to overstaffing. On the basis of cutting the size
of the army on several occasions, the CMC, with Yang taking charge
of its daily work, in 1985 successfully implemented the major
policy decision put forward by Deng Xiaoping to downsize the army
by one million active personnel, which was a glorious, but
nonetheless arduous task.
</P>
<P>
Yang also resolutely implemented Deng Xiaoping's theory
concerning the Party's absolute leadership over the army, and
engaged in unswerving efforts to enhance the Party's political
construction and organizational development in the army.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the army, while taking into account its own
reality, must implement the CPC Central Committee's decision on
the consolidation of the Party and directed related consolidation
work within the army. Yang's extensive efforts greatly enhanced
the Party's cohesion.
</P>
<P>
Yang took charge of formulating the CMC's Decision on Political
Work in the Army During the New Period, which clearly stipulated
related guidelines and major tasks. The decision pointed out that
"political work is the lifeblood of the army. Lifeblood in this
sense refers to 'guaranteeing' and 'serving' the construction of a
modern army and the fulfillment of various related tasks."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Passenger Trains to Run Faster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua) -- China will raise the speed of
passenger trains again as of October 1, without tick price
hikes, with trains running at an average speed of 71.6 kilometers
per hour, up 4.5 km from the current level.
</P>
<P>
The highest speed of trains on the three major lines --
railways from Beijing to Guangzhou, Beijing to Shanghai, and
Beijing to Harbin -- will reach 140 to 160 km per hour.
</P>
<P>
A high-speed train on the Guangzhou-Shenzhen line will run at
an average speed of 200 km per hour. Trains on the
Hangzhou-Nanchang, Houma-Yueshan, Baoji-Zhongwei, Nanning-Kunming,
and Wuwei-Urumqi railways will also run faster, Chang Guozhi,
chief dispatcher of the Ministry of Railways, told a press
conference today.
</P>
<P>
A new railway operational map will be implemented to cater to
the change. Chang said that in line with it, the number of
passenger trains will increase to 1,108 pairs from 966.5 pairs on
the existing map; that of express trains will reach 88.5 pairs, up
40.5 percent; that of fast trains will double the current figure
to 80 pairs, and that of "arrive-in-one-night" trains will reach
228, 164 more than the current figure.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will operate more passenger trains running between
large cities, short-distance trains, holiday trains, and special
trains for non-local workers, he added.
</P>
<P>
Railways in southwest China, an area with short transport
capacities, have been upgraded, with the annual carrying capacity
of Baoji-Chengdu railway increasing by 1.3 million tons, that of
Xiangfan-Chongqing line by 1.7 million tons, and that of
Zhuzhou-Guiyang and Guiyang- Kunming lines by 3.5 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-Kowloon railway will focus on cargo transport,
because its designed annual cargo transport capacity is 70 million
tons, but only 20 million tons are used currently. More cargo
trains will be operated on the line in the future, Chang said,
adding that the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway will focus on passenger
transport.
</P>
<P>
Tong Anyan, director of the Transport Bureau of the Ministry of
Railways, said that his ministry has spent more than six billion
yuan (722.9 million US dollars) in infrastructure, upgrading the
crossings on Beijing-Guangzhou, Beijing-Shanghai, and
Beijing-Harbin lines.
</P>
<P>
The speed of China's trains was raised on April 1 last year, in
order to meet the neeeds of the national economy and sharpen the
competitive edge of railways on the whole transport market.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to raise the speed of trains according to
market demands," Chang noted.

coalition Cabinet last week, Boris N. Yeltsin seemed to remain
largely in the background, adding to the growing impression that
the once-powerful President has been left with a largely
ceremonial role.

<HEADLINE> Nepal, India End Talks on Transit Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The secretary-level talks
between Nepal and India on renewing the transit treaty ended here
Sunday with good progress toward the finalization of the revised
treaty and its attached documents, the Nepali Ministry of Commerce
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The two sides agreed to complete negotiations on the renewal
of the Treaty of Transit before its validity expired on December
5, 1998," the ministry said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides agreed that the principle of free, uninterrupted
and permanent access to sea for Nepal was the basis for transit
arrangements," it said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that during the four-day preliminary talks led by
their commerce secretaries, the two sides exchanged views on
Nepal's proposal for automatic renewal of the transit treaty
signed seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
As a land-locked country, Nepal largely depends on the transit
routes through India for foreign trade. At present, there are 15
transit points for Nepal.
</P>
<P>
"The two sides agreed on measures to further smoothen movement
of Nepalese transit cargo through the Indian territory," the
Nepali ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that it was agreed that with the exception of
a small number of specified sensitive items of export, Nepalese
export traffic-in-transit would not require duty insurance cover.
</P>
<P>
It said that the two sides reiterated that the duty insurance
in respect to import traffic-in-transit of Nepal would be required
only for specified sensitive items.
</P>
<P>
"Mechanism for the realization of duty lost due to diversion of
goods in India was also discussed in the meeting," the ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, operating modalities relating to the Phulbari route,
which went into operation in September last year and provide Nepal
with an access to the Mongla port in Bangladesh through India,
were further clarified, it said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the Indian side agreed to allow the movement of
petroleum products along this route subject to safety
requirements.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also had a useful exchange of views on the
implementation of the Trade Treaty and the Agreement of
Cooperation to Control Unauthorized Trade, the ministry said.

eastward with Mao Zedong and was sent to join the battle in north
China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Yang was named director of the Political Department of the
Anti-Japanese Red Army University in June. The Red Army joined its
three major forces triumphantly in October and Yang was appointed
to a position as director of the Political Deptment of the General
Headquarters of the Front Committee of the CPC of the Red Army. A
short time later he participated in the Battle of Shanchengbao.
</P>
<P>
He became deputy director of the General Political Department

his suggestion for strengthening political and ideological
education in the Red Army.
</P>
<P>
Thereafter, he held leading posts concerning political work in
the army, and established a solid foundation for related political
and ideological development.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Sino-U.S Seminar on Intellectual Property Rights Closes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and U.S experts
expounded the relations between the protection of intellectual
property rights (IPR) and economic development during a seminar
that closed here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 150 experts also discussed the roles of the government,
enterprises and laws in protecting IPR and promoting economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was co-sponsored by the Chongqing municipal
government and the U.S. National Bureau of Asian Research.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, designed to intensify efforts to protect technical
inventions and handle the disputes in intellectual property
rights, was attended by experts and scholars from the academic
community and well-known enterprises such as Microsoft, IBM and
Legend of China.
</P>
<P>
Paul Liu, dean of Asia Pacific Legal Institute, noted that IPR
can spur economic development, which will in turn give IPR
higher additional values.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Qin Tianyuan from the Sichuan Provincial Academy of
Social Sciences said that China is facing two challenges in the
transitional period from an industrial economy to a
knowledge-based economy.
</P>
<P>
One is to catch up with the innovations in IPRs in the
international community; the other is to earnestly complete the
work to introduce the IPR system.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu, the National Bureau of Asian Research plans
to hold similar seminars in Shanghai and Beijing this year and
next year.

<HEADLINE> Year's Official Cotton Purchasing Prices Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The government-set cotton
purchasing prices in 1998 will remain unchanged so as to protect
the interests of cotton growers, according to a national
conference on cotton production, which closed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
On April 1 this year, the government lowered the price from the
previous 700 yuan per 50 kg to 650 yuan per kg, with the minimum
price set at 617.5 yuan per 50 kg, for province-level areas except
for the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
For Xinjiang, the official price was lowered to 600 yuan per 50
kg, from the previous 630 yuan, while the regional government was
authorized to set its own range of price fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
State-run supply and marketing cooperatives are the sole
cotton purchaser, processor and dealer in the country.
</P>
<P>
This year, the acreage of cotton fields stands at 4.43 million
ha., 133,333 ha. less than last year. Summer floods across the
country damaged the crop on some 233,333 ha. and, thus, are
expected to reduce the total output.
</P>
<P>
This year's cotton output is estimated at slightly lower than
last year's 4.3 million tons.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Turn Military Bases Into Civilian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 20 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is
planning to transform as many as 20 military bases around the
country into "economic develop hubs".
</P>
<P>
The Department of Public Works is negotiating with the World
Bank for one billion Rand (about 159 million U.S. dollars) to
fund the project, which was designed to create desperately needed
jobs, Business Times daily reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The redundant military bases will be set aside for land
reform, housing, commercial centers and industrial development,
Chief Director of State Property Holdings for the department, Gugu
Mazibuko, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The disposal of vast tracts of military land forms part of the
restructuring of the defense force, and coincides with the
planned closure of several large military bases and the proposed
retrenchment of about 30,000 permanent force members.
</P>
<P>
A task team made up of representatives from defense force and
public works departments, the non-governmental group for
environmental monitoring, has reportedly spent the past five
months finalizing a model for conversions.
</P>
<P>
The South African National Defense Force has about 60 large
military bases spread throughout the country, close to half of
which could eventually end up as major development initiatives,
the report said.

<HEADLINE> Released Iranian Drivers Return to Tehran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Five Iranian truck drivers
released by the Afghan Taliban militia arrived here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Iranians were set free by the Taliban on Saturday, Iran's
official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
The release came apparently as a result of Pakistan's mediation
after an unexpected visit by Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj
Aziz to Tehran on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During the one-day visit, Aziz promised to help defuse the
mounting tensions between Iran and the Taliban following the
killing of eight Iranian diplomats and an IRNA reporter.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan supports the Afghan student militia group.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian drivers were among the claimed 35 taken captive by
the Taliban as they carried foodstuffs and medicines to Afghan
refugees suffering from the ongoing civil war. But the Taliban
said they were caught shipping weapons and ammunitions to its
opposition in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Iran and the Taliban deteriorated last
month after the militia rounded up and killed eight Iranian
diplomats and a journalist after it took over Mazar-e-Sherif, an
opposition stronghold in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Iran is a supporter of the opposition of Northern Alliance.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban gave back to Iran the bodies of six diplomats and
the reporter on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Iran has massed more than 200,000 troops near the Afghan border
as domestic pressures for avenging the Taliban atrocities were
mounting.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani foreign minister has voiced Islamabad's readiness
to step up efforts to secure the return of the bodies of the
remaining two Iranian diplomats and the release of the Iranians
still held by the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Iran said that more than 30 Iranian nationals, mainly truck
drivers and aid workers, are still in the hands of the Taliban.

The Headquarters of the Third Army Corps of the Red Army came
under heavy bombardment by the enemy planes on April 25, and Yang
continued to direct battle operations in spite of sustaining
serious wounds.
</P>
<P>
On June 13, Yang together with Peng Dehuai led their troops
across Jiajin Mountain to protect the flanks of main forces of the
Central Red Army.
</P>
<P>
Yang attended the Lianghekou Meeting in late June after the
First and Fourth Red Armies succeeded in joining their forces. He
voiced resolute support for the CPC Central Committee's strategy

</P>
<P>
The Third Corps of the Red Army was reorganized into the Third
Army before long and Yang became the political commissar for the
Army.
</P>
<P>
He was named deputy director of the General Political
Department of the Red Army in August. He supported Mao's Right
Route Army and waged a resolute struggle against the splittist
activities of Zhang Guotao.
</P>
<P>
At critical moment, Yang and Ye Jianying devised an ingenious
plan to help Mao Zedong, other senior leaders and the bulk of
Central Red Army forces escape danger.
</P>
<P>
He attended an urgent enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau
of the CPC Central Committee in a Russian border area on September
12, and firmly backed the decision concerning errors committed by

He later served as deputy director of the Political Department
of the Shaanxi-Gansu Detachment of the Chinese Workers' and
Peasants' Red Army which formed on the basis of the old First and
Third Army corps of the Red Army and the Column of the Military
Commission.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Fighting Breaks out in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Heavy fighting broke out in
the Liberian capital Monrovia at the weekend, as government
security forces attempted to dislodge troops loyal to ex-warlord
David Roosevelt Johnson.
</P>
<P>
According to the Punch newspaper Sunday, the shooting began
Friday night when government troops moved on the residence of
Johnson at Camp Johnson Road, presumably to arrest him and his
troops which had been accused of plots to topple President
Charles Taylor.
</P>
<P>
Sounds of machine guns could be heard Friday night and
continued until early Saturday morning, the report said, quoting
Buari Ali, Press Secretary to the West African peace-keeping
force ECOMOG in Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
Security troops were being ferried to positions around Camp
Johnson Road and the Barclay training military barracks, as well
as Benson and Center Streets.
</P>
<P>
Liberia's Information Minister Joe Mulbah said in a special
broadcast that "dissident forces" were being round up following
sporadic exchange of gunfire.
</P>
<P>
He called on Monrovia residents not to harbor any dissident in
their midst.
</P>
<P>
This is the third attempt this year by Taylor to arrest the
ex-warlord, leading to heavy and sporadic shooting, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG troops, who had risen to such occasions in the
past, have apparently withdrawn from the troubled spots without
any official reason, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Roosevelt Johnson, leader of a faction of the United
Liberation Movement known as ULIMO-J, is a major rival of the
Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia during the Liberia's
seven-year civil war.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Yang Shangkun was a great
proletarian revolutionary, statesman, military strategist, staunch
Marxist and outstanding leader of the Party, state and the
people's army.
</P>
<P>
Yang, a dedicated revolutionary for more than 70 years, devoted
his life to the cause of the Chinese people's liberation and the
cause of construction. He also contributed greatly to the reform,
opening up and socialist modernization drive in the new era. Yang
Shangkun led a glorious life as a revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
He was born on July 5, 1907, in Shuangjiang Town, Tongnan
County, Sichuan Province, and the town is currently under the
jurisdiction of Chongqing Municipality. Yang entered the primary
school affiliated with Chengdu Higher Normal School in 1920, and
later attended the institution's subordinate middle school. Wu
Yuzhang served as president of the institution and Yun Daiying was
a teacher of the institution at the time.
</P>
<P>
Yang associated with many advanced young people during his
school years, and was a member of the social science reading
society. His initial introduction to Marxism came from reading
classic works such as the "Manifesto of the Communist Party" and
progressive publications including "New Youth".
</P>
<P>
Yang graduated from the Chengdu Higher Normal School in 1925 at
the age of 18 and returned to Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
The upsurge of China's Great Revolution was underway at the
time and Yang's early participation in revolutionary activities
was greatly influenced by his fourth elder brother Yang Yangong,
one of founders of the executive committee of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) in Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
Yang joined the Chinese Communist Youth League in 1925 and
became a member of the CPC in early 1926. Thereafter, Yang devoted
his lifetime to the liberation of the Chinese people and the
splendid cause of communism.

<HEADLINE> Five Freed Iranians Leave for Tehran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Five Iranians, released by
the Afghan Taliban Saturday, left for Tehran Sunday morning after
several months in detention in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The five Iranians were brought to Islamabad Saturday evening in
a special Pakistan air force plane from the southern Afghan city
of Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
Taliban leader Muhammad Omar had ordered the release of the
five Iranians two weeks after the release of the same number of
Iranians amid growing border tension between Iran and the Taliban
over the killing of Iranian diplomats in the northern Afghan town
of Mazar-i-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban had freed five Iranians on September 3.
</P>
<P>
About 40 Iranians are reported to be still in custody of the
Taliban. They were arrested when the Taliban militia overran
Mazar-i-Sharif, the stronghold of the anti-Taliban Northern
Alliance, on August 8.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban blamed the Iranians for bringing arms for the
Northern Alliance, while Iran said they had brought only
humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
Maulvi Rehmatullah, a senior Taliban representative in
Islamabad, asked Iran to take some practical steps following the
release of five Iranians and immediately withdraw its troops from
the border.
</P>
<P>
He said that deployment of troops by Iran near the Afghan
border has created tension in the whole region.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want second war with any country but desire to settle
differences through negotiations with Iran," he told reporters
here on return from Kandahar with the freed Iranians.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Claim to Have Occupied 40 Percent of Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 20 (Xinhua) --Rebels in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) claimed that 40 percent of the
country with a population of 16 million of people have been under
their control, Tanzania's "Sunday Observer" said.
</P>
<P>
A major leader of the rebels, Earnest Wamba dia Wamba,
who told the newspaper on Friday in a telephone interview from the
eastern Congolese town of Goma, asserted that the area under control
is larger than the total territories of Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Wamba said his 60,000-strong troops, battling 140,000 soldiers and
militia commanded by President Laurent Kabila, have controlled 10
towns and cities and are still marching forward on various fronts of
the third largest African country.
</P>
<P>
He said Goma, Kalemie, Kisangani, Bukavu, Beni, Butembo, Uvira and
Bunia have been captured, and their troops, have advanced beyond the
third largest city of Kisangani to the west. In addition, the rebel
troops are advancing to Kindu and heading towards the major business
town of Lubumbashi.
</P>
<P>
Wamba, who was a history professor with the University of Dar es
Salaam, had requested to leave between July 25 and August 9 for "attending
a meeting" but failed to return in time. He has been been sacked by
the university administration because of absenteeism.
</P>
<P>
Wamba was picked up last month to be a political leader of the
rebels. He said the war waged against Kabila is to bring democratic
change in the country.
</P>
<P>
It is said the professor, who went through a rough terrain during
the rule of Mobutu Sese Seko, was once placed behind bars for
being active in the opposition camp.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ugandan, Tanzanian and Zamibian Presidents held talks in
Entebbe in Uganda on Saturday, appealing for an immediate ceasefire in
the DRC.

<HEADLINE> Artist Destroys Printing Blocks to Make His Pictures Out of Print </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Lu Fang, a Chinese artist of
wood-block print, destroyed the printing blocks of his two
pictures today to make his works out of print.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-five-year-old Lu, from Chinese Academy of Fine Arts,
explained his deed which has never been done in China that he
wanted to prove that each of the two pictures has only 25 prints,
and therefore increase their value.
</P>
<P>
Wood-block print, a picture printed from an engraved or etched
plate, is an art form originated in China. Currently, a practice
in the international wood-block print circle is that artists must
promise to the society their pictures printed within a limited
number.
</P>
<P>
"Destroying the printing blocks is the best way to make the
promise," said Lu.
</P>
<P>
Both of the pictures feature the West Lake, a well-known scenic
spot in Hangzhou which is capital of east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 60 works of Lu, also in the subject of West Lake, were
on show in Hangzhou today, and two pictures have been housed in
the West Lake Traditional Chinese Painting Museum.

<TEXT>
<P>
Yang entered Shanghai University, an institution under Party
leadership, in the spring of 1926 and actively participated in
planning the first and second armed uprisings of Shanghai
workers.
</P>
<P>
He entered Moscow's Sun Yat-sen University in November that
same year and thereafter systematically studied theories of
Marxism and Leninism. He served as a class monitor and was a
member of the Party subcommittee and deputy director of the
university's propaganda department.
</P>
<P>
Yang and Li Bozhao were married in the Soviet Union in 1929,
and the following year he commenced postgraduate studies at the
Research Institute of Chinese Affairs. He also worked as a
translator for the Chinese representative of the Workers
International.
</P>
<P>
Yang returned to the motherland in 1931 at a time when the
nation was beset with deep misery. He served as director
of the Propaganda Department for the All-China Federation of Trade
Unions and as secretary of both the Party and Youth League of the
Shanghai Association of Trade Unions.
</P>
<P>
He worked diligently to reestablish trade unions and recruit
Party members in areas subject to the vicious control of the
Kuomintang.
</P>
<P>
After the September 18th Incident in 1931 that marked the
beginning of Japan's occupation of northeast China, Yang served as
director of the Propaganda Department of the Jiangsu CPC
Provincial Committee at the time, and later held a similar
position for the CPC Central Committee. His work centered on
directing workers movements and the anti-Japanese campaign for
national salvation.
</P>
<P>
Yang was assigned to the central revolutionary base area in
Ruijin, east China's Jiangxi Province, in January 1933. He served
as director of the Propaganda Department of the Central Bureau of
the Central Soviet Area and helped edit the Party's institutional
publications, including the "Red China" and "Struggle."
</P>
<P>
Yang was assigned in February to a position as head of the Red
China News Service, the predecessor to the Xinhua News Agency, and
in March became deputy president of the Marxism Communist
University founded by the Central Bureau for the Soviet Area.
</P>
<P>
He was assigned to the Chinese Workers and Peasants Red Army in
June and worked as director of the Political Department for the
First Front Army. Soon thereafter he was sent to the front-lines and
served under General Zhu De and Political Commissar Zhou
Enlai.

Yang became political commissar of the the Third Army Corps of
the Red Army in January 1934, and later in the month was elected
an alternate member of the CPC Central Committee during the Fifth
Plenary Session of the CPC Sixth Central Committee. He was also
elected a member of the Central Executive Committee of the
Chinese Soviet Republic.
</P>
<P>
He joined Third Army Corps Commander Peng Dehuai in winning a
series of decisive victories during the fifth anti-encirclement
campaign in the Central Soviet Area. He attached great importance
to coordination between units, properly handled various
contradictions and united his troops to fulfill all battle tasks.
</P>
<P>
Yang and Peng Dehuai led the Third Army Corps on monumental
Long March from Jiangxi Province beginning on October 17,
1934. The Third Army's success in breaking through four enemy
blockade lines won high praise from the Revolutionary Military
Commission under the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
In January 1935, Yang attended the enlarged meeting of the CPC
Central Committee's Political Bureau in the city of Zunyi in
southwestern Guizhou Province. He criticized Bo Gu and Li De for
serious command mistakes and expressed his full support to Mao
Zedong's correct view concerning the matter.
</P>
<P>
Yang and Peng exhibited great flexibility in carrying out Mao's
military strategies and tactics while leading the Third Army Corps
in many crucial battles. The Corps launched a successful offensive
to capture the Loushan Pass and joined the First Army Corps of the
Red Army in retaking Zunyi in the first significant victory won by
the First Front Army of the Red Army during the Long March.
</P>
<P>
The two commanders carefully assessed the rapidly changing
battle situation and offered several suggestions which were
adopted by Mao and the Central Military Commission. Yang and Peng
performed meritoriously to support China's revolution during a
critical period.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Ross Mission: Some Headway, No Breakthrough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Says U.S. Middle East peace
envoy Dennis Ross: "We have made some headway, but there is still
work to be done."
</P>
<P>
This most often-repeated line during his 11 days of shuttle
diplomacy in the region may well be used to sum up his whole trip,
which ended Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Quite interestingly, the most, if not the only, noteworthy
progress was made in his last-minute effort prior to his departure
for journey home.
</P>
<P>
After separate talks with Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu Saturday night, Ross was relieved to hear that the two
agreed in principle to hold direct talks.
</P>
<P>
Both Arafat and Netanyahu will be in New York later this week
to attend the 53rd General Assembly of the United Nations.
Washington has expected a summit to take place so the two could
seal a deal over the long overdue Israeli withdrawal from the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
This was actually the main goal of Ross' mission. But to avoid
possible embarrassment, Washington was so discreet as to refuse to
spell it out as Ross flew to the region on September 9.
</P>
<P>
In an exhaustive effort to bridge the gaps between the two
sides, Ross has held several rounds of talks with Arafat and
Netanyahu, as well as other senior Palestinian and Israeli
officials. He also paid short visits to Egypt and Jordan, the two
important mediators in the region, to brief their leaders on his
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Despite wild speculation and conflicting reports, Ross'
last-minute achievement did signal that some progress has been
made during his stay on the Israeli-Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations said that
although absent of an official agreement, the Palestinians have in
effect accepted the idea of a nature reserve on a 3 percent of
land in the Judean Desert to be turned over to them.
</P>
<P>
Israel proposed the nature reserve after it rejected an
American initiative which calls for a 13 percent Israeli
withdrawal from the West Bank, insisting that parts of the land be
under different treatment from the others.
</P>
<P>
The scope of the Israeli withdrawal has been one of the most
sticky point in the negotiations since the two sides resumed
direct talks two months ago. The Palestinians opposed to any
change to the U.S. proposal while Netanyahu's right-wing allies
threatened to topple him if he agreed to anything exceeding 9
percent.
</P>
<P>
To narrow Israeli and Palestinian differences over the status
of the nature reserve, Ross presented a formula under which the
nature reserve would meet what both sides are calling
"international standards," sources said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli sources said Netanyahu intended to appoint
National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon, one of the leading
hawk in the government, as foreign minister in exchange for his
approval of the 13 percent pullback.
</P>
<P>
On another outstanding issue of security cooperation between
Israel and the Palestinians, sources said that the Palestinians
appear ready to accept key ideas that Israel and U.S. put
together in an early July draft to enhance a memorandum of
understanding originally formulated last year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-brokered memorandum was signed in December but
Netanyahu rejected it, saying it was not detailed enough to be
effective. The July draft included some changes addressing
Israeli security concerns, but the Palestinians refused to endorse
it, blaming that the U.S. and Israel did it without consulting
them.
</P>
<P>
Ross also scored in reactivating Israeli-Palestinian
committees, which work on other interim issues such as a
Palestinian airport in Gaza and the safe passage between Gaza and
the West Bank, after they broke off four months ago.
</P>
<P>
Progress aside, however, the envoy returned to Washington
without a concrete agreement. Disputes still exist in many areas,
although Ross called them "technical issues."
</P>
<P>
The two sides are still bargaining over the responsibility the
PNA will have in the so-called "nature reserve;" they are
disputing over the security control over and the route of the
safe passage; the Palestinians said they have fulfill their
commitment to fight terrorism but Israel said it is not
enough. There are many uncertainties ahead.
</P>
<P>
But perhaps the only certainty is that a lot of work still
needs to be done before an agreement can be finalized, and thus a
real breakthrough in the peace process.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- High hopes are being raised
over possible discovery of crude oil in the northern part of
Nigeria as multi-national oil companies have increased
exploratory activities in the region.
</P>
<P>
Three oil companies operating in 21 blocks have drilled wells
over 2,500 square kilometers of seismic survey in Gombe, Plateau,
Bauchi and Adamawa states, according to a Sunday Times report.
</P>
<P>
Results of the data collected from these surveys suggest that
"several of the elements necessary for an oil accumulation may be
present" in the region, the report said, but officials have not
come to say categorically that oil had been found.
</P>
<P>
Oil companies operating in northern Nigeria include Shell
Nigeria Petroleum Nigeria Ltd., Chevron Petroleum Nigeria Ltd.
and ELf Petroleum Nigeria Ltd.
</P>
<P>
A top Chevron official told the paper that his company is
scheduled to commence drilling in three blocks before the end of
the year and is going ahead to drill its first exploratory well
during the last quarter of 1999 in its oil prospecting areas.
</P>
<P>
Chevron's Community Relations Manager, Deji Haastrup, who has
gone on a sensitization trip to its prospecting areas, said that
any success recorded during the drilling of wells would benefit
the company, the communities and the country as a whole.
</P>
<P>
By next year, Chevron would have committed more than 18
million U.S. Dollars into the search for the black gold north of
the Niger State in the country.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is a major oil producing country in the world with a
daily crud oil output at 2.3 million barrels. Enditm

<HEADLINE> Besenyei Cements Lead in Aerobatics Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Talented Peter Besenyei of
Hungary fortified his lead by claiming the second leg of the FAI
China Cup aerobatics grand prix here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The lanky 42-year-old Hngarian, who created knife-edge skill
which is now very popular in aerobatics, garnered 8.368 points to
win the second leg, building up his overall tally to 24.
</P>
<P>
The unexpected drizzle forced the cancellation of the
competition on Sunday. "The weather is too lousy and the
visibility is rather poor," said Jean Louis Monnet, Chief
Executive officer of Federation Aeronautique Internationale (FAI)
World Grand Prix of Aviation.
</P>
<P>
"So we had to cancel the competition today and the results of
yesterday's performance are final, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Nikolay Timofeev of Russia, who challenged Besenyei strongly
on Saturday, finished second on 8.308 with his overall tally up
to 20. Another Russian Viktor Tchmal came in third on 8.302 and
his overall tally increased to 16.
</P>
<P>
The winner of every leg will be awarded 12 points to the
overall tally, with the runner-up and third finisher takes 10 and
8, respectively.
</P>
<P>
"The pilots' scores are close," said chief judge Quintin
Hawthorne. "Besenyei is very experienced and his advantage is the
ability to interpret the accompanying music which is the main
part of the competition."
</P>
<P>
The drizzle failed to douse the local's craze for the
aerobatics performance, which become a smash hit here. Over 20
thousands spectators braved the rain to see the display of the
pilots and the Golden Dreams Aerobatic Display Team.
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe my eyes," said Chen Jiayan, a 15-year-old
sixth grader of Nanjing No.4 primary school. "The display is just
too excellent to believe and the 150 yuan (about 20 U.S. dollars)
I spent on the ticket is worthwhile"
</P>
<P>
The next leg of the grand prix will be held from 25 to 27
September in Ji'nan, the capital city of Shandong province in
east China.
</P>
<P>
The grand prix, which hailed by FAI president Eilif Ness as
the greatest festival of competitive aerobatics ever held, drew
the top 24 finishers of the world championships held last August.
</P>
<P>
The contestants, in the grand prix to be ended on November
2nd, will go on making tour matches and displays at Tianjing,
Shijiazhuang, Zhengzhou, Wuhan and Changsha.

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola Production Suspended in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Production of Coca-Cola and other
soft drinks at the plant of Zambia Bottlers, local manufacturer of
Coca-Cola Company, has been suspended because of poor sales following
the recent hike of their retail prices.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia Sunday quoted the Lusaka-based company's
highly-placed sources as saying that statistics showed that an average
of 80 percent of all products sent for marketing are returning to the
plant.
</P>
<P>
The sources, who did not clarify the date when the production was
suspended, said if the situation persisted and the company's talks
with the Zambian government on reduction of its excise duty flopped,
the management sector would be forced to take drastic measures such as
permanently laying off staff.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Bottlers increased Coca-Cola's retail price from 500 Kwacha
to 900 (one U.S. Dollars equals 2000 Kwacha) two weeks ago after the
government failed to honor an agreement concluded with the Coco-Cola
Company last May.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Zambian government would reduce the
company's excise duty from 25 to five percent while the company
pledged to invest 75 million dollars to expand its operations in the
country.
</P>
<P>
However, the Zambian government failed to keep its promise and the
Coca-Cola Company later decided to suspended its investment program
and raised the price of its drinks.
</P>
<P>
The price hike of the drink was followed by initially an estimated
30 percent fall in sales and the flooding of Zimbabwe-made Cokes into
the Zambian market last week.
</P>
<P>
Comparatively in the central African region, according to the local
paper, Zambia's tax regime ranks highest among five other countries
namely Zimbabwe, Malawi, Namibia, Botswana and Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Zambia charges 25 percent excise duty on all wholesale products,
17.5 percent value added tax on wholesale and another 17.5 percent on
all retail sales. However, Zimbabwe demands only 22.5 percent on
manufacturing, while Malawi charges on 20 percent on tax. And the duty
charged by other three countries ranges from 20 to 10 percent
altogether.

<HEADLINE> No Pupil May Be Expelled for Not Paying School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 20 (Xinhua) -- School fees in South
Africa are not compulsory and no action could be taken against
any pupil whose parents could not afford to pay, a senior
education department official said at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Mary Metcalfe, member of the Executive Council in Gauteng
Province's Education Department, said that no pupil may be
expelled from any school for not paying school fees.
</P>
<P>
She made the remarks in reply to a written question by the
opposition Democratic Party in legislature last week.
</P>
<P>
Metcalfe said it was the right of any pupil aged between seven
to 15 to attend public schools irrespective of their parents
ability to pay.
</P>
<P>
She said parents should also negotiate to pay a manageable
fee, but if parents were unable to pay school fees, they should
write to the schools' government body or discuss their problem
with the principal.
</P>
<P>
She said the failure to pay fees was no offence and did not
warrant suspension or expulsion, noting that only the head of
school department had the right to expel a pupil for school and
only for serious offenses.
</P>
<P>
However, she added, the provincial education department had
the right to intervene in public hcool and reverse the decision
to expel a pupil.

<HEADLINE> No "Counter-Productive" Actions: Indonesia Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Home Affairs
Minister Syarwan Hamid has urged all people to restrain themselves
from taking any "counter-productive actions" that can worsen the
current difficult situation, Antara news agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"It is better for us to build common vision to safeguard and
prevent the country from deepening economic crisis and work
together to restore security and order for the sake of peace and
prosperity," Hamid was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hamid made the statement in Ambon, capital of Maluku province,
late Saturday in response to reporters' questions about the
mounting students' protests against the government's measures and
policies in dealing with the country's current problems.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous country with more
than 200 million people, has been hit by the economic turmoil
since mid-1997 as a result of the regional financial and economic
crisis which flared up in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Students in Jakarta and other cities held rallies this month to
protest the spiraling prices of basic commodities. They urged
President B.J. Habibie to take concrete measures to resolve the
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after Brig. Gen. Paula Renyaan was
installed as Maluku vice governor, Hamid said the best way for
people to face the current situation is to restrain themselves
from taking any "counter-productive actions" which would damage
the country's credibility abroad.
</P>
<P>
On the government's political agenda, he said the government
has clear items in its agenda which will consistently be carried
out.
</P>
<P>
The agenda items include the holding of a special session of
the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), the country's highest
legislative body, in November this year, a general election in May
1999 and the MPR's general assembly at the end of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Permanent Monitoring in Iraq Goes on Smoothly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. permanent monitoring
system in Iraq is running on smoothly with no problems at all, a
U.N. source said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Iraqi News Agency, Neils Karlston,
director of the U.N. Special Commission on disarming Iraq, said
the monitoring system is still working undisturbedly and the
monitoring inspectors are doing their job at Iraqi sites every day.
</P>
<P>
He added that the cooperation between Iraq and the commission
is smoothly going on.
</P>
<P>
Iraq decided to suspend cooperation with UNSCOM on August 5,
demanding lifting oil embargo, recomposing the special commission
and moving its headquarters from New York to Vienna to avoid
U.S. influence.
</P>
<P>
It also announced that the permanent monitoring would be
allowed to go ahead in a bid to show good intentions and refute
interpreting the Iraqi decision as a non-commitment to the
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi people are suffering from the eight-year-old,
crippling U.N. economic sanctions imposed after Baghdad's troops
invaded Kuwait in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Allocates 912 Million Dollars for Post-Flood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
allocated 42.88 billion taka (about 912.34 million U.S. dollars)
for post-flood rehabilitation programs in the country.
</P>
<P>
The funds would be generated through readjusting the Annual
Development Program (ADP) and the donors' aid, to reconstruct
infrastructure damaged by floods and create jobs in rural areas,
The Bangladesh Observer daily reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken at a high-level meeting on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
State Minister for Planning Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir said the
meeting did not slash the ADP size at 136 billion taka (2.89
billion dollars) for 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
"The size of the ADP would remain the same but it has been
re-focused towards rehabilitation programs," Alamgir was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Funds from less important projects would be diverted to
projects directly involved in rehabilitation schemes, he said.
</P>
<P>
The most important task was to implement the massive
reconstruction and rehabilitation work so that people could get
job in the rural areas, and gratuitous relief and vulnerable group
feeding would continue in the affected areas, according to the
state minister.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina directed
ministries concerned to start immediately Food-for-Work and Test
Relief in the affected areas for providing employment
opportunities to the jobless poor, wherever flood water receded.
</P>
<P>
She laid stress on creating employment opportunities in the
rural areas by starting reconstruction and repair of the damaged
roads, bridges and culverts, schools, colleges and clinics.
</P>
<P>
The government's agriculture rehabilitation program included
ensuring availability of seeds and fertilizer free of cost, and
providing cash help to the farmers, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The government earlier announced a 32 billion-taka (680.85
million dollars) farm loan program for the flood-affected farmers.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has been badly hit by flooding this year, with
three-fourths of its territory inundated and nearly 30 million of
its 127-million population seriously affected, causing an
estimated loss of over 3.4 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> China Develops Hour-by-hour Plan for Gymnastics Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese organizers of
the 1999 Gymnastics World Championships reported an hour-by-hour
"extraordinarily advanced plan" for the tournament to be held
here next year to the visiting officials from the International Gy
mnastics Federation (FIG) on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Hardy Fink, president of the Men's Technical Committee (MTC),
and Jackie K. Fie, president of the Women's Technical Committee
(WTC), attended the one-hour-and-a-half in-depth presentation
which explains the preparation work for the coming Gymnastics
Worlds.
</P>
<P>
The inspecting top FIG officials, who will also stay out the
six-day China Cup tournament which starts tomorrow, both said
they are very much impressed by China's advanced plan.
</P>
<P>
"It is a very well-prepared plan," said Fie, "I'm very happy
about that."
</P>
<P>
"I have to say it's an extraordinarily advanced plan. I'm
grateful for your particular hard work," Fink added.
</P>
<P>
The competition schedule was an hour-by-hour one which
features opening ceremony, closing banquet, team and individual
competitions, award ceremonies and even break time for judges and
gymnasts between sessions.
</P>
<P>
The nine-day tournament, slated for october 8-16 in 1999,
still has an entire year away from now.
</P>
<P>
Miao Zhongyi, director of the competition department, said
they made a maxium programme as they think the 1999 Worlds would
attract an unprecedented number of participating countries.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin organization committee had earlier confirmed they
would pay for accommondation of participating gymnasts.
</P>
<P>
But both Fie and Fink told the organizers that they reserve
the right to manipulate the schedule "in a fair way" and make
some adjustments since they don't think there will be so many
entrances in the first place and "a less strenuous and less full
programme" would be more fitting.
</P>
<P>
In the financial part of the plan, the budget for the 1999
Worlds, which has been nation-wide billed as the last big sports
gala held in China in the 20th century, will hit 60 million yuan
(about 7.5 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
From tomorrow, the two FIG technical presidents will be shown
around Tianjin Sports Center, the site for next year's Worlds,
which includes an 8,000-seat main competition hall, a training
hall and a warmup hall, the longest walk between the three halls
only 50 meters. The Center also provides a comprehensive service
center for gymnasts, reporters, judges and officials.
</P>
<P>
Four hotels have been set aside exclusively to the
tournament's use, including tow five-stars for FIG officials, one
four-star for reporters and one three-star for gymnasts, with the
longest distance to the Center being two kilometers.
</P>
<P>
"We will listen carefully to FIG's feedback opinions and make
further improvements to our programme," Miao said.

in the late 10th round.
</P>
<P>
"He hit me when I was down," said the 25-year-old Bean said,
"The ref didn't do his job. I know I was on his home turf. He
hit me right on the temple. The ref could have stepped in."
</P>
<P>
"I've got to take advantage of every opportunity I get,
because he's a good fighter," said Holyfield, who will be 36 on
Octocer 19. "I just turned and hit him. That's part of the boxing
game."
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Holyfield Wins Decision over Bean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Evander Holyfield beat a
tough Vaughn Bean with a decision win in the heavyweight boxing
title fight on Saturday night in the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Holyfield, looking at times like an old fight, knocked Bean
down in the 10th round and won a unanimous decision over the
challenter before 41,357 home fans.
</P>
<P>
While Bean was fighting only his eighth opponent with a
winning record, Holyfield showed guile that comes from long years
of experience in the competition.
</P>
<P>
Bean pushed Holyfield into the ropes late in the 10th round
when the champion suddenly sidestepped Bean and flung him into
the ropes with his left arm. Holyfield landed a right to his
rival's head that floored him for a seven-count.
</P>
<P>
"He hit me when I was down," Bean said."The referee didn't do
his job. I know I was on his hometown. He hit me right on the
temple. The referee could have stepped in."
</P>
<P>
"I've got to take advantage of every opportunity I get,
because he's a good fight," said Holyfield, who will bed 36 on
October 19."I just turned and hit him. That's part of the boxing
game."
</P>
<P>
Bean was ranked No. 1 by the IBF and was Holyfield's mandatory
challenger. Last March, Bean lost an IBF title bid against
then-champion Michael Moorer on a 12-round majority decision.
This time the decision wasn't close.
</P>
<P>
Judge Duane Ford scored it 116-111, while Al De Vito and Leroy
Brown each had it 117-111 for Holyfield. Holyfield found the
awkward Bean much tougher than most observers thought he would be.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't come in overconfident, " Holyfield said. "I hit him
with good shots. He also hit me with good shots. You have to give
the man credit. The man came to fight. He's much better than
people gave him credit for. This was his day to shine."
</P>
<P>
Holyfield earned at least 5 million dollars for his 36th
victory against three defeats. He had 25 knockouts.
</P>
<P>
Bean lost for only the second time against 32 wins. His purse
was 1.8 million for his second IBF title bid.

<HEADLINE> Zhuhai Enjoys Steady Export Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The south China city of Zhuhai
recorded steady export development for the January-August period
in spite of the adverse influences of the financial crisis
gripping Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The city's exports grew by 8.7 percent during the first eight
months when compared to the previous year's period.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade enterprises enjoyed a 41.5 percent rise in
exports to 854 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Zhuhai enterprises have engaged in extensive efforts to
optimize their product mixes and currently export products to 94
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The 7.2 percent decline in exports for foreign-funded
enterprises will quite likely put added pressure on the city's
export sector.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Take Action on NLD's Parliament Convening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government has
warned the National League for Democracy (NLD) that the party
could face serious action if it tried to convene a parliament
unilaterally, according to an official Information Sheet issued
here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar Ambassador to the United States U Tin Winn, in an
interview with the Myanmar Monitor published in Washington DC
Tuesday, said the unilateral action is not only unlawful but also
treacherous according to the country's criminal codes.
</P>
<P>
"In order not to have to take drastic action, like outlawing
the NLD and arresting leaders of the party, the authorities have
tried to diffuse the situation by inviting some NLD members from
outside of the Yangon area to come to the guest house and discuss
the situation and the NLD's intention," he said.
</P>
<P>
A People's Parliament Elected in the 1990 Multi-Party General
Election of Myanmar was unilaterally formed here Wednesday with U
Saw Mya Aung, chairman of the Rakhine League for Democracy (RLD),
as chairman of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
A 10-member Representing Committee of the Parliament Elected in
the Election (RCPEE) was also formed earlier on Wednesday to
arrange for the convening of the People's Parliament. NLD Chairman
U Aung Shwe was chosen as the committee's chairman with U Than Tun
and U Aye Tha Aung as secretaries. Other members include U Tin Oo,
the NLD vice-chairman, and Aung San Suu Kyi, NLD's general
secretary.
</P>
<P>
The ruling State Peace and Development Council on Friday poured
scorn on moves by the opposition "People Parliament" to take over
the government, declaring that it will continue to rule the
country.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Wishes to Restore Relations With U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar wishes to restore
traditionally good relations with the United States and get them
back on track, according to an official Information Sheet issued
here Sunday, quoting Myanmar's Ambassador to the U.S. U Tin Winn.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed by the Myanmar Monitor published in Washington DC
Tuesday, U Tin Winn said: "The current state of U.S.-Myanmar
relations are at their lowest ebb."
</P>
<P>
For restoration of the two countries' relations, he called for
Washington's recognition that the present Myanmar government --
the State Peace and Development Council -- is acting in the
interest of the nation and the people.
</P>
<P>
He urged Washington to have a better appreciation of the recent
history of Myanmar, especially the reasons for the military's
leading role, saying that Myanmar's Armed Forces are "different"
from others' in the world.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. should realize that democracy cannot be built in a
day, in a month or in a year," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that there are many fields where the two
countries can cooperate with each other such as narcotic drug
suppression, health, education and exploration of natural
resources.
</P>
<P>
As a first step, the U.S. should seriously consider lifting
sanctions, otherwise it would be very difficult for them to
cooperate in the economic field, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar is also complaining that the U.S. is
blocking loans to the country from all international financial
institutions including the World Bank, the International Monetary
Fund and the Asian Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. imposed economic sanctions on Myanmar in May 1997,
banning new investments in the country.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. companies have reportedly begun withdrawing their
investments in Myanmar since 1996. Those already pulled out
include the Pepsi-Cola, Eddie Bauer, Liz Claiborne and Texaco Oil
Company.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Atlantic Richfields Oil Company of the
U.S. also decided in August to follow suit in the near future.

<P>
TIRANA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment continued
to flow into Albania despite the political turmoil which has been
striking the country over the past week, the Albanian Telegraphic
Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Albanian Minister of Public Works and Transport Gaqo
Apostoli, the agency said that foreign investment in Albania has

"Some 21 million ECU (about 24.36 million U.S. dollars) are
allocated for the Durres-Rrogozhina highway project while 20
million ECU (about 23.2 million dollars) for the
Rrogozhina-Elbasan highway project and another 6 million ECU (about
6.96 million dollars) for Milot-Lezhe," he said.
</P>
<P>
Work on the Durres-Rrogozhina axis is being done by

The bill also proposes some cost-saving plans for the national
railway service and the Post Office.
</P>
<P>
It also suggests the number of civil service employees be cut
by one percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Italian Premier Romano Prodi hopes that the budget bill could
win approval from Communist Refoundation Party leader Fausto
Bertinotti, who has threatened to withdraw his support from the
government unless it changes its social policies drastically.
</P>
<P>
Prodi's center-left coalition relies on the hard-left parties'
34 deputies in the Lower House to pass legislations, including the
budget.
</P>
<P>
Bertinotti has been demanding for months that the 1999 budget
should do more to promote jobs and support the poor. He said if
the budget fails to satisfy his demands, he will switch over to
the opposition, which will bring down the coalition government.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Demand on Chinese Export Packaging Blamed Unfair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. ban on Chinese
exports packed in untreated wood crates is unreasonable and will
hurt the interests of both the U.S. and Chinese peoples, the
"China Daily" quoted an expert on Sino-US relations as saying here
today.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Shijian, vice-president of the China Chamber of Commerce of
Metals, Minerals and Chemicals Importers and Exporters called the
request of the United States an excessive one, which actually
relates to the trade imbalance issue between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Agricultural Department of the United States recently
announced its intention to ban goods in untreated solid-wood
packaging from China to prevent entrance of Asian Long-horned
beetles into the country.
</P>
<P>
"Such beetles do exist in China, but they are also widespread
in other countries such as Russia, Japan and Southeast Asian
nations," said an official from the State Administration for
Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine. "Why should Chinese exports
be singled out for refusal?"
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side admitted that the long-horned beetle is native to
China, South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the United States say around 16-20 billion US
dollars in Chinese exports will be affected if the regulation goes
into effect.
</P>
<P>
Estimates by the Chinese Government on the volume of exports
involved are as high as 30-40 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
This would account for 50-65 percent of China's annual export
volume to the United States.
</P>
<P>
If China does as the U.S. demands, the consequent zoom in
export costs will also lower Chinese products' competitiveness
significantly.
</P>
<P>
As a result, U.S. consumers will find themselves unable to buy
cheap, good-quality Chinese goods, said Zhou Shijian.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trade deficit with China increased to 16.4 billion US
dollars in 1997 from 10.5 billion US dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
China has made considerable efforts, such as sending trade
delegations to the United States to make large-scale purchases, to
alleviate the surplus problem, while the U.S. government still
erects barriers against American companies wishing to export
high-technology products to China.

SAN JOSE, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Migration authorities of
Costa Rica deported 50,000 illegal Nicaraguan immigrants in
August, the "La Nacion" daily reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the Migration Office as saying that the number

Nicaraguans.
</P>
<P>
Deportations will continue, Public Security Minister Juan

But he denied the possibility that the Costa Rican government
will massively deport Nicaraguans illegally living and working in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Unofficial statistics show that 600,000 to one million
Nicaraguans are now living in Costa Rica, about 500,000 of them

PRAGUE, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Slovakia's gross domestic
product (GDP) grew 6.1 percent to 347.8 billion koruna (about 10.2
billion U.S. dollars) in the first half of this year over the same
period of last year, the Slovak Statistics Bureau announced Sunday.

<P>
The bureau predicted that the annual GDP growth rate will stand
at 5.6 percent in 1998, the fifth year of continued growth from
1994.
</P>
<P>
The Slovak economic situation has been the best one of the 12
central east European countries thanks to the measures taken by
the state to push the market economy, strengthen the macroeconomic
regulation and adjust the industrial structure after separating
from Czechoslovakia in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The country also improved its taxation policy to encourage
export and attract foreign investment.

<HEADLINE> Emergency to Be Extended in Chiapas, Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The state of emergency
will last one more week in some part of the southern Mexican state
of Chiapas, where hunger and epidemics have occurred, humanitarian
agencies said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Authorities and non-government organizations maintain different
versions about the effects of the rains on the coast of Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
The central government said that 172 people died and about 400
were missing, while the municipal authorities reported at least
413 deaths and more than 650 people missing.
</P>
<P>
But both agreed that the final casualties would possibly surpass
one thousand.
</P>
<P>
Despite the subsiding water level, it was still impossible to
reach many isolated areas, making estimation of damages difficult.
</P>
<P>
Rescue groups were busy burying the dead to prevent the spread
of diseases.
</P>
<P>
Denying any outbreak of cholera or plague, the government
admitted that there were cases of conjunctivitis, dermatitis,
diarrhea and gastrointestinal affections.
</P>
<P>
The Chiapas Sanitation Overseeing Committee said that 2,023
doctors and nurses are now attending victims in refuges and
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Felipe Arizmendi, bishop of the Tapachula diocese, said on
Friday that there was famine in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Social Security Mexican Institute opened mobile stores to
step up supply of necessary staples and to distribute 470 tons of
food that have reached the town of Puerto Madero in Tapachu.
</P>
<P>
The National Liberation Zapatista Army, which some days ago
announced it would donate money to flood victims, on Friday night
sent 10 tons of corn to the Motozintla municipality, one of the
most damaged.

<HEADLINE> China Accelerates Hydropower Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua) -- China has drawn a blueprint
for constructing four large hydropower projects by 2010, and four
big power firms are to be organized to run them by the State Power
Corp, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The projects include the Gongboxia Hydropower Station, with an
installed capacity of 1.5 million kilowatts; the Laxiwa Hydropower
Station, with an installed capacity of 3.72 million kilowatts; the
Longtan Hydropower Station on the upper reaches of the Hongshui
River in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, with a capacity of 5.4
million kilowatts; the Xiaowan Hydropower Station on the Lancang
river in Yunnan Province, with a capacity of 4.2 million kilowatts;
and the Sanbanxi Hydropower Station on the Yuanshui River in Hunan
Province, with a capacity of 1.5 million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
The total investment to the projects is estimated at 60 billion
yuan (7.23 billion US dollars), according to Zhang Xuezhi, director
of the hydropower development department with the State Power Corp.
</P>
<P>
China's hydropower capacity accounts for only 24 percent of the
country's total power generating capacity. Seventy percent of
electricity is generated by coal-fired stations, seriously
polluting the air and increasing transportation costs.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Planning Commission is considering
separating the operation of grids from that of power plants,
thereby creating a fair competitive environment for power
producers. Currently, a regional power corporation supervises
both power plants and local grids.
</P>
<P>
Experts say this reform will be a significant step for the
monopoly power sector towards market competition, and help pave
the way for direct foreign investment in hydropower production.
</P>
<P>
China has exploitable hydropower potential of 378 million
kilowatts, the largest in the world. However, only 15 percent has
been exploited, compared with 50-90 percent in the West.

<HEADLINE> Analysts Clear Up Investment Confusion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua) -- observers confused by the
astounding investment plan announced earlier this month by a
senior Chinese official should check definitions of Chinese
economic terms, the "China Daily" quoted a veteran investment
researcher at the State Development Planning Commission as saying.
</P>
<P>
State Councillor Wu Yi said during a recent national trade fair
in Xiamen that China's investment volume during the 1998-2000
period would top 10 trillion yuan(1.2 trillion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The figure mystified many observers, who wondered how the
government could foot such a monumental bill.
</P>
<P>
"I think Wu was referring to fixed assets investment, which
covers not only investment from the government, but also from the
State firms and the non-State sector, which includes individuals
and foreign investors,"said Zhang Hanya, director of SDPC's
Investment Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used not only for infrastructure, because the
term "fixed assets investment" has a very broad definition which
also covers investment for plant construction, industrial
upgrading, and construction of State and private property, and
even investment for natural resources exploration, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
China's fixed assets investment totalled 2.53 trillion yuan
(304 billion US dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
The figure put forward by Wu indicates the country needs to
pursue a 15 percent annual growth rate in fixed assets investment
between 1998 and 2000 - a rate well above the original ten percent
proposed by the government for the period, but much smaller than
those registered during the first half of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Wu's announcement implied that the government will rely more on
fixed assets investment to sustain economic growth than it had
originally anticipated.
</P>
<P>
Although the government's input will account for a very small
fraction of the total investment, demand generated by
government-funded projects will prompt State companies and
non-State firms to launch new ventures and push the total
investment growth to the new projected volume, experts
said.

<HEADLINE> Albanian Opposition Supporters Continue Demonstration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Supporters of Albania's
opposition Democratic Party continued their rallies in the capital
while a European delegation was negotiating a solution to the
crisis with Albanian political leaders on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
They demanded Prime Minister Fatos Nano resign.
</P>
<P>
The European delegation began a short visit to Tirana Saturday
morning to negotiate with Albanian political parties a solution to
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The delegation consisted of Greek Alternate Minister of Foreign
Affairs a Council of Europe (CE) Ministers' Committee President
George Papandreou, CE Secretary General Daniel Tarchys and Polish
Foreign Minister and Chairman of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Borislaw Geremek.
</P>
<P>
A diplomatic source said that the European delegation was not
optimistic about a quick solution to the crisis because of the
Berisha's stand.
</P>
<P>
The source said Berisha refused to accept the options offered
by the European delegation in the talks, which was held in the
Council of Ministers headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Berisha told the press Saturday that he will only agree to a
"political solution," which will oust what he called "the
new-dictatorship through democratic ways."
</P>
<P>
He has invited his supporters to visit the graveyard of a
leading opposition deputy, Azem Hajdari, who was killed one week
ago near the Democratic Party headquarters, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The CE threatened on Saturday to isolate Albania's Democratic
Party leader Sali Berisha if he continues with his tactics of
undermining government institutions.
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to say to Sali Berisha that his and his party's
tactics have undermined the democratic institutions, and if they
continue, it is certain the international community will isolate
not only his tactics but also him personally," Papandreou said at
a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
"The (international) community is determined to help Albania
and support the efforts of its legitimate government to overcome
this situation," Papandreou said.
</P>
<P>
Geremek said that the place of the opposition is in parliament,
not in prison and not in street dormer president Sali Berisha.
</P>
<P>
The delegation condemned the violence against government
institutions and and urged the Albanian government to bring to
justice the killers of Hajdari, whose assassination caused the
crisis.

<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Colombia
guerrilla group National Liberation Army (ELN) freed seven
kidnapped mayors Saturday, making progress in the peace process
agreed on by the Colombian government and the guerrilla group.
</P>
<P>
The release was announced Friday after ELN leaders Francisco
Galan and Felipe Torres held a meeting with representatives of the
Senate's Human Rights Commission in the northeast state of
Antioquia, where the mayors were kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
The release was described as "a show of good will" when the two
ELN leaders and the National Peace Council (CNP) representatives
formed a preparatory commission on Monday for a "National
Convention," a condition raised by the ELN for future peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The "National Convention" was one of the points agreed on July
15 in Mainz, Germany, after a three-day meeting between the ELN,
the second biggest guerrilla group in the country, and the
Colombian civil society.
</P>
<P>
The ELN also agreed to release Senator Carlos Espinosa next
Tuesday, who was abducted in early August, and four other mayors
will be freed at an undetermined site east of Antioquia.

<HEADLINE> Council of Europe Threatens to Isolate Berisha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Council of Europe (CE)
threatened on Saturday to isolate Albania's Democratic Party
leader Sali Berisha if he continues with his tactics of
undermining government institutions.
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to say to Sali Berisha that his and his party's
tactics have undermined the democratic institutions, and if they
continue, it is certain the international community will isolate
not only his tactics but also him personally," Greek Alternate
Minister of Foreign Affairs George Papandreou said at a press
conference here.
</P>
<P>
Greece currently holds the presidency of the Council of Europe
Ministers' Committee.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou, CE Secretary General Daniel Tarchys and Polish
Foreign Minister and Chairman of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation n Europe (OSCE) Borislaw Geremek began a short visit
to Tirana Saturday morning to negotiate with Albanian political
parties a solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The (international) community is determined to help Albania
and support the efforts of its legitimate government to overcome
this situation," Papandreou said.
</P>
<P>
The European delegation condemned the violence against
government institutions and and urged the Albanian government to
bring to justice the killers of the leading opposition leader Azem
Hajdari, whose assassination caused the crisis.
</P>
<P>
It said that it supports all initiatives by Albanian President
Rexhep Mejdani to reach consensus and political settlement.
</P>
<P>
Geremek said at the press conference that the place of the
opposition is in parliament, not in prison and not in street
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
A diplomatic source said that the delegation was not optimistic
about a quick solution to the crisis because of the stand of the
opposition leader and former president Sali Berisha.
</P>
<P>
The source said that Berisha refused to accept the options
offered by the European delegation in the talks, which was held in
the Council of Ministers headquarters on Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
The delegation was expected to hold a joint press conference
with Albanian political leaders at 2:30 p.m. local time after they
concluded the talks.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Javanese Eagle on Brink of Extinction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Dwindling natural forests
pose one of the threats to Indonesia's Javanese eagle whose
population is now estimated at only 250 to 300, Antara News Agency
reported on Sunday, quoting a conservation group.
</P>
<P>
Rampant hunting and illegal trading have also hindered the
conservation of the endangered birds, the Working Committee for
Javanese Eagle Conservation said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 alone, a number of non-governmental organizations found
at least 22 Javanese eagles traded at bird markets in various
cities on Java island, the committee said.
</P>
<P>
The illegal but lucrative trade in Javanese eagles has
encouraged the hunting of the bird species.
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the threats to the conservation of the national
animal," the committee said.
</P>
<P>
Javanese eagles were first found in 1870, and named after its
discoverer M. Bartels Sr.
</P>
<P>
Many people keep the Javanese eagle as a pet because this bird
species is also known as "Garuda" (mythical bird).
</P>
<P>
According to the Red Data Book issued by the Union for
Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, Javanese eagles are
endangered bird species with the high risk of extinction.

<HEADLINE> Honduran Army Placed Under Civilian Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Honduran Congress
voted on Saturday to take away autonomy from the armed forces and
put them under civilian control.
</P>
<P>
The 128-seat National Assembly voted unanimously for a
constitutional revision proposed by Honduran President Carlos
Flores Facusse.
</P>
<P>
The Honduran armed forces had ruled the country for 41 years
until 1941, when under pressure from the United States, civilians
were allowed to run for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
But the army continued throwing their weight around. Civilian
presidents have been thwarted in their efforts to control the army
even when the army were charged with human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
Civilian courts were barred from trying army officer. The
situation started to change five years ago when the army agreed to
allow civilian courts to try their officers.
</P>
<P>
The constitutional revision also eliminated the authority of
the commander-in-chief, which had in the past overthrown a number
of presidents, either civilian or military.

<HEADLINE> Anhui Province To Build Billion-Yuan Reservoir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Construction of a reservoir on
a tributary of the Yangtze River which will cost more than one
billion yuan will soon begin in east China's Anhui Province, the
first water conservancy projects since the end of this year's vast
flooding.
</P>
<P>
Located in the city of Ningguo, the Gangkouwan reservoir will be
built on the Shuiyang River and will be one of the largest water
conservancy projects ever in the province.
</P>
<P>
The reservoir is expected to have 1,120 square kilometers of
drainage areas, and will have a storage capacity of 941 million
cubic meters of water, with normal water levels reaching 135
meters.
</P>
<P>
The project will submerge nearly 1,586 hectares of cultivated
land and require the resettlement of more than 18,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Since New China was founded in 1949, more than 20 major floods
have occurred in the Shuiyang River Valley, costing tens of
billions of yuan in economic losses.
</P>
<P>
The reservoir is expected to be completed in 2002, at which
time regional flooding will be completely controlled, 36,600
hectares of farmland will be protected, and 31,000 hectares of
farmland will be irrigated.
</P>
<P>
The reservoir will generate 113 million KWH of electricity
annually.

<HEADLINE> Newcastle Trounce Coventry in English Premier League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Former Dutch international
Ruud Gullit had a real "sexy football" on Saturday when his team
Newcastle United trounced Coventry City 5-1 away at the English
premier league.
</P>
<P>
England captain Alan Shearer scored twice, to add to the
couple he hit in a 4-0 home win over Southampton last Saturday,
as the Magpies continued their return to form since Gullit
replaced former manager Kenny Dalglish in late August.
</P>
<P>
The result lifted Newcastle's points tally to eight from six ga
mes, six points behind leaders Aston Villa, who drew 0-0 at Leeds
United. Liverpool slipped to third on 11 points after a 3-3 draw
with Charlton at Anfield where Robbie Fowler marked his return
from injury with two goals for the home side.
</P>
<P>
Coventry actually went in front against Newcastle from a Noel
Whelan header after four minutes but were never in the match
after that.
</P>
<P>
Greek defender Nikos Dabizas headed Newcastle level after 14
minutes and Shearer, with a low shot, and Gary Speed, with a
header, made it 3-1 at the interval.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Glass ran through to make it 4-1 after 58 minutes and
Shearer completed another consummate performance with the fifth
from a corner in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
Julian Joachim should have won the game for Villa at Leeds l
ate on but he shot wide when given a clear sight of goal by
Robert Molenaar's mistake.
</P>
<P>
But Fowler showed he had lost none of his scoring touch with
his two goals on his return after a seven-month injury lay-off.
</P>
<P>
Charlton led 1-0 and 2-1 before Steve Jones' late volley
grabbed them a point. Patrik Berger scored Liverpool's other goal.
</P>
<P>
Derby County are second on 12 points after a 2-0 home win over
near neighbours Leicester City.
</P>
<P>
Wimbledon moved to fourth after a 2-1 home win over Sheffield
Wednesday while Middlesbrough drew 2-2 with Everton.
</P>
<P>
Nottingham Forest were held 0-0 at home by West Ham and bottom
club Southampton picked up their first point in a 1-1 home draw
with Tottenham.
</P>
<P>
Champions Arsenal play host to Manchester United on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Kafelnikov to Play Henman in President's Cup Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TASHKENT, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Top two seeds Yevgeny
Kafelnikov of Russia and Tim Henman of Britain, overcame their
respective opponents on Saturday to set up the finals of the
500,000 U.S. dollars President's Cup tournament.
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded defending champion Henman eliminated
fourth-seeded Nicolas Escude of France 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, while top
seed Kafelnikov routed another Frenchman Cedric Pioline in
straight sets with an identical score of 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Henman, this year's Wimbledon semifinalist, said "it was my
best match this week."
</P>
<P>
"I met Kafelnikov six or seven times and only twice I won. He
is a very good player and it will be difficult to play him
tomorrow," he added.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov, 24, easily beat third-seeded Pioline for his ninth
victory in their 10 previous matches. Earlier this year he
outplayed Pioline in the finals for the Guardian Direct Cup
indoor title in west London.
</P>
<P>
"Pioline had a very tough game against Safin yesterday, which
lasted over two and a half hours. He came up tired for today's
game. That's why I won so confidently," said Kafelnikov.
</P>
<P>
Both players have a chance to earn a berth in the ATP
Championship in Hannover, Germany, this year, to join the ranks
of Marcelo Rios, Pete Sampras and Patrick Rafter.
