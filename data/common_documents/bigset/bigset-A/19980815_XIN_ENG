<HEADLINE> U.S. Producer Prices Pick Up Modestly in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. producers prices by
factories and food-processing plants rose 0.2 percent, spurred by
a big jump in vegetable prices, the Labor Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The overall seasonally adjusted increase in the Producer Price
Index (PPI) for finished goods was more than analysts were
expecting. The gain followed a 0.1 percent decline in June and,
for the first seven months of the year, the index fell at a 0.3
percent annual rate.
</P>
<P>
Deflation in goods prices, partly because of the falling cost
of imports from economically troubled Asia, is helping to keep a
lid on inflation.
</P>
<P>
In July, food prices rose a brisk 0.4 percent. Vegetable prices
jumped 21.3 percent, the largest rise in 16 months. The cost of
tomatoes surged 130 percent and green-pepper and eggplant costs
each rose more than 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, meat prices fell. Beef edged 0.1 percent lower and
pork plummeted 10.9 percent, the largest drop in 22 years.
</P>
<P>
Fruit prices were well behaved too, falling 1 percent.
Nectarines were 43 percent cheaper; peaches, 33 percent; honeydew
melons, 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
Energy prices rose a moderate 0.3 percent, despite a 1.3
percent drop in the cost of gasoline. The increases came in
residential electricity, 1.1 percent, and residential natural gas,
0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, prices in prescription drug were also increased,
which surged for the third consecutive month. They rose 1.7
percent in July and were up 22.3 percent during the 12 months
ended in July.
</P>
<P>
Passenger car prices rose 0.8 percent in July as dealers ended
discount programs. For the year though, they're up just 0.2
percent. Computer prices, down 1.6 percent for the month,
continued their decline. Tobacco costs were unchanged, after
rising steeply earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
The price of intermediate goods was unchanged in July while
crude-good costs fell 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the often-volatile food and energy components, prices
edged just 0.1 percent higher.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Calls for Extraordinary Duma Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
Friday signed a message to the State Duma, the lower house of
parliament, suggesting that an extraordinary meeting should be
held to discuss a package of stabilization draft laws.
</P>
<P>
According to presidential press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky,
the president put the suggestion when making a working visit to
Novgorod.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's proposal will be discussed by a meeting of the Duma
Council which will be held on August 17.
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said Thursday that if
an extraordinary meeting of the Duma Council were held after
August 20 and the stabilization draft laws endorsed by the Duma
deputies, the laws could go into effect from September 1 after
being ratified by the Federation Council.
</P>
<P>
Duma budget committee deputy chairman Gennady Kulik Friday
expressed support for the president's appeal for an emergency
meeting of the Duma, saying that the appeal "proceeded from the
real situation and the effort to fulfill obligations taken by
the government in connection with credits of international fiscal
organizations."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, Yeltsin said that "at present there is no need
to convene an extra session of the Duma," but he did not rule out
the possibility to use his constitutional right to call the
session.
</P>
<P>
Under the Duma regulations, decisions on holding extraordinary
sessions should be taken on the basis of a written suggestion
coming either from the president or from the Duma chairman, or on
the suggestion of one fifth of the total number of MPs.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Greece pursued a policy of peace
and adhered to respect of international law and international
treaties, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a message on the eve of Greece's armed forces day, which
will be marked Saturday, Simitis said that Greece, as a member of
the European Union (EU) and as a country with full understanding
of the critical nature of the times and the climate of fluidity
and uncertainty plaguing the wider region of the eastern
Mediterranean, was exercising a policy of peace, based on a
credible deterrent force, in addition to its unwavering
persistence to respect of international law and adherence of the
international treaties.
</P>
<P>
He described the Greek armed forces as "the cornerstone of a
strong Greece" and "a true bridge of understanding between East
and West."
</P>
<P>
Greece's sensitive geographical position demanded the
materialization of a defense police founded exclusively on the
right of self-defense, which is consolidated in the U.N. charter,
the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Simitis stressed that a strong Greece was an economically and
militarily shielded Greece.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Industrial Production Drops in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The General Motors strikes
caused the worst back-to-back declines in the U.S. industrial
production in July in nearly eight years, the Federal Reserve
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The nearly two-month-long GM strikes caused production at
factories, mines and utilities to fall 0.6 percent last month, the
second consecutive decline, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
With the 1.1 percent plunge in June, it was the worst two-month
drop since November-December 1990, at the start of the last
recession.
</P>
<P>
Motor vehicle output dropped from an annual rate of 12.4
million in May to 8.3 million in July. Excluding autos, industrial
production would have edged up in July after declining 0.4 percent
in June, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report Friday, the Commerce Department said
business inventories rose 0.1 percent in June after no change in
May. Businesses are keeping a tighter rein on their stocks of
unsold goods, which shot up in earlier months.
</P>
<P>
Automobile inventories fell 3 percent in June, the biggest drop
since 1991 and a reflection of the GM strikes, which started on
June 5 and were settled at the end of the month.

<P>
LONDON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Ireland's Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern Friday thanked the American leaders for their support to
the Northern Irish peace process.
</P>
<P>
"One of the most satisfying aspects of the search for peace in
Northern Ireland has been the huge support and encouragement we
have got from our friends abroad, but none more so than from those
in America," Ahern was quoted as saying in a statement.
</P>
<P>
At a luncheon with Newt Gingrich, speaker of the U.S. House of
Representatives, Ahern also had a personal note of thanks to
Gingrich, who is in the Republic of Ireland with a congressional
delegation for an eight-day visit to Ireland and Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The conflicting political parties in Northern Ireland reached a
historic peace agreement in April, which is aimed at ending the
30-year-old bloody violence in Britain's divided province.
</P>
<P>
"You too, Mr Speaker, can take credit for the outcome -- all
the participants returned to Ireland from your lunch, galvanized
to `do the deal,'" Ahern said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his gratitude to U.S. President Bill Clinton
for his support and said he was looking forward to Clinton's visit
to Northern Ireland and the republic on September 3.

"The situation in the DRC has deteriorated overnight. Rebel

<HEADLINE> Hard Water Linked to Children Eczema </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Hard water is a major risk factor
for eczema in primary school children, British researchers said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Water hardness was more strongly linked with the painful, itchy
skin disorder than traffic pollution or any other suggested
hazard, researchers from the University of Nottingham reported in
The Lancet medical journal.
</P>
<P>
Researchers found that 17.3 percent of primary school children
living in areas with hard water had suffered eczema for a year,
and 25.4 percent had the disorder all their lives.
</P>
<P>
For soft-water areas the figures were 12 percent and 21.2
percent respectively, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
The study involved 4,141 primary school children and 3,499
secondary school children in southern Nottinghamshire in the UK.
</P>
<P>
The scientists said water hardness may worsen or prolong
existing eczema because calcium and magnesium in the water act as
chemical irritants.
</P>
<P>
Alternatively, there may be an indirect association because
more soap and shampoo was needed to obtain a lather in hard water.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Stresses Importance of Joint Defense Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Defense Minister
Yiannakis Omirou Friday underlined the importance of the joint
defense pact with Greece to the security of the Mediterranean
island.
</P>
<P>
In a message to his Greek counterpart Akis Tsohatzopoulos on
the occasion of Greek Armed Forces Day on Saturday, Omirou said "I
would like to express my sincere thanks for the (Greek) nation's
firm solidarity, led by the Armed Forces, to the struggle of the
people of Cyprus to end the Turkish occupation and restore the
independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the
Republic."
</P>
<P>
The joint defense pact, signed in November 1993 by the two
governments, provides that Greece will offer Cyprus air, land and
sea support in case of a new Turkish offensive against the island.
</P>
<P>
Omirou described the defense pact as "a practical expression of
Hellenism's solidarity toward Cyprus at these crucial hours,"
adding that "it has strengthened the feeling of security among our
people."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the pact, along with Cyprus' bid to join the
European Union (EU), are the two main pillars of the policy shared
by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since Turkish troops
landed and seized the northern third of the island in 1974 in the
aftermath of a failed pro-Athens coup by Greek Cypriots in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Turkey continues to maintain a 35,000-strong military presence
in the island's northern third, despite U.N. resolutions calling
for their withdrawal.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS Ababa, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia Friday called upon
the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and all concerned to
find a peaceful resolution to the over three-month Ethio-Eritrean
crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry
said that the OAU ministerial committee dealing with the
crisis has affirmed that the Badme Area was under Ethiopian
administration prior to the period between May 6 and 12, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The statement said, ''In the face of incontrovertible
evidence, the OAU committee conclusively affirmed that Badme Area
has been administered by Ethiopia''.
</P>
<P>
The OAU committee also stated that "what happened in Badme
between May 6-12 constitutes a fundamental element of the crisis"
and that the challenge is "to find a soluiton to that problem
within the framework of a comprehensive settlement of the
conflict in all its dimensions,'' said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It continued to provide evidences that the Badme was
administered by Ethiopia, noting that a census was carried out by
Ethiopia in 1994 registering 6,425 residents in the town and the
surrounding localities, no less than six Ethiopia elections were
held in Badme between June 1992 and February 1996, and the Badme
Area elected a member to sit in the Ehtiopian parliament.
</P>
<P>
The OAU ministerial committee met in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso
on August 1-2, 1998 and considered the report of the committee of
amabassaodrs which visited Eritrea and Ethiopia from June 30 to
July 9. The ministerial committe has submited its recommendations
to the heads of state of the OAU high level delegation for their
consideration.

The two, detained on the spot, are believed to be members of a

and South Africa.

<P>
Another man involved in the case has also been detained by
police.

BONN, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Germany Friday welcomed a peace
move made by Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova to resume the
political dialogue in Yugoslavia's troubled province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Friday in Bonn, German Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel described Rugova's decision to form a five-member
negotiating team as "an important first step on the difficult path
to a political solution to the Kosovo conflict."
</P>

Kinkel also urged the Yugoslav government to intensively
participate in the peace talks which have been suspended since
June, adding that "a serious dialogue was at least a glimmer of
hope for the political solution."
</P>
<P>
The negotiating team named by Rugova Friday, however, failed to
include members from the Kosovo Liberation Army, the rebel group
which has been fighting Serbian security forces for Kosovo's
independence for the past six months.
</P>
<P>
"It must remain the goal of all Kosovo Albanian politicians to
build an all-party negotiating platform accepted by all segments
of the Kosovo Albanian population," Kinkel said.

PARIS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- France Friday once against denied
any involvement in the on-going war in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC) after a DRC rebel source claimed that it had the
"implicit" support of both France and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"France has nothing to mess with in the current events in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo," said the French Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
A DRC source in Brussels was quoted by local media reports as
saying that six months after the fall of President Mobutu and
after President Laurent Kabila was found to be "not the man of
situation," the rebels contacted Paris and Washington for action
to "normalize the situation."
</P>
<P>
"The United States and France have given their implicit
agreement," said the unidentified source.

An earlier report by the French weekly satirical publication
Canard Enchaine quoted an official source as saying that the
rebellion had the "blessing" of President Jacques Chirac.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Special
Commission for disarmament in Iraq Friday rejected media reports
that it has been given and accepted "external direction" in its
operational activities.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued through the U.N. spokesman's office,
the commission, or UNSCOM, said that "these allegations are
false."
</P>
<P>
It noted that members of the U.N. Security Council acknowledge
the "key distinction" between policy decisions and operational
decisions regarding the UNSCOM and they respect the distinction.
</P>
<P>
"All policy decisions on the UNSCOM activities are taken by the
Security Council but operational decisions are taken by the
executive chairman," said the UNSCOM whose executive chairman is
Australian Richard Butler.
</P>
<P>
"Consultations on policy matters take place regularly between
the executive chairman and council members but all operational
decisions are taken by the executive chairman who has not been
given and would find it invidious were any attempt made to direct
his operational decisions or to micro-manage the day-to-day work
of the Special Commission," it stated.
</P>
<P>
The press release was issued in the wake of a Washington Post
report which said U.S. officials have asked Butler to try delaying
surprise arms inspections to avoid confrontation with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A deadlock in arms inspections between Iraq and the UNSCOM has
emerged since Iraq decided Wednesday last week to suspend
cooperation with the UNSCOM, requesting that the UNSCOM be
restructured and moved from New York to Geneva or Vienna to reduce
what it calls U.S. influence.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic efforts are being made for the resumption of
inspections following U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's
suggestions to the Security Council that Iraq be engaged more
closely in finding ways to resolve the Iraq-UNSCOM differences.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Endorses Draft Policy on HIV-AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Council of Ministers of
Ethiopia Friday unanimously endorsed the draft policy on HIV-AIDS
and decided to put the policy into force.
</P>
<P>
The national HIV-AIDS policy is aimed at launching integrated
prevention activities by governmental, non-governmental and other
pertinent bodies, making some amendments to the draft policy, the
Ethiopian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Ministers said that the number of Ethiopians
contracting the deadly disease is on the rise, making the country
one of the countries where AIDS is expanding at an alarming rate.
</P>
<P>
Although many preventive measures have been taken, so far they
have not been streamlined under a national policy, the council
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
It said that the need to direct efforts on the prevention of
HIV-AIDS necessitated the policy which is designed as part of the
national health strategy.
</P>
<P>
According to the national HIV-AIDS control program of
Ethiopia, the HIV-AIDS epidemic has increasingly spread among
Ethiopians in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Only one person out of every 100 Ethiopians was HIV-infected
in 1989; in 1993, three persons out of every 100 were infected by
HIV virus and in 1996, out of every 100 Ethiopians, five were
infected by the deadly disease.

<HEADLINE> Dem. Congo Calls for Rwandan Withdrawal Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 14 (Xinhua) - The Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) Friday once again called on Rwanda to withdraw its
troops out of the Congolese territory to contribute to peace in
the war-torn region.
</P>
<P>
The Charge de Affaires of the DRC embassy here, Kyungu Nyemba,
told a press conference that there was no other alternative for
Rwanda but to withdraw its aggression troops from the democratic
Congo.
</P>
<P>
"The soft words of Rwanda remembering its assistance in the
removal of Mobutu dictatorship and its claimed complete departure
of its troops will never change or hamper the strong
determination of Congolese people together with their president
Kabila to foil the expansionist designs of Rwanda," said Nyemba.
</P>
<P>
He said that the DRC will never accept the claims that the
Rwandese enter Congo peacefully or anyhow, dilute themselves into
local Congolese population by calling them Banyamulenge.
</P>
<P>
"Rwanda should refrain from taking the advantage of defense
and security problems inherited from the Mobutu chaotic era to
continually violate its borders with Congo," Nyemba said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the current situation in the DRC, the Charge de
Affaires said that it was difficult for him to follow because of
inadequate communications with Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
But he asserted that President Laurent Kabila was staying in
the country to guide repulses upon the rebels.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Prime Minister on Foreign Debt, Credit Rating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 14 (Xinhua) -- It is not logical for the
Moody's rating agency to announce it will diminish Romania's
credit rating, Romanian Prime Minister Radu Vasile told the local
daily Cronica Romana Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is not normal to use political disagreements to
consider the credit rating higher," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said that there are a lot of countries in the world "where
there are deeper and longer political tensions by way of
comparison with Romania."
</P>
<P>
"I would have understood Moody's gesture if our structural
reform had been delayed. But, since such an explanation cannot be
given anymore, they reached the `political environment' issues,"
the prime minister said, adding that these political environment
issues can be found in any democratic country, anytime.
</P>
<P>
Romania's current appraisal, Radu Vasile said, "is not
appropriate and it is connected to certain influence factors." As
a support for his statement, he said, speculations about the
foreign debt of Romania occurred.
</P>
<P>
"It should be clear that we have the smallest foreign debt,
about 8 billion U.S. dollars by way of comparison with Hungary,
the Czech Republic and Poland, while Hungary is one of the heavily
indebted countries in the world," Radu Vasile said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the international financial rating agency
Moody's announced Monday a possible lowering of Romania's credit
rating after its announcement on July 16 of its decision to change
Romania's status from stable to negative.
</P>
<P>
Local economic analyzers consider that Moody's decision is
caused by political instability and not the economic situation.
</P>
<P>
"It is an extremely serious warning because if Romania is
demoted with one more class in the rating hierarchy, it means it
will be completely out of the possible investments list," warned
Ilie Serbanescu, the former minister of reform.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Stresses Importance of Joint Defense Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Defense Minister
Yiannakis Omirou Friday underlined the importance of the joint
defense pact with Greece to the security of the Mediterranean
island.
</P>
<P>
In a message to his Greek counterpart Akis Tsohatzopoulos on
the occasion of Greek Armed Forces Day on Saturday, Omirou said "I
would like to express my sincere thanks for the (Greek) nation's
firm solidarity, led by the Armed Forces, to the struggle of the
people of Cyprus to end the Turkish occupation and restore the
independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the
Republic."
</P>
<P>
The joint defense pact, signed in November 1993 by the two
governments, provides that Greece will offer Cyprus air, land and
sea support in case of a new Turkish offensive against the island.
</P>
<P>
Omirou described the defense pact as "a practical expression of
Hellenism's solidarity toward Cyprus at these crucial hours,"
adding that "it has strengthened the feeling of security among our
people."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the pact, along with Cyprus' bid to join the
European Union (EU), are the two main pillars of the policy shared
by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since Turkish troops
landed and seized the northern third of the island in 1974 in the
aftermath of a failed pro-Athens coup by Greek Cypriots in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Turkey continues to maintain a 35,000-strong military presence
in the island's northern third, despite U.N. resolutions calling
for their withdrawal.

<P>
LAGOS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping
force ECOMOG has recaptured two important diamond towns from
rebels in Sierra Leone, a report from Freetown said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG troops, backed by civil defense forces, killed 32
rebels in the eastern town of Gandorhun Thursday, defense sources
in the southern city of Bo said, adding that mopping-up
operations were under way.
</P>
<P>
Gandorhun, strategically located between the Kono and Kailahun
diamond centers, had served as a springboard for rebel attacks on
both, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In another operation, ECOMOG chased rebels out of Yamandu, in
Kono district, said Colonel Rafiu Adeshina, the local brigade
commander.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted as saying that the rebels, who had held Yamandu
for more than four months, suffered heavy casualties but giving
no figures.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG, toppling the military regime of Major Johnny Paul
Koroma in Freetown and restoring President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah to
power in March, has been since engaged in mopping-up operations.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Yeltsin to Take Quick Action on Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Friday urged Russian President Boris Yeltsin to take quick,
decisive action to restore stability and confidence in Russia's
economy.
</P>
<P>
During a 40-minute telephone discussion, Clinton and Yeltsin
focused on the economic problems facing Russia, a U.S. official
told reporters on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
It was Clinton's view that the onus was on the shoulders of the
Russian government to take further action on its economy, rather
than on the West to provide more cash, said the official.
</P>
<P>
"The president encouraged President Yeltsin to take some
decisive steps in the next few days that would help change the
market psychology, so to speak, in restoring confidence," he
added.
</P>
<P>
When asked if the two leaders had discussed further
international aid to Russia, the U.S. official replied: "They
didn't talk about specifics. From the president's standpoint, it
is more a case of encouraging the Russian government to take
action."
</P>
<P>
"The president encouraged President Yeltsin to work with his
economic team and take some action sooner rather than later," said
the U.S. official.
</P>
<P>
"They need to keep doing the things that they need to do under
the IMF program. That will both send the right signal to the
markets and improve the climate when the IMF evaluates release of
the next tranche," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Yeltsin will meet in Moscow early in September with
economic issues likely to dominate the summit.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Friday
warned Americans against traveling to Albania and urged those now
in the country to consider leaving.
</P>
<P>
Concerned about another possible terrorist attack one week
after twin bombings on the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania,
the State Department issued a statement warning against all travel
to Albania.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said that American citizens currently in
Albania are urged to consider carefully their personal security
situation and, if appropriate, to depart.
</P>
<P>
U.S. embassy personnel in non-emergency positions and the
families of embassy employees have been ordered to depart the
country, the department said.
</P>
<P>
It added that it acted "because of recent declarations by
Islamic extremists against the United States and its citizens and
because of the possibility that the U.S. embassy in Tirana...
could be among the targets of a terrorist attack."
</P>
<P>
The travel warning follows an announcement late Thursday that
the embassy in Tirana was temporarily suspending normal
operations.
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 were wounded and more than 250 were killed in the
U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. Eleven American
citizens were dead.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Defense Department of the
United States will begin to inoculate all U.S. troops against the
deadly threat of anthrax next week, the Pentagon announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
Troops in the Persian Gulf began receiving the vaccinations
earlier this year. The next round of vaccinations will be the
troops serving in Southeast Asia and South Korea, and all of the
2.4 million active and reserve forces will be inoculated by about
2004, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
"This is an efficient, effective and safe way to protect our
forces against an emerging threat," Defense Secretary William
Cohen said while announcing the start of the program.
</P>
<P>
So far, 48,000 troops have received the inoculations, said Dr.
Sue Bailey, assistant secretary of defense for health affairs.
</P>
<P>
Michael Cowan, deputy director for medical readiness for the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, said there was an increasing threat of
chemical and biological attacks from several nations that are
thought to be developing such weapons.
</P>
<P>
The immunization program consists of a series of six shots for
each service member over an 18-month period, followed by an annual
booster.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Admits Discussing Timing of U.N. Inspections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The White House said on
Friday that Washington had discussed with U.N. weapons
inspectors on what time would be best for the weapons
inspection teams to stage surprise inspections in Iraq, but
denied giving any order to change their plans.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post said that the Clinton administration had
intervened secretly for months, to dissuade U.N. weapons
inspection teams from mounting surprise inspections in Iraq
because it wished to avoid a new crisis with Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
But White House spokesman Mike McCurry said: "We have been
talking with them "about the best way to perform their mission --
timing, outcome, best way to achieve their mission -- but we don't
order them not to conduct their mission."
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post said on August 4, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright urged chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard
Butler to rescind closely held orders for a inspection team to
mount "challenge inspections" at some sites where intelligence
reports suggested there might be banned weapons components.
</P>
<P>
A State Department official said that the date of
conversation reported by the Post was correct "but not the
substance or the tone."
</P>
<P>
Albright herself admitted that she had consulted with Butler on
the latest standoff between the Iraqis and the weapons inspection
teams, but denied she had given him any instructions.
</P>
<P>
"I do not tell Chairman Butler what to do," she told reporters.
</P>
<P>
She said it was up to Butler "where, when and how" he makes
his inspections.
</P>
<P>
Asked if she had told Butler, as the Washington Post
reported, that now was not a good time to make surprise
inspections, Albright said: "As I said we've had conversations.
I do not want to go into those conversations. I do not tell
Chairman Butler what to do.

<HEADLINE> Regional Panel on Lesotho Begins Election Audit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 14 (Xinhua) -- South African and
Botswanan members of a regional panel to investigate the alleged
electoral fraud in Lesotho arrived in Maseru Friday afternoon to
begin their work.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean members of the three-nation committee had yet
to join their colleagues, South African Press Association (SAPA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The committee was set up earlier this week in terms of an
agreement brokered by South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki
to defuse the political crisis in the mountainous kingdom.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has sent four representatives including
Constitutional Court Deputy President Pius Langa and Mbeki's
legal adviser Mojunku Gumbi, while Botswana has further provided
three members.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has apparently not finalized its representation yet.
</P>
<P>
The panel was immediately briefed by the South African mission
in Lesotho's capital Maseru.
</P>
<P>
It will work with, among others, Lesotho's Independent
Electoral Commission and opposition parties and has been asked to
report back within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Lesotho government and opposition parties have agreed to
abide by the committee's findings. Lesotho Prime Minister
Pakalitha Mosisili even pledged that he would step down if the
May 23 general election was proved seriously flawed.
</P>
<P>
Mosisili's Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) won 79 of 80
seats in the National Assembly in the election, but opposition
parties claim that the results were rigged in favor of the LCD.
</P>
<P>
Unrest began last Tuesday when opposition supporters camped
outside the royal palace in Maseru to protest.
</P>
<P>
Clashes between rival factions resulted in nine injuries
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> UK Crackdowns on Police Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A national crackdown on police
corruption has been launched by Britain's Home Department as fresh
evidence suggested that there are far more crooked officers than
had been suspected, according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
Officers will have to abide by a new code of ethics, which is
expected to ban minor "perks" - such as the use of a police
identity card to gain free admission to clubs - and even stipulate
whether senior officers should be allowed to drink during business
lunches.
</P>
<P>
The code, which will apply to all 120,000 police officers, is
likely to be draconian because of the belief that serious
corruption flows from petty dishonesty.
</P>
<P>
The new rules will be decided when an extensive assessment of
police corruption throughout Britain has been completed, according
to the Times newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The Home Office has called for secret reports from all 43 chief
constables in England and Wales after initial investigations
showed that sleaze was a problem in rural as well as city forces,
with officers recycling seized drugs and using informers to cream
off rewards, the newspaper said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
One Home Office source was quoted as saying: "There is
corruption in every type of force. Not every force has a problem
but no type of force is immune."

HANOI, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam will clear the way for its
full participation in the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) plan
scheduled for 2006 as it has committed, the Vietnam News Agency
Saturday quoted a government official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has pledged to apply tariffs of up to five percent on
at least 85 percent of its goods sold in regional markets by 2006,
said deputy minister for foreign affairs, Nguyen Tam Chien.
</P>
<P>
He added that Vietnam has completed a list of 1,700 goods items
subjected to tariffs deduction, which will be applied gradually.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese diplomat said that foreign ministers from member
countries of the ASEAN affirmed their commitments to obtain
regional trade liberation despite adverse impacts caused by the
current financial turmoil on their economies.
</P>
<P>
According to the deputy foreign minister, an agreement to
establish an ASEAN investment area would be likely to be signed in
the near future. Other regional accords, including an agreement
on multi-lateral communications, the second phase of an ASEAN
agreement on free services and other sub-regional cooperation
agreements, are expected to be reached soon.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's admission to ASEAN in 1995 marked the integration of
the Vietnamese economy into the regional and world economy, Chien
affirmed.

<HEADLINE> Animal Hearts to be Transplanted into Human Bodies (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- "Man with the heart of a beast"
might be used literarily to describe a man with a heart
transplanted from a transgenic pig in the next century when
scientists succeed in using transgenic animal organs for human
patients.
</P>
<P>
Scientists predict that xenotransplantation, the
transplantation of transgenic organs from one species to another,
might be used to help human patients who need organ transplants,
within 15 to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
"The incentive for xenotransplantation study lies in the
shortage of human organ donors," said Doctor Hester Kuipers from
the Novartis Company of Imutran Ltd., Cambridge, UK, who is here
attending the 18th International Congress on Genetics. She said
that the number of patients waiting for organ transplants is six
times that of the number of organ donors in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Kuipers and other scientists at Novartis, which is a
world-leader in xenotransplantation studies, are trying to
grow transgenic pig organs that will not cause hyperacute
rejection in human bodies.
</P>
<P>
She said the transgenic pigs were produced by micro-injecting a
complementary DNA (cDNA) construct for the human decaying accelerating
factor (hDAF), a kind of protein, into the fertilized eggs of
pigs. New-born pigs in the breeding program were first screened for
the presence of the transgene by genetic methods.

<P>
Experiments have shown that organs from hDAF transgenic pigs
were not hyperacutely rejected, she said, adding that they have
transplanted hearts from transgenic pigs to cynomolgus monkeys,
and one of the monkeys survived for 99 days after the operation.
</P>
<P>
The reason for using pigs for xenotransplantation is that the
heart, kidney and other organs of transgenic pig are more similar
to human organs in shape and size than other species.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Kuipers said that her company has been involved in
xenotransplantation study for ten years, and is making rapid
developments. But the technique will not be mature enough to be
used for humans until the early 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists have also started xenotransplantation
research, and they will try to transplant transgenic pig hearts into
monkeys by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Experimentation on the transplantation of tissues and cells from
transgenic animals have also demonstrated some gratifying results.
</P>
<P>
However, scientists are conducting experiments to find if
transgenic organs will bring viruses from the animals into human bodies
or cause other side-effects. Eventually, social scientists may

<HEADLINE> HK Administrative Secretary Returns from Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Anson Chan, administrative
secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR),
Saturday expressed the hope that the Asian economies will pick up
again very soon.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on her early estimation that the economic
recession might last for 2-3 years at the meet-the-media session
upon her return to Hong Kong from Singapore Saturday afternoon,
Chan said that it's very difficult for anybody "to estimate how
long the difficulties we are currently facing on the economic
front will last."
</P>
<P>
Of course, "we all hope that the Asian economies will pick up
again very very soon but to a large extent, as I have pointed out,
it depends on the Japanese leadership and vision."
</P>
<P>
"It depends on Japan taking measures to deal with the financial
reforms and to be back to normal situation, and to take measures
to stabilize the Japanese yen and resume consumers' confidence,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
"In the wake of that", she said: "I am sure we will see
economies in this region improving."
</P>
<P>
Talking about the measures that Financial Secretary Donald
Tsang has taken to draw upon the resources of the exchange fund to
counterattack speculators in the stock and futures markets, Chan
stressed that the government will not deviate its consistent
non-interference policy.
</P>
<P>
However, she said: "we can not tolerate any creation of
distortion in foreign exchange market to affect our economic
system.
</P>
<P>
"The special action that we have adopted aims at directing
specifically against the speculative activities", she added.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Ruling, Opposition Parties Decide to Join Hands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Nepali Congress
(NC) and the opposition Communist Party of Nepal
(Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML) have decided to join hands in forming a
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The NC's Central Working Committee decided Saturday to include
the CPN-ML into the present government led by its president Girija
Prasad Koirala, the party said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee of the CPN-ML has decided as well to
align itself with the NC.
</P>
<P>
In April, the NC and the CPN-ML tried to form a coalition
government, but failed due to dispute over the allocation of key
portfolios. Then the NC, the single largest party in parliament
after the CPN-ML broke away from the Communist Party of Nepal
(United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML) in March, formed a minority
government of its own.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the general elections, which Prime
Minister Girija Prasad Koirala said is scheduled for April/May
1999, lead to the eventual alliance between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
The alliance means a comfortable majority of 128 seats in the
205-seat Lower House of Parliament for the new coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
It is widely expected that the new coalition government will
come into being by Tuesday.

</P>
<P>
"Any new knowledge can be used as potential weapons against
people," said Anthony Griffiths, the IGF's Secretary General.

change every aspect of life in the next century, said Qiu Renzong,
a Chinese bio-ethics specialist and a delegate to the academic
event.
</P>
<P>
The congress was described as "successful and fruitful" by the
organizers.
</P>
<P>
"About 2,000 experts from 54 countries and regions attended
more than 70 symposiums and discussions, exchanging ideas on the
latest research in genetics-related fields such as agriculture,
medical treatment, pharmaceutics, longevity and environmental
protection," said Chen Shouyi, secretary general of the congress.
</P>
<P>
Hot topics include achievements in human genome research,
breeding of high-yielding hybrid rice, gene therapy and transgenic
technology.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, has called
for concerted and continuous efforts to fight the raging floods of
the Nengjiang River in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province
until final victory is achieved.
</P>
<P>
"The flooding situation still remains very serious. Full
preparations should be made to cope with problems and difficulties
that may possibly appear," stressed Li, who is also a member of
the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central
Committee, while on an inspection to the flood-fighting front line
in Heilongjiang on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Li extended warm regards and paid high tribute to the civilians
and soldiers who are fighting the floods.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that top priority should be given to the
protection of people's lives, and urged that every effort be made
to ensure that the people will be provided with adequate food,
clothing, shelter, and access to medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
From north to south, China is undergoing a major flood
season. The water level of the Nengjiang River is still rising
slightly, and more rain is expected to hit the river, he said.
</P>
<P>
So far this summer, the Nengjiang River has seen four floods,
the largest in history, causing huge losses, affecting millions of
residents, disrupting many sections of the Binzhou railway, and
threatening the safety of the cities of Qiqihar and Daqing.
</P>
<P>
Li said that an initial victory has already been achieved. By
August 13, no breaches had occurred on major levees; no large
reservoirs had been disrupted; and no casualties had been reported
among the tens of thousands of people who were evacuated.
</P>
<P>
Li praised the role that soldiers are playing in the
flood-fighting struggle.
</P>
<P>
While inspecting the Songhua River, Li said that the water
level of Harbin will very probably exceed the record high of 120.3
meters in 1957, and the city should keep on high alert and prepare
for the worst.
</P>
<P>
After the flooding ends, a large reservoir will be built on the
upper reaches of the Nengjiang River to accumulate water, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The Nengjiang River embankments should be consolidated;
barriers to flood prevention should be removed; and the safety of
railways, highways, power facilities, and posts and
telecommunications facilities should be ensured, he said.

<HEADLINE> First Group of Iranian Pilgrims Cross into Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 15 (Xinhua) -- For the first time in 18 years,
760 Iranian pilgrims crossed the border into Iraq Saturday to
visit the holy sites of the Shiite Muslims in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The group was officially seen off at the Khosrawi border point
in Kermanshah province by Iranian Minister of Culture and Islamic
Guidance Ataollah Mohajerani.
</P>
<P>
During their stay in Iraq, the pilgrims will visit holy sites
in Karbala, Najaf and Kazemyn in the south.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Mohajerani expressed hope that the
visit would consolidate bonds between the Iranian and Iraqi
nations.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Minister of Endowments and Religious Affairs Abdal-Munim
Ahmad Salih told the Iranian delegation that his country has
restored the holy sites over recent years.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached between Iran and Iraq, 3,000
Iranian and Iraqi pilgrims are to travel to either country to pay
pilgrimage to holy sites.
</P>
<P>
Before the eruption of the Iran-Iraq war in 1980, hundreds of
thousands of Iranian pilgrims visited the holy sites for Shiite
Muslims in Iraq every year.
</P>
<P>
In choosing its inaugural group of pilgrims, Iran has given
preference to relatives of the Iranians killed during the 1980-88
Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
Most of the pilgrims are parents of the men killed in the war.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the 10th anniversary of the end of the war, both
Tehran and Baghdad are speeding up their efforts to solve problems
left from the war so to normalize their ties.

found among the Uygur people in the Kashi region of Xinjiang for
the first time, according to the researchers' report published in
the latest issue of the Chinese Journal of Medical Genetics.
</P>
<P>
Kashi was a major center along the Silk Road to western Asia,
Tibet and India. Scientists say this hereditary disease is the
result of migration and marriage among the various ancient
nationalities.
</P>
<P>
Another type of gene associated with the disease has been found
in many Chinese all over the world. But the incidence diminishes
away from the Silk Road region to the rest of China, Taiwan,
Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Scientists infer from this that the mutant gene originated in
Gansu and then was spread to Southeast Asia by the migration of
Chinese.

HARBIN, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Sometime around August 21,
Harbin, capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, is
expected to face its worst flooding since 1949, local
water-control experts warned today.
</P>
<P>
They forecast that in about one week, water levels on the
Songhua River passing the city will rise to a record high of 120.3
meters, 2.2 meters above the danger line.
</P>
<P>
A flood peak is now roaring down the river at 3:00 pm today,
the water level on the river at Harbin rose as high as 119.36
meters, 1.25 meters above the danger level, with a water flow of
9,540 cubic meters per second, according to the State Flood
Control and Drought Relief Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Harbin imposed a curfew at several sections of the Songhua
River embankments yesterday. About 500,000 local people and
soldiers have been busy working along the river embankments
and residents living in possible danger areas have been
evacuated to safe places.

<HEADLINE> Feature: A Trip Through War-torn Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRISTINA, Yugoslavia, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Our car was
zigzagging up the crater-dotted road in the mountains of western
Kosovo, a Yugoslav province, when two men in Serbian police
uniforms emerged from behind the bushes and blocked our path.
</P>
<P>
They pulled back bolts of their submachine guns, obviously
because of the civilian license plate on the car.
</P>
<P>
As before, we had no trouble this time passing the check point
near Labushnic, about 30 kilometers west of Pristina, because
Bozidar Filic, deputy chief of the Kosovo police department, was
with us as our guide. Along the road we ran into many such check
points, some so camouflaged that no one could recognize them until
being stopped.
</P>
<P>
Civilian vehicles were rare here, as most families had fled the
region ablaze with war flames since Serbian troops launched a
major offensive against the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) in late
July.
</P>
<P>
The hilltop we had passed, now under Serbian control at the
cost of two days of fierce fighting, overlooks a strategic road
linking Pristina with towns in western Kosovo -- once the KLA's
stronghold, but now a battlefield.
</P>
<P>
WESTERN KOSOVO DEVASTATED BY RAGING WARS
</P>
<P>
Imprints of war began to stimulate our view as we continued
westwards. Roads were littered with rocks and deserted vehicles,
once used as barricades by KLA fighters. Trenches crisscrossed the
hillsides, connecting numerous bastions which were strewn with
bread, canned food and beverage containers left by the KLA.
</P>
<P>
All the towns we passed were virtually no-go zones as violent
battles had driven residents to live with their relatives
elsewhere, to retreat with rebels to mountains, or to slip into
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Police guarding a hilltop bastion told us that 300 to 400 armed
Albanians holing up there had blocked the strategic road for two
months before it was taken back by the Serb security forces
following two days of fierce fighting.
</P>
<P>
Down from the hilltop, tanks and other armoured vehicles were
roaring on the narrow road. Water tankers escorted by armed police
were distributing water to police posts.
</P>
<P>
Filic told us that vehicles carrying no license plates were
police vehicles and their plates were removed out of fear of
Albanian snipers in the bushes.
</P>
<P>
In Malisevo, an abandoned town 45 kilometers west of Pristina,
the only sign of life we saw, apart from heavily armed Serbian
policemen, was a dog searching for food along an empty street.
</P>
<P>
No house was intact, many reduced to ruins, apparently the
result of heavy shelling. Cars were abandoned by the road sides,
their windows shattered and bodies riddled with bullet holes.
</P>
<P>
Reports said more than 200 people, many of them civilians, were
killed in the Kosovo conflicts, which have already displaced some
240,000 people and threaten to spill over to other parts of the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
New tolls are being reported on a daily basis as Serbian forces
push their lines into more KLA strongholds.
</P>
<P>
The KLA claimed more than one third of Kosovo following a
series of attacks earlier this year that met with little
resistance from Serb police.
</P>
<P>
"At first, we did not launch large-scale offensives out of
concern for civilians and international reaction," said Filic.
He said incessant KLA provocations finally spurred Serb police
into a rampage of counterattacks on July 25.
</P>
<P>
According to Serbian sources, government troops have regained
three-fourths of the land lost to the rebels, recapturing several
highways and forcing out the KLA headquarters.
</P>
<P>
In front of a two-story building that once housed the KLA
supreme command in Malisevo, a sign read: "No Photos."
</P>
<P>
"Please feel free to take photos," said Filic. "The sign was
the work of the KLA." He said the KLA command had retreated into
the mountains before Serbs arrived on July 30.
</P>
<P>
However, Filic did not allow us to travel further west because
fighting was still going on there.

PRISTINA TROUBLED BY RACIAL TENSION
</P>
<P>
Artillery was not heard back in Pristina, where babies in
prams were among those enjoying the evening cool in the central
square as onlookers almost forgot the increasing bloodshed of the
past five months in the war-torn province.
</P>
<P>
A group of children were frolicking in the square where both
the Serbian and Albanian tongue could be heard from young people
playing cards, and elderly women chatting about household
trivialities.
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere, however, was made grim by the sights of Serbian
policemen and police cars constantly patrolling the city, stopping
vehicles for identity checks.
</P>
<P>
A grey haired man strolling near the square told us, in
Serbian, that his family lived on tenterhooks as reports of
frontline clashes circulated in the city.
</P>
<P>
"Don't be deceived by the bustling city at this hour," he
said. "No one dares to stay on the street after 11 o'clock at
night."
</P>
<P>
He said many Serb families had moved out of Kosovo, but he was
still hesitant about leaving because he had lived and worked there
for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo, bordered by Albania, has an area of 10,000 square
kilometers and a population of about two million, 90 percent
ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Part of Yugoslavia since early this century, Kosovo has gripped
international attention since last February when armed ethnic
Albanians stepped up the guerrilla war for independence from
Serbia -- the dominant republic of the Yugoslav Federation.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Director of Pristina's Media Center Sinisa Rjepojevic
said Serb residents in the city were under increasing pressure as
hostility intensified between Serbs and Albanians along with the
ongoing strife.
</P>
<P>
As we dined at an outdoor restaurant run by an Albanian man,
the proprietor complained about the disproportionate share of
rights for the Albanian majority -- the root cause of the
separatist movement that has flared into armed rebellion.
</P>
<P>
The whole issue could be traced back to 1990 when Serbian
leader Slobodan Milosevic dismissed the Kosovo local parliament
and government. The move fueled the racial antagonism.
</P>
<P>
In the same year, Kosovo Albanian students and teachers went on
strike protesting the government's mandatory order to use the
unified curriculum designed by Serbian authorities.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade's concession to allow courses be taught in Albanian by
Albanian teachers in 1996, and an agreement last March to
implement the 1996 concession, was, however, not enough to pacify
the extreme separatists who took up armed rebellion anyway.

DEFERRING VIEWS ON POSSIBLE NATO INTERVENTION
</P>
<P>
NATO's repeated warnings of military intervention, a fond hope
of ethnic Albanian leaders, have so far failed to deter the
offensive of the Serbian government, which is always bitter about
foreign interference in its internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
In Kosovo, a prevailing view among the Serbs is that the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization has no right to send troops to their
homeland of generations.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo Information Bureau Director Bosko Drobnjak ruled out,
with confidence, the possibility of any NATO action. He noted that
NATO has declared its opposition to Kosovo's independence and
wanted a political solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said he saw no ground for NATO forces to step in as it
agreed with Belgrade on these essential matters.
</P>
<P>
Captain Vjestica Radomir, in charge of a Serbian checkpoint in
Komorane, said his men were not afraid of NATO military
threats. "If NATO dares to intrude, we will fight it to the end,"
Radomir said with a clenched fist.
</P>
<P>
In sharp contrast with Serbs' resentment against external
intervention, ethnic Albanian leaders insist that NATO military
action is needed to press Belgrade onto a political road to
resolve the problem.
</P>
<P>
Kol Berisa, second vice chairman of the Democratic Union of
Kosovo, the largest political party of ethnic Albanians, said that
only NATO's intervention, on the same level as that in the Bosnia
crisis, could force Belgrade to withdraw its troops from Kosovo
and sit down at the negotiation table.
</P>
<P>
He said the latest Serbian offensive proved the urgency for
strong international intervention.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, it is already too late for NATO to halt the
fighting," said Berisa with a grudge etched on his face.
</P>
<P>
While NATO's role in the Kosovo crisis remains disputable, the
international community is unanimous in appealing for an immediate
ceasefire and unconditional opening of dialogue between the
parties, on the basis of respect for the sovereignty and integrity
of Yugoslavia.

FUTURE LIES IN DIALOGUE
</P>
<P>
Where does the future of Kosovo lie? This is the question we
raised whenever we felt it was opportune during our short Kosovo
trip.
</P>
<P>
Answers were varied, with the majority of people advocating
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"Our stance is clear-cut. That is, a political dialogue is the
only way out for Kosovo. Without preconditions, we are ever ready
for dialogue," Drobnjak said.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to discuss with ethnic Albanians about the
highest-level autonomy which the international community could
recognize."
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that the most urgent issue was to sit down
and talk.
</P>
<P>
Zeliko Odalovic, supreme administrator of Kosovo, said: "We are
willing to have the dialogue resumed with the Albanian political
leaders on Kosovo autonomy, but we will never allow independence
or the status of republic which the international community will
not recognize either."
</P>
<P>
Many ethnic Albanians also favor a political solution to the
crisis. Even among the armed ethnic Albanians, moderate voices are
heard calling for a non-violent means to achieve Albanian
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
"The Democratic Union of Kosovo has always held that the Kosovo
issue should, and can only, be solved through dialogue," said
Berisa. "That was why we agreed to open talks with the Serbs. The
talks broke down when Serb authorities intensified their military
offensives."
</P>
<P>
Berisa said Serb authorities must halt their military
offensives and withdraw their troops from Kosovo before dialogue
can be resumed. He said he believed independence was the best
solution to the Kosovo situation.
</P>
<P>
As we drove back from Malisevo, fighting was still going on in
the western mountains. The big differences on the conditions for
dialogue has made it unlikely that talks will be resumed in the
near future.

<HEADLINE> Polio Vaccination Campaign Starts in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A large vaccine campaign
in Somalia against polio started Saturday simultaneously in the
Somali capital and many regions in the central and southern
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, sponsored by United Nation Children's Fund
(UNICEF) and World Health Organization (WHO) in collaboration
with Mogadishu's Joint Health Authority (JHA), is aimed at
immunizing more than 900,000 children under the age of five.
</P>
<P>
Faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed and other political and
religious leaders attended the ceremony for the inauguration of
the national immunization days held in north Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
According to Jeylani Mohamed Dini, the officer in-charge of
UNICEF-Mogadishu, the first phase of the campaign will last five
days starting at once in the central town of Dhusamareb to the
southern port town of Kismaio including the border region of
Gedo. In Mogadishu, more than 400 well trained people
are carrying out the campaign in 16 of its districts.
</P>
<P>
The motto of the campaign is to eradicate polio from the
earth surface by the year 2000 and the Somalis are informed not
to be the last victim of polio as happened during the eradication
campaign of the small box disease in 1977, when the last victim
of the small box all over the world happened to be a Somali man.
</P>
<P>
A group of youth with loud speakers have been circulating in
the streets of the capital since early Saturday morning, urging
the people, especially the mothers, to get their offsprings to the
nearest vaccine center for a free immunization.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 people supported by international
non-governmental organizations took in this campaign throughout
the central and southern Somalia Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In the coastal town of Merca, 100 km south of Mogadishu, the
Italian aid agency COSV had been operating in the polio
eradication campaign in its seven districts of Lower Shabelle
region.
</P>
<P>
Many of the mosques in Mogadishu and elsewhere in the country
had similarly taken their role in the social mobilization, urging
the people to get their children immunized against the polio
which is one of the six killer diseases of the children in the
world.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan Worried About Escalation of Afghan War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh President Nursultan
Nazarbayev has expressed worry about the continued escalation of
conflicts in Afghanistan and warned all warring sides not to
spread fighting across the Afghan borders.
</P>
<P>
As reported by the Kazakh newspaper, Panorama Weekly, on
Saturday, Nazarbayev said the armed conflicts in northern
Afghanistan had lasted for 20 years and was now heading for the
southern borders of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).
</P>
<P>
The situation is worrisome, the president said.
</P>
<P>
He said he is consulting with leaders of other Central Asian
countries in hope of preventing the Afghan war from spreading
across the CIS borders.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev urged the Afghan warring factions to build a
peaceful country through negotiations instead of violent battles.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan had always stood solidly behind policies of keeping
Afghanistan's territorial integrity, and opposed any attempt at
interfering into its internal affairs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan, in hope of the Afghan situation calming down, was
willing to set up normal and neighborly relations with the Pamir
nation, Nazarbayev said.

<HEADLINE> 76 Ethnic Albanians Accused of Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Seventy-six ethnic Albanians
were charged on Friday with terrorism-related crimes by a local
procuratorate in Yugoslavia's troubled province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The move came as the ethnic Albanian leadership agreed on
resumed talks with Belgrade over the crisis which has existed in
Kosovo since February.
</P>
<P>
The Pech Prefectural Procuratorate had asked the local court to
start relevant investigations into the accusations, the Yugoslav
news agency Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
The suspects, who came from the Kovica area, were charged with
attacks on security agencies of the Kovica and Deccani regions,
last June and July.
</P>
<P>
The accused belong to two groups of 34 and 42 each, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Ibranhim Rugova, the main Kosovo ethnic Albanian leader, named
a five-person delegation, on Friday, to restart suspended peace
talks with Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians, seeking independence from Yugoslavia and
integration into neighboring Albania, boycotted the talks in
March, and they were suspended in June.
</P>
<P>
Tension has run high in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian outnumber
Serbs nine to one, since February when ethnic Albanians clashed
with Serb police and mounted numerous attacks on police
installations.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Call For Protection of Plant Genetic Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Several scientists warned here
today that one-eighth of the world's plant species are endangered
or threatened, and nearly 2,000 plant varieties are disappearing
every hour.
</P>
<P>
Kamaljit Bawa of the University of Massachusetts in the United
States, said here at the 18th International Congress of Genetics
that the annual deforestation rate between 1990 and 1995 was 13.4
million hectares, and that forest genetic resources are
diminishing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
He attributed this to loss of habitat and climatic changes, and
said that as a result of inadequate institutional and human
resources to deal with the problem, large amounts of plant genes
are being lost before they can be identified.
</P>
<P>
It will take a worldwide effort to protect plant genetic
resources, and people must make a choice, according to the social
and economic value of the plants, because they can not all be
protected at present, said Toby Hodgkin of the International Plant
Genetic Resources Institute.
</P>
<P>
In China, the loss of plant genetic resources is more serious,
and is not at present receiving close attention, according to Hong
Deyuan, director of the Institute of Botany of the Chinese Academy
of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Hong said that more than 90 percent of China's wild rice
species that existed in the early 1980s cannot be found
today. Wild rice species are genetic resources for high-yield and
good-quality hybrid rice.
</P>
<P>
China's well-known geneticist Tan Jiazhen urged the
establishment of germplasm banks and the use of modern
technologies, developed for gene mapping, cloning and sequencing
for the human genome project, to search for genes in cash crops
that have desirable traits.
</P>
<P>
"Humans, plants and animals are inter-dependent," said
Professor Bawa, adding that "Protecting them is protecting
ourselves."

<HEADLINE> Siberian Tigers Well-cared-of Under Flood Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The roaring water of the Songhua
River is constantly weakening the dikes, but the life of the 52
Siberian tigers living in the world's large zoo of such creatures
400 meters from the river are as peaceful as usual.
</P>
<P>
Visitors who brave the heavy rain to the zoo are really relaxed
and pleased. But Liu Xinchen, the zoo's director, knows well how
narrowly these precious tigers have escaped the hazards of one of
the worst flood in Harbin, capital of northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
"If not for the round-the-clock anti-flood efforts, the zoo
would have been totally submerged by water," he said.
</P>
<P>
On 6:00 pm, August 11, a 120-meter-long levee near the zoo
suddenly caved in. Without timely efforts, the water might quickly
rush to the zoo.
</P>
<P>
With a strong sense of protecting the endangered species, over
50 zoo staffs rushed to the scene in no time, who were joined by
soldiers of a nearby armed police school. The blocking took seven
hours to complete.
</P>
<P>
The situation of the tigers aroused the concern of the whole
city. While the city government contributed 300,000 yuan
(36,000 US dollars) of special funds, much more were donated from
tiger lovers.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Chengzhong, a staff of the zoo, has been taking care of
the tigers for four days running without going back home, though
his home is constantly threatened by the flood.
</P>
<P>
"I can build another home if it is lost. But if the tiger is
lost, nothing will make up for it," he said.
</P>
<P>
There are about 300 Siberian tigers living in the wild in the
world, mainly in northeast China and Russia. The species is on the
world's list of ten endangered species.
</P>
<P>
A Siberian tiger breeding center was set up in 1986 as part of
China's efforts to increase the number of the precious
creature. Over 100 tigers have been bred since then. The zoo in
Harbin was built in 1996.
</P>
<P>
By 15:00 today, water at the Harbin section of the Songhua
River rose to 119.36 meters, 0.36 meter higher than the safety
mark.
</P>
<P>
"We are all set to move the tigers to safe places whenever
necessary," said Liu Xinchen.

<HEADLINE> Mongolian President Rejects PM Nomination Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian President Nachagyn
Bagabandy repeated on Saturday that he did not agree on the
nomination of Davaadorj Ganbold as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The leadership of the ruling union, the Mongolian National
Democratic Party and Social Democratic Party, had once asked
Bagabandy, on Friday, to submit Ganbold's nomination to the Great
Hural (parliament), a presidential spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Bagabandy insisted that the ruling union made another
nomination, strictly observing legal procedures, the spokesman
added.
</P>
<P>
Bagabandy first rejected the nomination early this month, as he
believed that Ganbold, the Great Hural Standing Committee of
Economic Policy Chairman, was responsible for the country's
intensified banking crisis.
</P>
<P>
A decision in May to merge the state Renovation Bank with the
private Golomt Bank resulted in the dismissal of Prime Minister
Tsakhya Elbegdorj's government in July.
</P>
<P>
President Bagabandy believed that Ganbold failed in his duty of
overseeing or preventing the merger. The Great Hural Friday
withdrew the merger decision.
</P>
<P>
Under Mongolia's law, the ruling party's parliamentary group
should discuss the nomination for prime minister with the
president, who in turn submits it to the Great Hural for
approval.

<HEADLINE> PLA, Armed Police Make Donations to Flood-Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- China's People's Liberation Army
(PLA) and the armed police forces have donated more than 20
million yuan worth of relief goods to flood victims along the
Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The donations came from hundreds of generals on the
flood-fighting frontiers, thousands of retired PLA officers across
the country, and millions of ordinary soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Local governments and ordinary citizens are also making their
contributions to the ongoing flood relief work. In southwest
China's Sichuan Province, ordinary people and local organizations
have donated more than 36 million yuan worth of goods to the flood
victims.
</P>
<P>
On the morning of August 11, Wang Shuang, a sixth-grade primary
school student, sent 100 yuan RMB to the Disaster Relief Office of
the provincial Department of Civil Affairs, the first donation
received by the office since the department called on everyone to
make donations to the flood victims on August 10.
</P>
<P>
On August 12, the provincial government sent 220 tons of pork
and some 500,000 yuan worth of medicines to the flood-ravaged
provinces as Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi and Anhui.
</P>
<P>
"Although Sichuan is also a victim of the rampant floods,
provinces on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River
need the medicines more," said Xie Shijie, secretary of the
Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China
(CPC).
</P>
<P>
In an another development, officials and staff of the organs
under the General Office of the CPC Central Committee have so far
donated a total of 2.07 million yuan to the flood-stricken areas.

<HEADLINE> State Council Circular Calls for Epidemic Disease Prevention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- An urgent circular from the
State Council, China's highest governing body, calls for diligence
in the effort to prevent epidemic disease both during this season
of raging floods and after the waters subside.
</P>
<P>
So far, social and economic order has remained stable in the
flood-besieged areas. However, the experience of history shows
that large outbreaks of epidemic disease may easily occur
following natural disasters, according to the circular.
</P>
<P>
Local governments and health care departments should take heed
to strengthen their leadership over disaster relief and disease
prevention efforts, the circular says, adding that the Ministry of
Health should send groups of experts and national medical teams to
the flooded areas, and leaders should head for the front line.
</P>
<P>
Health departments should adhere to the regulation calling for
close supervision of epidemic disease potential, and timely
reporting during times of emergency, it says.
</P>
<P>
The masses should be mobilized to maintain a clean environment
and try their best to remove any conditions that could possibly
trigger an outbreak of epidemic disease. Efforts should also be
exerted to protect water resources and sterilize water for
drinking, the circular adds.

<HEADLINE> Flood-Fighting Tops Government Agenda: Jiang Zemin (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Flood-fighting is now at the top
of the agenda of local governments along the Yangtze River and all
efforts should be made to ensure the safety of the embankments of
the river, Chinese President Jiang Zemin stressed in flood-ravaged
central China's province of Hubei in a Friday speech, which was
made public today.
</P>
<P>
Top priority should be given to safeguarding the lives of the
people during this effort, Jiang said during an inspection of
Hubei Province Friday.
</P>
<P>
Jiang inspected a number of embankment sections in danger along
the Yangtze, conveyed his concern to local residents and soldiers,
and listened to briefings from local leaders.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee and
chairman of the Central Military Commission, pointed out that
"flood-fighting along the Yangtze River area has reached a crucial
moment when problems may easily appear and carelessness is liable
to cause huge losses".
</P>
<P>
All of the country's forces should make continued and concerted
efforts to support civilians and soldiers who are on the
flood-fighting front lines until a final victory is achieved, he
urged.
</P>
<P>
He said that outstanding successes have already been achieved
in fighting the raging floods in Fujian, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei,
Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Inner Mongolia
since mid-June.
</P>
<P>
During the unprecedented struggle against the Yangtze floods, a
large number of civilians and soldiers have scored a vital victory
by defending the river dikes for more than 40 days and
withstanding five flood crests, he added.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the victory to the strong leadership of the
Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the concerted
efforts by the millions of people and soldiers, the all-out
support by the whole nation, the growing base of both materials
and technology, and the water control system built up in recent
decades.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the army and armed police have won the acclaim of
the people by going all out to join in the flood-fighting work.
So far, 130,000 soldiers equipped with 5,800 vehicles and 860
boats have been deployed along the middle and lower reaches of the
Yangtze River.

<P>
"At present, the situation remains tough along the Yangtze
River," Jiang said, noting that new flood crests may occur as
rainfall is expected on the upper reaches of the river.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we should redouble our efforts and do a better job
in mobilizing, organizing the flood-fighting work," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang demanded that leaders at all levels place great
importance on the flood-fighting effort and give it top priority,
and told them they are all responsible for the effort.
</P>
<P>
Each locality and concerned department and forces from
everywhere should firmly obey orders from the State Flood Control
and Drought Relief Headquarters, he said.
</P>
<P>
The People's Liberation Army should play the role of shock
troops, overcoming fatigue and sharpening vigilance to make new
contributions, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also called for timely efforts to evacuate the people in
dangerous places and ensure they are provided with adequate food,
boiled water, housing, and access to medical service, adding that
attention must be paid to epidemic prevention and public security.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to step up efforts in maintaining normal
public order and crack down sternly on various kinds of crimes,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, governments at various levels should work out plans
to help local people restore production and rebuild their homes,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader noted that water control efforts are very
important for maintaining social order and invigorating the
nation. Floods, a hidden trouble threatening the lives, property
and safety of the people, should arouse high concern from the
whole Party.
</P>
<P>
The central authorities, as well as local governments, have
always attached great importance to strengthening the country's
water-control ability, and have adopted a series of measures to
increase investment in this regard, he said.
</P>
<P>
"However, the water-control ability of our country is still not
very strong, and this requires further effective measures," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that immediately after the present flooding
season, it is necessary that the government work out and implement
efficient measures to build water-control facilities and raise the
capacity for flood prevention.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Balance of Payment Records Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's balance on the
current account had a turnaround from persistent deficits since
the fourth quarter of 1992 to a large surplus of 6.6 billion
ringgit (about 1.578 billion U.S. dollars) in the first quarter of
1998, according to the Department of Statistics Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This surplus was attributed to the surge in earnings from
merchandise exports free on board (f.o.b), which, according to the
figures released by the Department, increased by 5.7 percent in
the first quarter of 1998 to hit 69.1 billion ringgit (about
16.531 billion U.S. dollars) against 65.4 billion ringgit (about
15.645 million U.S. dollars) in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
Merchandise imports f.o.b., on the other hand, dropped by 4.6
percent to 57.6 billion ringgit (about 13.779 billion U.S.
dollars) from 60.4 billion ringgit (about 14.449 billion U.S.
dollars) in the fourth quarter 1997.
</P>
<P>
Hence, the country's merchandise trade surplus was boosted to a
record high of 11.5 billion ringgit (about 2.751 billion U.S.
dollars) in the quarter under the review.
</P>
<P>
An improvement was also evident in the services account deficit
which narrowed to 4.1 billion ringgit (about 1 billion U.S.
dollars) (-31.7 percent) over the previous quarter, owing to an
improved position in the following components such as investment
income, where net outflows declined by 8.3 percent to 3.3 billion
ringgit (about 789.473 million U.S. dollars); freight and
insurance where net outlay reduced by 14.8 percent to 2.3 billion
ringgit (about 550.239 million U.S. dollars); and other services
which recorded a surplus of 0.3 billion ringgit (about 71.77
million U.S. dollars) from 1.3 billion ringgit (about 311 million
U.S. dollars) deficit in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the other transportation and travel and education
components continued to reflect a surplus position, albeit a
smaller one, in the first quarters, the Statistics Department
said.
</P>
<P>
However, net freight and insurance payments widened to 2.3
billion ringgit (about 550 million U.S. dollars) in the quarter
under review from 2.0 billion ringgit (about 478.468 million U.S.
dollars) in the first quarter 1997.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, net long-term capital inflow fell sharply by 72.2
percent to 1.5 billion ringgit (about 358.851 million U.S.
dollars) in the first quarter this year from 5.4 billion ringgit
(about 1.291 billion U.S. dollars) achieved in the
October-December quarter 1997.
</P>
<P>
The reduced net long-term capital inflow was largely due to the
factors such as the reduction of 37.8 percent to 2.8 billion
ringgit (about 669.856 million U.S. dollars) in net inflow for net
private long-term capital from the October-December 1997 inflow of
4.5 billion ringgit (about 1.076 billion U.S. dollars) and a net
outflow of 1.3 billion ringgit (about 311 million U.S. dollars) in
January-March 1998 quarter for net official long-term capital
compared to a net inflow of 0.9 billion ringgit (about 215.311
million U.S. dollars) in October-December 1997 period.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting the outcome on the current and capital accounts, the
basic balance, amounting to 8.0 billion ringgit (about 1.913
billion U.S. dollars) in the first quarter of 1998, was higher
than the level of 3.5 billion ringgit (about 837.32 million U.S.
dollars) achieved in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
The international reserves of Bank Negara (State Bank) Malaysia
concomitantly registered a decline of 1.9 billion ringgit (about
454.545 million U.S. dollars) in the first quarter 1998 as against
a decline of 2.8 billion ringgit (about 669.856 billion U.S.
dollars) in the previous quarter.

time when the bomb went off, because there was no tape working in
the system.
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of the FBI, I want to ensure the people of
Tanzania, the people of Kenya and the United States that we are
dedicated to identify the perpetrators of these attacks," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Piernick said that a total of more than 200 FBI agents are
cooperating with their Kenyan and Tanzanian counterparts in the
bombings investigation at present and that the premises of the U.S.
embassy in Dar es Salaam have been combed, finding no more
remains of the bombing victims.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Director of Criminal Investigation Adadi Rajabu also
told the reporters that search for the whereabout of an assistant
driver of the water tanker, believed to be planted with a bomb
which killed nine Tanzanians and one Kenyan and wounding more
than 80 civilians, was well underway.
</P>
<P>
Rajabu said police have so far found nothing related to the
co-driver of the Embassy's truck, a blue 7-ton Toyota water
tanker, which he believed to be the key to the investigation.

ISLAMABAD, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the Pakistani
Foreign Office Saturday denied India's accusation that its
intelligence agency has abducted one of India's embassy staff.

<P>
"There is no truth in it," the spokesman categorically stated
in his weekly briefing here.

<HEADLINE> Pak Denies Providing Military Assistance to Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Saturday denied
allegations that the country has provided military assistance to
the Islamic Taliban in their recent strong offensives in northern
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"This is motivated propaganda, it also flies in the face of
reality," a Foreign Office spokesman told a weekly news briefing
here in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan has not militarily assisted or interfered in
Afghanistan," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is ironical that a campaign of deliberate distortion on the
situation in Afghanistan has been launched against Pakistan," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We are not only deeply disappointed but we resent that some
countries are making accusations against Pakistan without paying
heed to our clear reiteration of non-involvement and
non-interference in Afghanistan," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Pakistan believes that the international
community should "dispassionately look at the situation in
Afghanistan and accept the realities on the ground."
</P>
<P>
He said the international community should engage with Taliban
so as to encourage them to preserve with their declared domestic
agenda which "is purely domestic and pose no threat to any
neighboring country."
</P>
<P>
In their latest attempt to take over the whole Afghanistan, the
hard-line Taliban militia have overrun Mazar-e-Sharif,
headquarters of the rival northern alliance, and a few other
strategic northern bases over the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Russia, Iran and the Afghan opposition have accused Pakistan of
giving military aid to the Taliban.

Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The rebels in the Democratic Republic of Congo are surrounding
the capital Kinshasa, of which they have deprived electricity after
taking control of a strategic hydro-electric center. The government

-- Fifteen months, almost day by day, after victoriously entering
Kinshasa, Laurent-Desire Kabila risks to know the same fate of his
predecessor, Marshal Mobutu. His intransigence, his failure to keep his
words, his incapacity to give an elan and unity of his country have
tolled the bell for his ambitions.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Deputy PM Calls for Teamwork in Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim Saturday called for teamwork and full
support by all sectors in achieving economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who is also finance minister, said at a forum here that
the prevalent political stability would have to be preserved so
that recovery from the current economic problems could
materialize.
</P>
<P>
"Political stability demands inter-racial harmony," he said,
adding it was incumbent upon the younger generation to preserve
racial harmony, a prerequisite in ensuring a future for the
country.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said Malaysia would have to be prepared to tackle the
economic problems on its own without help from Western countries
which he said would obviously be inconsiderate and unsympathetic
to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has to take full charge in steering its economy out of
the present crisis, without depending on foreign assistance, he
said, adding with bigger Asian economies like Japan, South Korea
and China grappling with their own economic problems, Malaysia had
no countries to turn to for assistance.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said that when rich countries demanded that developing
countries have greater transparency, they must also do the same
especially to their hedge funds and currency trading.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said the claim that the financial meltdown erupted in
Asia because all the regional economies were fundamentally weak
and flawed could not be true.
</P>
<P>
He said the problems were actually due to the world financial
system which lacked transparency and full disclosure of the hedge
funds.
</P>
<P>
He said that while Malaysia wants the world financial system to
be improved, it is not resting on its laurels, and that is why the
government has taken steps to rejuvenate the economy according to
its own set agenda.
</P>
<P>
Anwar also said that the government has accepted the fact that
it would take time for the country's economy to recover but with
resilience and the ability to ward off personal grudges and social
tension, the country's economy could be revived.

<HEADLINE> Power-Sharing Concept to Continue in Malaysia's Sabah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad pledged Saturday the power-sharing concept
practiced by the ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) (National Front) in
the state of Sabah, East Malaysia, will proceed for as long as the
people in the state want it to go on.
</P>
<P>
The power-sharing concept was proposed by Mahathir, who is also
BN Chairman, during the run-up to the state election in February
1994 to provide an opportunity for a representative of the Muslim
Bumiputeras (aborigines), the Chinese and non-Muslim Bumiputeras
in the state to head the state government.
</P>
<P>
The concept, whereby the post of chief minister of the state is
rotated among the three major communities in the state, has
proceeded smoothly after the state election with all the BN
component parties giving their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The first under the rotation system to hold the chief
minister's post was Tun Sakaran Dandai of United Malays National
Organization (UMNO) representing Muslim Bumiputeras from March
1994 who was replaced by Salleh Tun Said in December the same year
when Sakaran was appointed the Governor of the state.
</P>
<P>
Yong Teck Lee, representing the Chinese community, took over
the post in May 1996 and he was replaced by Dompok, who represents
the non-Muslim Bumiputera community, on May 28, this year.
</P>
<P>
"The rotation system will continue unless they (the Sabahans)
themselves feel that it is no longer necessary to do so," Mahathir
told a news conference in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah's capital, before
leaving for Kuala Lumpur after a three-day visit to the state and
the nearby Federal Territory of Labuan, according to Malaysia's
national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir made the pledge at a time when the Sabah state whose
next election is due by March next year is preparing for an early
state election. Mahathir confirmed in an exclusive interview with
Xinhua news agency Thursday that Sabah would go for an early state
election, but without specifying the date.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, when asked for comment on the chances
of BN's victory in the next state election, Mahathir said that at
present there was strong unity in the BN which comprises 14
parties and if this could be maintained there was a good chance of
the BN winning the election.
</P>
<P>
In Sabah, there are nine BN component parties. Mahathir said
that all the BN component parties in Sabah could propose the names
of their candidates to be fielded in the state election but he
would make the final decision.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Rally to End Volatile Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LONDON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- European shares rallied on Friday
after Hong Kong staged a powerful rebound and Moscow vowed not to
devaluate the rouble, ending a highly volatile week which wiped 3
percent off Europe's biggest stock markets.
</P>
<P>
Friday's rally came on the coat-tails of an 8.5 percent
advance in Hong Kong stocks and a 13.7 percent gain in Russia.
Both markets slumped on Thursday as investors focused on
devaluation risks. In addition, a steady yen helped calm
international investors' nerves.
</P>
<P>
In London, the FTSE 100 climbed 55.5 to 5,455.0, but was unable
to hold onto the 5,500 level after reaching a high of 5517.6. The
index lost 225.4 points or 3.97 percent on the week.
</P>
<P>
While oil issues performed well, banking stocks were the main
beneficiaries, with takeover talk adding spice. HSBC and Lloyds TSB
were described as potential partners while reports linking JP Morgan
with an approach from Deutsche Bank boosted the Dow Jones, according
to market sources.
</P>
<P>
Looking to next week, however, traders said that even if
international markets calmed down, there was still a heavy week of
UK data, including inflation and sales figures, to deal with.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfort, the Xetra-Dax rose just over 2 percent at
5,473.72. Shares in Deutsche Bank rose more than 5 percent on
rumors it is in preliminary talks with a major Wall Street firm,
with dealers speculating it had approached JP Morgan.
</P>
<P>
However, traders warned that a close watch was being kept on
developments in Russia, saying that the market would be looking for
signs that German banks could suffer from Russia's continued
financial problems amid concerns about the stability of the rouble.
</P>
<P>
Paris stocks close up over 1 percent, buoyed by Dow rally, but
trade lacked conviction as buyers fretted over Asia.
</P>
<P>
The CAC-40 index closed up 43.22 points at 3,994.91 but were
down 1.16 percent on the week overall.
</P>
<P>
The European markets' gains Friday were small in the context of
recent losses. Since reaching all-time highs four-weeks ago, the
FTSE and DAX have fallen around 12 percent and the CAC more than
9 percent. The Dow, which has led the bull market for three and a
half years, has also fallen more than 9 percent.

<HEADLINE> Pediatrician Convicted in Xinjiang Medical Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A pediatrician whose dereliction
of duty resulted in the death of an eight-year-old girl has been
sentenced to two years in jail and made to pay compensation of
100,000 yuan, by a court in Urumqi, capital of northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old pediatrician, Ding Jie, is the first doctor
convicted of a medical crime in Xinjiang since a law related to
medical practices was added to the amendments to China's Criminal
Law last year.
</P>
<P>
Ding made a simple examination of the girl, Tang Yunlu, who had
a fever and headache, on August 20, 1996, and decided to
hospitalize her in the pediatric ward.
</P>
<P>
After an injection of penicillin, the girl's temperature
remained high. When the girl's parents proposed looking for a more
experienced doctor or transfering her to another hospital, Ding
replied, "let's wait till tomorrow," and he then left.
</P>
<P>
In the small hours of the next morning, under repeated requests
from the girl's parents, Ding prescribed aspirin for the girl who
began to twitch after this treatment, and subsequently died at
10:25 am.
</P>
<P>
The relevant departments of the city of Urumqi and the
Autonomous Region assessed this case as a class-one medical
incident, and the court of the Tianshan District, Urumqi,
sentenced Ding to the prison term and ordered him to pay the huge
compensation.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Ding has lodged an appeal to a higher
court.

<HEADLINE> National Road Gives Way to Stone Buddhas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A project to relocate a section
of National Highway No.109 is under way as part of an effort to
protect over 50,000 stone Buddhas at the Yungang Grottos in north
China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The section, part of the highway linking Beijing with Lhasa,
capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, currently fronts the
entrance to the grottos. The over 10,000 coal trucks using the
main transportation artery on a daily basis have churned out large
quantities and sulphur dioxide which created a grave threat to the
stone Buddhas.
</P>
<P>
The grottoes, located on the southern slopes of Wuzhou Mountain
to the west of Datong, are surrounded by dozens of coal mines with
a combined annual output of over 10 million tons. The existing
highway section was located withing 300 meters of the ancient
cultural site.
</P>
<P>
Air pollution tests show that the dust content in the area
surpasses the state standard by a factor of 27-fold. Acid rain
represents yet another major threat to the stone Buddhas.
</P>
<P>
"The project represents the first time that China has relocated
a major national highway to protect a cultural relics site,"
according to Li Zhiguo, director of the Yungang Grottos Cultural
Relics Research Center.
</P>
<P>
The 25.8-km project will be completed at a cost of 188 million
yuan (22.9 million US dollars) and will add to the total length
for the original section. Plans call for completion of the project
by the end of this year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Evacuated Residents Return as Dike Burst Plugged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JIUJIANG, August 15 (Xinhua) -- People are drying up their
clothing and other belongings under the sun, while the smells and
sounds of cooking are stirring the air.
</P>
<P>
Residents were moving back to their homes in the western
suburbs in Jiujiang, in east China's Jiangxi Province, as the work
to plug a 60 m-burst in the dike of the Yangtze River close to
their houses finally came to its end on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In the first days of the breach, which occurred on August 7,
several thousand tons of rice and soybeans, a large amount of
rock, a truck, and eight boats loaded with rock or coal were
dumped into the breach but failed to block the rushing water.
</P>
<P>
It was finally blocked, on Wednesday, by thousands of soldiers
including a special experts team from the army, with a technology
developed to build bridges in the war time.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three days, people have used 4,000 square meters
of special clay to seal off any leakage in the repaired dike. Some
35,000 square meters of rock are expected to be used to reinforce
it in the coming days, officials in charge of the work said.
</P>
<P>
However, local experts said they will continue patroling around
the 150 kilometer-long city embankments to prevent any possible
burst.
</P>
<P>
No one was killed in the burst, but it has attracted wide
attention from home and abroad. It has been the first burst of the
embankments along the mainstream of the Yangtze since 1954,
according to an expert from the Yangtze River Water Conservancy
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Jiujiang, with a population of 500,000 and an area of 30 square
kilometers, is a major industrial and tourist city in Jiangxi. The
city embankments breached in 1954 when a deluge devastated many
localities along the Yangtze, killing over 33,000.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Apologizes to Victims of Abuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie conveyed here on Saturday his government's apologies to
the people who became victims of human rights violations by the
former government apparatus in May in Jakarta and other cities of
the country.
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of the government, I would like to express my
deepest regrets for human rights violations in several regions.
Hereby, I apologize to the Indonesian people in particular to the
families of the victims," Habibie said in his address of state
before the House of the People's Representatives on the occasion
of the 53rd Independence Day which falls on August 17.
</P>
<P>
The riots, in the form of looting and burning of shopping
centers and people's houses, were even aggravated by the violence
and sexual harassment against women, mostly the ethnic Chinese,
said the president.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that more than 2,000 people were killed and
over 5,000 shops and homes damaged or burnt as well as 170 women
were raped during the May 13-15 riots in the capital city and some
other cities.
</P>
<P>
The president said all of these irresponsible acts are indeed
very disgraceful. "They have streaked the face of our nation, a
nation renowned for its good character and high morals, with
shame. As a civilized and religious nation, we curse these
barbaric acts," he added.
</P>
<P>
All of the nation feel concerned over the cases of human rights
violation against the dignity and honor of the citizens and the
mankind, Habibie said.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, the leadership of Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI)
is thoroughly investigating the case, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to ask all parties, in particular community and
religious leaders to support and trust ABRI and also to give it as
ample opportunity as possible to investigate the case," Habibie
said.
</P>
<P>
The government and ABRI's leaders have asserted that such a
case shall never happen again in the future, he said.

<P>
Daqing, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Most of the some 3,850 people
besieged by flood-water after a dike of the Nenjiang River
breached early this morning have been evacuated to safe places.
</P>
<P>
The 20-meter breach of a 2.7 kilometer levee in Zhaoyuan County
near China's largest oilfield of Daqing inundated 13,333 hectares
of farmland of a nearby farm. The water, if not effectively
blocked, will pose a threat to the oilfield and a railway.
</P>
<P>
It is the second dike breach near Daqing. The first, measuring
500 meters wide, occurred at 6:00 am on August 14.
</P>
<P>
The repair of both of the breaches have been given up. Now the
the effort is focused on fortifying the secondary and the third
dikes protecting Daqing City, local sources said.
</P>
<P>
Heavy waterlogging has already inundated 355 oil wells and
reduced the daily production of the Daqing Oilfields by 807
tons. But most of the 20,000 wells are still operating normally,
according to earlier reports.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Be Tougher on Islamic Clout in School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Higher Education Board
(YOK) is to appoint new university presidents who will not allow
head-scarfed female students into campus and will refuse to
register them if they submit photos wearing headscarves.
</P>
<P>
The Daily News newspaper reported Saturday that this is part of
the efforts by Turkey's secularist institutions to curb Islamist
influence in public places.
</P>
<P>
Wearing headscarves is not illegal, but if done in public
places such as schools and hospitals, it constitutes a "crime" is
punishable by disciplinary action in the predominantly Muslim, but
politically secular country, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The YOK will appoint 20 new university presidents in November
and will take into consideration the backgrounds of the candidates
nominated by the universities.
</P>
<P>
The new presidents will be strictly warned not to tolerate
head-scarfed students entering their schools, to move ahead with
disciplinary action against female students who insist on veiling
their heads, or to expel them if necessary.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, education officials in Ankara launched an
investigation into two religious Imam-Hatip high schools, where
female teachers are wearing headscarves while teaching.
</P>
<P>
The officials said they will take measures against the
principals who allowed teachers to veil their heads in class.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian People Urged to Restore Self-Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie Saturday urged the people to restore their self-confidence
which he said was the key to the country's recovery from its
prolonged economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
"As soon as confidence is restored, I am very sure that
Indonesia will stand up again, faster than other countries which
have been hit by a similar crisis," he said when speaking before
members of the House of the People's Representatives (DPR) on the
occasion of the 53rd anniversary of Indonesia's National
Independence which falls on August 17.
</P>
<P>
All components of the country needed to look at the abundant
natural resources which were waiting to be tapped to yield quick
revenues.
</P>
<P>
"The key to our endeavor to emerge from the present crisis is
to restore confidence, namely the confidence of domestic and
foreign economic actors and, more importantly, confidence in
ourselves," Habibie said.
</P>
<P>
Since the country was hit by the monetary crisis, its economy
has been projected to contract by up to 15 percent this year, its
banking system almost collapsed and its international image
damaged.
</P>
<P>
On his government's strategy to end the crisis which hit
Indonesia since mid-1997, Habibie said his administration would
keep on focusing on four main points of what he called "economic
stabilization and reform programs."
</P>
<P>
The four main points gave high priority to the straightening up
of the country's financial institutions; solving problems relating
to the private sector's debts; making the country more efficient
and competitive by eliminating monopolistic practices; and
promoting openness and transparency in governance and in business
management.
</P>
<P>
Openness and transparency in the two areas were important to
wipe out the country's chronic illnesses: corruption, collusion
and nepotism, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Reforms in the financial sector were needed, because no modern
economy could operate without the support of a well-functioning
and reputable banking system, the president said.
</P>
<P>
To settle the cases of insolvent banks, the Indonesian Banking
Restructuring Agency had taken over the management of 55 banks, he
said, adding that some of the ailing banks' share ownership had
also been taken over.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, international confidence in and support for
Indonesia was now strong as was evident from the fact that the
country with more than 200 million population would receive about
14 billion U.S. dollars in foreign financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
"This amount (of money) can be wholly disbursed within this
fiscal year to sustain our budget and balance of payments," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Habibie, who replaced former president Soeharto after the
latter resigned on May 21 this year, urged the Indonesians not to
feel desperate or pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
"Let us shoulder together in all sincerity and seriousness the
grand task of ushering our nation and state into the twenty-first
century," he added.

<HEADLINE> UN Plans to Receive Congo (K) Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees are taking urgent measures to prepare
for the influx of refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) where rebels are fighting against the government.
</P>
<P>
Lennart Korsalainen, the acting representative of the UNHCR
office in Tanzania, said here Saturday that the agency plans to
open a new reception center in case the refugees from DRC
drastically increase.
</P>
<P>
The center, built last year in the Kibondo District, in west
Tanzania's Kigoma Region, has not received any refugees. The
center was originally planned for refugees from Burundi or other
countries, Korsalainen told Xinhua in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, whether or not to settle down the refugees
in the center is up to the government of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Korsalainen said the refugees fleeing the DRC into Tanzania
are increasing day by day, and reached 159 on Thursday. But these
days the new arrivals have been "very few".
</P>
<P>
The refugees, fleeing by boats across the Lake Tanganyika on
the border between DRC and Tanzania, are currently sheltered at a
reception in the Kigoma town on the shore of the lake.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR office in Tanzania has requested a contingency
budget from its headquarters in Geneva for expanding food and
other services, he said, adding the exact amount of fund needed
will depend on the scale of refugee influx.

<HEADLINE> India Not to Use Nuclear Weapons Against Others: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee Saturday said that India would never use nuclear
weapons for aggression.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the nation from the ramparts of Red Fort here on the
occasion of the country's 51st Independence Day, Vajpayee said
that no power on earth could force India to change from its
pre-determined path of global disarmament.
</P>
<P>
India conducted five underground nuclear tests in mid-May this
year causing great concern the world over. Pakistan, tit-for-tat,
also conducted six nuclear tests at the end of May casting a new
shadow over the bilateral relations between the two neighboring
countries and aggravating tension in the South Asian region.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee said that he looked forward to meeting his Pakistani
counterpart Nawaz Sharif again in Durban of South Africa on the
fringes of the Non-Aligned Summit to carry forward the process of
bilateral dialogue between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee's first meeting with Sharif on the sidelines of the
summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation
(SAARC) in Colombo, Sri Lanka, on July 29-31 failed due to the
dispute over the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that there is no dispute which cannot be resolved
through a dialogue," Vajpyee said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to economic issues, Vajpayee asserted that the
government was determined to make India an economic superpower in
the coming years. He said that India had the potential to play a
leading role in developing information technology and new steps
would be taken in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Though swadeshi (self-reliance) did not mean insulating India
from outside world, no body would be allowed to take undue
advantage of liberalization in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
He identified rising prices and corruption at high places as
two major problems facing the country and expressed his
government's resolve to address them on high priority.
</P>
<P>
Incessant rains dampened Saturday's celebrations with a thin
crowd turning out to hear Vajpayee's speech, canceling also the
aerobatics planned by the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
Drenched school children who gathered on the rain-soaked ground
since early morning and security personnel outnumbered the general
public at the annual event.

<HEADLINE> Eight Japanese Ministers Visit Yasukuni Shrine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Eight ministers of the Japanese
government visited Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine Saturday to pay respects to
Japan's criminals on the 53rd anniversary of the country's surrender in
World War II.
</P>
<P>
The eight included Transport Minister Jiro Kawasaki,
Posts and Telecommunications Minister Seiko Noda, Labor Minister
Akira Amari and Chief of the Management and Coordination Agency
Seiichi Ota.
</P>
<P>
Five other cabinet members also visited the shrine some time
before Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, Chief Cabinet Secretary
Hiromu Nonaka and six other ministers have said they would not
visit the shrine.
</P>
<P>
Japanese cabinet members' visit to the shrine, a bastion of the
wartime military government-sponsored Shintoism and symbol of
militarism in Japan before and during World War II, often draw
criticism from Japan's neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The shrine houses the memorial tablets of 14 class-A war criminals,
including wartime prime minister Hideki Tojo, and some 2.4 million
Japanese military personnel and officials who died since 1853 in
Japan's various wars.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet ministers' visit to the Shrine is also controversial
as Japan's postwar constitution stipulates separation of religion
and the state.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Half-Year Tourism Income up by 5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The income of Jordan's tourism
industry reached 244 million U.S. dollars in the first half of
this year, a 5 percent increase over the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Aqel Biltaji, minister of tourism and antiquities, attributed
the increase to more tourists from the Arab Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
He said the number of such tourists recorded a 36 percent rise
in the first seven months of this year from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
About 351,000 Saudi Arabians and 58,000 Kuwaitis came to
Jordan in pursuit of breeze and cool, out of a total of 444,000
tourists arriving in the kingdom during the period, he told the
official Radio Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The increase of tourism income could also be attributed to
longer stay by the tourists in Jordan, Biltaji said.
</P>
<P>
Each tourist had an average of 4.18 days of stay in Jordan in
the first four months of this year, compared with 3.9 days in the
same period of 1997, he added.
</P>
<P>
The tourism income in the first half of this year would have
been much higher, if the the number of tourists from Europe and
the United States had not suffered a 19 percent decrease, he said.
</P>
<P>
Regional political uncertainty, arising from Israel's hardline
policy on the Arab world and Iraq's brief stand-off with the
United Nations in February, kept away European and U.S. visitors.
</P>
<P>
The number of German tourists decreased by 41 percent,
Austrians by 39.5 percent, Finnish by 27 percent, Britons 24
percent and Swiss by 23 percent in the first seven months of the
year from the same period of 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tourism has been Jordan's pillar industry. Before the Gulf
crisis (1990-91), its annual income usually reached above 500
million Jordanian dinars (about 706 million dollars), or 37
percent of its annual foreign currency earnings and 11 percent
of its gross domestic products.
</P>
<P>
However, the instability in the region in recent years hurt the
industry and its income was down by a big margin.
</P>
<P>
Arab Gulf nationals used to have months-long holidays out of
their countries to escape sweltering summer heat and most of them
would like to spend a few days in Jordan, which boasted summer
breeze and cool.
</P>
<P>
European and U.S. tourists often bought package tours in the
Middle East and included Jordan as one of their favorite stops.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Budget Deficit Sees July Setback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's budget deficit in July
went for the first time this year beyond the overall 42 percent
target for 1998, marking a setback from performance in previous
months, the Daily Star reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In its monthly report issued on Friday, the Finance Ministry
said that the deficit rose from 33 percent in June to 51 percent
last month.
</P>
<P>
Expenditures increased from 427 million U.S. dollars in June
to 492 million dollars, including 219 million dollars for
debt-servicing, while revenues dropped to 243 million dollars
from 288 million dollars, leaving a budget gap of 249 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
For the first seven months of the year, the report said,
expending reached 2.82 billion dollars, including 1.27 billion
dollars in debt-servicing.
</P>
<P>
Revenues only reached 1.76 billion dollars, leaving a deficit
of 1.06 billion dollars, or 38 percent, an improvement on the 50
percent reached at the end of the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Excluding debt servicing, the government achieved a primary
surplus of 200 million dollars for the first seven months of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Huge annual budget deficits has helped push the national debt
over 15.5 billion dollars, an estimated 100 percent of the
national income.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Finance Minister Fuad Sinyoura as saying that
the July setback has not affected the government's optimism about
achieving its 1998 budget deficit target.
</P>
<P>
"We are warning everybody that revenues and expenditures
fluctuate from month to month," he said, adding "We have revenues
that have not been transferred yet."
</P>
<P>
He also believed that the drop in revenues from the Ministry of
Post and Telecommunications, which is considered by the government
as a main national income source, contributed to the increase in
deficit.
</P>
<P>
Local economists said that although the July setback is higher
than figures in recent months, the government is still on course
to achieve its target.

standing dialogue mechanism at the ministerial or vice-ministerial
level, which will serve as a useful channel for inter-Korean
dialogue. If North Korea (DPRK) agrees, I am ready to dispatch my
envoy to Pyongyang to discuss these matters," said Kim.
</P>
<P>
The president said there were many things that the two sides
could discuss if they were to survive on the peninsula the cold
reality of today's international politics.
</P>
<P>
"The Koreas should open a new chapter of reconciliation,
exchanges and cooperation," said Kim in his national address
titled "Let's begin the second nation-building."
</P>
<P>
The president also said the two governments should initiate a
good relationship for mutual prosperity and coexistence within the
framework of the Basic Agreement on Reconciliation, Non-aggression
and Exchanges and Cooperation between the South and the North.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by both Seoul and Pyongyang in 1992,
but has never been implemented because of continuing
confrontations ever since.
</P>
<P>
In the speech, Kim renewed his stance of not tolerating "armed
provocations" of any kind from the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
A DPRK submarine was caught by the South Korean military on
June 22 after it was found entangled in a fishing net in the South
Korean waters.
</P>
<P>
However, Kim said he would support and encourage the program of
exploiting the tourism resources of the DPRK's Mount Kumgang.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Hyundai Group signed an agreement with the DPRK to
develop Mount Kumgang when its boss Chung Ju-yung visited the
country last June.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, 1,000 South Koreans can tour Mount Kumgang
every day from September this year.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Adopts Unemployment Reduction Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 15 (xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government has
approved a national job creation program in an effort to combat
rising unemployment, the Vietnam News, the English daily, reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's working-age unemployment rate in urban areas soared
to 8.1 percent in Hai Phong, 9.4 percent in Nam Dinh, 9.2 percent
in Thai Binh, 9.3 percent in Guang Ninh and 8.9 percent in Bac
Giang, compared with the average urban unemployment rate under 5.9
percent in 1996 and around 6 percent in 1997, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate in Vietnam's rural regions is even higher
than 27.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is expected to have a workforce of over 40 million
people by 2000, compared with 35.9 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Taking these factors into consideration, Vietnam's national job
creation program set out to create more jobs to ensure employment
for all who have the ability to work. Another goal of the program
is to adopt measures to support the unemployed in their efforts to
find new jobs.
</P>
<P>
The program is designed to create 1.3 to 1.4 million new jobs
to press the urban unemployment rate down to 5 percent, and make
sure that rural labourers have work to do at least 75 percent of
the time.
</P>
<P>
To succeed, economic growth must be realized to generate five
million new jobs. Furthermore, 4.5 million people are to be
trained, according to the program, to increase the skilled
workforce to 25 percent by 2000.

capacity" to continue to develop cooperation, particularly in the
petrol and chemical industries, electric energy, mechanical
engineering and tropical farm products processing.
</P>
<P>
The annual trade turnover between Vietnam and Russia has
reached about 300 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Accuses Foreign Bodies of Interference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar authorities have
accused four foreign organizations of interfering in the internal
affairs of the country, the official newspaper New Light of
Myanmar reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued by the Ministry of Home
Affairs, the four organizations accused are International
Organization of Democracy in Burma of the United States,
Alternative Asean Network on Burma and Union for Civil Liberty of
Thailand and Initiative International Dialogue of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
These organizations were strongly condemned for interfering in
the country's internal affairs in the guise of social work and
under the pretext of democracy, and for arranging and financing
the 18 foreigners deported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 18 foreigners, who came to Yangon by air on August 7, were
sentenced by a special court Friday to five years imprisonment on
the account of attempting to incite unrest in the country and were
later released and deported after their punishment was commuted.
</P>
<P>
The foreigners, 10 males and 8 females from the U.S., Thailand,
Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Australia, were caught
and detained by the authorities last Sunday while reportedly
distributing smuggled leaflets in downtown Yangon in support of
local people's struggle for human rights and democracy.

<HEADLINE> Mahathir: Malaysia May Introduce Drastic Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Saturday his government may introduce
measures which may appear drastic in its effort to bring about
economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
The proposed measures could raise apprehension among the people
and prompt them to question whether the impending moves would be
helpful, Mahathir said when addressing a meet-the-people rally in
Kota Kinabalu, capital of Sabah state, East Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
He said notwithstanding that the people may have doubts and
suspicion over the proposed measures, they should have faith that
the proposed measures are meant for the nation's and their own
good.
</P>
<P>
"Have faith in the government. Each time we want to adopt an
approach we'll study it in depth first," Mahathir was quoted by
Malaysia's national news agency Bernama as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said all measures undertaken by the government and
designed to bring about economic recovery would be fruitful only
if the people give full support.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia whose economy was badly hit by the regional financial
crisis since last July has already introduced several measures and
approaches, including the establishment of the National Economic
Action Council, to deal with the current economic problems.
Malaysia registered a negative 1.8 percent growth in the first
quarter this year, the first negative growth in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
"But we'll not just end here. Much more have to be done,"
Mahathir said, adding the government's policies or approaches
were never meant to bring hardships to the people.
</P>
<P>
It would only draw up sound plans for the people whose
undivided support was crucial for their successful implementation,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said speculative raids by currency traders on the ringgit
had not been much of a pressure on the people although the attack
on the currency remained the country's main problem.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the government's policies and approaches in
dealing with such a situation had considerably sheltered the
people from the heat of the raids by the currency traders.
</P>
<P>
As an aftermath of their actions, the government now had
limited resources to finance development projects and had to defer
many of them, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir also told the rally about a foreign conspiracy out to
destroy the economy and topple the national leadership.
</P>
<P>
He said it was clear that parties behind the conspiracy had
failed in their attempt to change the leadership of the country.
</P>
<P>
"With the people's support, we can still stand tall and
preserve the national sovereignty and dignity," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir appealed to the people to fully support the government
in its handling of the economic problems.

COLOMBO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- International tenders for the
construction of the proposed Colombo-Katunayake airport express
highway will be called within the next two months, according to

The 31-kilometer expressway is expected to be carried out on a

The expressway is estimated to cost about 15 billion rupees

aid group, Japanese International Cooperation Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Colombo-Katunayake expressway, initially proposed in the

violations due to the relocation of thousands of residents along
the route and a number of environmental concerns, according to the

<HEADLINE> Riot Masterminds in Indonesia Still at Large: Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Police have arrested 16 people
suspected of instigating the May riots in which 1,200 people were
killed, but the masterminds of the mass unrest are yet to be
found, police said.
</P>
<P>
Coordinator of the Commission on Missing Persons and Victims of
Violence Munir said here Friday that those arrested so far are
relatively insignificant figures, the Observer daily reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The detainees are similar to the policemen who were made
scapegoats for May 12 killings at West Jakarta's Trisakti
University, while the real perpetrators remain free, he lamented.
</P>
<P>
"The policy today in solving the case of the riots and the
Trisakti case is just to find scapegoats. There's no strong
resolve to find the real masterminds who should be the first to be
sent to court," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Munir is adamant that the villains are not being touched
because they have strong links to the military and government.
</P>
<P>
Of the 16 people arrested, just three have been investigated by
public prosecutors and will later be sent to court. The others are
still under the custody of the Metro Jaya Police.
</P>
<P>
The masterminds of the May riots succeeded in destroying
thousands of shops and homes, most of them owned by ethnic
Chinese. As many as 170 ethnic Chinese women were raped during the
riots, the National Committee on Human Rights said earlier.
</P>
<P>
Some government officials claim the riots appeared to be a
spontaneous outburst of anger over the price increase fueled by
the economic crisis and Trisakti killings.
</P>
<P>
But witnesses said that in at least 27 areas of Jakarta,
well-organized groups of men, believed to be from the military,
were seen urging mobs to attack buildings, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Authorities are still looking for 20 men suspected to incite
the unrest, said police spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Edward
Aritonang.
</P>
<P>
The 16 already arrested are accused of spearheading the riots
in 10 locations in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
"The arrest of the suspects clarifies the fact that the May
riots were masterminded," said Aritonang.
</P>
<P>
He said police still do not know whether the instigators were
following orders from high-ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
A government panel is now investigating whether elements of the
Armed Forces were involved.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Observer also carried an editorial "Cat and
Mouse", saying that rumors of a new wave of massacres on
Proclamation Day on August 17 have sent shock waves through the
country.
</P>
<P>
The editorial said this shows that the government has not yet
succeeded in providing a sense of security to our brothers of
Chinese origin, who only last May became victims of unsurpassed
looting, ransacking and gang rape, and to whom, say some sources,
law enforcement agencies have deliberately turned a blind eye.
</P>
<P>
"Whether or not current rumors have any semblance of truth,
those who do not want the present government to succeed, have hit
upon an effective kind of cat and mouse game which puts it on the
defensive, always trying to put out the fire after it has burnt
out the whole environs," the editorial said.

OTTAWA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Canada voiced its concern Friday
over the renewed instability in the Congo and the African Great
Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
It also condemned the continuing inter-ethnic conflict in the
African country and the worsening atmosphere of exclusion and
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
"Canada welcomes and supports the efforts of the region's

regrets that their call for a cessation of hostilities made at the
Victoria Falls meeting has fallen on deaf ears," said Foreign

<P>
National reconciliation, at every level and in every region,
must remain the primary objective in the Congo, Axworthy noted.

He called on all the parties to the conflict to resume
discussions as soon as possible to implement the constitutional
reforms and to lay the groundwork for democratic public
consultations to legitimize the authorities.
</P>
<P>
"Canada remains deeply concerned by statements that are
exacerbating the violence and ethnic discrimination," Axworthy
added.
</P>
<P>
Canada encouraged all parties in the conflict to ensure that
the human rights of every individual in the Congo were respected, to
cease enlisting children as soldiers, and to show justice and
restraint in order to restore calm, Axworthy said.

<P>
SEOUL, August 15 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung Saturday proposed that the two sides on the Korean
peninsula form a ministerial-level dialogue forum, saying he would
like to send an envoy to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK) to discuss the proposal.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to mark the 50th anniversary of the founding of the
nation here on Saturday morning, Kim said the proposal is in the
spirit of his hope to remove the "wall of distrust" between the
two sides and to promote bilateral exchanges and cooperation in
accordance with the principles of separating politics and
economics.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to propose that the two sides establish a
standing dialogue mechanism at the ministerial or vice
ministerial-level, which will serve as a useful channel for
inter-Korean dialogue. If North Korea (DPRK) agrees, I am ready to
dispatch my envoy to Pyongyang to discuss these matters," Kim
said.

<HEADLINE> Andean Community Nations Guard Against Protectionism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Andean Community is refraining
from taking joint action despite a flood of Asian imports,
Sebastian Alegrett, secretary general of the Andean Community,
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Although some countries like Colombia and Venezuela had adopted
unilateral measures to protect their markets against the massive
imports of Asian products, no joint actions had been agreed within
the community, said Alegrett.
</P>
<P>
He said that last week Venezuela had decided to set prices on
imports at between 100 and 200 percent over their cost.
</P>
<P>
Colombia, in a similar way, approved the application of
safeguards to the import of polyester fibers.
</P>
<P>
Peruvian entrepreneurs in the same sector demanded the
government establish a commission to take measures against
Asian imports.
</P>
<P>
But Alegrett there was no decision about the possibility of
adopting a common policy against the affects of massive
Asian imports because of the risk of protectionism.
</P>
<P>
"It must be examined, pondered, the phenomenon must be
followed, but the governments have not had so far a position of
consensus about this matter," he said.
</P>
<P>
The community was established in 1969 and groups Peru, Bolivia,
Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Army Body to Recommend Trial of Prabowo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Officers Honor Council of
the Indonesian Army would recommend that former commander of the
Army's Special Force (Kopassus) Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto be
court-martialled for his alleged involvement in the abductions and
torture of political activists, chief of the council said.
</P>
<P>
"We'll recommend (to Armed Forces Commander Gen. Wirando) that
Prabowo be court-martialled rather than just be given
administrative punishment," Gen. Subagyo Hadissiwoyo said at the
Army's headquarters here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ultimate decision, however, will be taken by Wiranto
himself, said Subagyo, who is also Army chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
Prabowo, son-in-law of former president Soeharto, and his
successor Maj. Gen. Muchdi Purwopranijono as well as the former
commander of Kopassus Group IV for Intelligence Operations Col.
Chairawan, are currently being investigated by the council for the
abductions of more than 20 political activists early this year.
Ten lower-ranking Kopassus soldiers will be court-martialled for
allegedly carrying out the abductions.
</P>
<P>
Prabowo, who has been questioned twice by the council, admitted
that the abductions took place because he misinterpreted an
instruction from a superior.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers reported that Prabowo may also be involved in
other criminal cases such as riots in May in Jakarta and other big
cities during which about 1,200 people were killed and more than
5,000 shops and buildings damaged or burnt as well as 168 women
were raped by the rioters.
</P>
<P>
The Officers Honor Council was established on August 3 and
started work the next day. It will proceed with its questioning
next Tuesday.

BUENOS AIRES, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian President Alberto

Fujimori came to the Argentine capital from Brasilia, where he
reached an agreement with Ecuadoran officials on the setting up of
a temporary buffer zone between Ecuadoran and Peruvian troops in
the disputed border area.
</P>

"This means the risks of confrontation between troops are
practically nonexistent," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the participation of the guarantor countries,
Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the United States, to reach a final
agreement was fundamental.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua Seeks End to Armed Forces Dispute With Costa Rica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Nicaraguan government is
determined to resolve peacefully a dispute with Costa Rica over
armed forces on their common border, rather than send troops to
the area, Nicaraguan army chief Joaquin Cuadra said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But Nicaragua was maintaining its ban on Costa Rican
authorities travelling with weapons on the San Juan River, which
separates the two countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
The problem with Costa Rica had to be solved with conversation,
maturity and prudence, said Cuadra.
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan government declared on Wednesday that a
two-week-old border agreement with Costa Rica was "invalid and
non-existent" in a dispute over the movement of armed forces along
the boundary line.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, covering a 300-kilometer stretch of the Rio San
Juan River, was signed on July 30.
</P>
<P>
Under current treaties, the waterway is under Nicaraguan
sovereignty, but Costa Rica has the right of free navigation.
</P>
<P>
A conflict arose last month when Nicaragua forbade Costa Rican
armed forces from navigating the river with weapons.
</P>
<P>
Last month's agreement allowed Costa Rican police officers to
keep navigating the river carrying weapons, but only after they
informed Nicaraguan authorities of their plans.
</P>
<P>
This agreement, however, met with strong opposition in
Nicaragua's political circles, resulting in a claim by President
Arnoldo Aleman that it was just a simple "press release."

<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Cuban Parliament President
Ricardo Alarcon has accused the Cuban American National Foundation
(FNCA) of continuing to finance terrorist Luis Posada Carriles in
his counter-revolutionary activities against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Alarcon told the NBC radio that Posada had received financial
support for many years.
</P>
<P>
Posada, an exiled Cuban, was charged with taking part in the
bombing of a Cuban airliner in 1976 near Barbados which killed 73
persons.
</P>
<P>
"The sponsorship of the FNCA to Posada not only occurred when
the founder of the organization, Jorge Mas Canosa was alive, but
continues now," said Alarcon.
</P>
<P>
He said that the responsibility of the U.S. authorities in
anti-Cuba activities could not be denied, because they were
obviously organized and directed from abroad with the clear
participation of U.S. citizens or residents.

<HEADLINE> Prices of 900 Medicines Frozen in Panama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Commerce Commission of
the Legislative Assembly and representatives of laboratories and
distributors have agreed to freeze the prices of the 900
pharmaceutical products, a report from the Commission of Free
Competence and Consumer Affairs of Panama said Friday.
</P>
<P>
A reduction in the price of medicines most in demand in
Panama could start in a period of 15 to 30 days.
</P>
<P>
After the repeal of price controls two years ago, 961 medicines
increased their price by 30 percent, 13 increased 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest studies, the medicines increase their
price 63 percent over their production cost, since the
distributors apply a 30 percent rate of profit, and the drug
stores 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
The same source said that legislators, laboratories and
distributors are drafting a list of 350 generic names of
medicines, of which the prices will be lowered in 15 days.
</P>
<P>
The freeze has been applied to prevent an increase in prices
before the reductions come into effect, said Assemblywoman Balbina
Barrera, president of the legislative commission.

<HEADLINE> Three Groups Set Up to Probe May Riots in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Joint Fact-finding Team had
set up three groups to probe the May riots in the Indonesian
capital and other cities, local press Saturday quoted the team's
Chairman Marzuki Darusman as saying.
</P>
<P>
Darusman said that the joint team on Friday set up three groups
respectively in charge of data verification, testimonial affairs
and facts about the victims.
</P>
<P>
"Today (August 14) they have worked and next week we will have
the result of their work," Darusman said.
</P>
<P>
The joint team, which was formed on July 23, involves various
groups such as government officials, military officers,
non-governmental organizations, lawyers and women's organizations.
</P>
<P>
Darusman called on all parties not to make hasty conclusions on
matters related to the May riots as his team needed a conducive
climate to do its best.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped for the people's participation in giving
information so that the team would get a complete picture and make
a recommendation for the government later in October this year.
</P>
<P>
The country saw the worst looting and rioting in decades in
Jakarta and other cities from May 13 to 15. About 1,200 lives were
claimed, and thousands of buildings and vehicles were damaged and
burnt. It was reported that the total number of victims of rape
and sexual harassment from the rioting reached 168.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the government's plan to invite foreign
intelligence agents to Indonesia to take part in the May riots
investigation, Darusman said the joint team must be given the
opportunity to do its best.
</P>
<P>
"We should do what we must do first," he said, adding that he
realized that the government planning to invite foreign
intelligence agents has been influenced by outsiders.
</P>
<P>
Appreciating the government's intention, Darusman said,
"President Habibie may want to show the outside world that we are
serious, but actually we do not need the help of foreigners in the
May riots investigation."
</P>
<P>
Habibie Wednesday ordered Coordinating Minister for Political
and Security Affairs Feisal Tanjung to invite foreign intelligence
agents to Indonesia to examine reports of systematic gang rapes.
</P>
<P>
Members of Indonesian parliament Friday also rejected the
government's plan to invite foreign intelligence agents.
</P>
<P>
They said the government should wait for the Joint Fact-finding
Team to finish its probe into the rapes and use domestic
intelligence agencies, before calling in foreigners.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Asks US to Respect Territorial Integrity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Mexico asked the United
States here Friday to respect its territorial integrity in
operations against drug dealing and the laundering of drugs money.
</P>
<P>
Romero Perez, the Mexican representative at the Hemisphere
Congress for the Prevention of Money Laundering, admitted here the
success of the "Casa Blanca" operation directed by the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA) in Mexican territory, he said
that the U.S. authorities had never consulted with his government.
</P>
<P>
He disagreed with the method of the operations, but he said his
government did not support the illicit activities of the Mexican
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
"For Mexico, as for any other country, it will not be a cause
of pride that the financial institutions in our country were used
for criminals to hide the funds obtained in illegal activities."
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two officials of 12 Mexican banks were detained on the
charges of money laundering in this undercover operation, while
112 others were arrested in Las Vegas and in California, in the
United States, said Perez, who is also an official of the National
Bank and Stocks Commission of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
He also said that three Mexican banks were allegedly involved
in money laundering, 35 million U.S. dollars were frozen, and two
tons of cocaine and four tons of marihuana were seized in the
operations.

<HEADLINE> Arena Likely to be U.S. Soccer Team Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Soccer Federation
President Alan Rothenberg plans to hire Bruce Arena as the head
coach of the U.S. men's soccer national team, according to a
press report here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Aren, coach of two-time Major League Soccer champion D.C.
United, is the lone American of the four finalists to replace
Steve Sampson, who resigned after the American team was beaten
0-3 at the World Cup in France. The others are Bora Milutinovic,
Carlos Alberto Parreira and Carlos Queiroz.
</P>
<P>
Arena, 46, has won the wholehearted support from outgoing
Rothenberg, who for weeks had said he preferred to hire a coach
with international experience.
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg interviewed Arena in Orlando on August 2. He
shifted his view after the meeting. He believes Arena can
acquired the experience through the regional events leading to
the 2002 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
"We are still at the point where it needs to make sense for
both parties," Rothenberg said. "We've not discussed details."
</P>
<P>
Arena, whose only international experience came coaching the
1996 U.S. Olympic team, coached D.C. United to the first two MLS
championships. He said yesterday that no offer has been made and
no contract terms have been discussed with USSF officials.
</P>
<P>
"I'm interested," Arena said. "But I think at this point in
time, there would still be a lot of points to be discussed
related to the position. I feel it is an excellent job."
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg has said he would like to announce the new coach
before his term as USSF president expires on August 23. Arena
likely would be offered a two-year contract with two option years
or a one-year deal with multiple options.
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. coach Steve Sampson had a contract for more than
200,000 U.S. dollars this year but operated on a series of
one-year deals. It is believed that Arena likely would complete
his season with the United and take over the new job on Novenmber
1.

<HEADLINE> IOC Pledges to Control Commercialisation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The world sports governing body
the International Olympic Committee (IOC) pledged on Friday that
it will work hard to control commercialisation in Olympics.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports on Friday, IOC Marketing director Mi
chael Payne said that too many money would be considered by some
to be the biggest threat to sport.
</P>
<P>
"Whether it is selling out to the highest bidder or
compromising what is good for the sport in the name of generating
revenue, money is becoming the dilemma of the new millennium."
</P>
<P>
Payne said the IOC had put in place long-term partnerships
with sponsors, marketing programs and closer control of product
merchandising to generate the huge sums needed to finance the
Olympic Games while allowing the IOC to protect its image and
"look beyond revenue."
</P>
<P>
International Business Machines Corp had announced it had
decided to end its 40-year sponsorship of the Olympics after the
Sydney 2000 games, saying it could not reach financial terms with
the International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
"The level of commitment they want from us in the future is
just too large. It's simply a question of cost," IBM's Eli
Primrose-Smith said.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 Games in Atlanta were the first to be entirely
privately financed and ran into a storm of criticism from sports
officials, commentators and even IOC President Juan Antonio
Samaranch for their tawdry commercialism.
</P>
<P>
"We need commercialisation but this commercialisation must be
controlled," Samaranch said at the time.

Payne said future Olympic merchandising would be driven by an
"Image Model - offering only products that contribute to the
image of the Games."
</P>
<P>
"Beginning with the 2004 Games (in Athens), all city
billboards will carry Olympic messages. Street vending will be
controlled with programes that implement an appropriate 'look of
the games' throughout the city," Payne said.
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta, almost 400 vendors were licensed to sell
everything from ice cream and sausages to T-shirts and
handcrafted items at city-owned locations near the Olympic
Stadium and Olympic Village.

<HEADLINE> Wyatt Creech Appointed New Zealand Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Wyatt Creech, deputy leader
of the National Party, the major ruling party in New Zealand, has
been appointed deputy prime minister to replace Winston Peters
who was sacked Friday.
</P>
<P>
Creech was minister of education and leader of the House before
the promotion.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of promoting Creech to the deputy prime
minister was made Friday by Prime Minister Jenny Shipley, The
Dominion, a Wellington-based newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Bill Birch was appointed treasurer. Birch also continues as
minister of finance.
</P>
<P>
Winston Peters is the leader of the NZ First, the minority
partner of the National Party in the current coalition government.
Shipley accused Peters of violating principles of cabinet
collective responsibility and publicly criticizing government
policy regarding the sale of the government's shareholding in
Wellington Airport, and dismissed him from the post of deputy
prime minister and treasurer. While announcing the dismissal of
Peters, Shipley said she had asked that the Coalition Disputes
Committee be called together in order to have the principles of
collective responsibility confirmed as a clearly understood
requirement of the coalition.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion quoted the prime minister as saying that she
intended to "establish a National-led minority government in the
future", if the coalition disputes procedure could not bring a
satisfactory solution.
</P>
<P>
The dismissal of Peters was followed by an announcement of
selling the government's 66 percent shareholding in Wellington
Airport to Infratil New Zealand for 96.36 million NZ dollars
(about 49 million U.S. dollars). Infratil NZ is jointly owned by
New Zealand Airports, a consortium led by Infratil; British
investment groups Alliance Life Common Fund; and Foreign and
Colonial Special Utilities Investment Trust.

<HEADLINE> No Evidence of Manipulation in Natural Gas Futures: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The International Petroleum
Exchange (IPE) said on Friday that it finds no evidence of price
manipulation on its natural gas futures contract after
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Over the last week gas prices have risen generally, in the
futures and underlying physical markets. UK prompt natural gas
prices have risen in recent days, reaching almost 13 pence,
unusual in Summer months when demand is at its lowest in the year.
</P>
<P>
An industry association representing the UK's largest energy
buyers has suggested that there are rumors that the market has
been manipulated higher in order to influence long term contract
negotiations that are currently underway.
</P>
<P>
However, after having examined closely events on the futures
market and the pattern of trades, the parties carrying out the
trades and the underlying clients, the IPE's Compliance department
concluded that there is no evidence of manipulation.
</P>
<P>
"In this case we have received no official complaint, no hard
evidence of any wrongdoing, merely unsubstantiated rumors. We have
nonetheless investigated these rumors and can find no evidence of
manipulation." said John Mackeonis, Executive Vice President for
Market Supervision at the IPE, in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Hard Water Linking to Children Eczema </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Hard water is a major risk factor
for eczema in primary school children, British researchers said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Water hardness was more strongly linked with the painful, itchy
skin disorder than traffic pollution or any other suggested
hazard, rfesearchers from the the University of Nottingham
reported in The Lancet medical journal.
</P>
<P>
Researchers found that 17.3 percent of primary school children
living in areas with hard water had suffered eczema for a year,
and 25.4 percent had the disorder all their lives.
</P>
<P>
For soft-water areas the figures were 12 percent and 21.2
percent respectively, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
The study involved 4,141 primary school children and 3,499
secondary school children in southern Nottinghamshire in the UK.
</P>
<P>
The scientists said water hardness may worsen or prolong
existing eczema because calcium and magnesium in the water act as
chemical irritants.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Envoy Says News Report Proves U.S. Influence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Ambassador to the
United Nations Nizar Hamdoon said Friday that a report by the
Washington Post Friday proves that the U.S. has "too much
influence" on U.N. arms inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"This is why Iraq has requested in the past... that there
should be a major change in the whole infrastructure" of the U.N.
Special Commission for disarmament in Iraq, or UNSCOM, he told a
CNN program.
</P>
<P>
The Post says U.S. officials have asked UNSCOM head Richard
Butler to try delaying surprise arms inspections to avoid
confrontation with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A standoff between Iraq and UNSCOM has emerged since Iraq
decided Wednesday last week to suspend cooperation with UNSCOM,
demanding a "restructure" of UNSCOM and its removal from New York
to Geneva or Vienna to reduce what it calls American influence.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly accused UNSCOM of being influenced by the
U.S. to prolong the disarmament process so that sanctions imposed
on Iraq since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait remain in force
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued here today, UNSCOM denied being given
or having accepted any "external direction".
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic efforts are being made for the resumption of arms
inspections following U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's
suggestions to the Security Council that Iraq be engaged more
closely in finding ways of resolving the differences.
</P>
<P>
The 15 member Security Council is expected to meet on Monday to
decide its next step.

<HEADLINE> UK Launches Tab Bid to End Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- A system for keeping tabs on all
cattle from birth to death is being introduced in Britain in a bid
to persuade the European Union to lift its ban on British beef
exports.
</P>
<P>
British farmers hope the new 35 million pounds (about 56
million U.S. dollars) cattle tracking service, which comes into
operation next month, will help them prove their herds are free of
the "mad cow disease", according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
Final trials of the system, whereby every animal in the country
will be tagged, are taking place in Cumbria.
</P>
<P>
Each animal must, by law, be registered within a week of its
birth, with its history to be documented throughout its life on a
form similar to a vehicle registration document, according to the
new system.
</P>
<P>
And every time an animal is bought or sold, the tracking
service will have to be notified. Farmers who fail to register
their cattle will be fined or even sent to prison.
</P>
<P>
British Agriculture Minister Jeff Rooker was quoted as saying:
"We hope for an early lifting of the ban." He told BBC Radio that
he hoped the ban would be lifted by the end of the year and that
negotiations were taking place "on a daily basis".
</P>
<P>
He added that the new system was in addition to existing
efforts and that "there is no excuse for the beef ban not being
lifted now".
</P>
<P>
Those running the scheme for the Ministry of Agriculture
believe it could be a critical factor in persuading European vets
and politicians to lift the ban on British beef.
</P>
<P>
The EU ban has been in place since March 1996 when the UK
Government admitted there was a possible link between Bovine
Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) - or 'mad cow disease' - and
Creutzfeld Jakob's Disease, a fatal condition affecting humans.
</P>
<P>
One month later it was announced that all animals aged over 30
months at the time of slaughter would be destroyed rather than be
allowed to enter the human food chain.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, more than a million unwanted calves have been
slaughtered, and more than two and a quarter million older cattle
killed. The total cost of BSE to British taxpayers is set to top
4 billion pounds or over 6.4 billion U.S. dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Friday urged Russian President Boris Yeltsin to take quick,
decisive action to restore stability and confidence in Russia's
economy.
</P>
<P>
During a 40-minute phone call, Clinton received assurances from
Boris Yeltsin on Friday that Russia is taking the necessary steps
to weather its latest economic crisis, White House spokesman Mike
McCurry told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The leaders did not discuss whether a new aid package from the
West would be needed, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This was not a phone call about money. It was a phone call
about doing the things necessary" to stabilize an economy that has
been struggling, McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
"President Yeltsin sounded strong and confident in his economic
team," McCurry said. "They discussed some of the steps that will
be necessary to, over the long term, assure economic stability in
Russia."
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, a U.S. official told reporters that Clinton
encouraged Yeltsin to take some decisive steps in the next few
days that would help change the market psychology, so to speak, in
restoring confidence.
</P>
<P>
"The president encouraged President Yeltsin to work with his
economic team and take some action sooner rather than later," said
the U.S. official.
</P>
<P>
"They need to keep doing the things that they need to do under
the IMF program. That will both send the right signal to the
markets and improve the climate when the IMF evaluates release of
the next tranche," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Yeltsin will meet in Moscow early in September with
economic issues likely to dominate the summit.

UNITED NATIONS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan has designated the Department for Disarmament Affairs
as the focal point to coordinate all action on small arms within
the U.N. system, it was announced here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
A panel set up recently by the Department includes all
departments and agencies with comparative advantages in pursuing
the objectives of the U.N. policy on small arms, the Department
said in a press statement.
</P>
<P>
Among others, the objectives are:
</P>
<P>
-- to retain its lead in putting the issue on the global
agenda;
</P>
<P>
-- to determine priorities for international action;
</P>
<P>
-- to encourage civil society involvement in building
resistance to violence, and
</P>
<P>
-- to strengthen U.N. capability for responding to requests for
assistance by affected countries.
</P>
<P>
On the panel's agenda is an international conference on illicit
arms trade to be hosted by Switzerland in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has attached great importance to the issue of small
arms as these arms are closely related to armed conflicts in the
world today.
