<HEADLINE> China, Japan Split Top Four in Go-Chess Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- China and Japan had secured two
spots each in the last four of the Go-chess championship after the
quarterfinals concluded here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
China has its surviving entries of seven-dan Zhou Heyang and
nine-dan Ma Xiaochun, while Japan boasted of two nine-dan players
of Koichi Kobayashi and Wang Licheng.
</P>
<P>
After the South Koreans were all eliminated in the second
round, the last eight featured five Japanese players and three
Chinese nationals.
</P>
<P>
The match between Chinese Zhou Heyang and Japanese Masaki
Takemiya lasted for seven hours, with Zhou winning the board by
two and a half pieces.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the game, Masaki said "Zhou has surprised us a lot by
upsetting reigning champion Lee Chang-ho of South Korea, but I'm
not to be his next victim."
</P>
<P>
Ma Xiaochun outwitted his Japanese peer Lin Haifeng by one and
a half pieces as the latter was exploited in his loose attacks in
the center.
</P>
<P>
Eight-dan Chao Hao of China squandered his advantages in the
contest against Satoru Kobayashi, failing to enter the last four
by one and a half pieces.
</P>
<P>
In the previous meet, Chao was also stopped by Satoru in the
quarterfinals.
</P>

In the other all-Japanese game, Wang Licheng outplayed Cho
Chi-hum after 165 moves by slicing off a Dragon in the center,
forcing Cho leave the venue with tears full in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
The semifinals will be held in Tokyo on July 5 with Zhou Heyang
facing Satoru Kobayashi and Ma Xiaochun playing Wang Licheng.

<HEADLINE> Iraq, Syria Resume Trade Relation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Iraq and Syria have resumed the
bilateral trade ties which were cut off in early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported that the Iraqi Trade
Ministry today signed several contracts with Syrian companies to
supply Iraq with foodstuff under the Iraq-U.N. "oil-for-food"
deal.
</P>
<P>
INA said Iraq will import a large quantity of wheat, pulses,
soap and detergents from Syria, but it gave no more details.
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted a Trade Ministry official as saying
that these contracts are the first step to broaden the trade
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi trade delegation will leave for Syria soon to
reactivate trade exchange. The delegation has been invited by
Syrian Federation of Chambers of Commerce, according to the
official.
</P>
<P>
A Syrian trade delegation last month paid a first visit to
Baghdad since Iraq severed the diplomatic relations with Syria
in early 1980s because Damascus sided with Iran after the
Iraq-Iran War broke out.
</P>
<P>
The relations between the two countries further worsened since
Syrian troops joined in the 1991 Gulf War against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Israel Denies Israeli-Palestinian Meeting in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Israel today denied the
announcement by Egypt that Israeli and Palestinian officials
would meet in Cairo Sunday to discuss resuming the stalled peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Shai Bazak, spokesman for Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu,
also denied the claim by Palestinian officials that Israel had
agreed to halt the controversial construction of Har Homa
settlement in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Bazak issued the denials hours after Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa announced that senior Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators would hold a meeting in Cairo to
resume talks. This was regarded as a breakthrough in the
Egypt's recent mediation efforts to get the peace process back
on track.
</P>
<P>
Moussa's announcement came after Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak met with visiting Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat, who briefed Mubarak on the latest
contacts between Israel and the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Arafat also discussed with Mubarak a number
of proposals on renewing the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Mubarak are reportedly working on a five-point plan
on resuming the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, which calls on
Israel to freeze the settlement expansion, abide by the interim
agreement and coordinate with the PNA in deciding the scope of the
second and third Israeli troop pullbacks in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
In return, the PNA agrees to commit itself to maintaining
security cooperation with Israel and combating terrorism against
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted a Palestinian official as saying that
Israel's agreement to halt the Har Homa project was conveyed
by Egyptian mediator Osama Baz, and this led to the Moussa's
announcement of holding the Israeli-Palestinian meeting in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The official added that Israel and the PNA were working on the
text of the announcement on declaring the suspension of Har Homa
project.
</P>
<P>
But Bazak denied all these claims amid mixed signals on the
Egyptian efforts in reviving the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Baz has just returned from a visit to Washington to brief the
United States officials on his shuttle mission here last week. He
is expected to return soon for another mission aimed at breaking
the deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian talks.

LONDON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- British army engineers today
recovered from the sea three prototype bouncing bombs used in the
Second World War.
</P>
<P>
The bombs, designed by Barnes Wallis and used in an air attack
in 1943 to disrupt German war industries, were found in the sea

</P>
<P>
"They are still intact and many of the threads and bolts are
still workable," said army spokesman Captain Alan Conroy.
</P>
<P>
The bombs, which experts say may still contain explosives, were
spotted just off the coast at low tide. They are destined for
military museums once they have been made safe and cleaned.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Host International Economic Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Israel has decided to host a
large international economic conference in 1998 as part of
celebrations of 50th birthday of the Jewish state, reported
bi-weekly Israel Business Today.
</P>
<P>
An organizing committee is currently being established, which
is to be chaired by Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The conference will be designed to provide leading financial
organizations and potential investors with information regarding
Israel's economic program for the coming years, and to attract
foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The event organizers intend to invite around 600 guests to
the conference, including the heads of multinational corporations
and some of the world business community's leading investors.
The speakers at the event will present Israel's economic plans
for the 21st century
</P>
<P>
Several large conference organizing companies from around the
world have already been contacted and a decision is expected to be
announced in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem is the venue of an annual international business
conference. But due to the low ebb of the peace process in
the Middle East, the participants in the 1996 conference were
considerably less than the previous three years. Some Arab
states boycotted the conference.
</P>
<P>
Many Arab countries have also voiced their opposition to
extend invitation to Israel for the 1997 Middle East and North
African Economic summit to be held in Qatar later this year.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: No Formal Palestinian-Israeli Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
today ruled out Palestinian-Israeli experts' meeting here Sunday
would be a resumption of formal peace talks that collapsed two
months ago.
</P>
<P>
"It would differ from the normal negotiating track between the
them," the minister told reporters, adding Egypt will attend the
meeting as an observer.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian-Israeli negotiations have their track and
certain committees," he added. But this meeting was decided upon
after Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat
Friday met an advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu
who conveyed some Israeli ideas to bring closer views.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks broke down in March when
Israel began construction of a new Jewish settlement in disputed
Arab East Jerusalem. Palestinians conditioned the resumption of
negotiations on halting the project.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's meeting will tackle the Jewish settlements and other
important issues on the Mideast peace process, said Moussa earlier
following a brief meeting here this morning between Arafat and
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
The summit, the second in four days, took place on the heels of
Netanyahu's declaration of plans to retain 60 percent of the West
Bank lands in his envisioned final peace settlement on the
Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Sobieh, Palestine's permanent delegate to the Arab
League, who attended the meeting, said that Arafat briefed Mubarak
on dangers of Netanyahu's plan, which he termed as a "flagrant
violation" of Oslo and other signed accords.
</P>
<P>
"The 40 percent (of the West Bank) Israel will give to the
Palestinians represents separate parts (of the occupied lands),
with Israel keeping greater Jerusalem," he said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's plan, which was revealed early this week, includes
a partial Israeli withdrawal from 40 percent of the West Bank and
strengthening the Israeli presence in Jerusalem and the Jewish
settlement in the West Bank. The Palestinians have rejected it.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said instead of fresh U.S. suggestions to bring closer
Palestinian and Israeli view points, there are only Israeli
proposals now.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has taken an important role in mediating an end to the
crisis between the Palestinians and Israelis after U.S. Mideast
coordinator Dennis Ross's shuttle trips tappered off.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's top aid Osama el-Baz, upon return from his five-day
visit to the U.S., said he briefed Washington on his shuttle tours
between Israel and the PNA designed to bring them back to the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said Egypt and the Palestinians were working
on a five-point plan which includes a freeze on any change in the
status of Jerusalem and a ban on Jewish settlement of the West
Bank for a "sufficient period" of time.
</P>
<P>
In return, the Palestinians would give a firm commitment to
address Israel's security demands, they added.
</P>
<P>
Despite the Egyptian efforts, the gap remained wide, especially
on the question of Jewish settlement, according to the
sources. Netanyahu has refused to stop the new construction.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Wins Seat in Irish Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein, political wing of the
Irish Republican Army (IRA), has won a seat in the new Irish
parliament, reports from Dublin said today.
</P>
<P>
Its candidate Caoimhghin O Caolain won a seat in the border
constituency of Cavan Monaghan in the Irish general election which
was held on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein's election victory, its first since 1981, will
reinforce the party's demand for entry to talks on the future of
Northern Ireland, observers said.
</P>
<P>
It is barred by Britain and Ireland from Northern Ireland peace
talks because the IRA has not restored a ceasefire it broke in
February 1996 with a huge bomb in London. But Sinn Fein insists it
is committed to peace and demands entry to the talks.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein also fielded candidates in Northern Ireland in
British elections. Party leader Gerry Adams and senior strategist
Martin McGuinness were elected to Britain's House of Commons in
the May 1 election, but have refused to take their seats as this
would entail swearing allegiance to the Queen.
</P>
<P>
The party decided in 1986 to abandon its long-standing policy
of boycotting the Irish parliament, but until now has failed to
capture any seats in subsequent elections.

<HEADLINE> Radio Report: Lebanon to Resume Diplomatic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon will "soon" resume
diplomatic ties with Iraq and resume bilateral trade, Jachques
Sarraf, chairman of the Lebanese Industrialists Association,
expected today.
</P>
<P>
Sarraf, who visited Baghdad heading a powerful delegation of
Lebanese businessmen, was quoted by the state-run Lebanon Radio as
saying that the Lebanese government "will coordinate on this issue
with Syria."
</P>
<P>
Syria, with some 35,000 troops stationed on two thirds of
Lebanon's territory, is the most influential foreign broker in
this country.
</P>
<P>
"The resumption of diplomatic relations is necessary for a
resumption of Lebanon's exports to Iraq," Sarraf pointed out,
hoping that Lebanon and Iraq will re-open their embassies in each
other's capitals.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese Industrialists Associations has a say in the
policy-making of the Lebanese government under the
billionaire-turned Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon broke off diplomatic ties with Iraq in April 1994,
over the killing of an Iraqi opposition leader, Talib Suheli
Al-Tamimi in Beirut in which the Lebanese government accused
Iraqi diplomats of being involved.
</P>
<P>
However, the relations between Iraq and Lebanon had become
tense when Iraq backed Lebanese former army general Michel Aoun in
his failed war against Syrian forces in Lebanon in 1989.
</P>
<P>
As a sign to show intentions to improve the relations, the
Lebanese authorities released three Iraqis last January, who were
arrested shortly after Al-Tamimi's assassination. The authorities
had suspected that they were perpetrators of the murder.

<HEADLINE> OAU Chief Stresses Stability, Development in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Pei Shanqin)
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Organization of African
Unity (OAU) Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim said here today
that the challenges facing the OAU and the continent in general
are still political stability and economic development at
present.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief, during a two-day stop-over in his native
country Tanzania from Harare, Zimbabwe, where he attended the
organization's 33rd summit meeting, told a press conference that
from now on, the OAU will strongly oppose any group or people who
topple a democratically elected government in Africa.
</P>
<P>
For political stability in the continent, "there must be a
wind of change to ensure democracy prevails in Africa," he said,
adding that, "we have rejected the Sierra Leone military's
takeover."
</P>
<P>
He said, "our stand also still remains the same with regard to
Buyoya's administration in Burundi, who must fulfill conditions
set forth by the Great Lakes region leaders before sanctions
could be lifted on his administration."
</P>
<P>
Salim further said that there is need to strengthen the OAU's
conflict resolution mechanism unit through increased
contributions by member states to reduce donor reliance.
</P>
<P>
Africa must respond quickly to conflicts at their early stages
rather than waiting to intervene when fighting has started, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief said that another priority area in Africa is
economic development, with stress placed on integration of
economies.
</P>
<P>
"For Africa to be competitive in the economic scene, we must
be serious on integration," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said: "it is high time we must be practical. The OAU will
strengthen its support to such regional bodies as the SADC,
COMESA and ECOWAS in this direction."
</P>
<P>
On the role of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the OAU
chief said it should also be strengthened, adding that the NGOs
had greatly contributed to the development process in the
continent.

ANKARA -- Turkey's Akkuyu nuclear power plant bid has to be
delayed for two months, local newspaper Daily News reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted informed sources from the energy and natural
resources ministry as saying that the decision was made on a
request of one of the three tenderers.
</P>
<P>
Two of the prospective consortia are already prepared to seal
their bids but the third one has requested a delay for unknown
reasons, said Ugur Dogan, a consultant with the ministry.
</P>
<P>
However, Dogan failed to give the names of the three bidding
companies.
</P>
<P>
While saying that it was unfair to reveal the construction
financing before the bid was submitted, he told the paper that
the project, which is located in Mersin, a coast city in southern
Turkey, is estimated to cost around 2.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the safety of the nuclear power, the official said
that the experience of those developed countries had proved that
it was safe to generate power through nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
Some environmental protection organizations have protested the
government's program to build nuclear power plant for fear of
pollution and health problems.
</P>
<P>
As an energy-starving country, Turkey has to import oil and
natural gas to meet its domestic needs every year.
</P>
<P>
BAGHDAD -- Iraq and Syria have resumed the bilateral trade ties
which were cut off in early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported that the Iraqi Trade
Ministry today signed several contracts with Syrian companies to
supply Iraq with foodstuff under the Iraq-U.N. "oil-for-food"
deal.
</P>
<P>
INA said Iraq will import a large quantity of wheat, pulses,
soap and detergents from Syria, but it gave no more details.
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted a Trade Ministry official as saying
that these contracts are the first step to broaden the trade
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi trade delegation will leave for Syria soon to
reactivate trade exchange. The delegation has been invited by
Syrian Federation of Chambers of Commerce, according to the
official.
</P>
<P>
A Syrian trade delegation last month paid a first visit to
Baghdad since Iraq severed the diplomatic relations with Syria
in early 1980s because Damascus sided with Iran after the
Iraq-Iran War broke out.
</P>
<P>
The relations between the two countries further worsened since
Syrian troops joined in the 1991 Gulf War against Iraq.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces Plan for Hate Crimes Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton Said
Saturday that it is time for Americans "to mount an all-out
assault on hate crime," and called for convening a White House
conference this fall to address the threat.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio address today, Clinton says the conference
will seek to "confront the dark forces of division that still
exist" in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Janet Reno is reviewing the current hate
crimes' laws on the books, and in preparation of the conference
will determine ways the federal government can put in place a
"vigorous plan of action" to counter the menace.
</P>
<P>
Clinton says crimes "committed solely because the victims have
a different skin color or a different faith or are gays or
lesbians, leave deep scars not only on the victims, but also on
our larger community."
</P>
<P>
The conference is planned for November 10 at the White House.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone's Coup Leader Explains Power Takeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's coup leader Major
Johnny Koroma has said the soldiers seized power in order to end
the six-year civil war in the country, according to a report
reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
In his first formal interview with foreign press on Friday
since the May 25 coup, Koroma said that the rebel Revolutionary
United Front (RUF), which launched the civil war in 1991, and the
army were tired of fighting and wanted peace, which is the reason
that they are now standing together.
</P>
<P>
He also said he planned to form a broad-based government in
which rebels played a full part.
</P>
<P>
"Our intention is to form a broad-based government of national
unity fully incorporating the RUF to restore everlasting peace
and sanity throughout the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Koroma said: "we are committed to the democratic process
and we want elections but there are problems that we have to
solve. We must make sure that these problems are ironed out before
there will be an election," adding that this would take at least
18 months.
</P>
<P>
Koroma also accused ousted civilian President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah, whose election last year ended four years of military
rule in Sierra Leone, of undermining the honor and dignity of the
armed forces by turning a militia of Kamajor traditional hunters
against them.
</P>
<P>
By "arming and poisoning the minds" of the Kamajor, the
Kabbah government was deliberately trying to "sabotage the
legitimacy of the military", he said.
</P>
<P>
"This situation led to the persistent slaughter of soldiers
nationwide," Koroma said, adding that in spite of repeated
complaints, the past government refused to take necessary action.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the soldiers had to overthrow the government
by means of coup because they wanted to "prevent the country from
descending into tribal and regional warfare".
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the formation of the civil defense
forces on regional and tribal lines would "no doubt have created
disaster for this nation".
</P>
<P>
As for the RUF rebels, who flooded into the capital Freetown
after the coup, Koroma said the coup organizers were able to
control them.
</P>
<P>
"They (the rebels) are committed to peace in Sierra Leone and
the RUF has assured the new military regime through the RUF
leader, Corporal Foday Sankoh, that they are committed to peace,"
Koroma said.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh was reportedly discharged from the RUF leadership by
his followers after an alleged house arrest last May in Nigeria.
The coup leaders have appealed the Nigerian government to send
him back.
</P>
<P>
The coup has been widely condemned among the international
community. The west African peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG
has started military intervention to restore Kabbah's government
in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
However, according to the report, dissident army officers have
said they will not accept Kabbah back.
</P>
<P>
The situation still remains tense in Freetown and many people
have been fleeing for fears that ECOMOG bombardment might take
place this weekend.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between west African countries and the military
are reportedly underway for a peaceful settlement of the crisis
in the country.

The accident occurred 10 miles to Charleston, West Virginia.

confirmed today in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's public relations department said in a statement
that "the security authorities have managed in a record time to

KATHMANDU, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government is making
preparations for setting up separate centers for the development
and rehabilitation of indigenous and backward communities, local
sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State Mahesh Chaudhari disclosed the government's
plan to preserve the interests of backward communities while

Official demographic statistics show that there are 61 groups

It was estimated that the indigenous groups, with different
languages from each other, account for about 35 percent of the

Analysts attribute the increase to sufficient funds coming from
the issuing of treasury bonds, recalling discount loans to
commercial banks by the central bank, and the steady increase in
savings deposits.
</P>

This is tied to the continuous drop in interest rates this
year, which averaged 0.43 percentage points in the past five

<HEADLINE> High Cost Drives Nigerians Away From Hospitals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- High cost of medical treatment,
time-wasting in outpatient wards and widespread demand for
pre-treatment deposits are driving more and more Nigerians away
from hospitals.
</P>
<P>
A survey by the Sunday Times found that seven out of 10
persons interviewed in Lagos said they would rather consult
friends, spiritualists or roadside drug sellers than go to
hospitals when they are ill.
</P>
<P>
Professor Olusoga Sofola from the college of medicine,
university of Lagos, said that patients had become so few that
there were not enough of them with whom to train medical students
at the college.
</P>
<P>
At the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, patients now
have to deposit 20,000 naira (about 235 U.S. dollars) for any
surgical operations involving blood transfusion. This is a rise
of 100 percent over the charges last year.
</P>
<P>
In some hospitals, patients who fail to raise the required
deposits are sent away.
</P>
<P>
When patients turn to roadside drug sellers, the chances are
that they have a possibility of 70 percent to buy fake drugs,
according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Noniface Oye Adeniran, an official from the Nigerian
Medical Association, however, defended the hospitals' high
charges.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the situation to the poor financing of hospitals by
government.
</P>
<P>
Further more, he said, doctors operate within the same
economic climate as other companies. When the cost of everything
is going up, it is not fair to blame hospitals alone for rising
charges over services.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper suggested that solution lies in the need for a
national health insurance scheme and a review of the country's primary
health care program.

<HEADLINE> East China Farmer-Businessmen Interested In Farming Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Some farmers who turned to
business in Zhejiang Province, in east China, have shown a renewed
interest in their former profession -- but this time, they plan to
develop more by hiring laborers instead of working like they did
before.
</P>
<P>
At least 100,000 former farmers in the province have gone
elsewhere to grow farm produce and provide badly needed
by-products. The new move started with mushroom growers in
Qingyuan County, where land was insufficient and the price of
mushrooms too low, so farmers decided to try their luck in the
Shanghai suburbs in 1993.
</P>
<P>
They got land contracts for land and grew mushrooms there at
about the same cost but sold them at a much higher price,
encouraging others. Now over 10,000 of them are making a good
profit growing mushrooms and raising fish, both of which sell well
in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
In the late 1970s, farmers from Zhejiang took the lead in China
in going elsewhere to look for job opportunities, and more than
two million of them made a lot of money that way. Some of them
went back to their villages and set up businesses, becoming
businesspeople overnight.
</P>
<P>
These farmer-entrepreneurs, of which there are estimated to be
about 200,000, have helped improve the province's agriculture by
expanding the scale of farming by integrating agriculture,
industry and trade.
</P>
<P>
One of those businessmen working in other provinces is Xie
Fujiang, in Huzhou, who is a fairly typical example. He signed a
30-year land-use contract for about 86 ha earlier this year on a
state farm in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province to grow
soybeans.
</P>
<P>
Xie paid the farm nearly 640,000 yuan for miscellaneous fees,
but says, "I believe the fertile land will repay all my investment
in two years, if everything goes smoothly." He plans to sell the
soybeans in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
Some other businesspeople even go abroad. One edible fungus
company has bought about 1.6 ha of land in Seattle to grow
mushroom.

<P>
PARIS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- France is reportedly sending war
materials to the Congo Republic after one French soldier was
killed and five others wounded Saturday evening in a skirmish with
"uncontrollable armed elements" in Brazzaville.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry did not specify which kinds of war
materials were being sent or from where they were sent.
</P>
<P>
Agence France Presse (AFP) reported that they are apparently
Vehicles of Avant-Blinde used by French army to transport soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The vehicles can be sent either from France or from the Central
African Republic or Gabon, where France maintains military bases.
</P>
<P>
About 450 French soldiers are now deployed in Brazzaville,
originally for the purpose of evacuating French nationals from
neighboring Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of
Congo.
</P>
<P>
Violent fighting continued in Brazzaville today between the
supporters of Congolese President Pascal Lissouba and those of
former President Denis Sassou-Nguesso.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers supporting Sassou-Nguesso today claimed the
capture of the central government building, the treasury and two
strategic highlands overlooking Brazzaville.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Radio France Internationale, the former
president said that he would accept a ceasefire if the government
admitted that he had been self-defending.

<P>
JERUSALEM, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Israel's delegation will leave
for Cairo later today for talks with the Palestinians, according
to an announcement of Israeli Prime Minister's Media Advisor.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken after hearing Palestinian denial that
it had commitment from Israel to stop construction of
settlements, said the announcement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh officially
informed Egypt, in a telephone conversation with Egyptian
presidential advisor Osama el-Baz, that the Israeli delegation
would not leave today for the Cairo experts' meeting due to a
statement by Palestinian National Authority official Marwan
Kanafani.
</P>
<P>
Kanafani was quoted in Israeli radios as saying that Israel had
agreed to halt the settlement building in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel conditioned the departure on an unequivocal denial by
the Palestinian side that Israel had made any commitment.

<HEADLINE> Iraq's Power System Close to Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's power generation system,
which is working at only 40 to 50 percent of the capacity due to
lack of spare parts, is close to collapse, the English-language
newspaper Baghdad Observer reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper in an article quoted Kareem Wahid Hassan,
director-general of Dora power station in the capital, as
saying that "only 40 to 50 percent of the capacity of the
country's whole power generation system was regained."
</P>
<P>
He told reporters recently that Iraq has used up most of the
spare parts in government storage in order to maintain such
capacity of power generation.
</P>
<P>
Over 2.5 million Iraqi families suffer the shortage of
electricity, Adnan Abdul Majeed, Minister of Industry and
Minerals told a press conference last week.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the U.S. for blocking the approval of contracts
submitted to the U.N. Sanctions Committee for purchasing power
spare parts.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food deal singed by the U.N. and Iraq last year,
which allows Iraq to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil
over six months to buy food and other supplies, allocates 36
million dollars for the purchase of spare parts for electricity
generation.
</P>
<P>
Hassen said the amount allocated by the deal to purchase
power spare parts covered only 4 percent of the total needs of
Iraq's power grid. However, none of them has arrived in the
country, he added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under stringent sanctions imposed by the
U.N. Security Council since 1990 for its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that more than 90 percent of the country's
power stations, which were heavily bombed in the 1991 Gulf War,
have been rehabilitated.
</P>
<P>
Iraq needs a high electricity load to cope with domestic
demand fueled by a one-third rise in population. Its power
generation should be increased to 18,000 megawatts by the end of
the year 2000, said the paper.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
said today that the country should not be content with being
merely industrializing, but must become fully industrialized.
</P>
<P>
President Ramos raised this goal when delivering a keynote
speech at a national development conference aimed at working out a
strategy that can help the country pole-vault into the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
"We must not just alleviate poverty, we must eradicate it. We
must not be content with being merely industrializing, we must
become fully industrialized," he said.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this goal, the country should work out a
pole-vaulting program that identifies the economic and political
reform still undone in the country and some programs that must be
accomplished over a specific period, Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of various sectors of the country should also sustain
the forward drive of all reforms to successfully overcome the
poverty of Filipino families and expand the circle of economic
progress, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the country should work hard to catch up its
East Asian neighbors and ensure the economy's competitiveness in
the global market by making it an efficient creator of wealth, he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Urban families with a collection of
2,000 copies of books and suburban families with a collection of
more than 1,000 copies of books in the capital of China will have
a chance to be awarded for their love of books.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Municipal Federation of Women and Dazhong Reading
Society have jointly sponsored a selection of families and
individuals fond of collecting and reading books.
</P>
<P>
The selection began in April and will last through the
year. 100 families and ten individuals will become "zhuangyuan"
(No.1 contestant in the imperial examination in old China) at the
end of the selection.
</P>
<P>
The activity is aimed at promoting the collecting and reading
of good books among the citizens and further improving their
quality, according to Wu Xiuping, vice-chairman of the Municipal
Federation of Women.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent investigation, the percentage of urban
Chinese residents' spending on cultural consumption was ten
percent in 1993, 13.5 percent in 1994 and 18.5 percent in
1995. During the same period, the spending on food had been
steadily around 52 percent.
</P>
<P>
The purchase and storage of books has become a necessity for
residents in the capital city. A discounted-priced book fair held
here this month received more than 200,000 customers within the
first five days and reported a daily business volume of two
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
A weekend reading activity was held in the city last year,
drawing 300,000 families within nine months.
</P>
<P>
According to the Dazhong Reading Society, a number of ordinary
urban families have a collection of between 4,000 and 5,000 copies
of books. Even in remote mountainous Pinggu County, there are more
than 10,000 families with a collection of more than 100 books
each.

leaders," he said. "I believe my visit will be successful and help
further develop the bilateral relations between the two
countries."
</P>
<P>
Gligorov's visit to China is the first one by a Macedonian
president. China and Macedonia, though geographically wide apart,
enjoys a long tradition of friendship. Bilateral cooperation in
politics, the economy, culture, science and technology has
proceeded smoothly since diplomatic relations were established in
October 1993.
</P>
<P>
During Gligorov's visit, the two nations will sign agreements
on investment protection and avoiding double taxation.

<HEADLINE> South China Win Hong Kong's Soccer League Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 8 (Xinhua) -- South China won over defending
champions Instant-Dict 3-2 in the extra-time of the Hong Kong
soccer First Division League Grand Final here Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
It is the first League title for South China in five seasons.
</P>
<P>
Instant-Dict won this year's Hong Kong FA Cup just a week ago.
</P>
<P>
South China had an edge over Instant-Dict, with four wins, two
draws and one loss, in the seven previous meetings this season
between the two sides. But only once in the five decisive matches
between the two this season had more than one goal to separate the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
"We've played each other so often that each team knows the
other's style of play inside out," South China striker Dale
Tempest told a local newspaper. "So I don't think you're are going
 to see a high-score game come on Sunday," he predicted.
</P>
<P>
With skipper and veteran defender Ku Kam-fai out of the match
because of a thigh injury suffered last month, South China's
defense had suffered a lot, which was clearly shown in today's
match, especially in the first half.
</P>
<P>
Ross Greer of Instant-Dict opened the score at the 11th minute
when his sharply-angled slide shot beat South China's goalkeeper
Kooistra Werner out of balance.
</P>
<P>
South China leveled the score 13 minutes later when Tempest's
shot from inside the goal area found the net.
</P>
<P>
Instant-Dict made it 2-1 in the 42nd minute when a shot by Paul
Foster deflected on a defender's foot and flew into the goal.
</P>
<P>
And in the dying minute of the match, South China tied it
again, with a close-range header by forward Cheng Siu-chung.
</P>
<P>
It was Cheng again when he converted a corner-kick by his
teammate with another close-range header, at the 17th minute of
the extra time. It sealed up South China's victory as the match
was played on the "Golden Goal" concept, which means that any team
which scores the fist goal in the extra time, win the match.
</P>
<P>
Scorers:
</P>
<P>
Instant-Dict: Ross Greer (11th minute); Paul Foster (42nd);
</P>
<P>
South China: Dale Tempest (24th), Ricky Cheng Siu-chung (46th,
17th of extra time).

<HEADLINE> Iraq, U.N. Exchange Letters to Renew Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Iraq and the U.N. on Saturday
night exchanged the letters to renew the "oil-for-food" deal
signed by the two sides last May, the official Iraqi News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Nizar Hamdoun, Iraq's permanent envoy to the U.N. and Hans
Korel, U.N. Under Secretary-General for legal affairs exchanged
the letters in the United Nations. Whereby, a six-month extension
of the "oil-for-food" deal has been okeyed as of today.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council agreed Wednesday to let Iraq sell oil
for another six months to buy food and medicine. The 15-member
council voted unanimously to allow another 2.1 billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil sales.
</P>
<P>
The deal, signed by Iraq and the U.N. in May last year and came
into effect on December 10, expired on Saturday. It allows Iraq to
sell 2 billion dollars worth of oil over 180 days on a renewable
basis to buy food and other daily necessities urgently needed in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been hit seriously by the sanctions imposed by the
U.N. Security Council after its invasion of Kuwait in August,
1990.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council has refused to lift sanctions entirely
until it is fully convinced that Iraq has destroyed its weapons of
mass destruction and made a full disclosure to U.N. inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Over the coming weeks, the Iraqi government will forward a
distribution plan.

WASHINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton ordered a Justice Department review
of laws against hate crimes and said he will call a conference.
</P>
<P>
-- States have less that a month to meet the federal deadline
for enacting a plan to carry out welfare reform, yet California,
home to one-fifth of the nation's welfare recipients, is nowhere
near a consensus on crucial components of its plan.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Conflicts within the Republican Party will clearly be on
display in the coming weeks as the Congressional tax committees
begin drafting legislation to carry out the 135-billion dollars
tax reduction included in the bipartisan balanced budget
agreement. Social conservatives will want to cut taxes for
families, while economic conservatives seek a reduction in the
capital gains tax.
</P>
<P>
-- An ethics commission charged with recommending actions on
human cloning to President Clinton called for a legislative ban on
attempts to clone people. Such a ban would restrain private groups
that get no Federal financing for cloning research. The Government
has a moratorium in place now to ban human clones, but that
affects only researchers supported by Federal money. the
moratorium began on March 4.

PARIS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- France will send 500 more soldiers to
the Congo Republic from Monday, the Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The two companies of troops would be sent from French military
bases in the region, Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux
said, apparently referring to French garrisons in Gabon and the
Central African Republic.
</P>
<P>
A cellular team on the Congo crisis met today to discuss
reaction to the escalating violence in Brazzaville after one
French soldier was killed and five others wounded in a clash with
"uncontrollable armed elements" in Congo Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
The 450 French soldiers previously stationed in Brazzaville
have been escorting some 4,000 French expatriates in Congo to the
French Embassy and other French missions, but no immediate plan of
evacuation is worked out.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry announced earlier today that it is sending
armored vehicles to Congo Republic.
</P>
<P>
Fighting broke out Thursday morning between government troops
and private militiamen supporting former President Denis
Sassou-Nguesso, after his residence was reportedly attacked by the

<HEADLINE> China Continues to Be Ideal Place for Overseas Investment, Scholar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 8 (Xinhua) -- China is likely to be an ideal
place for overseas investment in the next century, with a prospect
of attracting 30 to 40 billion US dollars of foreign funds
annually, according to a local academician.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zhongli, President of the Shanghai Academy of Social
Sciences, recently said here that China is a big attraction to the
rest of the world, as its economy shows prospects of a high-speed
growth and the country's 1.2 billion-strong population creates a
huge market.
</P>
<P>
In general, foreign investment in China has turned from the
previous labor-intensive industries to technology-intensive
sectors, he said, adding that transnationals and giants have
become the major foreign investors in the country.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that more international firms will move their
regional headquarters to China, and Shanghai is the most ideal
place to locate them.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, now with over 16,000 foreign-funded projects, is the
largest economic center in China. The metropolis has nearly 1,000
research institutes and 900,000 professionals, according to
official figures.

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 8 (Xinhua) -- North China's cultural
relic-rich province, Hebei, has invested some 200 million yuan
since 1990 to renovate local historical buildings.
</P>
<P>
To date some 240 projects on historical buildings under state
or provincial protection have been completed, while other 20 are
being undertaken.
</P>
<P>
The projects including those on the imperial summer resort of
the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) in Chengde in the northern part of
Hebei and the eastern and western imperial tombs of the dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Local relics officials say that all the renovation plans have
been approved by leading experts and implemented by skillful
artisans.
</P>
<P>
"We have tried our best to use original materials and
traditional techniques to restore the buildings to their original
features," the officials say, adding that such renovation is time
consuming.
</P>
<P>
For instance, it took 100 artisans to work for five years to
renovate some 20 buildings in the Longfu temple in Qingxiling (the
Western Imperial Tomb of the Qing Dynasty).
</P>
<P>
Hebei has 12,000 historical sites, 58 of them are under state
protection.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Join Convention Against Chemical Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Parliament today approved
a bill that allows its government to join the convention against
development, production, stockpiling and using of chemical
weapons.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Tehran Radio reported it today without giving
any details about the bill.
</P>
<P>
The bill came a month after Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani rejected U.S. charges that Iran has been engaged in
the production of chemical weapons, terming it as "a sheer
allegation."
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said that Iran would never think of having or
employing chemical weapons since "We have had such a terrifying
experience" during the eight years of Iran-Iraq war (1980-88).
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Iran's permanent representative to the U.N.,
Kamal Kharazi, also rejected the U.S. allegation, saying
"Washington has once again resorted to baseless claims in an
irresponsible manner in connection with the peaceful activities
of the Iranian chemical industries."
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran is a signatory to the Treaty on
Non-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction and a victim of
these weapons during its war with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iran rejects all allegation on any plan to produce chemical
weapons in the country, Kharazi added.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Beer Makers Targeting Chinese Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 8 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's giant breweries are
targeting the Chinese beer market which is quickly emerging as the
world's largest, according to industry sources here.
</P>
<P>
Oriental Brewery (OB), one of the biggest breweries in South
Korea, has decided recently to establish a locally-incorporated
firm in China, and Chosun Brewery of the popular Hite brand is
expected to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
OB is currently looking to take over a brewery in China's
Shandong Province with an investment of 78.65 million
U.S. dollars, and to establish a plant with an annual production
capacity of 100,000 kiloliters.
</P>
<P>
"OB is seeking to develop one or two local brands for initial
marketing popular OB lager beer sometime next year," one industry
official said.
</P>
<P>
Chosun is seeking to gain entry into the Chinese market through
a Chinese liquor company in which Bohae Distillery Co. has
invested. Chosun recently took over Bohae to enter the white
spirit market.
</P>
<P>
Chosun will take over a brewery in China with a production
capacity of 100,000 kiloliters, and transfer to the brewery the
manufacturing systems in its Seoul plant.
</P>
<P>
The reason for such a rush to get into the Chinese beer market
is obvious, considering the demand in the world's most populous
country has shown a continuous increase in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Indian Scientists Propose to Monitor Genetic Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 8 (Xinhua) -- India's top scientists have
expressed their concern over possible abuse of genetic research
and have called for creation of an apex national bioethics
organization (NBO) to monitor research being carried out with
human genetic material.
</P>
<P>
They warned in a recently released document that the latest
advances in genetics research "raise ethical, social, cultural and
legal issues with significant long-term implications for
humanity."
</P>
<P>
"While genetic studies may provide powerful tools, they are
also prone to abuses which could threaten society," the scientists
said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the apex NBO, the document suggested setting up
genetic testing laboratories in each state for providing
diagnostic service and to carry out research on the genetic basis
of unusual diseases encountered in India.

<HEADLINE> India's Coffee Prices to Be Raised Again Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The prices of coffee at the
retail outlets in India are to be increased by 10 rupees (0.28 US
dollar) per kg from next Monday, making it the fifth rise since
February this year, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Coffee prices were last raised by 10 rupees per kg from 180
rupees (5.14 dollars) per kg on May 26.
</P>
<P>
The prices of the commodity have spurted since February due to
mixed reasons of rise in international prices, low stocks with
traders and a shortfall in domestic consumption.
</P>
<P>
A steep hike in coffee prices was witnessed during last week of
May following the Association of Coffee Producing Countries'
decision to continue their curb on exports.

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Render Continued Support for China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing internal reforms of the
World Bank will help strengthen its cooperation with China, the
international financial body's largest client, a senior bank
official said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to serve China better still. I think China will remain
as important as it is today," Pieter Bottelier, chief of the World
Bank's resident mission in China, told Xinhua in an interview
recently.
</P>
<P>
The major field offices of the World Bank, including the office
in China, will be reinforced after the structural reorganization
inside the Bank, he said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the major offices will have a greater
decision-making power and more responsibility, adding that "we
hope to become more efficient, quicker and more tuned-in to
China's needs."
</P>
<P>
Bottelier said that internal reforms of the international
financial body will give its China office greater flexibility in
dealing with the designing and implementation of World Bank-aided
projects and in solving problems.
</P>
<P>
"It's also our intention to broaden the range of financial
instruments available to support China's development," he said.
</P>
<P>
After he completes his term of office as chief of the China
mission and returns to the Bank's headquarters in Washington D.C.,
he will continue to promote cooperation with China, he added.
</P>
<P>
After its World Bank membership was resumed in May 1980, China
has since 1993 become the international financial body's single
largest client with an annual borrowings standing between 2.5 and
three billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics of the World Bank show that the
international financial body has, to date, lent a total of more
than 26.8 billion US dollars to 180 projects in China, which cover
almost all economic sectors.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Bottelier said that as the International Development
Association (IDA), the Bank's lending arm for cheap loans, has
limited financial resources, the Bank will arrange more
co-financing and cross-financing for China.

<P>
"The World Bank's relationship with China is very effective and
we think it is important that the World Bank continues to support
social development and poverty elimination in China," he said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Chinese economy, Bottelier said: "The macro
economic situation at this point is very very strong, as inflation
has gone down to well below six percent and the economy has been
growing at a high but sustainable level."
</P>
<P>
He said that the economic macro-control measures of the Chinese
government in the past three and more years have been effective
and the moderately-tight fiscal and monetary policies have
produced the desired results, enabling the national economy to
head for a successful soft landing last year.
</P>
<P>
Bottelier recalled that the Chinese economy was overheated when
he came to Beijing as chief of the World Bank's mission in China
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
This year, China's economic situation will improve further and
the major economic indicators will, very likely, be better than
expected, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
China has constantly seen its economy grow nearly ten percent
annually in recent years. Meanwhile, it has effectively brought
inflation under control, cutting the annual increase rate of the
retail price index to 6.1 percent last year, down from 21.7
percent in 1994 and 14.8 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
China has set this year's economic growth rate at around eight
percent and the inflation control target at six percent. In the
first quarter of this year, the Chinese economy was up 9.4 percent
while the retail price index rose 2.6 percent on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
Despite all the past achievements, China should further improve
its fiscal situation, accelerate the pace to reform state-owned
enterprises and the process of commercializing the state-owned
banks, and create more job opportunities, in order to guarantee a
healthy and long-term economic development, Bottelier said.

<HEADLINE> Israelis, Palestinians to Resume Dialogue Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 8 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli-Palestinian dialogue,
aimed at renewing full-scale peace talks, is scheduled to take
place in the Egyptian capital of Cairo this afternoon under the
Egyptian auspices.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that the arrangement was confirmed in a
late-night telephone conversation Saturday between Israeli
cabinet secretary Danny Naveh and Egyptian presidential adviser
Osama Al-Baz.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli team will consist of Naveh, Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu's senior aide Yitzhak Molcho, and his new
political adviser Uzi Arad, as well as Foreign Ministry adviser
Ya'acov Bardugo.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian initiative was almost scuttled when Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa announced the meeting prematurely, prompting
both sides to issue clarifications before the arrangement was
finally set.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) said Saturday that it
was encouraged by Egyptian mediation efforts to get political
talks with Israel started again and hoped there would be
practical progress in today's Cairo talks.
</P>
<P>
Unofficial Palestinian sources said that by sending
representatives to Cairo, Israel was not ruling out a slowdown in
settlement building, as this possibility was what made the meeting
in Cairo possible.
</P>
<P>
However, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, adviser to PNA President Yasser
Arafat, said that, "The only progress is that there will be a
meeting and that we have better contacts with Israel."
</P>
<P>
"But there is not any agreement concerning anything," he
said. "Nothing has been agreed upon, and we hope we might
achieve something," added the PNA adviser.
</P>
<P>
Abu Rudeineh also remarked on the close coordination of the
United States and Egyptian positions as something positive in
light of Arafat's previous charges that the U.S. sided with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
A flurry of consultations between Israeli and Arab leaders and
among Arabs themselves has boosted the view that a way out of the
current deadlock is pending, and that this has to involve a
cessation or slowdown of Israeli settlement building in disputed
areas, including the Har Homa (or Jabal Abu Ghoneim) project in
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a slowdown would most likely be accompanied by
acceleration of final-status talks between the Israelis and
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sources said that Arafat conferred with Netanyahu's
senior aide and Israeli General Security Service chief Ami Ayalon
Friday; he then went to Cairo Saturday to meet with President
Hosni Mubarak, and today he is expected in Jordan for talks with
the Jordanian monarch King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said that Egypt has proposed a five-point
plan, which includes a freeze on any change in the status of
Jerusalem and a ban on Jewish settlement building in the West
Bank for "a sufficient period."
</P>
<P>
In return, the Palestinians would make a firm commitment to
meeting Israel's security demands, they added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday Israeli media reported that Israel agreed on
a temporary halt in the construction of Jewish settlements in
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel Television Channel 1 reported that Israel and the PNA
were trying to reach agreement on the duration of a construction
freeze on Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as
well as in Jerusalem's Har Homa.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Israel would begin the work on a
housing project of 3,000 units for Palestinian Jerusalemites
"near Har Homa" immediately and would suspend work at the area
earmarked for Jewish residents as soon as the infrastructure
there is completed.
</P>
<P>
However, the report was denied by Netanyahu's spokesman, Shai
Bazak, who said the building at Har Homa would not stop.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Taxi Firm Ambitious to Match Hertz Company of US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai Dazhong Taxi Co. Ltd. is
resolved to build itself into a firm that can stand up to Hertz
Company of the United States in the aspects of taxi and car rental
service.
</P>
<P>
Yang Guoping, chairman of the Board of Dazhong Taxi Co. Ltd.,
said his company would strive to expand business in the coming
years and build a fleet of 10,000 taxi cars by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"Only through operating business on a fairly large scale and
expanding market share remarkably can we achieve greater economic
benefits amid fierce market competitions," said Yang.
</P>
<P>
China has seen fast expansion of taxi service as it has a quick
development in cities over the past years. In Shanghai, which has
a population of 13 million, there are some 560 taxi companies
operating more than 38,000 taxi cars.
</P>
<P>
Dazhong Taxi, which now boasts 110 million yuan of assets and
operates 2,400 taxi cars, has built up its fame as a trustworthy
company for its higher standards of service. Per-taxi net profit
of the company was 30,000 yuan last year, triple the city's
average level.
</P>
<P>
Closer trans-regional cooperation will be an unavoidable trend
with the establishment of a link-up network of expressways in
China by the year 2005, and the numerous taxi companies in
Shanghai will eventually be merged into ten major group companies,
Yang predicted.
</P>
<P>
Dazhong Taxi purchased and took over 300 taxi cars of several
small taxi companies in 1996, and will double the figure this
year, Yang added.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang, his company has also established Dazhong Taxi
chain companies in ten other Chinese cities, with 3,500 taxi cars
in operation.
</P>
<P>
Dazhong Taxi plans to bring the number of its chain taxi
companies outside Shanghai to 24 which operate a total of 6,000
taxi cars by the turn of this century.
</P>
<P>
"Under market economic system, an enterprise should not be
confined to any regional limits and but extend its cope of
business wherever markets exist," Yang said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scientists Use Computers to Help Disabled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli scientists have used
computers and electronics to help disabled persons in their daily
life, The Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem College of Technology (JCT) has developed a
series of impressive devices to aid the disabled -- a computerized
devices that synthesizes Hebrew text into recognizable speech, an
infra-red navigation system that helps the blind find their way,
and a Hebrew-speaking, easily programmable clock that wakes blind
children by speaking their own names.
</P>
<P>
The infra-red navigation system to use infra-red ceiling
transmitters to help the blind navigate their way inside
buildings. Building locations are coded into digital values, and
the codes are transmitted from the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
The user wears a portable receiving unit, which senses the
closest beam and echoes the signal into a building location. He
then hears spoken announcements about where he is and is warned
to watch out for stairs or other potential dangers.
</P>
<P>
"We use technology to help disabled people to function better,
not only to make them more independent but to increase their
self-confidence and allow them to contribute to society," said
Emil Dere, founder and managing director of JCT's four-year-old,
non-profit Center of Technology for the Handicapped.
</P>
<P>
Foreseeing the advantage of applying technology to improve the
lives of the disabled, Dere, an electronics innovator, set up
the center at JCT.
</P>
<P>
Having designed customized devices to help many of the 70
pupils at Keren Or, a Jerusalem school for multi-handicapped
brain-damaged, mute and blind children, the center is now ready
to make its clinical resources available anywhere in Israel and
in the world.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Face Serious Drug Trafficking Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A drug war has erupted
between gansters in Johannesburg and Nigerian drug dealers in the
city, in which 28 Nigerians have been kidnapped, South African
Justice Minister Dullah Omar said at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerians had organized themselves into heavily armed
teams to protect their key drug dealers and it was feared that
there could be gang battles in the streets, local daily City
Press quoted Omar as reporting.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the South Africa Institute of International Affairs
workshop on the drug trade in Southern Africa, Omar said South
Africa's integration into the world community had created far to
much space for well-organized crime and drug syndicates.
</P>
<P>
The latest sophisticated electronic tools and modern
information technology had also made the drug traffickers evade
police and customs possible, he said.
</P>
<P>
South africa, accessible by land, sea and air, has been used
as a conduit for smuggling hashish, heroin and opium to the
international market, Omar said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to South Africa, Namibia, Kenya, Swaziland,
Angola, Tanzania and Ugnada are now also on the major cocaine
trafficking routes.
</P>
<P>
"International cooperation is of vital importance to combat
drug trafficking and money laundering effectively, Omar stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to Omar, addicts in South Africa now consume an
estimated 70 percent of the world's Mandrax.
</P>
<P>
During the first six months of 1996, police had sized about
300,000 Mandrax tablets and about 77 kg of cocaine and 1,325 LSD
tablets, but this was only about 10 to 15 percent of all drugs
smuggled into South Africa, he said.
</P>
<P>
The South African Narcotics Bureau estimated that during 1996,
136 world drug syndicates, out of a total of about 480, operated
in South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Explain Defense Review to Neighbors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Japan will soon detail to its
neighbors its just-worked-out interim report of the ongoing
reviews of the 1978 guidelines for defense cooperation with the
United States, Kyodo News Service reported today.
</P>
<P>
"We should get neighboring countries to rid themselves of their
sense of uncertainty over what Japan would do in a crisis. We will
fully explain to the neighboring countries, particularly to China
and South Korea," Kyodo quoted a senior Foreign Ministry official
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Japan would send the Defense Agency's Defense Policy Bureau
chief Masahiro Akiyama to China in mid-June, and another official
to South Korea, to explain the review of the guidelines.
</P>
<P>
The country would try to assure China that the guidelines
review did not target any particular country, Kyodo said, quoting
Foreign Ministry sources.
</P>
<P>
Japan and the U.S released a seven-page interim report on their
review of defense guidelines in Hawaii on Saturday, vowing to
strengthen cooperation on defense in peacetime, during armed
attacks on Japan and in emergencies in areas surrounding
Japan. The review will be finalized in September.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, in emergencies, Japan would provide
additional land and facilities to U.S. forces and allow
U.S. military to use the country's Self-Defense Forces' (SDF)
bases, civilian airports and seaports.
</P>
<P>
The SDF would also provide logistic support to U.S. military
forces on Japanese territory as well as "on the high seas and in
international airspace surrounding Japan," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The strengthened defense cooperation between Japan and the
U.S. has caused concerns among Japan's neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> Iran Refutes Turkey's Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Iran has refuted Turkey's claims on
alleged assistance to its anti-government guerrillas of Turkey's
Kurdish Workers Party (PKK), an official report said here today.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA said that the Foreign
Ministry issued a statement in response to the Turkish allegations
made by Erol Ozkasnak, secretary general of the Turkish armed
forces general staff.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish general had charged Friday that Turkey's neighbors
including Iran have a hand in providing missiles and logistic
training to the PKK guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Mohammadi, spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry
said "the allegations of this Turkish military official is in
contradiction with the announced policies of Turkey on the
good bilateral relations and their expansion."
</P>
<P>
He stated that Iran has concentrated efforts in the direction
of promoting security cooperation between the two countries and
that the results of such cooperation have been thoroughly
constructive.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that such "irresponsible and selfish statements
by certain Turkish military officials over the past few months"
are the prime indications of attempts by those opposed to
Iran-Turkey friendship in order to "create an atmosphere of
suspicion between the two nations" and "pursue their own
objectives in the region,"
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also expressed regret over reports containing
similar charges carried by some Turkish newspapers, and said "the
clamor in the Turkish press is neither in the interest of good
neighborly relations nor in the direction of promotion of
cooperation among all in the region."

<HEADLINE> Salim to Reform OAU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Organisation of African
Unity (OAU) Secretary General, Salim Ahmed Salim, on Saturday
said that his immediate task will be to restructure the African
body in line with current responsibilities and challenges.
</P>
<P>
Salim was talking to the press at the International Press
Center in the city, on his way to Ethiopia from the just ended
Harare summit which elected him the OAU Secretary General for the
third time.
</P>
<P>
"We have to look at how best we can have maximum performance
but within our limited resource," he said.
</P>
<P>
Salim said, "We must have the right people at the right place
and choose priorities among prioirities for more effectiveness."
</P>
<P>
He said apart from administrative changes, reforms should also
be made on the continental body's charter for more effective
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief said, his role at his third governance is to
ensure that the OAU constitution is restructured to suit new
challenges and responsibilites in the continent.
</P>
<P>
"Given the budget constraints that the organisation suffers,
it is not easy to change the constitution," he said. However, he
said, "we want the organisation to become dynamic."
</P>
<P>
Salim said his organisation is determined to ensure that
people are involved in the democratisation process in the
continent.
</P>
<P>
The democratisation process in the member countries cannot be
realized unless they involve people in determining what they best
want, he said.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief said it is high time that OAU became modern in
its conduct. "The environment has very much changed in Africa, we
want to ensure democratic societies in the continent," he said.
</P>
<P>
OAU is also determned to consolidate a mutual relationship
with civil societies all over the continent, Salim said.
</P>
<P>
He said Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) play a big role
in ensuring that governments are responsible to their citizens,
adding that the aim of the OAU is to work with NGOs in order to
ensure that the African continent is in a safe float.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief further said during the coming four years, the
OAU will be committed at consolidating African unity by ensuring
that proper strategies are designed to prevent conflicts rather
than waiting until they erupt.
</P>
<P>
The organisation will also engage itself in the global
economy, he said, adding that integration is very important if
Africa is to effectively compete in the global economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambian health deputy minister
Nkandu Luo has called for discouraging the public from smoking.
</P>
<P>
Luo said here on Sunday that the best that could be done is to
do anything possible to discourage the public from smoking
because tobacco growing is a lucrative business and could not be
stopped.
</P>
<P>
Sunday mail today quoted her as saying that smokers not only
endanger their lives but that of the people around them as well.
</P>
<P>
She also said tobacco killed over three million people per
year worldwide and Zambia is no exception to this morbidity.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, Joseph Pobee, World Health Organization (WHO)
representative, complained that in developing countries
cigarettes and other tobacco products are marketed without the
warning that cigarettes are bad for one's health.
</P>
<P>
He also said that in many countries, the prices of cigarettes
have been increased to deter would-be smokers from adopting the
habit and try and get smokers to stop the practice.

<HEADLINE> Work on Zanzibar Sewers Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Work on the improvement of
the sewerage system at the Zanzibar Central Market, also to cover
the Darajani commercial area, in the town of Zanzibar, has
started, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The project is being financed by a 3.295 million US Dollars
grant by a German Bank - KFW.
</P>
<P>
A sewerage and drainage department official told reporters in
the town on Saturday that the waste water will be spilled a
distance of 372 meters from the shore, a measure taken to avoid
spoiling the environment.
</P>
<P>
The new pipeline will be two meters wide compared to the
present dilapidated one which measures half-a-meter and was
installeld almost half a century back.
</P>
<P>
The project has come following the failure by municipal
authorities to effect waste water treatment as planned due to
non-availability of an oxidation pond attributed to "technical
reaons".
</P>
<P>
Th many years, the area has been one of the dirtiest spots in
Zanzibar town as the sewerage system could not cope with the
increase in population and growth of business.
</P>
<P>
The project is also seen by residents in the town as positive
move towards keeping the environment clean especially during this
period when the Isles have been hit hard by the outbreak of
cholera.
</P>
<P>
The program runs parallet with the rehabilitation of Zanzibar
narrow streets which is now in its final stages for completion
funded by another German company.

<HEADLINE> Israel Revokes PNA Security Chief's VIP Card </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Israel has decided to cancel the
VIP card of a senior Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
official whom it holds responsible for the murder of three
Palestinians alleged to have sold land to Israelis, Israel Radio
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The special VIP card enables the holder to enter Israel from
the West Bank and Gaza Strip freely and to cross into Jordan and
back with no restrictions.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted PNA officials as saying that the VIP card
for Tawfik Tirawi, head of the Palestinian General Security
Service in the West Bank, would expire today.
</P>
<P>
Israeli General Security Service head Ami Ayalon told PNA
President Yasser Arafat about the cancellation of Tirawi's pass
at a meeting in Ramallah in the West Bank Friday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials would not comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
Tirawi called the move "an attack on Palestinian
sovereignty," and denied any connection to the killings.
</P>
<P>
"I was not involved in any way in the killings of the land
dealers. This is absolutely untrue," Tirawi said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Israel issued a warrant for the arrest of one of
Tirawi's subordinates, Hussein Saadeh, who is the head of
Palestinian intelligence in Ramallah, Jerusalem police spokesman
Shmuel Ben-Ruby said.
</P>
<P>
In all, three Palestinians suspected of selling land to Jews
have been killed in the past month and the kidnaping of a
fourth was foiled at the last minute by Israeli police.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police say they were holding at least four PNA
security officials involved in the killing of three Arabs
suspected of selling land to Jews.
</P>
<P>
However, Amin Hindi, head of Palestinian intelligence in the
Gaza Strip, denied PNA involvement in the deaths of the land
dealers, saying "Israel has no proof of any sort that the PNA
intelligence is involved in the killings."

<HEADLINE> US, EU Allow Egypt To Break Mideast Peace Impasse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A European Union (EU) peace
envoy said that the United States and the EU will give Egypt two
weeks for reviving the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks stalled
for three months since mid-March, reported local English daily,
The Jerusalem Post, today.
</P>
<P>
EU special Mideast envoy Miguel Moratinos said that after the
Egypt's move, the U.S. and the EU will formulate a new strategy.
But no details were given.
</P>
<P>
The envoy made the remarks in an interview with the
pro-government newspaper following his visit to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos traveled to Washington last week for consultations
with officials of the Clinton Administration on how to bring the
deadlocked peace process back on track. He met with U.S. Middle
East peace coordinator Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was "very, very satisfied" with the joint
American-EU efforts to promote the peace march, and the EU's
"special relationship with Washington "has been reinforced."
</P>
<P>
"Coordination is going well between the Europeans, the
Americans, and the Egyptians," said Moratinos, who returned to
Israel Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"If there is no breakthrough as a result of the Egyptian
initiative, the American administration will be fully involved
and will try to do something, along with the EU... If there is
something, (the EU leadership) will applaud. If not, we'll
react."
</P>
<P>
He said that the meeting between Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat and Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak Saturday could indicate how the Egyptian effort is
progressing.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, in his lightning visit to Cairo Saturday, the second

efforts to break the impasse in the peace process.
</P>

According to diplomatic sources, Egypt and the PNA were
working on a five-point plan including a freeze on any change in
the status of Jerusalem and a ban on a Jewish settlement in the
West Bank for a "sufficient period of time."
</P>
<P>
Moratinos emphasized that Palestinian security cooperation and
Israeli concessions on building at Har Homa and in settlements
form the crux of a peace package.

<HEADLINE> Three African States Propose Secret Ballot Over Ivory Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The three Southern African states
proposing the downlisting of the African elephant from appendix
one to appendix two will ask for a secret ballot during the
forthcoming convention on international trade in endangered
species meeting in a bid to protect delegates from intimidation
by countries opposing the lifting of the ivory trade ban, the
Sunday Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
This comes in the wake of a looming confrontation between the
United States and some heavily western-backed animal rights
groups against Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe over downlisting
proposals as the wildlife issue assumes both political and
economic significance.
</P>
<P>
At a just ended pre-conference meeting held in Darwendale of
Zimbabwe, many of the African countries pledged their support to
Zimbabwe and the two other regional states over their joint
proposal which they described as "well researched, well prepared
and well presented".
</P>
<P>
But sources who attended the meeting said it would be
difficult to "openly" vote against the powerful western and
U.S.-backed forces for fear of losing aid and other bilateral
assistance hence moves to have a secret ballot.
</P>
<P>
Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe are currently lobbying for
support for the downlisting of the African elephant from appendix
i to appendix ii, which allows limited trade in the mammal
products.
</P>
<P>
They request for the lift of the trade ban, put in place in
1989, to enable them to dispose ivory stockpiles worth several
millions of dollars.

<HEADLINE> China's Fujian Reports Expectedly Good Economic Indicators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The overall economic situation is
good in east China's Fujian Province, according to a leading
provincial official.
</P>
<P>
"The major economic indicators have turned out to be just as
good as expected," Chen Mingyi, secretary of the provincial
committee of the Communist Party of China, said at a regular
meeting of the provincial people's congress.
</P>
<P>
He said that the acreage of early rice this year is expected to
reach 536,000 ha, 638.6 ha more than last year.
</P>
<P>
Fujian's provincial gross domestic product rose 14.5 percent in
the first quarter, while its industrial output value was up 17.7
percent on a yearly basis to 60 billion yuan, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
An analysis shows that state-owned enterprises and enterprises
with the State holding the controlling stakes generated 18.17
billion yuan in output value in the first three months, up 5.5
percent over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that the industrial production-to-sales ratio was
approximately 94.8 percent between January and March, down 1.49
percentage points from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Fujian's exports surged 31.2 percent to more than 3.155 billion
US dollars in the first quarter, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the fiscal and financial sector performed
well in the first three months, with quarterly fiscal income up
26.4 percent year-on-year to 7.59 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Construction of key projects went smoothly in the first quarter,
during which total investments in fixed assets were up 10.2
percent, according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, price rises in Fujian continued to slow
down between January and March, up merely 1.1 percent on an annual
basis. Average incomes of urban residents were 10.9 percent more
than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Despite the generally satisfactory economic indicators, Chen
said that problems and difficulties still exist in the economic
work of Fujian, citing amounting difficulties in the effort to
reduce the losses and increase profits of the state-owned
enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Calls on Unity, Peace in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe
appealed his people to remain united to ensure peace and
development in the country.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when celebrating vice-president Joshua
Nkomo's 80th birthday in Bulawayo, the country's second largest
city, yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe praised Nkomo for the contribution he made towards the
liberation struggle and his role in forging unity between Zanu
(PF) and pr-Zapu in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the crowd, Mugabe described Nkomo as nation
builder, symbol of unity and pioneer of the liberation struggle
in this country. He urged the youth to safeguard peace and unity
in order to promote development.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, "the biggest lesson we get from Nkomo's life is
that we should remain united as one nation."
</P>
<P>
The president said after all the years of struggling to
liberate the country, Nkomo was still worried that the land
question had not yet been resolved. He promised that his
government would do everything within its power to acquire enough
land to cater for the landless.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to assure you that my government will address
the land question once and for all this year. We have a
committee, being led by Joseph Msika, which is identifying farms
to be acquired to resettle the landless," said Mugabe.

NEW DELHI, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Stocks of multinational companies
and a few blue chip domestic shares remained bullish on the Bombay
Stock Exchange (BSE) market last week mainly on fresh buying by
foreign institutional investors coupled with local speculative
support.
</P>
<P>
The trading for the week started on a better note and scrips
led by Hind Lever, ITC, ACC, Reliance and others firmed up sharply
on buying support.
</P>
<P>
However, several other shares continued to remain subdued in
absence of buying support mainly due to discouraging corporate
results.
</P>
<P>
The weekend rate showed widespread modest to handsome gain. The
volume of business remained brisk.
</P>
<P>
The BSE sensitive index recovered smartly from the previous
week level of 3755.10 and crossed the 3900 mark and touched at

due to widespread profit taking to finish at 3836.44 with the

<HEADLINE> India's Steel Consumption Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The annual consumption growth of
steel in India was around 4.4 percent during 1989-95, lower than
the gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 5.5 percent during the
same period, according to the latest study by the Confederation of
Indian Industry (CII).
</P>
<P>
The elasticity of steel consumption with respect to GDP is
approximately 0.8 percent. The decline in consumption of steel in
relation to GDP growth was constraining growth of steel industry.
There is a need to increase the elasticity factor of steel with
respect to GDP to around 1.5 to 2.0 for the revival of growth, the
study said.
</P>
<P>
The suggested strategy on steel consumption, according to the
study, included development of sectors that are intensive in
consumption of steel such as infrastructure, construction
industry, capital goods and consumer durables. There has been a
serious shortfall in investment in major infrastructure sector
(power, ports, roads and railways) during the eighth five year
plan period (1992-1997).

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Canada's Sun Life Assurance Co. is
more interested in Chinese children than insurance professionals,
today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Sun life recently donated one million US dollars to enhance
education and health care for children in China's developing areas,
company chairman John McNeil said.
</P>
<P>
Part of the money will be used to build a primary school in
Chongqing, southwest China. The school is expected to accommodate
1,200 students. Part will go to the Canada China Child Health
Foundation to set up children's medical clinics in Chongqing and
northwestern Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The primary school and medical clinics are expected to open by
1999.
</P>
<P>
McNeil said that the donations indicated Sun Life's commitment
to the future of Chinese youth and the nation.
</P>
<P>
Overseas insurance companies normally make charitable donations
to obtain operating licenses in China. Many of them choose to
donate money to train Chinese insurance professionals.
</P>
<P>
Currently, only two overseas life insurance companies --
American International Group and Canada's Manulife -- are allowed
to sell life insurance policies in China. Both use conventional
retail sales methods.
</P>
<P>
McNeil said that Sun Life is attracted by China's potential
growth in private and group life insurance.
</P>
<P>
Headquartered in Toronto, Sun Life operates in about 80
countries and regions worldwide.

<P>
LIMA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The "El Nino" phenomenon has arrived
in the Peruvian coasts, a report from the National Meteorology
and Hydrology Service said today.
</P>
<P>
The temperature of the sea water in some zones is four degrees
centigrade higher than in the surrounding masses of the ocean
waters, while the atmospheric pressures are too high, said Jose
Ames Ruiz, director of the service.
</P>
<P>
Ruiz said that the direction of the winds has reversed and
changed their course toward the continent. The El Nino phenomenon
will bring strong rains to the north and drought in the southern
areas in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the El Nino in the 1982-1984 caused 600 million U.S.
dollars in losses because of the flood in the north of Peru, and a
lost of some 250 million dollars in southern Peru because of the
drought.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Gradually Cut Interest Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government has
decided to go for gradual reduction in interest rate to make the
local industry competitive.
</P>
<P>
"The interest rate will be gradually brought down from an
average rate of 17.5 percent to 12 percent in the next financial
year," Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz told the press Saturday at a
pre-budget briefing.
</P>
<P>
Aziz, who will present the first budget of the government led
by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on June 13, said the crux of the
economic revival package is to control increase in prices and
provide employment opportunities to youth.
</P>
<P>
"The budget is being framed to provide maximum job opportunity
and arrest the upward spiral of basic commodities' prices," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that within one or two years, the economy would be
put on the right track.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister said the government is poised to announce
decisions to help generate revenue and cut down expenditure,
including downsizing of the government.
</P>
<P>
Aziz, confident of reviving the economy, said less taxes,
freezing electricity tariff at present level and a stable exchange
rate would be the key parameters of the next budget.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Over 60 people were killed and
200 others injured when a huge fire broke out at the Thanjavur
temple in Tamil Nadu of southern India Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here today said that the consecration of the
1,000-year-old Brahadeeswarar temple, popularly known as the big
temple, at Thanjavur town was scheduled to be held Sunday after a
gap of nearly 17 years.
</P>
<P>
The fire was caused when some airborne crackers fell into the
temple and ignited the oil vessels and the pandal, which was
already dry due to extreme hot temperature.
</P>
<P>
Officials said most of the victims died due to stampede caused
by panic. Many fell down and could not get up as they were
trampled by those who were rushing out. The burning pandal also
collapsed, torching many people to death.
</P>
<P>
The toll might go up as many of the injured were rushed to
private hospitals in serious condition, they said.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people had gathered in the temple complex to
witness the last pre-consecration ritual when the pandal caught
fire and instantly spread.

<HEADLINE> Rail Line to HK To Help Boost Shenzhen Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen will be able to co-operate
closely with areas along the Beijing Kowloon Railway line because
the first train from Beijing to Kowloon entered Hong Kong via the
north-south trunk line in mid-May, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Experts from local organizations, including the Shenzhen
Comprehensive Development Institute, believe that more
co-operation is expected in communications and transportation,
business transfer, market and resource development and the use of
overseas funds between Shenzhen and the interior areas.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that Shenzhen, which is near Hong Kong and a
pioneer in China's opening-up drive, will become a successful
service center for overseas businesses investing in interior
areas, especially those along the Beijing Kowloon line.
</P>
<P>
The city, with 12 national exit and entry checkpoints by sea,
land and air, has standard and efficient services in finance,
information, personnel training, transportation and storage.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-Kowloon line crosses seven provinces and two
municipalities from north to south, affecting 117 million people.
The areas along the line have abundant natural resources and great
potential for economic development.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen, as a major stop on the southern end of the
north-south line, had used 11.87 billion US dollars of overseas
funds by the end of 1996, including investment from more than 130
international consortia and transnationals.
</P>
<P>
The city has spent 2.49 billion yuan (300 million US dollars)
on 866 projects along the route. Those areas invested 4.99 billion
yuan (601 million US dollars) in Shenzhen, with Beijing and
Tianjin far ahead in investment scale.
</P>
<P>
Economic and technical co-operation between Shenzhen and
interior areas previously had been confined to trade, commerce and
real estate.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Interior areas supported Shenzhen's economic
expansion by securing funds and providing advanced technology and
skilled labor.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shenzhen made advanced economic and technological
progress in the interior by launching solely funded businesses,
setting up joint ventures and leasing, trading and taking over
property.

TIRANA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Prime Minister Bashikim
Fino today asked the Multinational Protection Force (MPF) to
extend its mandate in his country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a cabinet session, Fino asked the Italian-led MPF
to stay three months after its current mandate runs out on
June 28 in an effort to create a secure environment for the
general election to be held on June 29 and the work of the
international observers.
</P>
<P>
Fino instructed the Foreign Ministry to negotiate the extension
of the mandate with related international organizations.
</P>

On March 28, the United Nations Security Council authorized the
MPF a three-month mandate to protect relief operations and help
restore order in Albania, where massive protests prompted by
collapsed savings schemes turned into armed unrest early this
year.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Imports From India Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's volume of imports from
India has risen tremendously last year, according to local news
paper reports.
</P>
<P>
The value of Sri Lanka's total imports from India in 1996 was
over 550 million US dollars while Sri Lanka's exports to India
stood at only 50 million US dollars, leaving the trade imbalance
largely in favor of India.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have agreed recently to examine the trade imbalance
with India looking into the possibility of removing non-tariff
barriers while Sri Lanka should expand its product base, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
India said that India had opened its huge market for Sri Lankan
products. In the process, India had reduced tariffs on 81 items in
favor of Sri Lanka. Now they are studying the possibility of
adding more items to this list.
</P>
<P>
On the subject of investment opportunities available in the two
countries, both sides agreed that a greater alliance network
should be created through joint marketing and buy-back
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
India has also agreed to help Sri Lanka upgrade its
infrastructure facilities and to promote tourism between the two
countries, the reports added.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Provide Better Services for Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's immigration and tourist
police are gearing up to provide better services and safety for
tourists in line with the government's scheme to revitalize
tourism.
</P>
<P>
The improvement of service, which will be put into force within
six months, will start from the Bangkok international airport --
the country's main gateway.
</P>
<P>
Foreign and local visitors will see a much better immigration
service at the beginning of August, Pol Maj-Gen Ekachai Warunprapa
of the Immigration Bureau was quoted today by local press as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The first improvement in the pipeline is the bureau's plan to
introduce a "fast track" immigration service for first and
business class visitors.
</P>
<P>
Airlines will be asked to send a list of air travelers in
advance so that immigration officers at the airport can process
the paperwork before they actually turn up at the airport.
</P>
<P>
Along with the fast track service, the present visa and
passport examination at immigration booths at the airport will
also be revamped.
</P>
<P>
In addition, "group check" will be introduced to allow visitors
traveling in groups to pass through the immigration checkpoint
more quickly and conveniently.
</P>
<P>
Pol Col Wuth Liptapallop, deputy commander of the tourist
police, said measures are also being prepared by his agency to
provide better care for the country's visitors.

<HEADLINE> Sichuan Strives To Accomplish Self-Sufficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The core of our prosperity relies primarily on a more open
mind-set," said Xie Shijie, secretary of the Sichuan Provincial
Committee of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing became a separate municipality in the spring. Like
Beijing, its municipal government is now accountable to the
central government, instead of provincial rules.
</P>
<P>
Xie went on to say that six million people from rural areas
moved to eastern coastal cities for jobs and brought back about 30
billion yuan (about 3.6 billion US dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
As many as 340,000 small business owners returned home with
money, technology and managerial expertise, launching thousands
of township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"We must also seize the opportunity of coastal capital flowing
westward,otherwise we will lag behind, " Xie noted.
</P>
<P>
About 4,400 solely-foreign-owned and joint ventures have
settled in Sichuan, he added, bringing about two billion US
dollars of investment. Seven foreign banks have offices in
provincial capital Chengdu.
</P>
<P>
The vast potential market, cheap labor, natural resources and
strong industry are boons to the emerging economy.
</P>
<P>
But the separation of Chongqing from Sichuan is expected to
disperse capital flow. Besides, the municipality has a large
Yangtze River port, 270 billion Cubic meters of natural gas and
excellent infrastructure facilities spawned by the ongoing Three
Gorges Dam project.
</P>
<P>
To avoid problems, Sichuan sought its own outlet by building a
10,000-ton container port in Luzhou. A railway links Neijiang in
Sichuan, and Kunming in Yunnan Province will provide an indirect
sea outlet for Sichuan commodities.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, some cities, like Mianyang, Deyang and Leshan,
hold promise as provincial high technology center, a specialty
chemical base and tourist haven within the Chengdu economic
circle.
</P>
<P>
A plan to form a new industrialized civilization has been
outlined, in which the province will pin its hopes on six pillar
industries: information technology, machinery and metallurgy,
building materials, food processing, chemicals and
pharmaceuticals, and tourism.
</P>
<P>
The province has also prepared 91.8 billion yuan (11 billion US
Dollars) this year to expand 37 profitable enterprises and
large-scale infrastructure and energy projects, a record in
fixed-asset investment, Xie said.
</P>
<P>
To improve the investment environment, the landlocked province
is building expressways, highways, railroads and airports. By the
year 2000, up to 1,000 km of expressways will be completed, and
four railways will switch to electric power from coal.

<HEADLINE> Thai Police to Use Internet to Fight Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Thai police authorities are
launching a program to use the Internet to fight crimes in a bid
to improve their crime suppression efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Under the program which will be in full operation in 1999,
people could report complaints and crimes by e-mail, while the
latest crime suppression details, such as suspects' identities,
missing vehicles and warrants for wanted criminals, are also
provided on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the program is expected to come on-line
later this year, which would provide general information,
including telephone numbers, about the (Bangkok) Metropolitan
Police Bureau (MPB) as well as basic guidelines on how to avoid
becoming a victim.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that information supplied to the police
via e-main will remain confidential and only police offers know
the password.
</P>
<P>
The police authorities believed that the Internet-based system
would be effective in fighting crimes, as the use of the Internet
is becoming popular around Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The system will also be linked with the International Criminal
Police Organization (Interpol) to facilitate cooperation on
international anti-crime cooperation.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Film Maker to Remain Strong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- China's largest film maker, China
Lucky Film Corp., said it is able to remain strong in the domestic
market following the entrace to China of the US-based Kodak and
Japan's Fuji, According to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident of rooting a strong position in the Chinese
market," said Li Yaochang, manager of Lucky's import and export
department.
</P>
<P>
He reminded his employees about the Three Kingdoms era (AD
220-280) when three independent powers ruled China for a half
century.
</P>
<P>
"Lucky's sales of film and photographic paper in the domestic
and international markets keep rising," Li said, noting that his
company occupied 20 percent of the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Company figures show that film sales grew 20 percent and
photographic paper sales rose 70 percent in 1996, with foreign
exchange earnings reaching 9.1 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of this year, film sales soared 52
percent, photographic paper sales climed 7.9 percent and foreign
exchange earnings rose 26 percent, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Li said that Lucky aims to make 10 million US dollars in
foreign exchange this year. He also said that Lucky is preparing
to open 1,000 franchise stores in major Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
Although many industry insiders say that Lucky does not lag
behind foreign competitors in film quality, it is difficult to
find developers that can process Lucky film. So many Chinese
customers switched to foreign brands because most developing shops
process those brands.
</P>
<P>
Facing the same money constraints as many State enterprises,
Lucky intends to list on the stock market this year. But Li
declined to give details about listing.
</P>
<P>
Li said Lucky would not reject the possibility of setting up
joint ventures or cooperating with foreign partners, but Lucky
must be the controlling shareholder and the technology transferred

<HEADLINE> New County Seat Being Built in Southwestern Jiangxi Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Xiajiang County, one of the
relatively-poor areas in southwestern Jiangxi Province, has made
progress in building a new county seat believed to be able to help
link itself to other parts of China via Beijing-Kowloon Railway.
</P>
<P>
Xiajiang, which falls under the jurisdiction of Ji'an
Prefecture, has its existing county seat in Baqiu Town,
located on western bank of the Ganjiang River.
</P>
<P>
The new county seat is being built in Shuibian Town on the
eastern bank of the river, where the north-south trunk rail route
passes and a train stop has been established.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, some 200 million yuan (24 million
US dollars) have so far been spent on the construction, with the
completion of a number of major infrastructure projects, including
an office mansion for Xiajiang County Party Committee and the
county government, and a highly-elevated flyover crossing the
Beijing-Kowloon Railway Line.
</P>
<P>
An official in charge of the construction pledged that they
would redouble their efforts and step up construction so that the
local county authorities are expected to move into new offices
built in the new county seat by July 1.

<HEADLINE> Former Mexican President Hails Hong Kong's Return to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The return of Hong Kong to
China is an important step to definitively finish with colonialism
in the world and opens a new chapter in the total decolonization
of the world process.
</P>
<P>
These were the comments made by the former Mexican President,
Luis Echeverria Alvarez, during an interview with Xinhua here
today.
</P>
<P>
The former Mexican president, now dedicated to promoting
studies about the developing countries, underscored that the
return of Hong Kong to China is of a great importance not only for
China, but also for all the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"As a friend I have always been of China, I reiterate my
conviction that the Opium War was an unjust war against that
country, a brother of the developing countries, and that it was
only a pretext to establish the basis for the British expansionism
and colonialism in that region," said Echeverria.
</P>
<P>
"China will recover, after 150 years of arduous and tenacious
struggle, the exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong, which is
a just action in the world and represents a great triumph for the
Chinese people and government," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I never doubted -- knowing the character and the history of
the heroic Chinese people -- that it finally would achieve the
victory, integrating Hong Kong to its territory."
</P>
<P>
Echeverria said of the "one country, two systems" theory, that
it was a "very sensible formula for the modernization promoted by
our friend Deng Xiaoping."
</P>
<P>
Echeverria, a lawyer and an old friend of the Chinese people,
has visited China three times and maintains a deep feeling of
friendship toward China.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five years ago the then head of the Mexican state
adopted important measures directed to support the People's
Republic of China in the recovery of the place it deserved in the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He also decided to break relations with Taiwan authorities and
establish diplomatic relations with China.
</P>
<P>
He traveled to China in 1973 to become the first Mexican chief
of state to visit the ancient country in Asia.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Muslim Rebels Facing Breakup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) rebels in the southern Philippines are breaking up due to
internal squabbles, the Sunday Chronicle reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Major General Romeo Padiernos, chief of the Southern Command of
the Armed Forces of the Philippines, was quoted as saying that the
MILF is splitting into three factions according to their regional
attachments.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 Maranao members, disillusioned with the present
MILF leadership, have pulled out from the MILF central head office
of Camp Abubakar, while another 1,200 Tausog rebels have already
left Matanog Camp in Maguindanao, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The disillusioned rebels are reported to be setting up another
rebel group of a still undetermined ideological orientation,
prompting Padiernos to place all military forces in the nearby
areas on full alert.
</P>
<P>
Padiernos confirmed that the Maranaos are blaming MILF vice
chair for military affairs Al Haj Murad for the heavy Maranao
casualties in the clashes between MILF and government troops.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is a faction broken away in 1978 from the mainstream
Moro National Liberation Front which signed a final peace
agreement with the government last year.
</P>
<P>
The 12,000-member insurgency group is scheduled to hold the
fifth round of low-level talks with the government on June 17-18.
The two sides achieved little progress in their first four rounds
of talks.

Beijing-based newspapers:
</P>
<P>
 "People's Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- China has made initial progress in reducing the financial
burden of farmers. In the rural areas of Zaozhuang, a city in
eastern Shandong Province, the average financial burden per capita
is about 3.1 percent of the per head annual net income, well below
the official ceiling of five percent.
</P>
<P>
-- The branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in
east China's Jiangxi Province extended 10.4 billion yuan (1.25
billion US dollars), or 82.1 percent of its new loans, to 157
state-owned enterprises, enabling 121 of the firms to reduce
losses substantially.
</P>
<P>
--- In the special economic zone of Shenzhen, south China, a
welcome-back fever is prevailing for the return of Hong Kong to
the embrace of the motherland on July 1, reflected by upgraded
port facilities and improved urban surroundings.
</P>
<P>
 "China Youth News"
</P>
<P>
-- A historical film called The Opium War is to make its debut
at the Great Hall of the People tomorrow, just 22 days before China

be shown in Hong Kong and the interior areas as of June 11.
</P>
<P>
 "China Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- China is establishing a nationwide oil reserve as part of a

<HEADLINE> Overseas Banks Off to Good Start in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Eleven overseas banks have been
granted licenses to operate in the Chinese capital, today's China
Daily quoted an official of the Beijing branch of the People's
Bank of China (PBC) as saying.
</P>
<P>
It said that nine of them have actually started operation,
adding that Japan's Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi was the first
overseas bank to open a branch in Beijing in July 1995.
</P>
<P>
Beijing is attractive to overseas banks for its distinct status
and promising market, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of March, outstanding loans by the overseas banks
had reached 730 million US dollars, up 223 percent from a year
ago. Meanwhile, savings grew 33.6 percent to 410 million US
dollars and the banks' assets soared 92 percent to 1.76 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some of the banks have begun earning profits despite the short
period of operation, the official said, adding that in the first
quarter of this year the banks made a combined 370,000 US dollars
in profits.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp., which set up a branch
here in August 1995, is among the profitable banks. It raked in
profits last year and was profitable in the first quarter of this
year, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of overseas banks are applying for business licenses in
Beijing and even more financial institutions have applied to open
representative offices, the PBC Beijing official said.
</P>
<P>
Official record shows that more than 200 overseas financial
institutions have opened offices in Beijing, about half of the
number of offices set up in China by overseas banks.
</P>
<P>
As China's political, cultural and international exchange
center, Beijing is a strategic city for overseas financial
institutions to expand their business networks across the country.
</P>
<P>
Governmental bodies, state banks and many big companies are
headquartered in Beijing, a fact contributing to the city's
importance to overseas firms, experts say.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Beijing is home to Chinese headquarters for many
foreign companies because of its proximity to governmental
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than 70 of the world's top 100 banks
have a presence in Beijing while 16 out of the top 20 property
insurers and 10 of the first 20 life insurance companies have
opened offices here.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Macedonian Relations Develop Healthily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov
will pay his first state visit to China on June 9-13, coming at
the invitation of Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
The visit will raise bilateral relations to a higher level.
</P>
<P>
The two countries, though geographically wide apart, cherish a
long tradition of friendship. Bilateral cooperation in politics,
the economy, culture, science and technology has proceeded
smoothly since diplomatic relations were established in October
1993.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Gligorov met President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng
in Moscow and Copenhagen respectively. Later in the year, Former
Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski visited China.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen
made his first visit to the Balkan country, and it was followed by
Macedonian Economic Minister Bekir Zuta's China tour.
</P>
<P>
During these visits, Macedonian leaders vowed to continue to
implement the "one China" policy. They hoped China would achieve
reunification through its "one country, two systems" policy.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade, though growing rather slowly in recent years,
never ceases to gain momentum and faces a bright prospect.
</P>
<P>
Several Chinese trade delegations have lately explored the
possibility for more cooperation with Macedonia and a trade
delegation is to come to China with President Gligorov.
</P>
<P>
During this visit, the two sides will sign agreements on
investment protection and avoiding double taxation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, cooperation in other sectors has been boosted
enormously.
</P>
<P>
China sent students, martial arts coaches and scholars to
Macedonia. It also provided humanitarian aid to Macedonia to
relieve its heavy burden of refugees.
</P>
<P>
In return for this, Macedonia made donations to China's
flood-stricken areas. All these exchanges and mutual help will, as
Gligorov said in an interview, usher in "a broader and brighter
era" for the friendly ties linking the two peoples.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia, China Enjoy Prospect to Develop Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov
said there is a bright and wide prospect for the Macedonian-Sino
cooperative relations.
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy to have received the official invitation of
Chinese President Jiang Zemin to visit friendly China. Our nation
attaches great importance to my forthcoming visit," Gligorov said
in an interview with Xinhua before his Chinese trip on June 9-13,
the first one by a Macedonian president.
</P>
<P>
A smooth development of the Macedonian-Sino diplomatic
relations helps growth in other links between the two countries
and Macedonia is ready at all times to conduct extensive
cooperation with China on international occasions, said he.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the best friends of Macedonia, an important
factor in the international affairs, a honest partner in
mutual-benefit cooperations, said Gligorov.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that after my China's visit, there must be coming a
wider and brighter stage of the friendly and cooperative
cooperations between the two countries, " he said.
</P>
<P>
The Macedonian president praised China's reform and open-door
policy which he said has become a positive and successful example
in the world. He wished that his country and China will further
strengthen economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He also spoke highly of China's foreign policy based farsighted
strategic stand, saying Macedonia must learn from China in this
respect.
</P>
<P>
On Macedonia's internal situation, he noted that the Republic
of Macedonia is a part of the Balkan region. Macedonia has avoided
war, consolidated its independence, achieved democracy and legal
system and carried out reforms in politics and economy.
</P>
<P>
In the economic field, Macedonia has been privatized state
enterprises. Its currency and market are stable.
</P>
<P>
On its policy with neighboring states, Gligorov pointed out
that Macedonia will develop friendly ties with all neighbors on a
basis of equal distance principle, creating an
mutual-understanding and mutual-trust atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia has established diplomatic and cooperative relations
with its all neighboring states, and it has taken a series of
steps to push forward the Europeanization in the Balkan region,
added the president.

<HEADLINE> China's Strict Regulation to Reduce CD Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A stricter regulation on imported
compact disc production lines took effect last week, reflecting
the country's determination to eliminate piracy, reported today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation
(Moftec) and the General Administration of Customs regulation
requires licenses for imported CD/VCD production lines since June
1.
</P>
<P>
Moftec's Quota and License Administrative Bureau is responsible
for approving the licenses.
</P>
<P>
Application procedures will differ for domestic and
foreign-funded general trade and processing trade enterprises.
But both kinds of companies, before ordering equipment, must get
permission from the State Press and Publication Administration.
</P>
<P>
Insiders said the new measures show the government's resolve to
fight CD/VCD piracy.
</P>
<P>
"After years of battling copy-right piracy and obscene
publications, we feel it is more urgent to crack down on the
illegal plants than solely purifying the distribution markets," a
Guangdong Province official said.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong previously was the site of most illegal audiovisual
production. But last winter, it swept away more than a dozen
illegal VCD production lines.
</P>
<P>
As the new regulation takes effect, the number of pirated and
pornographic audiovisual products is expected to shrink
significantly in China, industry insiders said.
</P>
<P>
The regulation also affects chemical fertilizers and carbonated
beverages.
</P>
<P>
Under the regulation, companies will need licenses to import 35
kinds of products.

<HEADLINE> Pak to Benefit from Economic Reforms: ADB Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Large fiscal deficit, low foreign
exchange reserves and low domestic saving have been the immediate
challenges for Pakistan's macro-economic policy.
</P>
<P>
This was stated in the Asian Development Bank's (ADB) annual
report for 1997-98 fiscal year issued here yesterday.
</P>
<P>
In the next two years, "Pakistan is likely to benefit from the
ongoing reforms and from the improvement in the economic growth of
its trading partners," said the ADB report.
</P>
<P>
"A more stable political environment should enhance economic
performance", it said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the report stated, difficult challenges confront
Pakistan's economic managers given the urgent need to reduce the
budget deficit, shore up foreign exchange reserves, and increase
domestic saving.
</P>
<P>
The ADB report said that as a result of reforms in the banking
system now, incentives for small savers, among other things,
should become more effective.
</P>
<P>
Together with an improvement in the domestic economy in the
second half of 1997 and better fiscal management, these reforms
could lead to an increase in gross national saving to 13.3 percent
of the gross national product in 1997 and 14.9 percent in 1998,
the report forecast.
</P>
<P>
Domestic investment could increase as the reduction in the
fiscal deficit frees financial resources for both public and
private investment, it believed.
</P>
<P>
"The unemployment rate is likely to remain at less than five
percent if output growth continues at projected levels. However,
Pakistan is still a labor-surplus economy.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to domestic employment-generation programs, the
government proposes to launch an aggressive program to promote
overseas employment of Pakistani workers. If this program
succeeds, remittances of overseas workers can be expected to
increase over the next two years," the report said.

<HEADLINE> Legislation Needed in China for Oil Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- China's move to establish a
nationwide oil reserve as part of a strategic oil-supply security
system calls for legislative support, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for construction of several sea ports capable
of handling large oil tankers. They will be used for loading,
storing and processing imported sulfur-containing crude oil to
ensure sufficient supplies exist in the north and south.
</P>
<P>
China is negotiating with major oil-producing nations in the
Middle East for long-term oil orders as well as financing for
major refineries along China's coast.
</P>
<P>
It also is considering establishing ocean-going oil
transportation fleets. Major petrochemical complexes are expected
to be renovated to increase handling capacity for imported
sulfur-containing crude oil.
</P>
<P>
The reserve plan needs legislative support, central government
planning and a State foundation to be its pillar, and the reserve
is already crucial because the gap between domestic production and
demand is widening, according to Zhu Yu, president of the China
Petrochemical Consulting Corp, the think tank for China
Petrochemical Corp (Sinopec).
</P>
<P>
Despite the relatively slow legislation, petroleum companies
are being mobilized for the system. Presidents of the Sinopec and
the China National Petroleum Corp are visiting major
oil-and-gas-producing nations, especially in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
However, China will continue to need a tiny portion of the
world trade volume, said Zhu, who is also director of the
Sinopec's Petrochemical Planning and Engineering Institute.
</P>
<P>
Efforts for the reserve apparently are increasing the prospects
of foreign governments and enterprises participating more in
petroleum and petrochemical operations in China.
</P>
<P>
Zhu called for legislation authorizing the reserves, saying
that with laws, the community can be mobilized for such an
expensive reserve.
</P>
<P>
"It would be a bit late to officially plan State reserves of
crude oil and oil fuels," he said. "But now is the time to
legislate related plans and measures to quicken the action."
</P>
<P>
Economic growth will force China to import 50 million tons of
crude oil by the year 2000 -- twice the amount imported last
year.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Consultancy Firms Rush to Shanghai's Pudong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Overseas-funded consultancy firms
are rushing to an emerging financial and trade zone of China's
largest economic center at a rate of more than doubling their
number each year.
</P>
<P>
Official record indicated that the number of operational
overseas-funded consultancy firms in the municipality's Pudong New
Area, which is separated from downtown Shanghai by the Huangpu
River, had reached 257 by the end of April, with a total
investment totaling 168 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
About 20 percent of the firms, which are from the United
States, Britain, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan and other countries and
regions, are operated by well-known multi-national corporations.
</P>
<P>
Data provided by the area's bureau for economic and trade
affairs indicate that the number of consultancy firms accounted
for less than one percent of alls sorts of overseas-funded
enterprises in Pudong in 1993. The proportion rose up to eight
percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said that the overseas-funded consultancy firms
mainly engage in providing consultancies for matters related to
finances, accounting, taxation, investment, real estate, commerce
and property management.
</P>
<P>
Some of the firms were involved in construction of both the
Nanpu and Yangpu bridges, two major bridges spanning the Huangpu
River built in recent years, a bureau official said.
</P>
<P>
The consultancy firms have on the one hand brought into China
advanced expertise and on the other hand made big profits out of
the area's economic boom.
</P>
<P>
Conservative estimates have put the business income of Earnest
and Young's Shanghai firm at more than 100 million yuan (some 12
million US dollars) for fiscal year 1995-1996.

<TEXT>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Opens Consulate General in Munich </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MUNICH, Germany, June 7 (Xinhua) -- China today opened a
consulate general in the southern German city of Munich, the
second Chinese consulate general in the country after the one in
the northern port city of Hamburg.
</P>
<P>
In a message of congratulations to the event read out by
Chinese ambassador to Germany, Lu Qiutian, at the opening
ceremony, Chinese leader Li Ruihuan, who is currently on a
seven-day official goodwill visit to Germany, said he hopes the
new consulate general will make positive contributions to
strengthening the friendship and cooperation between the Chinese
and German peoples, and between China and Bavaria.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), made the first stop of
his visit to Germany in Munich, capital of the German state of
Bavaria, on Thursday. He left here Saturday afternoon for Berlin
to continue his visit.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the consulate general,
Chinese Ambassador Lu said the Sino-German relations have made
great progress since they established diplomatic ties in 1972.
</P>
<P>
Because both are countries of great importance in their
regions, the smooth development of the bilateral ties between
China and Germany will not only benefit the two peoples, but also
benefit the world peace and stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Bavaria has been playing a very important role in
the development of Sino-German relations, Lu expressed the
confidence that the opening of a Chinese consulate general in
Munich will strengthen the relations between the two countries as
well as between China and Bavaria, and will deepen the
understanding and friendship between the Chinese and German
peoples.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the opening ceremony, vice-premier of the
Bavaria state, Hans Zehetmair said it is of great importance for
Bavaria and China to expand their good relations. The
establishment of the Chinese consulate general in Munich could
make great contributions to this end.
</P>
<P>
Munich is the third largest city of Germany with a population
of over one million. It is also the center for new industries,
where many large companies, like Siemens, BMW and Allianz base
their headquarters.
