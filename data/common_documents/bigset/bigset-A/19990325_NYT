L.A. SECESSION PETITIONERS REJECT PROVISO TO SHOULDER LAWSUIT
BILLS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Valley Voters Organized Toward Empowerment flatly
rejected demands Wednesday that it agree to pay the cost of
defending Los Angeles County in any lawsuits arising from a
secession study sought by one-fourth of the suburban San Fernando
Valley's voters.
</P>
<P>
   The issue surfaced at a meeting of the county's Local Agency
Formation Commission and stalled the formal application for the
unprecedented secession study.
</P>
<P>
   LAFCO officials never sought such an indemnity clause for
lawsuits before in considering cityhood proposals in unincorporated
areas. Officials said they borrowed the idea from provisions used
in other California counties, which, in cases such as subdivision
boundaries, require applicants to pay for defending lawsuits that
might be filed in response to agency approvals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk about a chilling affect -- it's worse than ice cubes.
We're in the deep arctic freeze here,'' said John Walker, a
Woodland Hills attorney and one of the trio of suburban San
Fernando Valley residents who became the ``chief petitioners'' by
signing the first petition.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, speaking for fellow applicants Carlos Ferreyra and Marie
Harris, charged that the county added the provision in July, two
months after the cityhood drive began. He said it forces the
applicants to risk their personal assets and life's savings and
either shouldn't apply or should be changed.
</P>
<P>
   LAFCO members said the county needs to protect itself from
lawsuits filed against an agency merely doing its job.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be some kind of provision to protect us as a
governmental entity. We're talking about something here that
involves billions and billions and billions of dollars, massive
interests,'' said Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke.
</P>
<P>
   The indemnity provision is the latest obstacle in the path of
the secession movement.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's debate was similar to one over the question of who
should pay to verify the more than 200,000 signatures Valley VOTE
collected on cityhood petitions. Los Angeles County ultimately
paid, yielding to challenges that citizens shouldn't be charged to
petition government.
</P>
<P>
   Valley VOTE tallied 132,490 signatures from registered Valley
voters, which was 719 signatures over the total required.
</P>
<P>
   The cityhood study, however, can't go forward without an
application following the successful petition drive.
</P>
<P>
   Walker told LAFCO the three chief petitioners represented those
voters who want a study and the agency shouldn't deny them. ``We
are the agents for those people. That's all we are able to do.''
</P>
<P>
   LAFCO called on attorneys representing the county and the
petitioners to seek a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to clear the air on this thing,'' said Valley
Councilman Hal Bernson who represents the Los Angeles City Council
on LAFCO. ``I think we need to protect ourself, but we've never
required anybody to be personally liable.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke was particularly critical of Valley VOTE's opposition to
the indemnity provision. Similar to her opposition to the county
paying for the signature verification cost, Burke said secession
supporters should have considered potential costs associated with
the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``This cannot be handled in what we call an `Amos and Andy' way.
You need to think about it carefully and decide what you're
doing,'' Burke said.
</P>
<P>
   Bernson countered that Valley VOTE was a citizens group and not
some sort of ``government in exile'' that can anticipate every step
in such an unprecedented process.
</P>
<P>
   Valley VOTE leaders said the petitioners and the organization
recognize they might face lawsuits. Indeed, Valley VOTE is forming
a foundation to raise money for such costs.
</P>
<P>
   But they won't commit to paying the county's legal costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a blank check that the applicants are signing. It's just
not right, it's not fair, it's not constitutional to require a
person to take on that responsibility,'' said Valley VOTE attorney
John Isen.
</P>
<P>
   Taking issue with Valley VOTE's charge that the county was
putting up another roadblock, LAFCO Executive Director Larry
Calemine noted that the commission changed its policy on the
signature verification fee and pushed for the county to pay the
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This commission has bent over backwards. And it seems that
they . . . are constantly coming in, month after month, to request
changes to policy issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Calemine also questioned why the group raised the issue for the
first time this week.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who chairs the LAFCO committee
overseeing the study process, defended Valley VOTE.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were obsessed with getting the requisite number of
signatures.''

MAVERICKS FANS RAIN BOOS UPON NASH IN LOSS TO ROCKETS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The long-suffering Mavericks fans took a hard stance in
the third quarter. They booed one of their own _ point guard Steve
Nash.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the Mavericks' 88-78 loss to the Houston Rockets
last night at Reunion Arena, the Mavericks fans booed Nash as if he
were an enemy player. The intensity of the jeering toward a player
perhaps has not been heard in this building since Mavericks fans
booed Kiki Vandeweghe after he refused to play for Dallas when the
Mavericks made him the franchise's first draft pick in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Nash said he noticed the booing right away, when he rechecked
into the game late in the third period. At the time, Nash was
scoreless and was 0-of-8 from the field in a game the Mavericks
trailed at one point by 16 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans pay money to come watch us play, and they have every
right to cheer us, to boo us, or to have any reaction that they
please,'' Nash said. ``I didn't play well, I didn't shoot the ball
well and they weren't happy about it, and they showed their
displeasure and that's fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything quite like that, but it's just the
nature of the business. \RLast\S Saturday night I had a big game
\Rwith 22 points against Sacramento\S and the crowd cheered, and
now I had a poor game and the crowd voiced their displeasure, and
they have every right to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, said guard Michael Finley, who took exception to the
crowd's reaction to Nash's poor game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't appreciate that at all,'' Finley said. ``True fans of
any sport, you don't boo the home team. When things are going
downhill like they were _ for not only Steve, but for the team _
that's the time when fans should be behind a team or an individual
and cheer for them more.
</P>
<P>
   ``But to hear them boo our own player, I was very disappointed.
Hopefully that was just a spur of ignorance on the side of the fans
who were booing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockets forward Charles Barkley, who was a teammate of Nash's
when the two were in Phoenix, gave Nash a hug before the fourth
quarter started. After the game, he criticized the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed in the Dallas fans,'' Barkley said.
``He's a good kid. I like him a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed they treated him like that. Why don't they
send him to down to Houston? We'll take him.''
</P>
<P>
   After the initial verbal assault on Nash, the fans booed him
every time he touched the basketball, except when he drilled a
3-point basket with 6:02 left. Nash finished the game 1-of-10 from
the field with three points, five assists and no turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   The booing also could have been perceived as a direct slap at a
Mavericks organization that gave up this summer's first-round draft
pick to Phoenix for Nash. And, before this season, the Mavericks
signed Nash to a six-year, $33 million contract extension, and all
but labeled him as this team's cornerstone point guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know he's a much better player than he's playing,''
Mavericks coach/general manager Don Nelson said. ``He's got to
toughen up, that's all.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to prove to people that he's a player. If it takes
hitting the bottom of the barrel, which maybe he did tonight, then
let's see. Let's grow up and get some skin under our nose and let's
prove to people we can play this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Nash said his confidence is not shattered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd always sort of been a fan favorite, and not really the
goat,'' he said. ``It's a new challenge for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at the end of the day and the end of your life, if you
have the opportunity to take the easy street, or take the tough
path and actually learn and grow and face a little adversity, I
think you'll learn a lot more and you'll become a stronger
person.''

L.A. SERB IMMIGRANTS WORRY ABOUT NATO ATTACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY SHARLINE CHIANG  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Serbians and Albanians living in the San Fernando
Valley watched and listened nervously as newscasts showed exploding
airstrikes in Kosovo all day Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Many said they felt helpless witnessing the bombings from
halfway across the globe, all the while fearing for the lives and
well-being of family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Woodland Hills resident Veroljub Radivojevic, 61, a Serbian
immigrant, wondered how the war would affect his sister and
brother-in-law still who live in Belgrade. Airstrikes reportedly
struck outside the city limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, I'm worried. Not only for them but for all Serbian
people,'' said Radivojevic, a retired civil engineer. ``If they
continue like this they will destroy Serbia. It is a small
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Majlinda Gjikuria, 26, was keenly aware that Wednesday she would
have still been in her home outside the Albanian capital of Tirana
-- a city only about 50 miles away from the Kosovo-Albania border
-- if she hadn't won a U.S. green card in a lottery that allowed
her to move permanently to America just three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am really scared. I have friends all over Albania,'' said
Gjikuria, whose family left Albania and now lives in Greece. ``This
war is too much for them. Everyone is trying to get out of Albania
but they can't get visas.''
</P>
<P>
   Nora Hughes, who has invited Gjikuria to stay at her Granada
Hills home, lived in Albania for two years on a Fulbright
scholarship and worked to improve the justice system there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very hard. (Tirana) is 50 miles from the border of
Kosovo so you are not talking about any great distance,'' she said.
``The Serbs have been coming over the board for a year and people
are scared to death. They're saying, how can we get out?''
</P>
<P>
   Serbians, Albanians and supporters of both ethnic groups
expressed sorrow over the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is for defense, not for attack,'' Radivojevic said.
``Yeah, Milosevic is a bad man but it's the Serbian people who are
the victims. If they have something against Milosevic, they should
go against him. Use other ways, diplomatic ways, pressuring way . .
. something better than this.''
</P>
<P>
   Radivojevic said he is helping to organize a protest by area
Serbs and Serbian-Americans for 2 p.m. Saturday in front of the
federal building in Westwood. David Hartsough, executive director
of the Peaceworkers organization in San Francisco, spent the past
two and a half years supporting Albanians working toward nonviolent
solutions for peace in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first response (to Wednesday's airstrikes) is really great
sorrow that during nine years of very significant nonviolent
movement the whole international community stood by and did
nothing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he couldn't help sensing a sad irony in the airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that our message that killing civilians is wrong
can be gotten across by killing civilians ourselves,'' he said.

REID TAKES TURN AT FORWARD ROULETTE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ J.R. Reid now knows how Corie Blount felt.
And how Robert Horry feels. And what Rick Fox has gone through.
</P>
<P>
   On a roster where seven of 12 players are forwards, and with
four guys who could arguably start at the big forward slot, no
one's minutes are certain. And now Reid, who started all 16 games
with Charlotte and led the Hornets with 15.2 points per game, is
just another guy struggling for minutes in the Los Angeles Lakers'
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Reid averaged 17.4 minutes and 4.4 points in his first five
games here, then watched his next two from the bench once Dennis
Rodman returned from his Las Vegas vacation.
</P>
<P>
   And just when Reid had resigned himself to the role of high-paid
spectator, coach Kurt Rambis sent him in for Shaquille O'Neal just
four minutes into Wednesday's game against Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Just another day in the life of a Lakers power forward. Fifteen
minutes one day, DNP the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of expected it,'' Reid said. ``I kind of thought
something like this would happen. But I just try to stay positive
and be ready when I get my opportunities again.''
</P>
<P>
   He's made the most of limited playing time and made an instant
impact Wednesday. Reid had four points and four rebounds in his
first eight minutes, helping the Lakers rebound from an early
double-digit deficit.
</P>
<P>
   A free agent this summer and in search of a raise from his
$700,000 contract, Reid said he's OK with the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough going from playing a lot to not playing, but that's
just a transition you have to make going to a championship team,''
he said. ``Hopefully, I've played enough so far that teams know
what I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Rambis has been impressed with Reid and said his sporadic
playing time _ like Horry's and Fox's _ is no reflection on the job
he's done.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the aspect of my job, is there's absolutely nothing
those guys have done wrong to not deserve time,'' Rambis said.
``They all deserve time.... We have a very talented ballclub and
it's hard to go 12 deep in a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Breather: After surviving a brutal six-game, nine-day road trip,
the Lakers were more than a little relieved to take Tuesday off. No
game, no practice.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant still played some hoop but found time to visit with
his niece as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely felt good. When (Rambis) said `day off,' you
just heard everybody go like, `Whew,''' Bryant said. ``It feels
good to just kind of mellow out a little bit, catch up on life,
other things besides basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the time off didn't give Rambis much time to relax.
</P>
<P>
   ``One kid was sick, the other was home _ I played some ball with
him _ watched a bunch of videotape, unpacked, did about five loads
of laundry and bada-boom, bada-bing, it was time to go to bed,''
Rambis said.

DOCTOR DENIES OFFICE TURNED AWAY TEEN WHO DIED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Mesa doctor denied Wednesday that he refused to treat a
13-year-old girl who died hours later of a ruptured appendix.
</P>
<P>
   As hundreds of people poured out their support and expressed
outrage over the death of Gricelda Zamora, Dr. Stuart Agren, in a
written statement, said Gricelda did not appear critically ill when
she came into his office last Thursday, and had been at a hospital
emergency room only minutes before.
</P>
<P>
   His account contradicts that of the child's family.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Zamora Quintero, the girl's father, maintains that he
carried a very sick and weak Gricelda into Agren's office where
they waited for 45 minutes without medical attention while office
workers questioned the family's medical coverage, ability to pay
and Gricelda's immigration status.
</P>
<P>
   Zamora also disputed Agren's statement late Monday, saying
Gricelda did not go from the emergency room to Agren's office.
</P>
<P>
   Some three hours after leaving Agren's office March 18, Gricelda
was airlifted to Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center, where she
died.
</P>
<P>
   Agren stated that his office staff worked with the family
members to see if their insurance was valid before saying that they
did not need to have money upfront before Griselda was treated.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to Zamora, the clerks did not accept his
insurance cards and told him the doctor would see Gricelda if he
had $65 to pay for the visit. Zamora said he did not have the cash.
</P>
<P>
   An angry Zamora disputed Agren's version saying, ``Everything
they say is false. I have repeated my story many times and I have
witnesses.``
</P>
<P>
   Through his employer, Gallo Insulation, Zamora has medical
insurance for his family. Russ Bonsall, personnel manager for
Gallo, confirmed that the Zamora family was covered by a health
care plan with Principal Life Insurance. Both Bonsall and Principal
Life Insurance verified that Agren is an approved plan doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Patients covered by the plan can see Agren with a $10
co-payment, according to Principal Life.
</P>
<P>
   The death of the sixth-grade cheerleader set off an outpouring
of support and outrage in the community. Many grieved over the dead
teenager and asked how it could happen.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Mexican government pledged to hire an attorney
to represent the Zamora family. Antonio Zamora immigrated from
Mexico with his wife, Inez, and Gricelda when the girl was an
infant. He is now a legal resident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at those medical personnel who rejected this
girl while she was in pain,'' said Miguel Angel Isidro, acting
chief of the Mexican Consulate in Phoenix. ``This is a very, very
confused case in which some bad decisions were made.`'
</P>
<P>
   Gricelda's death came after an appendicitis attack went
undetected by emergency room doctors at Mesa Lutheran Hospital and
hours after her family sought care in Agren's office three days
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family thanked them and then left. That was the last
information the office had on them,'' said Barry Halpern, an
attorney representing Agren.
</P>
<P>
   Halpern said that he did not know if Agren saw Gricelda in the
waiting room.
</P>
<P>
   Agren's version of the events surrounding Gricelda's final hours
differ from the family's on several points, according to Halpern:
</P>
<P>
   Zamora had been in Mesa Lutheran's emergency department a second
time, minutes before she had gone to Agren's office. If she had
been gravely ill, why had the emergency department let her leave?
Under federal law, they are obligated to treat her, Halpern said.
</P>
<P>
   When the office staff tried to verify the insurance cards that
the family gave, they couldn't determine if the family was covered.
That's why the office staff asked about their Social Security
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My staff, my family and I share the Zamora family's grief over
the loss of Gricelda Zamora. We hope that with the passage of time
and after further reflection, there will be more fair and balanced
account of the events which are now subject to considerable
discussion and speculation,'' Agren's statement reads.
</P>
<P>
   The family went to Agren after being referred to him by the
hospital emergency department.
</P>
<P>
   Because the family didn't initially contact Agren until two days
after the emergency-room visit, that may mean Agren is not
responsible for care, Halpern said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Arizona Board of Medical Examiners is taking a different
view.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a doctor on the on-call roster and you are assigned
patients for follow-up, you shouldn't be refusing those patients
care,'' BOMEX spokesman Eric Nickell said.
</P>
<P>
   BOMEX is gathering information about the case to determine if
they should file a complaint against Agren.
</P>
<P>
   Nickell said the board will be investigating if Gricelda's
treatment at Agren's office fell short of medical standards.
</P>
<P>
   The board also will look at how much Agren and his staff knew
about the family in the waiting room, especially Gricelda's
condition, and at what kind of protocols they had for turning away
patients, Nickell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of different theories. There is the captain
of the ship theory that a doctor is responsible for what goes on in
his office. There is also theory that a doctor should treat a
patient if that patient needs treatment,'' Nickell said.
</P>
<P>
   Agren, who has been licensed in Arizona since 1985, has received
one letter of complaint concerning false advertising from the
Arizona Board of Medical Examiners.
</P>
<P>
   Around the Valley, ``Republic'' readers reacted with sympathy
and generosity for the Zamora family, who could not afford to pay
for Gricelda's funeral and burial. Hundreds of people pledged
donations and several individuals, mortuaries and community groups
offered to pay for funeral expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Peoria pawn shop owner Alex Gonzalez offered to pay for the
funeral after crying when he read Gricelda's story in the paper
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told they didn't have money and that's one pressure they
don't need right now. I thought I would try to be a blessing to
them,'' he said. ``But it's nothing compared to what they lost.''
</P>

UW'S BENDER TURNS DOWN VANDERBILT JOB OFFER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In contrast to speculation about his future, Bob Bender was not
all over the map Wednesday. He gave straight-forward responses.
Once the Final Four concludes on Monday, the University of
Washington basketball coach will be headed in one direction _ home.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone news conference Wednesday from St. Petersburg,
Fla., Bender announced that he is spurning the job offer at
Vanderbilt and staying at Washington. He said the decision was made
Tuesday night after discussions with his wife, Alice, and revealed
Wednesday morning to Vanderbilt athletic director Todd Turner.
</P>
<P>
   ``With what we still want to accomplish, it became very obvious
that Washington is a place where we need to be and want to be,''
Bender said.
</P>
<P>
   On his list of factors, Bender did not list any ``cons'' with
the Commodores, just many more ``pros'' with the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all to do with Washington,'' he said. ``No way does it
reflect negatively on Vanderbilt. Motivation is also a big part of
the decision. We want to prove where we brought the program can be
expanded and built upon. Now we need to get to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bender was contacted by Vanderbilt last week. He spent Monday
and Tuesday in Nashville touring the campus, talking to Turner and
the chancellor. Bender was intrigued by the private-school status
of Vanderbilt, which is similar to Duke, where he was a player and
an assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   He said Vanderbilt's rigid academic standards were not an issue
and kept coming back to the qualities at Washington simply being
more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Input from his wife figured prominently, he said. Even though
her father graduated from Vanderbilt's medical school, Alice Bender
favored a return to Washington. Bender was reminded of all their
great friendships in Seattle, a city where their children (Mary, 3,
and Robert Jr., 7 months) were born.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a very important role,'' Bender said of Alice. ``She's
a rational person. Many times wives have to take the brunt of so
many things. In an instance like this, there are very difficult
emotions to deal with. A place like Seattle becomes much more
ingrained in what a family is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   The Benders also felt loyalty to the Huskies themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her relationship with the players is very much like mine,''
Bender said. ``What players mean to you always enters into it.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight year, Bender flirted with another
university, and Florida State even showed modest interest in 1997.
Last year Texas called.
</P>
<P>
   Bender has been criticized for having a supposedly wandering
eye. But he says he is just checking out opportunities, each
fact-finding mission taking him back to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is being unfairly ridiculed by some of the fans,'' said
Husky assistant coach Byron Boudreaux. ``Just because he's being
courteous to Vanderbilt, people thought that showed a lack of
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're as desirable as he is and all these people (Texas
and Vanderbilt) want to pay you all this money and you still come
back _ that's commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Bender said he can't control the timing of the openings but does
not want to be perceived as an unsettled coach, realizing the
strain he is putting on athletic director Barbara Hedges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't predict the future, but I don't want to put her
through this every spring,'' he said. ``I'd be very cautious to
ever say five to 10 years from now I will still be coaching at
Washington. I hope I will. That means we're doing things the right
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Hedges: ``It would have to be something exceptional for Bob
to look at anything in the near future.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt never formally offered the job to Bender, but it was
understood that he was the leading candidate. No one else had been
asked to come to Nashville for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Bender refuted many conjectured reasons why he might
want to leave Washington. Criticism of his coaching in the
first-round game of the NCAA tournament game did not bother him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows people care,'' he said. ``It's been a positive for
the program. It's shown that we've progressed from a point where
people didn't pay much attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Bender did not use his dalliance with Vanderbilt as a way of
sweetening his own contract at Washington. He told Hedges that he
did not want his contract changed at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no ulterior motive,'' Bender said. ``It was a unique
institution I wanted to learn more about. It meant in no way that I
was leaning toward leaving Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that football reigns at Washington is viewed as an
asset.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a huge bonus and ally in rebuilding the (basketball)
program,'' Bender said. ``The vision Barbara Hedges has for
Washington is the same that Todd Turner has at Vanderbilt _ in
today's age you can be successful in all sports you offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Hedges: ``I definitely have a vision for the program and
Bob Bender is such an important person in that vision. I told him
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, the vision is blurry. The Huskies lost their
two best players, Todd MacCulloch and Donald Watts, to graduation.
Next year's starting center likely will be a junior college
transfer. The best returning scoring threat is Deon Luton, who
varies between fantastic and erratic.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies signed two players in November _ Ben Coffee, a
6-foot-6 guard from Benson Tech High in Portland, and Will Perkins,
a 6-9 JC transfer from Iowa Western.
</P>
<P>
   They have two more scholarships to offer. The most likely
candidates are all JC players _ David Dixon, a 6-10 center from
Tyler, Texas; Julius Hicks, a 6-9 forward from West Valley in
Saratoga, Calif.; and Livan Pyfrom, a 6-11 center from East
Oklahoma State.
</P>
<P>
   At Vanderbilt, Bender could have had nine of the top 10
returning Commodores. But that job will be someone else's, perhaps
going to Quin Snyder, the Duke assistant and Mercer Island graduate
who appears to be the No. 1 candidate now.
</P>
<P>
   Bender recognizes and relishes the challenges ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you have to follow your heart,'' he said.
``Washington is where I need to be.''

SEAHAWKS' KITNA TOPS TRADING CARD HOT LIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ Jon Kitna thought it was strange just having a
football card of himself. Now, the Seahawks quarterback has the
hottest card in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna's 1997 Pacific Crown Royale rookie card is listed atop the
``What's Hot'' list in the April issue of Beckett Football, a
magazine and price guide that has become the bible of card
collecting. Kitna vaulted past Randy Moss, who was an All-Pro
receiver in his rookie season with the Minnesota Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They must not have made very many of them,'' Kitna said
Wednesday, displaying a typical low-key approach to his growing
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   That is part of it.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Trading Cards, based in Lynnwood, was the only card
manufacturer to make a rookie card for the undrafted passer from
Central Washington University, and it produced an extremely limited
number.
</P>
<P>
   But Beckett also points to the arrival of Mike Holmgren as
Seahawks coach and general manager, which has sparked the obvious
comparisons of Kitna to a young Brett Favre and a young Steve Young
_ two quarterbacks who blossomed into All-Pro status under
Holmgren's tutelage in Green Bay and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Kitna, who's as likable as he is unassuming, as
talented as he is inexperienced and on the verge of a breakout
season for himself and his team.
</P>
<P>
   An entire nation of card collectors is noticing. Not only has
Kitna's rookie card jumped from off the chart in February, to No. 4
in March to No. 1 in April, its value has increased from $2.50 in
December, to $12 in February to $30 in April. And his 1997 Pacific
Revolution card has jumped from No. 10 on the hot list in March to
No. 4 in April.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the ``What's Hot'' list for April includes two cards
each for Moss, 49ers wide receiver Terrell Owens and Ravens running
back Priest Holmes; and rookie cards for Broncos quarterback John
Elway, running back Terrell Davis and wide receiver Ed McCaffrey,
Colts running back Marshall Faulk, Falcons running back Jamal
Anderson, Jaguars running back Fred Taylor and Seahawks wide
receiver Joey Galloway.
</P>
<P>
   Illustrious company, but all this hoopla over cards and their
worth is somewhat lost on Kitna. He never collected them while
growing up in Tacoma. Instead, Kitna used to hang out at Tacoma
Tigers games while Mark McGwire and Jose Canseco were playing for
the Pacific Coast League club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never cared about that stuff,'' Kitna said. ``We'd have
balls that were signed or bats with their names on them, and we'd
just go out and play with them. I should have kept them. But, oh
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is a bit strange when the face staring at you from the
card is yours. Kitna has a complete set of his cards, thanks to the
efforts of Karl Payne, the chaplain at the church Kitna attends.
Payne gave Kitna a complete set of his cards for Christmas last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird to see the cards. I just never pictured this
happening,'' Kitna said. ``People are making a big deal out of what
I'm doing, but I feel like I'm doing the same thing I've been doing
since high school. Little things have changed here and there, but
all in all I feel like I'm just playing still.''
</P>
<P>
   If the people at Beckett are correct, and Holmgren can mold
Kitna as he has other young quarterbacks, the glut of glory could
just be starting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it gets worse,'' Kitna said with a smile. ``That's the
goal. If it gets worse, that means I'm doing my job.''

KINGS DEFEAT KNICKS, 92-91 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ The New York Knicks took another blow to
their self-esteem and mental stability on Wednesday night. They
took another crushing loss in a tight finish.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks lost their fourth game in five tries after Patrick
Ewing's potential game-winning jumper bounded off the rim with 3
seconds left. The Sacramento Kings walked away with a 92-91 victory
at Arco Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing led the Knicks with 23 points, while Vernon Maxwell led
the Kings with 19 points off the bench. The Knicks, playing the
first game of a three-game trip, fell to 15-13 and are 3-9 on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   As is their habit, the Knicks allowed a 9-point fourth quarter
lead to disappear in a flurry of mistakes. The biggest occurred
when the score was tied, 91-91, with 59 seconds left. After a
jumper by Ewing missed and went off the Kings and out of bounds,
and another miss by Chris Childs was rebounded by Larry Johnson,
Latrell Sprewell had the ball in his hands at the top of the key
when he was stripped by the rookie Jason Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was instantly fouled by Sprewell with 11.5 seconds
left. Williams missed the first free throw and then, after it
bounded around the rim, the second one fell in to give the Kings a
92-91 lead. The Knicks were hyperventilating as they traded miss
for miss in a flurry of botched fast breaks midway through the
fourth quarter. And still, the Knicks held a 77-74 lead after
Sprewell opened the quarter with two quick scores.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, playing smarter and more in control than the Kings,
opened a 81-74 lead after Childs drove and kicked the ball out to
an open Charlie Ward for a 3-pointer with 6 minutes 54 seconds left
in the game. The Knicks' lead was cut to 85-83 on two free throws
by Vlade Divac. Ewing, mustering all of his energy, managed a layin
and then tapped in a missed runner by Ward. But Ewing's efforts
were matched on back-to-back 3-pointers _ one by Divac and one by
Williams _ to keep the Kings close, 91-89, with 1:23 left in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks were up against a team that played loose and with few
thoughts of defense. Once it was clear that the Knicks were not
going to be able to put their foot down on the fast break, they
decided to dip their old toes in the fountain of youth and take off
with the Kings. Making up a 7-point second-quarter deficit, the
Knicks ran and ran until they came up with a 52-51 halftime lead.
Both teams shot 48 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team kept up that pace in the third quarter. It was too
hard on the Knicks' aging bodies, so they slowed it down, ran the
offense through Ewing and tightened their defense.
</P>
<P>
   As the tempo of the game dragged, the Knicks played a game of
slow motion back and forth. The score was tied, 62-62, with six
minutes left in the third when the Kings pulled a few tricks _
including an alley-oop from Divac to Tariq Abdur-Wahad _ to put
them ahead by 68-64 with 1 minute 14 seconds left. Johnson came up
with a 3-pointer to pull the Knicks back to within a point. The
Kings' lead stood at 68-67 going into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   This was another test for the team that had proven mentally
fragile. But at least the Knicks appeared game and were able to
keep up with the fleet Kings from the start.
</P>
<P>
   It was like old times for Sprewell. He was playing the kind of
free-wheeling West Coast style he thrived in at Golden State. But
as fast as Sprewell was running up 9 points on 11 shots in 16
minutes off the bench in the first half, Maxwell was tagging him
right back. Maxwell collected 13 points in 13 minutes as sixth man.
</P>
<P>
   Something had to give, and it was Williams. He was getting a
little too fancy, a little too free, and he turned the ball over
six times in the first half. Ward could not stick with him when he
was dribbling between his legs and around his back, but the brash
display inspired Ward.
</P>
<P>
   And Ward is at his best when he is inspired. Too often this
season, his familiar detached look on his face has turned into a
vacant stare. After re-signing for five years and $26million, Ward
has regressed from a year ago. With one of the league's worst
assist-to-turnover ratios standing at 150 to 84 entering the game,
Ward had only had a single night when he seemed into a game.
</P>
<P>
   That game was against Stephon Marbury, the name most mentioned
to upgrade the Knicks' point guard weakness before the trade
deadline. Ward did not like it, and he took great satisfaction in
his 18-point, 13-assist game against Marbury one month ago. But
since that night, Ward has vanished, and the Knicks have become
increasingly desperate for some court guidance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought last year he had the right mixture between being
aggressive _ particularly on the break and trying to make plays _
but not being careless,'' Coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``I think it
that way, he needs to get back on top of that.''

<P>
   This is a crisis without a happy ending. Unless there is some
extraordinary change of heart by the Serbs _ and the violence this
past weekend makes it clear there is little chance of that _ the
Kosovo war is either going to end in a NATO bombardment or the
betrayal of the Kosovo Albanians who so credulously signed up for
``peace'' in Paris last week.
</P>
<P>
   It is even possible that we could both bomb the Serbs and betray
the Kosovars. We could even betray our own high principles _
democracy, human rights, and so on _ if we find that the Muslims of
Kosovo insist on independence rather than autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   The approach of international conflict in the Balkans has been
so slow, and so littered with the usual cliches of threat and
counter-threat, that it is difficult to realize that we are
approaching the endgame.
</P>
<P>
   Both NATO and Slobodan Milosevic have reached _ cliche again _
the point of no return. Serbia cannot surrender Kosovo to foreign
forces. NATO cannot back down from its obligations to the Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when the Kosovo delegation coldly signed away their
independence in return for limited self-government, the men and
women who had hitherto played a starring role in the drama
preferred to stay away. British foreign secretary Robin Cook was in
Bonn, as was French foreign minister Hubert Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
   Madeleine Albright said she ``wished she could be there'' _ she
could have been, of course _ but stayed in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The stars suddenly wanted out of the movie. No one _ save the
luckless U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, his Austrian EU colleague and
Russian negotiator Boris Mayorski wanted to be there. And Mayorski
sullenly refused to sign the documents as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   Russia was not going to be a party to this particular surrender
of Serb sovereignty, nor lend its name to a treaty which may lead
to a NATO war.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov may still warn
Milosevic of his behavior _ and condemn the slaughter of ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo _ but his cancelled trip to Washington shows
that Moscow is not going to join the NATO crusade. Nor are the
Russians unaware of the divisions within NATO.
</P>
<P>
   American enthusiasm for an offensive against Serbia has scarcely
wavered during the weeks of negotiations at Rambouillet and Paris.
But Europe's threats _ symbolized by Cook's finger-wagging
diplomacy _ have grown steadily fainter as the prospect of conflict
approached.
</P>
<P>
   Wars in Southeast Asia and the Middle East invariably spread to
neighboring countries, their effect rippling like an earthquake
throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   Why should Europe be any different? And this, remember, will be
a European war _ far from the United States, but well inside our
own continent.
</P>
<P>
   Once we start bombing Serbia, will Montenegro seek independence
_ and our protection _ from Belgrade? Will the Albanians of
Macedonia declare for the Albanians of Kosovo _ or, worse, a
greater Albania? Could Greece tolerate internal dissent in
Macedonia?
</P>
<P>
   Would the Bosnian Muslims _ an outside chance, this, but one
that NATO has thought about _ choose this moment to conclude
unfinished business with the Bosnian Serbs and retake the Drina
Valley?
</P>
<P>
   In London, we are backing the Americans (more or less). But the
closer they are to the Balkans, the less enthusiastic are our
European partners. Italy and Austria and Greece really do not want
a war. And who can blame them?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are cracks in the Serbian edifice. Milosevic's
opponents are being quietly wooed by NATO ambassadors who know that
two of Serbia's top military strategists were fired by the Yugoslav
president earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Serb ``democrats'' fear that a war will give Milosevic the
opportunity to declare martial law, crush the remaining free press
in Belgrade, arrest dissidents and, perhaps, seize back control of
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo Albanians would then be fair game for the Yugoslav armed
forces; since the Kosovars would invariably support NATO, they
would be regarded as a fifth column, vicious traitors who must be
ruthlessly exterminated.
</P>
<P>
   As usual this past weekend, we were looking after our own,
hoping to extract the Kosovo monitors before the Serbs could take
them hostage _ while leaving the Kosovars to their fate.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA will, for a while, abide by the treaty signed in Paris
last Thursday; they will wait for the autonomy that NATO guarantees
_ until it becomes clear that NATO will not ride to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   If NATO bombs the Serbs, will the KLA remain in their villages?
And if they do not _ and the Serbs attack the Kosovars _ will the
western armies in Macedonia help them? Alas, that is not what the
Kosovo delegation signed up for in Paris last week.
</P>
<P>
   So will the Kosovars themselves stay united? The Americans are
desperately worried that they will not; hence their insistence last
week that the Kosovo delegation should return to Pristina for
``necessary consultations,'' the need to remain unified and ``stay
in touch'' with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the sudden invitation to the Kosovo delegation to visit
NATO headquarters for a briefing on what they can expect _ and not
expect _ in the way of support.
</P>
<P>
   For if the Kosovo Albanians seek independence rather than
autonomy once a NATO bombardment begins, the European casus belli _
the refusal of the Serbs to abide by the Paris peace agreement
which they refused to sign _ disappears. And then the world will
ask why NATO has gone to war.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Milosevic might still, at the very last moment, give way.
But the odds are increasingly against it. Serb president Milan
Milutinovic promised in Paris last week that the Yugoslav armed
forces would fight in the event of a NATO attack.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Milosevic allowed the Serbs of Krajina to be driven
from their homes by the Croatians, and abandoned the Serbs of
western Bosnia. He is unlikely to bow to American pressure in order
to save Serb lives in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   So what chance of a happy ending? &QL;

   LONDON _ As the West prepares for war against Serbia, fears
inevitably are being voiced that the conflict will throw the entire
region into chaos.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Balkan tinderbox'' theory was frequently wheeled out by
Western politicians in the early Nineties to justify a ``hands
off'' policy towards the conflict then raging in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Balkan chaos theories have a long pedigree, dating back at the
very least to the first and second Balkan wars of 1912 and 1913,
which involved Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia, Montenegro and
the Ottoman Empire in a series of constantly shifting, short-lived
combinations.
</P>
<P>
   General Sir Michael Rose, former commander of the U.N. troops in
Bosnia, revived the tinderbox theory Tuesday on the ``Today'' (BBC
Radio) program.
</P>
<P>
   Warning of a possible ``third Balkan war,'' he said: ``There's a
grave danger that an act of war carried out against Serbia by NATO
will spread into Bosnia and possibly into Macedonia.''
</P>
<P>
   The general's worries about Macedonia are certainly shared by
most observers, and by many Macedonians, too. Serbia's southern
neighbor declared its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991 and is
an inherently unstable state, in spite of the presence of more than
10,000 NATO peacekeepers on its northern border.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday Macedonia closed its two border crossings with Kosovo,
while President Kiro Gligorov appealed to NATO to lend his country
extra security guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   The flow of Albanian refugees into Macedonia already threatens
to destabilize the country's explosive ethnic mixture, pitting the
dominant Slavs against a large and restive Albanian minority.
</P>
<P>
   Relief organization officials said about 1,000 Kosovars crossed
the border in the last 24 hours alone.
</P>
<P>
   Albania itself is another obvious worry. Although the left-wing
government is less inclined to pander to pan-Albanian rhetoric than
its right-wing predecessor, Tirana would still find it extremely
hard to stay aloof from all-out war on the ground, especially if a
massive Serbian assault on the population threatened them with
annihilation.
</P>
<P>
   Further afield, there are other potential actors in the Serbian
drama; Turkey for one, the former ruling power in the Balkans and
self-appointed protector of Balkan Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Bulgaria. Sofia has no direct interest in war with
Belgrade, other than exaggerated worries that its nuclear power
station might be hit by accident if missiles start flying around.
What it has does have is a very real stake in Macedonia, which
Bulgarian nationalists have always considered an integral part of
Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   Their predatory interest is shared by the Serbs, who ruled
Macedonia in the 14th century and seized it back from Turkey _ to
the fury of the Bulgarians _ in the Balkan wars.
</P>
<P>
   So it is the collapse of Macedonia, rather than war in Serbia
and Kosovo, that is most likely to make the Balkan ``tinderbox''
theory a reality.
</P>
<P>
   Two countries in the region that are not likely to join any new
Balkan war are Romania and Greece. In Bucharest, there is a
principled opposition to the notion of outsiders interfering in a
sovereign state. But those worries are more than balanced out by a
strong commitment to joining the EU and NATO. So no opposition to
the West there.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Greeks, although they provided their Orthodox
brothers with a valued diplomatic lifeline when Belgrade was at war
in Bosnia, ties have cooled since then. Greek diplomats are
dismissing the chances of Athens being involved _ or even affected
_ by air strikes on Serbia. &QL;

 By ANNE MCELVOY  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Slobodan Milosevic has turned into a great dictator
with all the trademarks of one: madness, cruelty and longevity.
</P>
<P>
   He began his rise to power by exploiting Serbia's sentiments
about the sanctity of Kosovo and made a stepping stone of personal
ambition and dreams of territorial aggrandisement.
</P>
<P>
   When he ended Kosovo's autonomy in 1989, the Soviet Union was
still in existence and the shrill ravings of a Yugoslav nationalist
seemed to all but the most prescient an insubstantial threat.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the violence began in earnest in Croatia in 1991,
there was something faintly absurd about Serbia's leader.
</P>
<P>
   Early that year, I attended a dinner in Belgrade given by the
government. Milosevic looked and talked like a textbook Eastern
European Marxist-Leninist lecturer _ socially insecure, ham-fisted
but stubbornly bullish about his beliefs under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   When he tired of too much preprandial questioning about his
intentions, he announced sharply: ``Let's attack the soup.''
</P>
<P>
   I remember that this hawkishness, applied to the dinner, seemed
rather comical. Not so funny now, after Vukovar, Srebrenica and
Racak.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has outlasted Mikhail Gorbachev, George Bush, Margaret
Thatcher, Helmut Kohl and John Major. The endgame falls to Bill
Clinton and Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   When people complain that the aim of the NATO mission against
Serbia is unclear, they are wrong. There is one clear goal, without
which peace is impossible: to create a situation in which Milosevic
falls from power and the distorted, rapacious Serbia he has created
is humiliated.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Milosevic rouses himself from the nightmare of his own
making in the next few days, this is the course on which NATO will
embark: the most serious engagement in Europe since the Second
World War.
</P>
<P>
   There is no institutional or legal case for military action
against a sovereign power that has committed atrocities on its own
territory. We must rely on the more subjective assessments of
realpolitik and on the ethical imperative for reasons to act.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday in his Commons statement, Tony Blair entwined the two in
a proposition that can be summarized as: ``Not acting is more
dangerous than acting; and, anyway, it is right to intervene
because of the suffering imposed by Milosevic on Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   This is sound. But the mission is going to be a long and bloody
affair, its price and its outcome uncertain. The prime minister
will need to work harder in the weeks and months ahead to convince
people that Britain's involvement is justified.
</P>
<P>
   When he contemplated the post of prime minister, it is unlikely
that the consensual Blair imagined himself as a war leader. But
high office is unpredictable and this is what he may well be called
upon to become.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's role in Kosovo will be an even more difficult war to sell
than the last Gulf skirmish _ and that was far from being Blair's
most convincing piece of salesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Bombing the Serbs on behalf of Kosovo is as near as damn it to a
recognition of Kosovan independence.
</P>
<P>
   It may well be that in order to seal the strategic gains of a
bombing campaign, we will have to commit troops onto this territory
against the will of Milosevic _ indeed this is the outcome he
dreads, because it guarantees his disgrace and downfall. But its
political and human cost would be high.
</P>
<P>
   Given his strong commitment to European institutions, Blair was
a surprisingly reticent European when it came to laying out the
single binding reason why we are obliged to take in the risks of a
long conflict in Kosovo: it is a part of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative to Western intervention is to accept that the
Western ideals of basic human rights and freedom from persecution
by the state do not apply to Yugoslavia. I do not believe that
Europe should tolerate such ethical exclusion zones.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite argument of opponents of bombing is that since the
West is neither able nor willing to use force to tackle injustice
everywhere in the world, it should not do so in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But Europe is the point: the Continent's future is our future.
If we are not to fight a brutal aggressor after a delay similar to
that which allowed the carnage of Bosnia, where would we fight?
</P>
<P>
   One of the baleful consequences of the dominance of the single
currency in Western Europe's priorities has been the downgrading of
a wider sense of what it means to be a European, as bestowing some
basic values and duties of care for one another.
</P>
<P>
   Into this vacuum floods the kind of petty selfishness manifested
by the renowned Second World War historian Correlli Barnett in a
baffling and perverse newspaper article in which he compared the
prospect of NATO ground troops in Kosovo with an ``army of
occupation.''
</P>
<P>
   Technically , this may be a correct description. But Kosovo is
not the Sudetenland. The overwhelmingly Albanian population sees
NATO as a redeemer, not an invader.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett then worries about the risk of Kosovo distracting our
armed forces from some other pressing threat to British interests.
But what interest can be more pressing than peace in Europe?
</P>
<P>
   Much of the global-reach doctrine of our armed forces has
outlived its usefulness. Forging and maintaining the peace in
Europe and on its borders will be task enough for the next century.
</P>
<P>
   There is no such thing as a ``far-off corner of the Balkans'' in
a Europe that has a new NATO member in Hungary, bordering on Serbia
and in which refugees spill across open borders. The Iron Curtain
is no longer there to shield us from unpleasantness.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett and the rest of the new British isolationists might like
to cut Britain off from the security interests of Europe. But it is
neither possible nor desirable to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, a creeping ``I'm all right Jack''-ism is shared by
the sections of the left and right. They are intent on forming a
coalition of apathy and will fight for nothing and no one beyond
their own garden fence.
</P>
<P>
   It is to these latter-day appeasers that Prime Minister Tony
Blair needs to address himself more forcefully if he is to become a
great statesman, as well as great politician. &QL;

   LONDON _ Kosovo was where the 20th century's final cycle of
Balkan wars began. Now Kosovo is where they will end; not with a
peace agreement but, surely now, with the first attack by NATO in
its 50-year history on a sovereign state _ and, if the worst comes
to the very worst, with the first major European land war since
1945.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, as Serb forces continued to sack Albanian
villages, the final realistic chance of averting allied airstrikes
against Yugoslav targets vanished as first President Slobodan
Milosevic, and then the Serbian parliament which he controls,
rejected demands for a cease-fire and the deployment of a NATO-led
international peacekeeping force in the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   In dramatic further confirmation that war may be at hand,
Yevgeny Primakov, the Russian prime minister, dramatically
cancelled a visit to the U.S. which was due to start Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The onslaught, which the White House said would be ``swift and
substantial,'' could be unleashed as soon as early today
(Wednesday).
</P>
<P>
   In a grim interview as he left Belgrade for Brussels to report
back to NATO, the U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke made no bones of the
failure of his last-ditch mission. The circumstances, he declared,
were ``the bleakest'' he had known in his experience of negotiating
in the Balkans..
</P>
<P>
   That experience began in 1995, when Holbrooke took the Bosnia
crisis in hand, browbeat Milosevic and the other protagonists to
the conference table in Dayton, Ohio, and secured a peace which has
turned Bosnia into a virtual NATO protectorate.
</P>
<P>
   Alas Kosovo was omitted then. Four years later it has turned
into perhaps the gravest Balkan conflict of all.
</P>
<P>
   His talks had been a ``watershed moment,'' after nearly a year
of unavailing Western efforts to broker a settlement between ethnic
Albanians and Serbs, culminating in proposals put to last month's
Rambouillet conference which Belgrade refused to sign.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav president didn't want even to discuss either the
cease-fire or the foreign peacekeeping force, and ``fully
understood'' the consequences of that refusal, Holbrooke added. In
other words, the time for talking has run out.
</P>
<P>
   That, too, was the unvarnished message from Western capitals. In
the House of Commons the British prime minister, Tony Blair, warned
that 65,000 more Kosovars had been driven from their homes by the
latest Serb offensive.
</P>
<P>
   The West had made a solemn promise to the ethnic Albanians, and
would not permit a new humanitarian disaster in Kosovo. Nor would
it tolerate further repression by Belgrade that would probably drag
Albania, Macedonia and Bosnia _ and perhaps Greece and Turkey too _
into ``disintegration, chaos and disorder on the doorstep of the
European Union.''
</P>
<P>
   Later the prime minister even more plainly donned the mantle of
commander-in-chief, addressing ``those British pilots who may be
called into action, their families...all those people who are part
of the armed forces... I would not ask them to undertake this if I
did not believe it was necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington the mood was equally somber as Congressional
leaders of both parties rallied behind President Bill Clinton's
call for support for military action.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the well-aired misgivings of some senior U.S.
politicians, the sense was that airstrikes were all but inevitable
_ that even the master of brinkmanship Milosevic had finally passed
the point of no return.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground as well all seemed set for war. As Yugoslav and
Serb forces continued the offensive of recent days in the Drenica
valley north of Kosovo _ a strategy which had prompted some
speculation the Yugoslav president was staking out the ground for a
partition of the province _ an ominous calm descended on the
capital, Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   After a spate of bombings, Serb police rampages, and tit-for-tat
killings in the last few days, the city was deathly quiet. The main
market and schools were shut, and the traffic was a trickle.
</P>
<P>
   Tightening the vice, the Yugoslav authorities also closed the
southern border, thus preventing Albanians fleeing to safety in
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The real question Tuesday night was when the air attacks might
start. Faced with the fresh tide of refugees and Milosevic's almost
mocking intransigence, earlier waverers in the alliance like Italy,
Germany and Greece seem to have thrown their weight, however
reluctantly, behind airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is now united and prepared to carry out its warning,''
President Clinton said. ``If President Milosevic is not willing to
make peace, we are willing to limit his ability to make war.''
</P>
<P>
   The threat has been heard a dozen times; this time however it
rang true _ perhaps explaining why the Yugoslav leader Tuesday
sacked his army's security chief.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts saw the step as continuation of a purge of senior
officers opposed to a confrontation with the West which could cost
the country much precious military hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night the main political factor staying NATO's hand
disappeared when Primakov, leader of the country which is
Belgrade's staunchest ally and categorically opposed to NATO
airstrikes, called off his visit to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   To have launched them at the very moment Primakov was in the
Oval Office would have been an insult which even the present
wretched state of America's relations with its former superpower
rival would hardly justify.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, however, military preparations are virtually
complete. The hope now is that one crushing blow against key
military installations _ starting probably with Cruise missile
attacks against air defense and communications sites _ will suffice
to convince President Milosevic to change his mind and accept the
international peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   If not, matters could quickly escalate, even to the point where
a NATO ground invasion _ something the allies have vowed they will
never do _ was the only option left.
</P>
<P>
   That is a nightmare scenario which no NATO leader has yet
publicly confronted, but was implicit in the warning of one NATO
defense minister visiting London Tuesday, ``Kosovo is not Bosnia.
It needs a political solution; a military solution does not
exist.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, that solution will be up to Milosevic. In 1987,
as an ambitious younger member of the Serbian Communist party's
central committee, he went to Kosovo, the spiritual cradle of
Serbia, and made the speech that launched today's Serbian
nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later he stripped Kosovo, and the 90 percent ethnic
Albanian majority of its population, of its autonomy _ the autonomy
he refuses to return today.
</P>
<P>
   By then Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia had read the Serb writing
on the wall, and, in wars greater and smaller, left Yugoslavia. But
Kosovo, where it all started, remained a tightly controlled part of
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the last Balkan war, Serbia may lose even its heart. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Just a few miles away from the place where I write this, a small
coastal town in the Indonesian part of Borneo, human beings are
doing unimaginable things to one another in the jungle.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of ethnic Madurese have been burned out of their homes
and scores murdered, and the burning and the killings are
continuing. In the past three days armed warriors have paraded
through their villages carrying severed ears, arms and heads.
</P>
<P>
   The motive is pure racial hatred. The police and army are
impotent or indifferent. And the same kind of communal violence,
for different reasons and by different means, is happening all over
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago I was in the Spice Islands where Christians and
Muslims are locked into their own murderous battle of religion, a
tropical Northern Ireland in the making.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the archipelago, three of Indonesia's 27 provinces
have declared their independence _ one of them, East Timor, is
almost certain to break away from the republic in the next year.
</P>
<P>
   In Jakarta, demonstrations against the government are gathering
momentum in the approach to June's elections _ during the last big
demonstration, in November, 13 people were shot dead.
</P>
<P>
   To Europeans, all this should have a disturbingly familiar ring
_ a large state, ethnically and religiously diverse, which throws
off a corrupt dictatorship, only to find itself stricken by
communal violence.
</P>
<P>
   Is the world's fourth largest country breaking up? Will
Indonesia become an Equatorial Yugoslavia?
</P>
<P>
   It is an urgent question because the consequences of instability
here would be serious. Indonesia's 13,000 islands occupy the
crossroads of Asia, an area of profound strategic, political and
environmental importance to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   A substantial part of the world's oil passes through the
country's territorial waters _ prolonged disruption to shipping in
the Straits of Malacca, for instance, would seriously affect the
economies of both Japan and China.
</P>
<P>
   And Indonesia's sprawling expanse makes it a neighbor to the
whole region. The prospect of an exodus of refugees from a
population of 210 million causes alarm from Canberra to Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
   This is why foreign governments gave such enthusiastic and
unquestioning support to President Suharto, the man who bears the
greatest responsibility for Indonesia's present turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   For 32 years, he ruled a country which, from the outside,
appeared to be a model of Third-World development. GDP soared,
population growth was slowed, poverty was reduced and illiteracy
was virtually eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   His predecessor, Sukarno, had been an unpredictable demagogue
who flirted with communism and fought a low-intensity war with
Malaysia. No wonder the countries of the west, Britain among them,
were so willing to supply him with arms and to turn a blind eye to
the brutal annexation of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knew that Suharto's rule was based upon fear; the more
astute could see that the benefits of Indonesia's success were
disproportionately concentrated in Suharto's home, the main island
of Java.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, however, he seemed to have succeeded in bringing
about permanent stability. Only in the last two years it has become
obvious what an illusion that was.
</P>
<P>
   As a nation state, Indonesia was always an unlikely proposition
_ the only thing that its diverse people had in common was their
colonial history as the former Dutch East Indies.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than eliminating ethnic and religious difference, Suharto
froze them, forcing unity and stifling dissent with a repressive
military apparatus. Last May the thaw set in, and in the last 10
months the old enmities have emerged pristinely from the ice.
</P>
<P>
   This is the best way of understanding the grisly diversity of
violence presently on display in Indonesia. The hanging of
traditional sorcerers in East Java, and the beheading of Madurese
settlers in Borneo have nothing in common in terms of direct
motivation.
</P>
<P>
   But both are symptoms of the same sickness _ a combination of
economic distress and the breakdown of law and order, among
populations which have no other means of expressing a deep sense of
injustice and pent-up frustration.
</P>
<P>
   But there are huge differences as well as similarities, and for
several reasons the Balkans experience is unlikely to repeat itself
here. The most basic of these is Indonesia's size, a source of
passive strength as well as vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   In Yugoslavia, two religions and a handful of ethnic groups
battle for a geographically and historically uniform region _ they
are fighting for what they have in common.
</P>
<P>
   But Indonesians are as diverse as any people in the world. To an
ethnically Chinese Christian yuppy in Jakarta, the independence
struggles of animist tribesmen in Irian Jaya are almost as alien as
they are to the inhabitants of London or New York. However
concentrated power may be in Java, no single ethnic or religious
group is powerful enough to threaten the whole.
</P>
<P>
   For all their frustration with their central government,
Indonesia's provinces have much to lose from breaking away. East
Timor is misleading in this respect for in every way it is an
exception.
</P>
<P>
   As a former Portuguese colony, it was never part of the Dutch
empire and played no part in the Indonesian war of independence.
Despite its passive capitulation, the U.N. never recognized
Jakarta's annexation.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's announcement that it is prepared to give it
independence came as a result of international pressure, and a
brilliantly effective campaign by NGOs and East Timorese exiles.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor's struggle has been one of principle, but in the rest
of the archipelago dissatisfaction has its roots in practical
matters.
</P>
<P>
   In Borneo, Aceh and Irian Jaya, big corporations have made
fortunes in timber, oil and copper with negligible benefit to the
population at large. Resentment for this exploitation has laid the
ground for independence movements and outbreaks of violence. But
what people want is not sovereignty so much as justice.
</P>
<P>
   All now depends on the outcome of general elections to be held
in June _ the closest Indonesia has come to real democracy since
1955.
</P>
<P>
   A decisive victory for a popular and visionary president could
halt the paralysis which the country is experiencing under
Suharto's unpopular successor and appointee, B.J. Habibie. But with
48 parties competing and no clear favorite among a handful of
front-runners, such a clean result is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of sudden anarchy or civil war, Indonesia faces decades
of uncertainty, a directionless drift back into the Third World. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Just a few miles away from the place where I write this, a small
coastal town in the Indonesian part of Borneo, human beings are
doing unimaginable things to one another in the jungle.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of ethnic Madurese have been burned out of their homes
and scores murdered, and the burning and the killings are
continuing. In the past three days armed warriors have paraded
through their villages carrying severed ears, arms and heads.
</P>
<P>
   The motive is pure racial hatred. The police and army are
impotent or indifferent. And the same kind of communal violence,
for different reasons and by different means, is happening all over
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago I was in the Spice Islands where Christians and
Muslims are locked into their own murderous battle of religion, a
tropical Northern Ireland in the making.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the archipelago, three of Indonesia's 27 provinces
have declared their independence _ one of them, East Timor, is
almost certain to break away from the republic in the next year.
</P>
<P>
   In Jakarta, demonstrations against the government are gathering
momentum in the approach to June's elections _ during the last big
demonstration, in November, 13 people were shot dead.
</P>
<P>
   To Europeans, all this should have a disturbingly familiar ring
_ a large state, ethnically and religiously diverse, which throws
off a corrupt dictatorship, only to find itself stricken by
communal violence.
</P>
<P>
   Is the world's fourth largest country breaking up? Will
Indonesia become an Equatorial Yugoslavia?
</P>
<P>
   It is an urgent question because the consequences of instability
here would be serious. Indonesia's 13,000 islands occupy the
crossroads of Asia, an area of profound strategic, political and
environmental importance to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   A substantial part of the world's oil passes through the
country's territorial waters _ prolonged disruption to shipping in
the Straits of Malacca, for instance, would seriously affect the
economies of both Japan and China.
</P>
<P>
   And Indonesia's sprawling expanse makes it a neighbor to the
whole region. The prospect of an exodus of refugees from a
population of 210 million causes alarm from Canberra to Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
   This is why foreign governments gave such enthusiastic and
unquestioning support to President Suharto, the man who bears the
greatest responsibility for Indonesia's present turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   For 32 years, he ruled a country which, from the outside,
appeared to be a model of Third-World development. GDP soared,
population growth was slowed, poverty was reduced and illiteracy
was virtually eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   His predecessor, Sukarno, had been an unpredictable demagogue
who flirted with communism and fought a low-intensity war with
Malaysia. No wonder the countries of the west, Britain among them,
were so willing to supply him with arms and to turn a blind eye to
the brutal annexation of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knew that Suharto's rule was based upon fear; the more
astute could see that the benefits of Indonesia's success were
disproportionately concentrated in Suharto's home, the main island
of Java.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, however, he seemed to have succeeded in bringing
about permanent stability. Only in the last two years it has become
obvious what an illusion that was.
</P>
<P>
   As a nation state, Indonesia was always an unlikely proposition
_ the only thing that its diverse people had in common was their
colonial history as the former Dutch East Indies.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than eliminating ethnic and religious difference, Suharto
froze them, forcing unity and stifling dissent with a repressive
military apparatus. Last May the thaw set in, and in the last 10
months the old enmities have emerged pristinely from the ice.
</P>
<P>
   This is the best way of understanding the grisly diversity of
violence presently on display in Indonesia. The hanging of
traditional sorcerers in East Java, and the beheading of Madurese
settlers in Borneo have nothing in common in terms of direct
motivation.
</P>
<P>
   But both are symptoms of the same sickness _ a combination of
economic distress and the breakdown of law and order, among
populations which have no other means of expressing a deep sense of
injustice and pent-up frustration.
</P>
<P>
   But there are huge differences as well as similarities, and for
several reasons the Balkans experience is unlikely to repeat itself
here. The most basic of these is Indonesia's size, a source of
passive strength as well as vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   In Yugoslavia, two religions and a handful of ethnic groups
battle for a geographically and historically uniform region _ they
are fighting for what they have in common.
</P>
<P>
   But Indonesians are as diverse as any people in the world. To an
ethnically Chinese Christian yuppy in Jakarta, the independence
struggles of animist tribesmen in Irian Jaya are almost as alien as
they are to the inhabitants of London or New York. However
concentrated power may be in Java, no single ethnic or religious
group is powerful enough to threaten the whole.
</P>
<P>
   For all their frustration with their central government,
Indonesia's provinces have much to lose from breaking away. East
Timor is misleading in this respect for in every way it is an
exception.
</P>
<P>
   As a former Portuguese colony, it was never part of the Dutch
empire and played no part in the Indonesian war of independence.
Despite its passive capitulation, the U.N. never recognized
Jakarta's annexation.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's announcement that it is prepared to give it
independence came as a result of international pressure, and a
brilliantly effective campaign by NGOs and East Timorese exiles.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor's struggle has been one of principle, but in the rest
of the archipelago dissatisfaction has its roots in practical
matters.
</P>
<P>
   In Borneo, Aceh and Irian Jaya, big corporations have made
fortunes in timber, oil and copper with negligible benefit to the
population at large. Resentment for this exploitation has laid the
ground for independence movements and outbreaks of violence. But
what people want is not sovereignty so much as justice.
</P>
<P>
   All now depends on the outcome of general elections to be held
in June _ the closest Indonesia has come to real democracy since
1955.
</P>
<P>
   A decisive victory for a popular and visionary president could
halt the paralysis which the country is experiencing under
Suharto's unpopular successor and appointee, B.J. Habibie. But with
48 parties competing and no clear favorite among a handful of
front-runners, such a clean result is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of sudden anarchy or civil war, Indonesia faces decades
of uncertainty, a directionless drift back into the Third World. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   War is never easy, and all the high technology in the world will
never make it so.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's new military toughness in Yugoslavia constitutes a deadly
gamble with many lives, and may become painful and unpopular. But
it remains necessary, in spite of all the final reservations that
accompany the fateful step of attacking a fellow sovereign state in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Our first instinct is to welcome military action against a
regime that has systematically attacked the rights of the people of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   This century has witnessed too many betrayals of small and
defenseless peoples in Europe, and it is to be hoped that the
action in Kosovo marks an end to that sad and shameful record.
</P>
<P>
   It is President Slobodan Milosevic who has forced the
predominantly Albanian population of that province into desperate
resistance. His government has denied them legitimate cultural
expression and legislative autonomy, discriminated against the
Albanian language and most Kosovars' Muslim faith, and finally
adopted the same techniques of ``ethnic cleansing'' that he
mobilized in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   For years we forced our troops in the Balkans to scuttle around
in armored personnel carriers, dealing out charity rather than
tackling the root cause of conflict: Serb aggression. Now that
humiliation may be over.
</P>
<P>
   But we must go further than emotional spasm. NATO's actions are
not the end of the struggle with Milosevic. In fact, they herald a
new level of conflict with this tough and cunning operator whose
capacity to trick, delay and dissemble will not be ended by
military action alone.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary: military action raises the stakes, creating new
situations for the Belgrade strongman to exploit, and forcing the
Western allies to concentrate every step of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Only a strategy for the whole course of this new and more
intense confrontation can hope to isolate and contain such
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   There is a need for such clear thinking over every aspect of
this new and dangerous conflagration. Having escalated the crisis,
we must face the consequences, building strategies for dealing with
the results of our actions.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomacy must remain to the fore, for in this field NATO's
position is far from secure. Russia and China oppose military
action, a stance Serbia will attempt to take advantage of. Without
unanimous international support or U.N. authorization, NATO must
not give the impression of go-it-alone warmongering.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomatic situation may get worse, as the conflict could
spread to Macedonia, Albania, and beyond. The political and
military groundwork must be laid to deal with that eventuality.
That means extra troops if necessary, and security agreements with
countries who share a border with Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   But there are technical and operational problems on a similar
scale. Serbia is no Iraq. With well-equipped air defenses and a
trained, tested and committed army, she will be no military
pushover.
</P>
<P>
   The lives of NATO personnel may be lost, perhaps in large
numbers. Alliance troops are strung out across Bosnia and
Macedonia, and will need protecting. For that there must be a plan,
for ultimate extraction or deeper and more forceful involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Provision must be made for refugees streaming across the border
into Macedonia and northern Greece. Once war is launched, there can
be no half-measures.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no quick or bloodless victory; in the Balkans,
there never are any simple solutions. But Milosevic has torn up
every agreement he has made in the last six months, and his ability
to defy sense and diplomacy must now be brought to an end.
</P>
<P>
   NATO should stand firm for the stark principles that necessitate
action. The credibility of the Western alliance, the Kosovar right
to self-determination and democracy, and the security of Europe
itself are at stake. &QL;

 By PHIL REEVES  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The first NATO bomb to crater Yugoslav soil will stand
in history as the moment when Russia realized exactly how far it
has fallen since the days it stood astride the planet as a
superpower capable of counterbalancing American might.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's refusal to listen to Moscow's pleas to spare its
Slavic cousins in Serbia marks a new low in an increasingly
ambivalent relationship with the United States, in which Russia _
to its horror _ finds itself cast not so much an enemy as a
sponging lightweight.
</P>
<P>
   The warmth of the early post-Soviet era faded long ago, but
Kosovo has turned Russian reservations about the West _ and, in
particular, the supremacy of NATO _ into concrete resentment, shot
through with deep suspicion which is likely to influence policy for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday in Moscow outrage echoed across the political
spectrum, moderated only by the humiliating recognition that Russia
must turn again to the West for loans.
</P>
<P>
   After eleventh-hour calls to U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Jacques Chirac of France, Boris Yeltsin appeared on national TV to
appeal to Nato to stay its hand. He spoke ominously of the world
facing ``a war in Europe and possibly something greater.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the White House, Clinton's message was: ``We should
not allow a dispute on a single issue to derail the important work
we're doing on a wide variety of issues.'' Those issues include
nuclear weapons reduction, and peacekeeping in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Foreign Minister, Igor Ivanov, dropped hints about
arming the Serbs _ arguing that a NATO attack could render the U.N.
arms embargo null and void (although the Kremlin distanced itself
from these).
</P>
<P>
   Marshal Igor Sergeyev, Russia's Defense Minister, even talked
about Yugoslavia becoming a ``second Vietnam,'' as the he placed
the armed forces on a state of ``higher alert.''
</P>
<P>
   From the newly ascendant Communists, there were calls for
Russian military assistance; from the nationalists, blusters about
restoring a Stalinist dictatorship so that Russia should not be so
humiliated again.
</P>
<P>
   The mood is one of deep grievance, and it is not without cause.
This week Clinton was to meet the Russian premier Yevgeny Primakov,
but the latter's plane _ in a pure piece of Cold War theatre _
turned around over the Atlantic on Tuesday after he concluded NATO
bombing was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Beforehand, the American president made a speech about the need
for ``the right kind'' of relationship with the Russians, who could
be ``great partners.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is not much evidence he is willing to back his words
with actions. These days Washington mixes hardball, with a strategy
of ignoring Moscow altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Russian protests over the Anglo-American bombing of Iraq fell on
deaf ears, a response which undermined its treasured status as a
permanent member of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has been hectored by the U.S. _ including having
sanctions slapped on research institutes _ over weapons technology
transfers to Iran. And the International Monetary Fund has lectured
them tirelessly over how to run a market economy after last
August's crash _ this, despite the fact that the fund was partly to
blame.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's policy is perhaps based on the reality that
Russia's economy has shrunk to the size of Belgium's. But Moscow's
legacy of 30,000 nuclear warheads, its lake of chemical weapons,
and a time-tested ability to currying favor with the planet's
pariahs cannot be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton recognized as much in his speech. He would like
Russia's 40,000 nuclear scientists to do ``peaceful, good things
and not bartering their services to other countries to cause
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   A fine sentiment, but one which will not be furthered by NATO
bombing runs in Yugoslavia. &QL;

   MOSCOW _ The first NATO bomb to crater Yugoslav soil will stand
in history as the moment when Russia realized exactly how far it
has fallen since the days it stood astride the planet as a
superpower capable of counterbalancing American might.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's refusal to listen to Moscow's pleas to spare its
Slavic cousins in Serbia marks a new low in an increasingly
ambivalent relationship with the United States, in which Russia _
to its horror _ finds itself cast not so much an enemy as a
sponging lightweight.
</P>
<P>
   The warmth of the early post-Soviet era faded long ago, but
Kosovo has turned Russian reservations about the West _ and, in
particular, the supremacy of NATO _ into concrete resentment, shot
through with deep suspicion which is likely to influence policy for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday in Moscow outrage echoed across the political
spectrum, moderated only by the humiliating recognition that Russia
must turn again to the West for loans.
</P>
<P>
   After eleventh-hour calls to U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Jacques Chirac of France, Boris Yeltsin appeared on national TV to
appeal to Nato to stay its hand. He spoke ominously of the world
facing ``a war in Europe and possibly something greater.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the White House, Clinton's message was: ``We should
not allow a dispute on a single issue to derail the important work
we're doing on a wide variety of issues.'' Those issues include
nuclear weapons reduction, and peacekeeping in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Foreign Minister, Igor Ivanov, dropped hints about
arming the Serbs _ arguing that a NATO attack could render the U.N.
arms embargo null and void (although the Kremlin distanced itself
from these).
</P>
<P>
   Marshal Igor Sergeyev, Russia's Defense Minister, even talked
about Yugoslavia becoming a ``second Vietnam,'' as the he placed
the armed forces on a state of ``higher alert.''
</P>
<P>
   From the newly ascendant Communists, there were calls for
Russian military assistance; from the nationalists, blusters about
restoring a Stalinist dictatorship so that Russia should not be so
humiliated again.
</P>
<P>
   The mood is one of deep grievance, and it is not without cause.
This week Clinton was to meet the Russian premier Yevgeny Primakov,
but the latter's plane _ in a pure piece of Cold War theatre _
turned around over the Atlantic on Tuesday after he concluded NATO
bombing was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Beforehand, the American president made a speech about the need
for ``the right kind'' of relationship with the Russians, who could
be ``great partners.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is not much evidence he is willing to back his words
with actions. These days Washington mixes hardball, with a strategy
of ignoring Moscow altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Russian protests over the Anglo-American bombing of Iraq fell on
deaf ears, a response which undermined its treasured status as a
permanent member of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has been hectored by the U.S. _ including having
sanctions slapped on research institutes _ over weapons technology
transfers to Iran. And the International Monetary Fund has lectured
them tirelessly over how to run a market economy after last
August's crash _ this, despite the fact that the fund was partly to
blame.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's policy is perhaps based on the reality that
Russia's economy has shrunk to the size of Belgium's. But Moscow's
legacy of 30,000 nuclear warheads, its lake of chemical weapons,
and a time-tested ability to currying favor with the planet's
pariahs cannot be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton recognized as much in his speech. He would like
Russia's 40,000 nuclear scientists to do ``peaceful, good things
and not bartering their services to other countries to cause
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   A fine sentiment, but one which will not be furthered by NATO
bombing runs in Yugoslavia. &QL;

   LONDON _ In the late 1960s two ultra-bright boys from Little
Rock went to Oxford as Rhodes scholars. One was a straight arrow
who worked hard, took his degree, and left early in order to serve
in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The other, famously, didn't inhale, didn't get a degree and
didn't get drafted and is now President of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That first Arkansan is called Wesley Clark. At 54, he is two
years older than Bill Clinton, his commander-in-chief. More to the
point, he is a four-star general in the U.S. Army and as NATO's top
uniformed officer, the man who right now is giving the orders for
the bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Wes Clark, ``The Boss'' to his deferring aides, is that uniquely
American creature, the political soldier.
</P>
<P>
   A British general will have as little as possible to do with the
``political wallahs.'' But since that stint in Vietnam, where he
was wounded and awarded the Silver Star, Clark's subsequent rise
owes as much to his skills at dealing with the politics of defense
as his ability as a soldier and military organizer.
</P>
<P>
   On his return from Vietnam, he went to work in the White House
under Alexander Haig, Nixon's chief of Staff, and future NATO
Supreme Commander and Secretary of State _ another in the line of
modern politician-soldiers who include Dwight Eisenhower and Colin
Powell.
</P>
<P>
   Clark and Clinton's have white-grey hair in common, but very
little else. Where Clinton tends to sloppiness and verbosity, he is
disciplined and weighs every word.
</P>
<P>
   The President is a Southern Baptist through and through, while
Clark converted to Catholicism. And his private life truly is
private.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Balkans brought them together, the two Arkansans'
paths had barely crossed. But as Bosnia became an increasing U.S.
diplomatic priority, Clark emerged as a key Presidential adviser on
the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Later, along with Chris Hill, be was Richard Holbrooke's closest
aide during the 1995 Dayton conference.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to those talks, and several recent missions to Belgrade
to try and sort out the Kosovo crisis, he knows his foe Slobodan
Milosevic uncommonly well. But like everyone else, he has failed to
sway the Yugoslav president with words.
</P>
<P>
   He must now do it by war _ and in the process remember enough of
the tragedy of Vietnam to keep NATO out of a similarly disastrous
entanglement in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   If he does, the ladder may stretch higher still for Wes Clark.
The logical military promotion, to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, is
probably out, since the Army has filled the job twice in
succession.
</P>
<P>
   But there are political possibilities too: as National Security
Adviser or, who knows, even Secretary of State in a future
administration, be it Republican or Democrat. &QL;

   PARIS _ Slobodan Milosevic has again forced intermediaries to
extend the deadline for agreement on autonomy for Kosovo. This
adjournment poses more urgently than ever the question of
protection of civilian populations.
</P>
<P>
   Civilians have been forgotten in the negotiation process. Their
fate is being left exclusively to humanitarian aid organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The plight of Kosovo's civilians worsens by the hour as the
fighting between Serbs and the Kosovo Liberation Army escalates.
Once again, entire families are being forced to flee their
villages.
</P>
<P>
   Mobile clinics operated by Medecins du Monde in four
municipalities are assisting thousands of displaced persons, many
of them destitute, terrorized and exhausted after trekking for
several days without sustenance.
</P>
<P>
   These newly displaced persons join other thousands already in
the four towns, which were partly destroyed during Serbian
offensives last year.
</P>
<P>
   A study of the four zones by Medecins du Monde found that close
to 7,000 homes were destroyed. Yet 30,000 refugees were on hand
last month before the current influx.
</P>
<P>
   The health and food situation is extremely precarious. As many
as 50 men, women and children can be found sharing a single room.
They take turns sleeping and keeping warm.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the new arrivals say they had to leave elderly people or
invalids behind in their home villages. Some families have
abandoned their homes for the second or third time.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the displaced children are unable to attend school
because the schools are already overcrowded. Many show signs of
extreme anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty with which these people are confronted, as they
constantly fear a new attack, aggravates the general deterioration
of health.
</P>
<P>
   Medecins du Monde is trying as best it can to protect these
people. As a humanitarian organization, it cannot interfere in the
fighting or prevent the flow of displaced persons. It can only
provide health care and food, and let these refugees know that they
have not been completely forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   The civilians of Kosovo should not have to pay the price for the
slow pace of negotiations and the power struggle between Milosevic
and the international community.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a case of a disembodied diplomatic negotiation. The
lives of many thousands of people are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Every day that passes without a political resolution results in
more displaced persons and heightens the humanitarian emergency in
Kosovo. &QL;

   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The New Jersey Nets thought they had
momentum. They had won two straight home games, routed a hot
Toronto club and, in getting way ahead of themselves, begun
thinking playoffs. But the Detroit Pistons _ a mediocre, slumping
team that had lost its last four road games _ came into Continental
Arena on Wednesday night and proved that nothing had changed for
the Nets. Appearing unstoppable on offense and impenetrable on
defense, Detroit drilled the Nets by 84-71 before a crowd of
16,896.

   The 13-point gap was misleading. This one lost all competitive
value after the Pistons held New Jersey to 29 first-half points in
taking a 17-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   The deficit was 26 less than five minutes into the third
quarter, and the Nets, whose futility seemingly has no end, were
threatening to set franchise lows.
</P>
<P>
   But after going 11 minutes 45 seconds, spanning the third and
fourth quarters, without a basket, the Nets saved face with a late
charge that cut the final margin and kept them out of the annals.
At least most of them. As it was, the Nets tied a franchise mark
for fewest field goals in a game with 23, just four more than the
league's low.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of knocked the wind out of us,'' Kerry Kittles said.
``When we came out at the beginning, we were just playing in a
funk. They came out aggressively, played hard, and we didn't
respond. We got so far behind so quickly that it was tough to come
back. This season has been frustrating all around the table.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, who are 2-4 under their interim coach, Don Casey, and
5-21 over all, thought they were beginning to turn it around. After
overpowering Toronto by 106-87 on Monday to end the Raptors'
five-game winning streak, Jayson Williams talked as if the Nets
were still in the post-season picture. And many of his teammates
knew they were only eight and a half games out of the eighth and
final Eastern Conference playoff spot, leaving them a mathematical
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   But though such aspirations would seem to incite energy and
fire, the Pistons (15-12) were the only ones exuding intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They defended us strongly, physically,'' Casey said. ``I won't
say intimidated, but they were initiating and we were reacting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, who were led by Keith Van Horn's 27 points, were
manhandled so fiercely that their 31.9 percent shooting was low
even by New Jersey standards. And while the Nets spoke proudly
afterward about holding Detroit to 84 points, the truth is that the
Piston offense was clicking on all cylinders.
</P>
<P>
   With five players scoring in double figures _ led by Bison
Dele's 18 points and Jerry Stackhouse's 17 _ Detroit shot 50.7
percent. The Pistons attempted 3 fewer field goals than the Nets
but made 12 more.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, who made just nine first-half shots, played offense
that was hard on the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   If they weren't battering the rim while missing open jump shots,
they were losing the ball in creative ways.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Kittles drove for a layup on the right side against
Stackhouse only to have the high-flying Piston swat his attempt;
then, in adding insult to infamy, he knocked the ball away from
Kittles and out of bounds: Detroit basketball. Moments later,
Kendall Gill nullified another open-court opportunity by charging
uncontrollably into a stationary Pistons.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, as the Nets exited for intermission, the fans
began booing loudly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand the fans being upset,'' Casey said. ``They
truly want to jump on the wagon and get things rolling. But there's
no easy way out.'' &QL;

SUNS BEAT LAKERS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ And so, 6,795 miles later, the Los Angeles
Lakers docked once again in a safe harbor, no worse and no better
for the wear after a road trip that netted as many wins as losses.
</P>
<P>
   The smoggy skies over crowded highways never looked better. The
Forum never felt more friendly. But the comforts of home were
deceiving. And the one day off maybe wasn't enough. Or maybe the
Lakers could have used an extra practice after all.
</P>
<P>
   Looking every bit the jet-lagged bunch they were, the Lakers
spotted the Phoenix Suns a 14-point lead in the first quarter
Wednesday night before finally unpacking their game faces. But by
late in the game, the Lakers were again playing like a team with
its head in three time zones.
</P>
<P>
   The final result, a 106-101 loss to the Phoenix Suns. Home
seemed less attractive after the Suns had snapped the Lakers' Forum
winning streak at nine games and dealt them their first loss with
Dennis Rodman in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant scored 24 and 25 points
respectively, but O'Neal missed 11 of 20 shots.
</P>
<P>
   By the ugly conclusion of an ugly game, the Forum crowd had
turned downright nasty, sarcastically chanting ``Ed-die'' upon
watching a Glen Rice air ball fly two feet short of the basket in
the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   After playing six games in six cities in nine days, the Lakers
certainly had a plausible case for the loss. It was exactly what
their resident sage, longtime assistant Bill Bertka, had warned
them about earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bertka made a great point at shootaround this morning,'' Kobe
Bryant said. ``He said you notice after a long road trip a team
comes home and has a tendency to kind of slack off, and there's a
good chance for the (visiting) team to sneak out a win. And he's
also seen teams come home and just totally kick a team's butt
because they're happy to be home.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers showed a bit of both.
</P>
<P>
   Combining careless turnovers with rushed shots, the Lakers
watched the Suns take a 16-4 lead. But as they proved Sunday at
Orlando, the Lakers can make such ugliness disappear rather
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   With an unconventional lineup of J.R. Reid at center, Dennis
Rodman and Rick Fox at forward and Derek Fisher and Bryant in the
backcourt, the Lakers started an 18-6 run that cut the gap to 24-22
by the end of the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The starters returned for the second quarter and O'Neal quickly
went to work, giving the Lakers their first lead four minutes into
the period with eight quick points. The Lakers built as much as an
eight-point cushion before settling for a 54-49 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Then things got nasty.
</P>
<P>
   With the Lakers leading 75-69, Fox tossed Gerald Brown to the
hardwood to stop a fast-break layup in progress. Brown leaped to
his feet and was met by an inexplicable shove from an intervening
Rodman. Tom Gugliotta and a handful of others jumped in for a quick
scrum at the baseline.
</P>
<P>
   Fox got a flagrant foul, Brown and Rodman got a double-technical
and when it was all over Brown had made two free throws, and the
Suns, retaining possession, got Clifford Robinson to the line for
another pair of foul shots.
</P>
<P>
   The margin was suddenly an iffy 75-73, and the Suns used the
momentum to mount a 14-2 run to close out the quarter and take an
83-77 lead to head into the final period.
</P>
<P>
   Before tipoff, coach Kurt Rambis was hopeful the Lakers' recent
defensive resurgence, in the second half at Orlando and in Dallas,
would return home to L.A. with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely feels good to be back, but it's not gonna solve
all of our issues,'' he said. ``We still have to build upon the
advances we made in the last game and a half.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they took two steps back.

BACK IN '89, RICE'S RECORD RUN COOKED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ It was a singular stretch of time in the
life of a basketball player whose most exceptional days, he hopes,
are still ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   Long before Glen Rice joined Jerry Buss' flock, the latest
convert in the Los Angeles Lakers' start-and-stop pilgrimage to the
NBA's Mecca, Rice was the shepherd who guided Michigan to college
basketball's most hallowed shrine.
</P>
<P>
   The 1989 NCAA Division I Tournament was Rice's oracle. From the
Kingdome in Seattle he evoked on high the name of a certain
Princeton god. No one had scored more points in a single tournament
than Bill Bradley's 177 in 1965 until a resplendent Rice recorded
184 to lead the Wolverines to an improbable overtime win over Seton
Hall in the title game.
</P>
<P>
   This year's tournament, like the one in 1989, features Duke, two
Big Ten teams and a Big East entry. Whomever commands the spotlight
this weekend _ Connecticut's Richard Hamilton, maybe, or Duke's
Chris Carrawell; Ohio State's Michael Redd, perhaps, or Michigan
State's Antonio Smith _ he'll be hard-pressed to make people forget
Rice.
</P>
<P>
   And 15-minute Rice, he was not. Ten years later the newest
Lakers forward remains very much in fame's groove, continuing to
confound defenders with the quickest release this side of Phoenix's
Rex Chapman. It's enough to make you wonder; is that an arm under
his sweatsuit sleeve or a slingshot?
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have a regular stroke, it's mostly just wrist and
elbow,'' said Lakers teammate Robert Horry, who was a freshman at
Alabama in 1989. ``The way he shoots it, you don't know if he's
passing it or shooting it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tide that year was in the same tournament bracket as
Michigan and Horry remembers relishing the prospect of playing
against Rice and Co. Apparently he wasn't the only one looking
ahead; Alabama was unceremoniously upended in the first round by
South Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I remember most about them was that whole team was
good,'' Horry said of the 1989 Wolverines. They did indeed have a
starting lineup with teeth _ ``A pro team,'' is how Rice described
it after the Lakers' 106-101 loss to Phoenix Wednesday at the
Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Rice was Sean Higgins, Rumeal Robinson, Loy Vaught and
Terry Mills. They blew through their bracket like a tornado, with
Rice as its eye.
</P>
<P>
   In Cleveland, a 13-year-old Ruben Patterson watched in wide-eyed
wonder. ``Back then I wasn't really into college basketball,'' said
the Lakers rookie. ``But I watched that game and I remember Glen
lighting it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The unenviable job of guarding Rice in the final fell to the
Seton Hall forward Andrew Gaze. The Australian import might as well
have been trying to stop a hungry koala from chewing on eucalyptus
leaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time Glen released, I thought (the shot) was down,''
Gaze would say at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolverines were trailing by two points with a little over
one minute remaining in the second half when Rice knocked down a
3-pointer. He had a window to win it for the Wolverines in the
final second of regulation but his 20-footer _ which Rice took with
Gaze in his face like a freckle _ bounced off the rim, setting the
stage for the first overtime period in an NCAA final since 1963.
</P>
<P>
   The missed shot was an aberration, like a steamy March day in
the Pacific Northwest. Truth to tell, Rice was seamless in Seattle,
shooting as if the Space Needle was well within his range.
</P>
<P>
   He delivered the Wolverines to destiny's door, then watched as
Robinson ushered them through, sinking two free throws with three
seconds remaining in the first overtime period to turn back the
Pirates 80-79.
</P>
<P>
   Rice's feathery jumpers transported him as if on wings to an
ethereal place. His 75 field goals, 27 3-pointers and 184 points
were all single-tournament records, the latter breaking a record
Bradley had held for 24 years. Told that no one since has surpassed
his marks, Rice raised an eyebrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's caught fire, huh?'' he said, allowing himself a small
smile.
</P>
<P>
   All modesty aside, he isn't surprised. ``Ain't many tornadoes
going to blow through,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Rice's pro career has been a quiet storm. He scored more points
than any other player in his first two stops, Miami and Charlotte,
and is gunning for an NBA championship ring in his third, in L.A.
He is a three-time All-Star reserve who can remember his NCAA
Tournament starring role as though it were yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to forget it,'' Rice said. ``Especially when March
Madness comes around. It was an unbelievable run by me and my
team.''

DUCKS' TRADE FOR ZEZEL NULLIFIED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The harsh reality of life superseeded hockey
on Wednesday when the Anaheim Mighty Ducks' trade for Peter Zezel
was nulified.
</P>
<P>
   Zezel chose not report to Anaheim so he could remain in Toronto
with his 3{-year-old niece, Julliann Carter, who is dying of
neuroblastoma -- a malignant tumor.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old center, who the Ducks acquired from Vancouver on
Tuesday, will not return to the Canucks this season. He will likely
forfeit the remainder of his $800,000 contract. Zezel becomes a
free agent this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any other time I'd have loved to go play for Anaheim, said
Zezel, who reportedly asked Vancouver not to trade him. ``But if
I'm not with my family through this I will regret it the rest of my
life.
</P>
<P>
   Zezel's sister's daughter was diagnosed in Feb. 98 and six weeks
ago was given just weeks to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is day-to-day, she could pass away tommorrow, Zezel told
the Vancouver Province.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, while Zezel was recovering from a foot
injury, he took a one-week leave of absence to take his niece to
Disneyworld.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks will be returned the eighth-round draft pick they sent
to Vancouver for Zezel.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he his mind wasn't into it and I said `ok' , said
Anaheim general manager Pierre Gauthier. ``We wanted a little depth
and veteran leadership. It's unfortunate he's not coming, but
there's a legitimate reason.
</P>
<P>
   The GM added: ``There is nobody to blame. It's a unique
situation. There is a human factor we can do nothing about.

SOWARD DECIDES TO STAY AT USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC's version of Dennis Rodman has returned.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver R. Jay Soward, who disappeared from the Trojans'
football program and did not attend conditioning workouts for
several weeks, has resurfaced just in time for spring practice,
which begins Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Soward said Wednesday he needed some time off to re-evaluate his
options, and considered applying for the NFL's supplemental draft
before deciding to rejoin the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just thinking about my whole situation,'' Soward said.
``I wasn't really happy at that period in time. I was unhappy
financially. Walking around, not having anything in my pocket. I
didn't like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward, who could be a preseason All-American, said he has
experienced a turbulent spring semester at USC, because he was
forced to move out of his apartment in December and has stayed on
and off with friends the past three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like I was living out of my car, truthfully,'' Soward
said. ``My clothes were in the trunk. Football was last in my mind.
It was hard to find me. Most of the time, (the coaches) were
looking for me.''
</P>
<P>
   For the majority of Soward's AWOL period, even his father had no
idea where he was living or what he would decide to do.
</P>
<P>
   Soward said once he began skipping football workouts, it became
even harder for him to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared. Maybe that's why I didn't come,'' he said. ``I
just knew I was going to get kicked off the football team or not
play for the first three games.''
</P>
<P>
   Although USC coach Paul Hackett suspended Soward from last
year's season opener against Purdue for poor academic performance,
he sounded almost conciliatory Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's been through a tough spring,'' Hackett said.
``The decision (to return for his senior season) was a tough
decision and after he made it, there might have been some second
thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett also stressed that Soward missed nonmandatory
conditioning drills. No other player probably has the clout to skip
such workouts and return relatively unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he did not want to overreact to Soward's absence,
because players from the John Robinson era are still adjusting to
his coaching methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't view that as being soft (on Soward), I view it as
being prudent,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Soward would be punished for his prolonged absence from
the Trojans, Hackett said, ``We will handle that within the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward, who has been running extra laps in conditioning sessions
this week, was optimistic he would not be suspended from any games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's going to be any disciplinary action,''
he said. ``It wasn't like I missed any days of practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward said he feels his first priority is to regain the respect
of his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I treated the whole team unfairly,'' Soward said. ``I want to
regain everybody's trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly if he can avoid any future references to Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not that drastic,'' Soward said.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Hackett has offered the tight-ends coaching position to
former Washington assistant coach Steve Morton. However, Morton
interviewed for the head-coaching job at North Dakota on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Morton cannot be paid by USC until July 1, so if he agrees to
take the job in the spring, he will have to be a volunteer
assistant.

FORWARD LAKEY LEAVES USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC forward Greg Lakey has quit the basketball
team, the third Trojans player to leave since December, and there
remains a possibility of further defections.
</P>
<P>
   Lakey, who is attempting to transfer to Loyola Marymount,
informed USC coach Henry Bibby on Tuesday he would transfer. Last
week, guard Quincy Wilder quit the team. And in December, point
guard Kevin Augustine quit and enrolled at Fullerton College.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources, reserve forward Shannon Swillis is also
considering transferring, possibly to Fresno State. There has been
speculation that junior forward Jarvis Turner might transfer to
either Fresno State or Loyola Marymount, but Turner said Wednesday
he intended to stay at USC.
</P>
<P>
   The latest moves mean that five scholarship players have quit
the USC basketball team in the past 19 months. Shooting guard Danny
Walker and center Philip Von Backstrom quit prior to the start of
the 1997-98 season.
</P>
<P>
   The departures of Lakey and Wilder were attributed to a lack of
playing time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I already spent two years here and I haven't accomplished what
I wanted to accomplish,'' Lakey said Wednesday. ``I did what I
could and I couldn't get in there. I really just thought about
(transferring) two days ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Lakey said he was frustrated over the unpredictable nature of
his playing time. In USC's last three games, Lakey played 21
minutes against Arizona, nine against Arizona State and one against
Wyoming in the National Invitation Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Lakey averaged 4.8 points and 3.0 rebounds this season and led
the Trojans in free-throw shooting (87 percent).
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Henry Bibby was upbeat Wednesday, saying that he only
determined playing time based on practice performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``You play two hours of practice a day. If you can't show me two
hours a day you can play, I can't play you in the basketball
game,'' Bibby said. ``If you talk to most coaches, they say
basketball games are won and lost in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't determine who plays. (Players) determine who plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby said he was not worried about the program's image being
hurt by losing three players in such a short time span.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is the guys that are here,'' he said. ``My concern
is `Are we fair?' My concern is `Are we doing what's best for the
program?' There's no reason for anyone to leave. It's not
complex.''
</P>
<P>
   Lakey said two other factors caused him to transfer. He was
unhappy when it was suggested he redshirt next season _ a charge
denied by USC _ and he was bothered by Turner's role on the team.
</P>
<P>
   One of USC's most experienced players before the season, Turner
played sparingly, with eight games in which he played less than 10
minutes and five games in which he did not play at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about it a lot. I saw what happened to Jarvis,
the way he didn't get into the game. And Shannon didn't either,''
Lakey said. ``That really was on my mind. (Jarvis is) one of my
best friends on the team. I can't have that happen to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Although USC has lost two of its point guards and a key
center-forward, players seemed undaunted Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why they're leaving,'' sophomore guard Jeff
Trepagnier said. ``The coaches are cool. I'll be here.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the players were really sure, however, if Lakey would be
the final player to transfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it would keep surprising me if people leave,'' center
Brian Scalabrine said. ``I thought we had an OK season. But you
have to look at each individual person. Maybe it didn't work out
for them.''
</P>
<P>
   After being short of scholarships, USC suddenly has three for
the spring signing period. Bibby said Wednesday he would like to
sign a point guard and at least one post player.

but they did Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night, dropping a hideous 87-68 decision to
the Timberwolves. They've lost 10 of their last 11 games and are
free-falling at an alarming rate with no end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   If there was negativity in the air Sunday, it was downright
radioactive in the FleetCenter Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night. One fan bellowed
for the return of M.L. Carr. Another told Rick Pitino that if his
team was a horse, the animal would be put out of its misery.
Thousands stood and cheered when Timberwolves executive Kevin
McHale made his way through the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Fans hooted Antoine Walker with each ensuing brick, and there
were plenty (he was an unfathomable 1 for 14). At this rate, he's
going to enjoy seeing the FleetCenter about as much as a fire
hydrant enjoys seeing a dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's with the crowd,'' said Walker, who matched
his season low with 6 points and is 3 for 29 in his last two games
at the FleetCenter. ``We need support. And the booing. On every
shot? Is that necessary? Is that going to make it better?''
</P>
<P>
   The fans also hooted Pitino. The bloom is off the rose and he
knows it. The erstwhile messiah Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night saw his team quit
on him. That was the universal feeling on the Minnesota bench. The
Timberwolves were shorthanded and expecting a battle. They got a
gift instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't blame the fans,'' Pitino said when asked about the
boos. ``Put yourself in their shoes. With that type of performance,
we should get booed. I didn't think it could get worse, but it did.
Unfortunately, when it rains, it pours, and right now, it's pouring
on us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics shot 30.5 percent, a season low. The 68 points were
a season low as well. They forced only six turnovers and had a
single steal, not good signs for a team that likes to harass. Those
also were season lows. The Timberwolves actually set a franchise
record for fewest points allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics watched the Timberwolves open the third quarter with
a 7-0 run and the fourth with a 10-0 run to usher in garbage time.
Paul Pierce was 3 of 15 from the field while Ron Mercer was 6 of
20. It was ugly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's embarrassing,'' Mercer said. ``But the season is not
over. It's one bad game. We have to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   The pregame atmosphere was charged after Pitino promised to make
changes following the Cleveland game. But he said he discovered he
couldn't because everyone was equally horrid and it would be unfair
to single anyone out. He's going to make the same discoveries after
this one.
</P>
<P>
   The Timberwolves shot 40 percent, missed 12 of 27 free throws,
were outrebounded, and still won going away. They got Dennis Scott
(22 points) going early, then rode Kevin Garnett (22 points, 14
rebounds) the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics' night could be crystallized into one play: a
three-on-one break at the end of the first half. Tony Battie
bobbled the pass, Bobby Jackson picked up the ball, and tossed in a
runner off the glass as the horn sounded.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota, which lost at home Sunday to the Clippers and is
without two of its top players (Anthony Peeler, Malik Sealy), never
led by fewer than 10 points after opening the third quarter with a
baseline jumper by Terrell Brandon. Following the 7-0 run to open
the quarter, Pitino called time, only to see his team come out of
the huddle and commit a 24-second violation.
</P>
<P>
   The Timberwolves blew the lead out to 27 in the fourth, enabling
officials Dee Kantner, David Jones, and Joe Forte to mercifully
steer the game in under two hours.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics moved the ball around, got decent looks, but could
get nothing to drop. You live by the sword, you die by the sword.
They were threatening franchise records for fewest points and field
goal percentage down to the wire until they got 7 points in the
final 93 seconds. Kenny Anderson led Boston with 16 points while
Mercer had 13.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino talked at length afterward about how these trying times
will, in the long run, benefit his team. He's a big believer in
adversity building character and actually said this whole unseemly
mess will ``pay huge dividends'' once his players get with the
program. That seemed like a hollow promise after what everyone has
witnessed in the last four days.

   Serbian military authorities have begun to to crack down on
foreign journalists who were reporting news of the NATO air strikes
from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   They briefly detained a Washington Post correspondent early
Thursday, shut down all television transmission complexes and
threatened a CNN correspondent and his crew in Pristina, the
capital of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty reporters and technicians, including at least 7
Americans, were detained in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   At about 4:30 on Thursday morning, Belgrade time, Serbian
plain-clothes agents who identified themselves as border guards
entered the Hyatt Hotel in Belgrade and asked for Peter Finn, one
of two Washington Post correspondents working in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The agents took Finn out of the hotel, saying he would be
deported, but he was later released.
</P>
<P>
   They also acted to deport a Belgian journalist, Philippe Debroz.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Milligan of The Boston Globe and William Glauber of The
Baltimore Sun and four CNN employes were also detained by the
police on the roof of a hotel in Belgrade, but were released last
night, according to their editors.
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina, two American television correspondents remained on
Wednesday, Allen Pizzey of CBS News and Brent Sadler of CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler said armed Serbian officials had slashed the tires of his
vehicle and had threatened him and his crew by holding out two
bullets and saying, ``These are for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Among American newspapers, The New York Times and The Los
Angeles each have a reporter based in Kosovo. The Associated Press
moved some reporters out of Pristina, but still has a half-dozen
there, according to a spokeswoman, Tori Smith.

BRUINS, DAFOE BLANK OTTAWA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANATA, Ontario _ In the standings, the two points were no more
important than if they had come against the Tampa Bay Lightning or
the Chicago Blackhawks or the New York Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   However, psychologically, the Bruins picking up a pair of points
against the team that sits in first place in the Eastern Conference
and could very well be the Bruins' first-round opponent in the
playoffs did provide a bigger boost than if they had come at the
expense of the worst teams in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night's 3-0 win over the Ottawa Senators was
as exciting as any postseason matchup could've been. Goalie Byron
Dafoe stopped all 28 Ottawa chances, picking up his eighth shutout
of the season and 15th of his career.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins took a 1-0 lead in the first and then scored on
back-to-back shots in the second, the first of which was a
successful penalty shot by center Jason Allison.
</P>
<P>
   Allison made Ottawa defenseman Jason York suffer not once but
twice. The first time York pulled him down, it led to the Bruins'
first goal _ scored on the ensuing power play. The second time, it
meant a penalty shot for Allison at the 3:30 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Allison took off from center, switched several times from his
backhand to his forehand, used a double head fake to throw off
goalie Ron Tugnutt, then lifted in a backhand shot at the left
post.
</P>
<P>
   Just 39 seconds later, forward Landon Wilson, who was still
smarting from his missed penalty shot against Toronto March 17,
looked as if he'd been watching Allison. The puck pinballed off
several players and Wilson found himself with the puck and nothing
between him and the net but Tugnutt. He skated in, made a similar
move that Allison made, and tried a backhander from the same place.
Tugnutt made the stop but Wilson stopped, too, and managed to whack
the rebound over the goalie for a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Burns said he didn't let Wilson advise Allison before
his penalty shot. When told of this, Allison laughed. ``I didn't
even go to the bench,'' said Allison. ``I didn't want anyone
talking to me. I played with Ron before and I know he knows I like
to sometimes go high. I've had success with that deke before, but
he played it great. I just got it to squeeze by him.''
</P>
<P>
   The first period started off very slowly with the game looking
more like a chess match than hockey. Both teams were content to
dump the puck and wait for their chances. Ottawa's best opportunity
came at 15:33 when York, positioned at the right point, blasted a
shot that clanged off the left post. The siren sounded but it
clearly wasn't in. Left wing Marian Hossa chased after the puck but
missed it with his stick and it bounced off his right skate.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than three minutes later, the Bruins took a 1-0
lead on the power play. Defenseman Ray Bourque carried the puck
across the blue line. At the left point, he dished it to Dmitri
Khristich, who blasted a shot from high between the circles that
went over Tugnutt's glove at 18:53.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Allison's goal, the Senators mustered a decent scoring
bid off the stick of center Alexei Yashin less than two minutes
into the second period. Yashin picked up a loose puck behind the
net and skated out to the left circle, firing a shot that
disappeared into the body of Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   After Wilson's goal, the Senators hit another snag when ex-Bruin
Ted Donato, who was traded to Ottawa from the Islanders Saturday,
teed up a shot from the right circle that went through Dafoe but
rang off the post.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the excitement and success of Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night's
win, Bruins assistant general manager Mike O'Connell said if the
teams meet again in the first round of the playoffs, all bets will
be off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not out of the woods yet but when you get into the
playoffs, the whole picture changes, everything changes,'' said
O'Connell. ``The pressures change. You've got a home-ice advantage
team against a non-home-ice advantage team. One finishes so many
odd points ahead of another team. Those pressures aren't there
right now. I think every team in our conference has a chance, one
through eight, every team has a chance.''

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If you're planning an excursion to hell, don't
pack that sweater. Temperatures are normal.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's climate also remained much the same inside the
Sports Arena (which only seems like hell), where _ witnessed by
6,180 _ the Los Angeles Clippers surrendered to the Golden State
Warriors 92-80, terminating the home team's winning streak after
one in a row. Instead of victories back-to-back, a 13-point fourth
quarter made them settle for back to bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just ... missed,'' said forward Maurice Taylor, defining
his team's 5-of-12 marksmanship in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Clippers coach Chris Ford thought this explanation would sound
good in stereo. ``You gotta put the ball in the basket,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because they didn't, a plausible victory _ the game was tied
71-71 with 10:08 remaining _ became the Clippers' 23rd loss in 25
games; they now are on pace to complete the Cliffs Notes version of
this NBA season at 4-46.
</P>
<P>
   And the hits keep comin'. Point guard Darrick Martin
hyperextended his left knee just moments before the agony of defeat
was official. The Clippers, who already have two playmakers on the
injured list, scheduled an MRI for Martin today.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that fourth quarter, they might be wise to hire a
bus and make it a field trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't make the plays when we had to,'' guard Charles
Smith said. ``They outhustled us late in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a damning declaration for a team with two victories.
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday's epiphany at Minnesota _ where they finally found
an `A' game at the bottom of a suitcase _ the Clippers at least
began Wednesday's game like a team responding to an intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Behind six points from Taylor and a bit of backboard bullying by
rookie center Michael Olowokandi (two blocked shots, three
rebounds), the Clippers jumped out to a nine-point lead. Guard Eric
Piatkowski capped the rally, finishing a fast break off a feed from
Martin to put the Clippers ahead 13-4 with 7:07 left in the opening
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors (11-15) _ who lost Tuesday night in Portland _
countered with an 11-0 surge, featuring Donyell Marshall's
fast-break slam to complete the run at the 5:03 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Golden State _ whose wounded starting forwards Jason Caffey
(Achilles) and Chris Mills (ankle) turned out in civilian clothes _
limped into a three-point lead, but the Clippers limped back to tie
the score at 24 when the period ended.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor finished the quarter with eight points. Olowokandi (13
points, nine rebounds for the game), who snagged a career-high 16
rebounds in Minnesota, had six boards in round one. Both teams shot
more than 50 percent _ from the field. The middle quarters were a
competitive warm-up for the Clippers' signature fourth-quarter
collapse. Rookie forward Antawn Jamison had nine points in the last
period and finished with a team-high 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things weren't going as smoothly in the fourth quarter,''
Taylor decided.
</P>
<P>
   No, but things certainly looked familiar. &QL;

CELTICS CROWD NEARLY AS UGLY AS GAME 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's all about degrees of bad when you watch the
Celtics now. It's like the Jerry Springer show and Kevin Costner
movies: How low can they go?
</P>
<P>
   We thought the game at Charlotte was the nadir. Then the
overtime loss to the Bulls last Sunday. Then Tuesday night in
Cleveland. Now this _ a 87-68 home loss to the Minnesota
Timberwolves on the same night the beleaguered Celtics had been
``challenged'' by their beleaguered coach.
</P>
<P>
   How bad did it get Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night? Antoine Walker shot 1 for
14 and fans behind the bench were begging for the return of M.L.
Carr.
</P>
<P>
   Yikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind the booing,'' said Walker. ``But on every shot?
Is that gonna make things better? . . . I don't know what's with
the crowd. I don't think that's right. We need all the support we
can get.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not ugly at the beginning of the evening. There were no
signs imploring Paul Gaston to ``bring back M.L.'' (the roundball
equivalent of bringing back Lou Gorman). There were no Rick Pitino
dolls hanging in effigy from the upper deck. The Celtics didn't get
the Don Zimmer/Ulf Samuelsson treatment when they came out for
pregame warmups.
</P>
<P>
   But there was negativity in the building. Negativity all over
town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been given great treatment in this town by the press and
by the fans,'' Pitino said before the game. ``Now, the way we have
played, I deserve to take a lot of heat for the way the team is
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino has obviously decided that the best defense is a good
offense. This is an old Dennis Johnson trick. Members of the media
never ripped DJ because he was always tough on himself. Same with
Bill Walton. Big Red would say, ``Tonight I was a disgrace to the
game of basketball,'' and it was difficult to top that with any
poison pen.
</P>
<P>
   And now Pitino's self-flagellation helps mask the crises of
confidence in the Celtics' executive suites. Thanksdad Gaston has
to be wondering if he made a wise move when he turned over complete
control and $50 million to a man who we know is a terrific college
coach, a snappy dresser, and a top-shelf motivational speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had poor performance from a team that should be
well-coached,'' Pitino admitted. ``I have to look in the mirror and
say, `Maybe this is not a well-coached team.' I don't think I'm
doing a very good job right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Celtic fans have been much tougher. Pitino was thoroughly
slaughtered on sports talk radio Wednesday and the word ``fraud''
was tossed around where fans once cited ``genius.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino has an expression for the bloodthirsty shut-ins, guests,
and hosts of WEEI, calling them ``the fellowship of the
miserable.'' Asked if he heard himself torched on sports talk radio
the coach shook his head and said, ``That's one thing I will not
stoop to _ my UMass education will not allow me to stoop to that
level.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmm. He'd better not listen today.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino threatened wholesale changes after Tuesday's abysmal
showing in Cleveland, but sent out the same starting five against
the Timberwolves. This did not go unnoticed by the discerning
fandom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Ricky, wasn't somebody supposed to sit?'' bellowed one
fan in the opening minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no one individual I can put my finger on,'' Pitino
said before the game. ``But after tonight, I will. If we grade out,
based on hustle, and I see things I don't like, then those people
are not going to play a lot of minutes in Philadelphia (Friday
night).''
</P>
<P>
   The first big boos of the night were saved for Walker when he
took a quick and errant 3-pointer while the Celtics were trailing
by 4 late in the first quarter. Walker came out at the next whistle
to mock applause.
</P>
<P>
   After shooting 29 percent (12 of 42), the Celtics came off the
floor at halftime and a fan screamed, ``Rick, I feel sorry for
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker, a listless 1 for 7 in the first half, did not warm up
before the third period. He just sat on the bench. He no doubt
wanted to conserve some energy to guard the sensational Kevin
Garnett.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett was a highlight film in the third period, repeatedly
dunking over Walker, who still could not make a shot.
</P>
<P>
   It was nasty. There were ghosts of Celtics past all over the
building: Bob Cousy and Robert Parish (in the stands), Kevin McHale
(Minnesota general manager), Jerry Sichting (Timberwolves assistant
coach), Cedric Maxwell and Tommy Heinsohn (broadcast row), Jo Jo
White, and M.L. Carr. It must pain them to see this happening.
</P>
<P>
   When it got to 61-47, another wise guy walked past the Celtic
bench and said, ``Hey, Rick, if this was a horse you'd put it
down.''
</P>
<P>
   The beginning of the fourth was disastrous. Walker could not get
out of his own way, but kept trying (and missing) treys. Down 71-50
with 9:58 left, Pitino called time and you would have thought Dan
Duquette was being introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino kept his starters on the floor. It was as if he wanted to
punish them by playing them. Walker did not come out until there
was 2:09 left on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   After the beating, Pitino seemed tranquilized. There was none of
the fire and anger he displayed in Cleveland a night earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it could get worse, but it did,'' he
acknowleged. ``But their self-estemm has got to be as low as
possible and I'm not going to add to that.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't point fingers. He didn't threaten to bench or trade
anyone. And he said he didn't think his team had tuned him out.
</P>
<P>
   But this was bad. A 10th loss in 11 games. A season-worst 68
points. A new low.
</P>
<P>
   But the stats weren't the worst thing. The young Celtics quit on
their famous coach Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night. That was the worst of it.

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ And so, 6,795 miles later, the Los Angeles
Lakers docked once again in a safe harbor, no worse and no better
for the wear after a road trip that netted as many wins as losses.
</P>
<P>
   The smoggy skies over gridlocked highways never looked better.
The Forum never seemed more fabulous or friendly. But the comforts
of home were deceiving. So, too, was the apparent progress the
Lakers had made in road-trip-ending victories at Orlando and
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, they took another backward step Wednesday night in
a sloppy 106-101 loss to the Phoenix Suns. Make that two backward
steps, long enough to stretch back to their previous meltdowns in
Cleveland and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   As always for this team, progress is fleeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no explanation for it,'' Shaquille O'Neal said. ``None
whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   The six-city, nine-day road trip could have sufficed for an
explanation, especially on a night in which the Lakers spotted the
visiting team a 14-point lead in the first quarter. But that was
immediately dismissed by all as a lame excuse.
</P>
<P>
   They had their chance to win this game, with an eight-point lead
late in the third quarter, but old habits returned. Several
turnovers and ill-conceived shots later, their nine-game home
winning streak, and their 11-0 Dennis Rodman streak, were toast.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the day off they took to rest up from the road trip would
have been better spent practicing after all. And maybe somewhere
back at LAX, a purple-and-gold duffel bag containing the Lakers'
cohesion and basketball smarts is sitting on a baggage-claim
conveyor belt, going in circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't come out ready to play and we turned the ball over
way too many times,'' coach Kurt Rambis, visibly upset, said
afterward. ``It's just mental mistakes. The way we turned the ball
over are just mental mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen turnovers negated the Lakers' 48-44 rebounding edge and
superior shooting (46.1 percent to the Suns' 43.5 percent). Kobe
Bryant committed five turnovers and hit 10 of 22 shots to mar his
25-point performance. Rodman's 13 rebounds came with four
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Kidd did the rest, scoring 21 of his 23 points in the
second half to go with 10 assists and seven rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   And all the Lakers could do was shake their heads in disgust.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sitting here discombobulated,'' Derek Harper said.
``Sort of looking for an answer. Here I am trying to explain what
happened and what didn't work.... We have to play together. I don't
think there's any way around it. We have to play together, we have
to play as a group and we have to be tied together.''
</P>
<P>
   No further analysis was needed. The home crowd had already
delivered its own editorial on the subject. In the closing seconds,
after a Glen Rice airball that missed the rim by three feet, they
broke out the sarcastic ``Ed-die'' chants, in homage to the traded
Eddie Jones.
</P>
<P>
   After recovering from the early deficit, the Lakers controlled
the game through most of the second and half the third quarter. But
then things got nasty.
</P>
<P>
   With the Lakers leading 75-69, Rick Fox tossed the Suns' Gerald
Brown to the hardwood to stop a fast-break layup in progress. Brown
leaped to his feet and was met by an inexplicable shove from an
intervening Rodman, which nearly started a brawl.
</P>
<P>
   Fox got a flagrant foul, Brown and Rodman got a double-technical
and when it was all over Brown had made two free throws, and the
Suns, retaining possession, got Clifford Robinson to the line for
another pair of foul shots.
</P>
<P>
   The margin was suddenly an iffy 75-73 and the Suns used the
momentum to mount a 14-2 run to close out the quarter and take an
83-77 lead to head into the final period. The Lakers never got
closer than three points the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis was so disgusted, his postgame sermon to the players
consisted of just three terse thoughts: ``We've got practice
tomorrow. Meeting's over. Get dressed and go home.''

 COMPLACENCY THE ENEMY IN AIDS FIGHT, SAYS ELDERS  &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An AIDS conference in San Francisco turned into
a pep rally for some 2,000 battle-weary fighters of the disease
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joycelyn Elders, the plain-talking former surgeon general of
the United States, kicked off the National HIV/AIDS Update
Conference, an annual event sponsored by the American Foundation
for AIDS Research, with a stirring plea to stay the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have to be in this battle until it's over, and I want
you to know it's not over,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Few doubted that among the hundreds of veteran AIDS health care
providers and public health workers in the crowd at Bill Graham
Civic Auditorium. But now, Elders reminded them, there's a new
problem: growing public complacency.
</P>
<P>
   Lulled by encouraging early results from new drug therapies,
many Americans have decided AIDS is no longer much of a threat,
said Dr. Mervyn Silverman, the former San Francisco public health
czar and chairman of the AIDS conference, which runs through
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   He cited survey results that suggest people must be tuning out
all the AIDS awareness campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The deadly virus is nearly always contracted through exchange of
blood or other body fluids, often during unprotected sexual
activity or from sharing intravenous drug paraphernalia.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey taken in 1991, 41 percent still wrongly assumed that
HIV could be contracted from sharing a drinking glass with an
infected person. In 1997, the same misconception was found in 55
percent of those surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, 34 percent of those surveyed in 1991 worried about
catching the AIDS virus from a public toilet seat, as compared to
41 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-seven percent of young Americans believe they are at no
risk of contracting HIV. Yet about 1 in every 4 new infections
occurs in the same age group, 17- to 22-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either we're really getting dumber, or some of us in this room
are not doing our jobs,'' Silverman said.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown also stressed that the AIDS
battle needs to be rejoined, even if the issues are shifting
nowadays to include such problems as AIDS and the elderly, or
workplace re-entry for AIDS patients who are moving from deathbeds
to long-term drug therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a mammoth struggle,'' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   Following him to the podium, Elders offered a familiar litany of
suggestions, including universal access to health care and free
needle-exchange programs, both of which seem as far from reality as
when she was in office.
</P>
<P>
   Later, she said she was still trying to find an effective
champion on Capitol Hill who would support her.
</P>
<P>
   She compared the experience of fighting AIDS to ``dancing with a
bear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't sit down when you're tired,'' she said. ``You have
to wait until the bear is tired. Only then can you sit down.``

 KASICH'S CALIFORNIA PRIMARY STRATEGY  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The best way to compete in California's early
presidential primary may be to spend a lot of time in Iowa or New
Hampshire, Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, suggested Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to make it through Iowa and New Hampshire,'' said
Kasich, or else ``you'll never see me in California except on
vacation.'' Kasich will visit the Bay Area this weekend for the
first time since he announced the formation of his presidential
exploratory committee.
</P>
<P>
   The energetic 46-year-old chairman of the House Budget Committee
_ who once compared himself to the double-caffeinated soft drink
Jolt _ discussed his longshot quest for the presidency with
California reporters over lunch, dismissing polls that show Texas
Gov. George W. Bush far ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where people are today could be 180 degrees from where they
are tomorrow,'' Kasich said, adding that he is not losing sleep
over the rush of California Republican activists to the Bush
campaign. ``I don't worry about who signed up for who in
California,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If he manages to surprise people in the Iowa caucus in early
February or in the New Hampshire primary, the nation's first,
Kasich said, he will get the attention needed to win California's
March 7 primary.
</P>
<P>
   He said his unscripted style would play well in the West, but he
could offer no specific reasons why he might hold any particular
appeal to Californians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to tell you that I like the Lakers or
something,'' he said. ``My message is the same wherever I go. No
matter what state I'm in, no matter who I'm talking to, the message
is the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasich said he would have voted in favor of California's
Proposition 187, which limited public assistance to illegal
immigrants, but said he was unfamiliar with the details of
Proposition 209, which ended many of the state's affirmative action
programs.
</P>
<P>
   He said his campaign message will center on giving people ``more
control over their lives,'' whether that be through less
government, tax cuts, private retirement accounts or giving parents
more of a say on where their children go to school.
</P>
<P>
   A devout Christian, Kasich said opposition to abortion would be
a requirement for a potential running mate, and for a Supreme Court
nominee, if he is elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich will travel to the Bay Area this weekend for fund raisers
in San Francisco and San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Though conservative by reputation, Kasich has worked well with
Democrats during his 16 years in Congress. He is a good friend of
former Rep. Ron Dellums, a Democrat from Oakland, Calif. His
scheduled appearance last year at a breakfast fund raiser for Rep.
Gary Condit, a Democrat from California's Central Valley and
another close friend, so angered the Republican Party establishment
that the leadership barred him from addressing the party's
convention last month.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign style so far has included bowling earlier this
month with voters in Iowa, and ``mushing'' on a dogsled in New
Hampshire last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to get the nomination,'' he said. You think that's
just a flip comment. It's not. I believe if I get the money, I will
be president.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasich was at times vague about the details of his California
strategy. He said he was not even up to date on his travel schedule
in the state. ``Frankly, I don't look ahead at the schedule,'' he
said. ``I have better energy when I focus on the wood in front of
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he would fare better than California Republicans did
last November, Kasich bristled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a clue what they did. I didn't watch that
campaign,'' he said.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: THE TEXAS INTERVENTION OF 2008
 &HT;    For release Sunday, March 28.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States declared a state of war today as
waves of Mexican warplanes pounded U.S. military targets in a
campaign to force Washington to accept an international peace plan
for Texas.
</P>
<P>
   President Ignacio Vazquez Torres of Mexico said the strikes, the
first attack on another nation in Mexico's 198-year history, were
aimed to prevent ``brutal repression'' by U.S. forces against the
heavily Hispanic majority, which seeks to establish self-rule
throughout southwest Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Vazquez asserted that the attacks ``enjoyed the support of every
nation in the Western Hemisphere, from the Arctic to Patagonia.''
As he put it:
</P>
<P>
   ``We and our Latin allies have taken this action only after
extensive and repeated efforts to obtain a peaceful solution to the
crisis. But President Bush has rejected the balanced and fair peace
accords that our allies and partners, including Canada, have
advanced, a peace agreement that the Mexicans in Texas courageously
accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   Canadian leaders, however, voiced their outrage against what
they called ``a blatant case of aggression against our American
brothers.'' Ottawa vowed to break an international arms embargo
imposed against Washington after President George W. Bush
stubbornly refused to acquiesce to Hispanic demands for an
autonomous pro-Mexican government in El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, who had served as a Spanish-speaking governor of Texas
before entering the White House in 2001, told a special session of
the 110th Congress: ``We shall never surrender our control over the
region nor allow foreign 'peacekeeping' troops on sovereign U.S.
soil.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also claimed that ``the world community remains poorly
informed about the many atrocities committed by Hispanic guerrilla
forces against defenseless Anglo civilians in and around El Paso.''
</P>
<P>
   Vazquez, in his speech on the Internet, viewed by some 5 billion
people, recalled the fierce NATO attacks against Serbia in 1999.
That campaign occurred shortly before the collapse of the U.S.
economy and the discovery of vast oil riches in Mexico _ wealth
that allowed Mexico to leap ahead of its neighbor and to build its
Fuerza Aerea Mexicanos (FAM) into a massive aerial arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The onetime Clinton administration in Washington established
the principle that ethnic rights must be upheld even if it means
going to war,'' Vazquez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now horrors are taking place along our northern border and not
in some faraway land,'' he added. ``In the same spirit that Clinton
once viewed the tragedy in Kosovo, so we must act to avert another
tragedy in Texas. For us, this is also 'a moral imperative.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I pledge that we will stop the bombing and recall our FAM
forces when the United States comes to its senses. But, until that
happens, we've warned the Bush clique in Washington that any
attempt to retaliate would lead to the gravest possible
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Vazquez disclaimed any territorial ambitions by his powerful
country. He did note, however, that vast stretches of the
southwestern United States, including Texas, ``were Mexican soil
until relatively recently, actually only 172 years ago.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Yeltsin mighty involved _ after the fact
 &HT;    (For release Sunday, March 28, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Were I Bill Clinton (and I'm delighted that I'm not) here's what
I would have done _ quite some time ago:
</P>
<P>
   I would have picked up the phone and placed a call to Boris
Yeltsin in the Kremlin, or whatever rest home he was occupying at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boris,'' I would begin, ``this guy Milosevic, with whom we've
had trouble in the past, is murdering a lot of ethnic Albanians and
we need to put a stop to it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you plan to do about it, Bill?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, if it isn't stopped, we're going to get NATO to put the
muscle to them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Again with the bombs? Don't you know anything but bombs?
You're still bombing Iraq!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Boris, I'll tell you what. Every time we get some tinhorn
dictator going around murdering innocent people, we talk to them
until we're blue in the face. When that is exhausted, we have no
other choice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will never accept indiscriminate bombing of sovereign
territories.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Boris, let me put it to you. What would you do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What would I do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, the Serbs are killing the ethnic Albanians, destroying
their homes, forcing them across their borders. It is close to
genocide, Boris. I've had enough of you sitting on your hands until
we are forced to make a bold move, then listen to you criticizing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Clinton, I've got my hands full here in Russia; I can't
get too involved in Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Yeltsin, do you think I've had an easy time the last year
or so? I got a mess on my plate that won't go away but I can't look
the other way when ethnic cleansing is going on. You and the
Russian people should know as well as anyone else. Look what the
Nazis did to you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill, we've got a good relationship with the Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Great! That's a start. How about you, Milosevic and me _ just
the three of us _ sitting down somewhere, anywhere, and working
this out; make him stop the slaughter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill, these flare-ups happen everywhere. I had it in Chechnya,
remember?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Boris, they're slaughtering people because of their
ethnicity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But you have to understand, there was a revolt. The Kosovan
Liberation Army is much like terrorists. Milosevic had to take a
stand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking a stand is one thing; slaughtering is another.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So, you're going to bomb?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell you what, Boris, the next time we send an envoy to
Belgrade to talk with Milosevic, why don't you send one with us?
All we want to do is stop the ethnic cleansing. I presume you don't
accept ethnic cleansing, either, so we can agree on that before we
start. I really don't care if there is a separate state of Kosovo,
although I must remind you that it once was autonomous and that was
taken away by Milosevic. And also that Milosevic agreed to a treaty
that included allowing NATO troops into Yugoslavia to keep the
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not NATO, Bill, and I don't like NATO. Why should I do
something with NATO?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because no one else is doing anything, Boris. The U.N., as
usual, is tossing lilacs into the air, you guys are doing _ what?
Did you even utter a sound about the slaughters in Kosovo? No, you
didn't. Instead, you just sat back and crabbed about NATO going
beyond its purview.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So you want me to be involved in the talks with Milosevic?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not, you seem to want to get involved, or you wouldn't be
shooting off your big mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Clinton, I have had health problems and great internal
problems here in Russia. I have neither the time nor the personnel
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then stay out of it when we start bombing, Boris. You don't
play the game, you don't make the rules!''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: U.S. right to tread softly on land-mine issue
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   First Donald Steinberg gets five years as U.S. ambassador in
Angola, which is not altogether jolly duty, and now, for his pains,
he's a point man in land mine policy, with most of the world
hissing Washington's refusal to join 135 nations in a treaty
banning the weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg, however, has a pretty good product.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is taking a bad rap on this issue, sometimes
from friends _ Canada is appalled _ but more often from nations to
which the issue offers easy posturing and even from nations so
blithely evil they'll sign anything virtuous-sounding without the
slightest intention of honoring the deal. Some half-dozen
signatories already are violating the pact that went into effect
only March 1.
</P>
<P>
   Land mines are especially pernicious weapons. They stay live for
decades _ mines from World War I remain in Europe _ and claim
civilians as their long-term victims, very often heedless children.
Most are designed to maim rather than to kill. (A dead solider can
be left where he falls; the wounded must be tended. A mine
incapacitates at least two combatants.)
</P>
<P>
   There are some 70 million mines buried in the fields and
roadways of 70 countries, especially dense in 25. They are a daily
fact of life in, for instance, Cambodia and Bosnia, and in Angola
mines laid in the interminable civil war have maimed 80,000 and
driven 100,000 from their homes, so far.
</P>
<P>
   Though largely to deaf ears, President Clinton has pleaded
reasonably that the United States, with unique superpower
responsibilities, needs a few years to adjust policy and to perfect
military alternatives before it can honestly sign the international
ban. An effective option is needed, for instance, to the mine field
that helps to keep rash and radical North Korea at bay on the
politically sundered Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   While all of that hangs fire, the United States remains the
world's leader in the crucial and difficult task of demining, and
here Steinberg speaks with a missionary's zeal born of his Angola
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has increased funding in recent years to $120 million
a year, about half of the world effort. U.S. programs train
deminers abroad, pinpoint mines through satellites and other
sophisticated means, teach populations, especially kids, how to ID
suspicious sites, and provide medical backup to victims.
</P>
<P>
   Monthly mine casualties in Cambodia have been cut from 500 to 50
and 4,000 miles of road in Mozambique have been cleared; 3.3
million mines were destroyed from 1996 to '98. And innovative
programs are attracting private help.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations Association of the USA manages an
Adopt-a-Minefield program; donors alone or by pooling contributions
can clear a whole field. Other groups will deploy a mine-sniffing
dog, still the best detector, for as little as $250.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. effort to get square with the ban seems genuine if
slow, and meantime the United States is, as a practical matter,
overwhelmingly more a part of the solution than of the problem.
Much of the contrary umbrage is more righteous than right.

 &HT;    EDS: With RUSSIA-ARMY-$ADV28, RUSSIA-RECRUIT-$ADV28.
 &HT;    Moving in (i) international and (w) Washington categories
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The U.S. State Department in February issued an
extraordinarily detailed report to Congress on the status of
Russia's military. It estimated that Russia's Defense Ministry is
operating with a $9 billion debt, which includes about $2.5 billion
in back pay and pensions to active and retired servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the findings:
</P>
<P>
   An internal Russian military analysis found that ``the average
Russian soldier is only marginally combat capable,'' as chronic
economic problems faced by the government have curtailed training
of the country's 1.2 million soldiers, sailors and airmen.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, sea duty for Russian submarines was reduced by 25
percent, while surface ships spent 33 percent less time at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Russian air force pilots in 1998 got only 15 to 40 percent of
normal flying time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the government was three-to-four months behind in
paying salaries to servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   The wage arrears and decline in living standards on Russian
bases has placed the military ``at the low end of the country's
economic scale.''
</P>
<P>
   The result as been an increase in crime, ``particularly theft,
and corruption in the armed forces, as well as suicides among
service members and widespread evasion of military service.''

 &HT;    It's hard to weed out the hot buttons
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ After nearly 17 years of writing a column,
the one thing I've learned is that you never know what is going to
set people off. I have written pieces that I was sure would bring
in loads of nasty mail and gotten nary a word. I have written other
columns that seemed utterly innocuous, only to discover that I have
somehow pushed someone's hot button.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's good to hear from the customers even if they're not
exactly calling to bestow laurels upon you.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first columns I ever wrote, back in the summer of
1982, had to do with my cats, who were having to adapt from living
in the big city of Austin to making do in tiny San Augustine,
population 3,000. I mentioned that my cats were being visited by a
black cat who had taken offense at these big-city cats moving into
town. There had been a few minor skirmishes, the typical antics of
territorial creatures.
</P>
<P>
   The piece was meant to be lighthearted. You want serious, read
George Will.
</P>
<P>
   The morning it appeared, I was visited by a woman who was
convinced I was talking about her cat, even though she lived two
miles down the road. She threatened to sue me. I pointed out it's
hard to libel a cat. Dogs maybe, but truth is always a defense, and
cats are guilty of just about anything you could write about them.
</P>
<P>
   She could not be consoled or calmed. I had ruined her reputation
by talking about her cat. She might have to move or go into the
witness protection program. To this day I have no idea what exactly
caused her to turn into a raving lunatic that Wednesday morning.
She promised her attorney would be in touch, but a few days later
she called to apologize. She had decided it wasn't her cat I was
talking about after all.
</P>
<P>
   I tell this story because a few weeks back I wrote another
allegedly lighthearted column about what the three teen-age boys I
take to school each morning talk about: girls, tongue piercing,
rock videos, which teachers are mean, and which are cool, etc. The
three teens in question had no objection to the piece, though they
requested veto power over future columns that used them as topics.
Tough luck, I told them. Catch another ride if it bothers you.
</P>
<P>
   I have gotten several e-mails and even a handwritten letter from
a few teachers and one teen who read the piece in other newspapers
as far away as Pennsylvania. Two teachers from out of town took the
time to write and tell me that I was:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Full of beans.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Didn't know anything about teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Obviously have not been in a classroom in years, and
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ought to stick to my knitting, as the saying goes.
</P>
<P>
   Yeech. Lighten up, fellas. I'm on your side. I was simply
recounting what the teens I transport had to say. As for knowing
nothing about teen-agers, all I can say in my defense is that this
is the third set of teens I've helped raise. That doesn't mean I
understand them anymore than I have figured out cats or women, but
I do have some on-the-job experience.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite critique came from a young man in Newville, Pa. I
was impressed he took the time to write, even though he was a tad
critical. He wrote, in part:
</P>
<P>
   ``We (teen-agers) could care less about body piercing. Why
should we care about our government? They do whatever they please.
The electoral college elects the president. Then the president does
whatever he feels he wants to do. We have no influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you were trying to write an informative essay
on this topic, but if you were, it was a horrible one. My friends
and I can write better essays and articles. We shall be very glad
if you respond to my letter!
</P>
<P>
   Cordially yours,
</P>
<P>
   John Lehman.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Mr. Lehman's letter was flawlessly written, with nary a
misspelling or grammatical error. He must have some good teachers.
</P>
<P>
   I am a bit saddened that he is already so cynical about
politics, and I hope he soon realizes that people do have influence
and voting does matter.
</P>
<P>
   As for whether I was trying to write an informative essay on
teen-agers, the answer would be no. I'll leave that to others more
qualified.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'll stick to cats from now on. At least they can't sue
me.

 &HT;    A work in progress
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ The preacher, the other Sunday morning, was well
into his sermon about the work of God. ``Notice how God works in
all our lives,'' he said. ``We must allow God to work everyday for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   My 8-year-old daughter leaned into me and whispered, ``Why is
that everything about God is about work?''
</P>
<P>
   I wish I could have asked such a smart question.
</P>
<P>
   She's right of course. We are told so much about how God works
that seldom do we hear about the God who plays.
</P>
<P>
   All work and no play would make this world pretty dull.
</P>
<P>
   Walking out of church it was easy to see the whimiscal side of
God. The trees were putting on new, leafy coats and the azaleas and
dogwoods were in full bloom.
</P>
<P>
   It's the time of year when we shake off the gray, muddy days of
winter and watch in wonderment as the earth renews itself.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it takes the wisdom of an 8-year-old to bring it into
focus.
</P>
<P>
   God does work in mysterious ways.

 &HT;    Split-second decisions that can last a lifetime
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It all happened so fast. I don't even remember
drawing or aiming the weapon. It was as if the pistol jumped into
my hand and fired itself.
</P>
<P>
   The next thing I remember was the other guy laying face down in
the street. It was shown later that I fired three times and hit him
twice. One round would have given him a bad stomach ache if the
round to his head hadn't killed him.
</P>
<P>
   The training officer had a question and a prediction.
</P>
<P>
   The question: ``Why did you do that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He ran over my partner,'' I replied.
</P>
<P>
   The prediction: ``You just bought yourself a trip to the grand
jury.''
</P>
<P>
   It just happened so fast, I didn't think. I reacted. If it had
been real life, I would have a lot of explaining to do and probably
plenty of free time to work on those explanations.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't real, though. The scene played out on a sophisticated
piece of machinery used to train Austin police officers on
shoot/don't shoot situations.
</P>
<P>
   A weapon converted to shoot laser ``bullets'' is hooked to a
computer that tracks the way the weapon is aimed, counts rounds and
scores hits. A video gives you the perspective of a police officer
and puts you in a situation in which you have only seconds to
decide whether to shoot.
</P>
<P>
   In the scenario played for me, my partner and I stopped a van. I
was in the passenger seat and my screen colleague told me to cover
the passenger side of the vehicle we had stopped. As he approached
the van, the driver threw it in reverse, knocking my partner down.
</P>
<P>
   Then the driver got out and approached. Everything from then on
was reaction driven by adrenaline. The next thing I know, I fired
and the driver of the van went down.
</P>
<P>
   The computer gives the training officer providential power. With
a mere push of a button, he can show what would have happened had
the weapon not been fired.
</P>
<P>
   In my scenario, the van driver raised his hands in surrender. A
diplomatic butt chewing followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not a threat to you when he got out of that van,''
Detective Jerry Staton noted. He didn't have to say the rest: I
killed him anyway.
</P>
<P>
   It was but a taste of the firearms training cadets receive as
they prepare to take a place on the police force. Once on the
force, officers are periodically trained on the system.
</P>
<P>
   Staton was just one of dozens of officers who volunteer their
time to the Citizens Police Academy, a program designed to give
civilians insight into the making of an Austin police officer.
</P>
<P>
   It is an extensive course, but the Firearms Training Systems (or
FATS) is a curriculum highlight _ the ultimate video game and about
as close to real as technology can get.
</P>
<P>
   The scenarios vary. A drunken man waves a machete. Complicating
things, a baby is involved. A woman throws a knife at you in
another. In yet another, a man is choking a woman. None of the
situations is easy. Each is designed to test restraint and
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Before and after time on the FATS, there are lectures about
handling a weapon and a briefing on department's policies on using
deadly force. There is also attention paid to the luxury of time.
Time is always on the side of the Monday-morning quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Don't read this as an endorsement of police shootings or a
justification of the three incidents this year in which Austin
police officers fired at civilians. Two of those were fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Do read this for what it is intended to be _ a glimpse, however
fleeting, of what it feels like to be on the spot where your
information and field of vision are limited and a decision needs to
be made immediately.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the FATS was a real eye-opener. I think of a firearm as
a tool that came with a job (in the U.S. Army) I don't have
anymore. I like to think of myself as a peaceable kind of guy now,
one who wishes that no physical harm befall others.
</P>
<P>
   I was amazed at how easy it was for me to fire and keep firing
until the bad guy went down. He was, by the way, holding a knife.

 &HT;    At the top of haute couture
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ France Goldman runs a hand over a
late-model purchase and smiles.
</P>
<P>
   She has yet to take it on the road, but it looks good.
Well-built. Polished exterior. Handles well on the curves.
</P>
<P>
   The cost? Let's just say it was in the five-figure range. With
the proper maintenance, it can last years, even decades.
</P>
<P>
   Perfect. She gives one last approving look.
</P>
<P>
   Then she steps out of it, grabs a white plastic hanger and goes
into her bedroom closet for another.
</P>
<P>
   France Goldman doesn't know how many five-figure gowns she has
in her Boca West home, and it's better that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't count,'' she says. ``I don't want to count. Otherwise,
I would panic.''
</P>
<P>
   In a one-year buying spree _ January 1998 to January 1999 _
Goldman zipped to the top of the haute couture, or high-fashion,
world.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping for couture is nothing like buying khakis at the mall.
The clothes are hand-made only in Paris and tailored, again in
Paris, for individual clients. Design houses are discreet about
costs, which can balloon several thousand dollars on the strength
of a few well-placed beads.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, eager to have it, now sits in the front row of
designers' semiannual runway shows. She picks the clothes she
likes, then consults with her husband, who carries the checkbook.
</P>
<P>
   She is a very new, very good customer. On her second trip to
Paris last July, she says, she ``went wild'' and bought an entire
wardrobe of the hand-tailored, one-of-a-kind, made-only-in-Paris
creations. How many dresses? She won't say.
</P>
<P>
   But designers said, ``Bonjour!'' For the March issue of W
magazine, both Christian Lacroix and Givenchy picked Goldman to
model their clothes for a story on haute couture clients. Goldman
was a natural choice _ she is a size 4, a former model, a perfect
fit for some designs.
</P>
<P>
   And ``reportedly the single largest buyer of couture,'' W wrote
under Goldman's name.
</P>
<P>
   That distinction is hard to prove. Even the number of couture
clients is fuzzy. Some say 300, some say 3,000. Anyone who can
afford a $20,000 ``business'' suit _ or how about a $100,000
evening dress? _ is welcome.
</P>
<P>
   But enough about money, says Goldman, who says she doesn't keep
track of price. She goes to Paris because, after years as a single,
struggling model with two young boys and one good pair of shoes,
she has the chance to pursue her passion _ beautiful, hand-made
clothes designed especially for her.
</P>
<P>
   So far, her husband approves. And why not? It was his idea.
</P>
<P>
   Enter France and David Goldman's home and make a quick right.
There, beside the piano, is a slightly larger-than-life statue of
France Goldman herself, wearing a turquoise strapless dress.
</P>
<P>
   The dress is the first couture outfit Goldman ever owned. ``It
was almost a perfect fit except the length,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   And the statue is a gift from her husband of one year, David. He
asked France's brother, a sculptor in Montreal, to make it before
the couple was married last March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a little ostentatious,'' France says, ``but
my husband liked it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was David who said, ``Let's try'' when they came across an
Ungaro couture trunk show at a ski resort in St. Moritz. She tried
on the turquoise column dress _ ``It looked a little Egyptian'' _
and he bought it.
</P>
<P>
   It was David who said, ``Come on, we'll go together'' when
France said she couldn't go to the Paris fashion shows because it
was during the school year, and her boys might need her. He
insisted, and she went for the first time last January.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, it's David who says, ``What do you need it for?''
and ``When are you going to wear it?'' and ``Do you really need
three gowns?'' when they make their twice-a-year trips to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   But he hardly ever says ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he has a limit, but I haven't heard it yet,'' France
says.
</P>
<P>
   David Goldman is proud of his wife. ``When you're with somebody
you care about, you're sensitive to their desires,'' he says. ``I'm
with France. She loves fashion, she eats fashion. Going to the
couture shows is something she dreamt about.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's that.
</P>
<P>
   France is 40. David is 57. Friends introduced them four years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, France was a model in Boca, working the
country-club and resort fashion shows that she now attends and
hosts.
</P>
<P>
   Her life was this: daughter of an interior decorator in
Montreal, an upper-middle-class childhood, lessons in dressmaking
from her mother's seamstress. She started learning English,
reluctantly, at age 21 when she started modeling. She did
television commercials, catalog work, ads for beer and wine.
</P>
<P>
   With two children and her first husband, she moved to Boca about
10 years ago and continued modeling. Divorce was tough, money-wise,
and she raised the boys alone. Eager to remain elegant, she adopted
an all-black wardrobe, shopped at boutique sales and got discounts
when she modeled for department stores. She had one good pair of
shoes and one good bag. Then she met David.
</P>
<P>
   His life: the first of seven children, son of a small
manufacturer in Boston, entrepreneur. He borrowed money to buy a
series of businesses, including machine-tool companies that make
car and airplane parts. Now he imports cobalt and is president of
the Goldman Financial Group, based in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to Boca in 1993 after looking at 200 homes around the
state. It was this place _ a two-story home with Venetian decor
that looks deceptively small from the road _ or Fisher Island in
Miami, he says. But Fisher Island's golf course had only nine
holes.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman worries about fitting in down here, which is why he
won't talk about the Paris shopping trips in dollars and cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll think we're brash, gross people,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And, ``It ruins it if the person's only looking at the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember, these are the most beautiful, best-made clothes in the
world, he says earnestly. ``Why spend the money? I can see people
saying that,'' he adds. ``If I was 21, I wouldn't understand it. I
was making $50 a week. This is not understandable for someone who
was never part of this world.''
</P>
<P>
   But hey. He's part of it now.
</P>
<P>
   France Goldman does not bounce around the house in $40,000
dresses.
</P>
<P>
   But she's not in a T-shirt and flip-flops, either.
</P>
<P>
   She wears tennis clothes, or today's ``Boca uniform'' of Armani
khakis and pink Chanel top. She is a room mother at her boys'
private school, helping with field trips and parties. She spends
every Sunday through Thursday evening with Jonathan, 12, and
Matthieu, 10.
</P>
<P>
   She keeps a stash of Barbies at the house to give to young girls
who might visit. She contributes to charities. Last Christmas, she
and David donated 50 Furbies for a Ballet Florida fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Couture, she says, is not their life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our little treat,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She stands in her dressing room-slash-office, looking through a
rack of recent buys. The sun through the skylight touches her Louis
Vuitton day planner and fashion books and Diana and Monica Lewinsky
bios. In the living room, Celine Dion sings from hidden speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Here. Goldman holds up some of her favorites. A Gaultier jacket
made of fur and antique embroidered purses. A Christian Dior dress
of woven ribbon. A Pierre Balmain gold jacket and olive pants with
fur trim. A Givenchy black sleeveless embroidered dress with train.
</P>
<P>
   She wears them to the opera, perhaps, or to a special party.
She's careful. She's done nothing more than lose a few beads.
``Don't jinx me,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   When Goldman decides to buy a couture outfit, this is what
happens:
</P>
<P>
   She consults with her husband. If they argue, she usually wins.
</P>
<P>
   She visits the design house while they are in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   She stands while as many as seven people take her measurements
in front of a three-way mirror. David watches from a nearby couch,
sipping coffee. A fitting can take hours.
</P>
<P>
   She gets a discount of 35 percent to 40 percent if she fits the
outfit shown on the runway, because another does not have to be
made from scratch. (If it has to be made, she must wait several
weeks before a package marked ``Paris'' arrives at her door.)
</P>
<P>
   She rarely meets the designers. ``They're artists. They're never
around.''
</P>
<P>
   She flies back to Paris or New York for fittings.
</P>
<P>
   She gets free alterations.
</P>
<P>
   She gets free delivery.
</P>
<P>
   She gets the name of a good Paris dry cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   Then, once she wears the outfit for an event, she puts it away
for the rest of the season, packed full-length in acid-free paper.
</P>
<P>
   She might wear it the next season. Or the one after that.
</P>
<P>
   Some outfits, Goldman says, she still hasn't found the occasion
to wear.
</P>
<P>
   And the next trip to Paris is just four months away.

 &HT;    Collecting the fine art of couture
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ You'll have to excuse Iris Apfel today.
She has the flu.
</P>
<P>
   She was going to model a few of her hundreds, no, ``hundreds and
hundreds and hundreds'' of haute couture outfits, but she's just
not up to it.
</P>
<P>
   She offers a glass of water instead.
</P>
<P>
   (Note the coaster. It is a piece of plastic made to look like a
slice of ham.)
</P>
<P>
   Apfel, of Palm Beach, is a collector. ``One of the greatest
shoppers in the Western world,'' she calls herself.
</P>
<P>
   If she were feeling better, maybe she'd show off her stashes of
spinets, or antique church vestments or 18th-century dog beds.
</P>
<P>
   But not today. She rifles through the fat rack of clothing that
crowds her entryway and lifts out a coat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oof,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Haute couture is heavy. It has linings and interlinings and
padding to make it fit perfectly. That's why she's bought so much,
Apfel says. Couture is art.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad it's dying, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Apfel started collecting clothes in the 1950s, with a few pairs
of beaded pantyhose from the French design house Lanvin.
</P>
<P>
   She has Japanese obis, outfits from every major designer and
rows and rows of Geoffrey Beene, who happens to be a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Museum curators admire Apfel because she was at it long before
vintage clothes were cool. And they love to watch her style, from
her ``Is that the Old Navy gal?'' glasses on down.
</P>
<P>
   Apfel, for example, once converted a Middle Eastern slingshot
into a dandy necklace. She liked the wooden wishbone shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iris will never look like anyone else in the room,'' says
Ellen Shanley, costume curator at the Fashion Institute of
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of thinking of couture as art, she's really unique,''
says Richard Martin, curator of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's
Costume Institute. ``She's one of those women whose closets we're
most likely to raid.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin and friends make a game of describing her outfit after
parties. ``There's always a bracelet under her sleeve you don't
notice until halfway through dinner,'' Martin says.
</P>
<P>
   Apfel, a New York native and former art history major, is
flattered. ``Fashion is social history,'' she says. ``I don't think
it should be put out to pasture. And if I can wear it as well,
that's a double whammy.''
</P>
<P>
   But damned if she's going to pay today's sky-high couture
prices. ``Do I look like I'm certifiable?'' she snaps.
</P>
<P>
   How old are you, Ms. Apfel? ``I'm a lady of a certain age.
Whatever that means.''
</P>
<P>
   How much do you spend on these clothes? She sidesteps. ``Couture
gets more and more costly,'' she says. ``It never made money for
any of the design houses. It's done to perpetuate the name and
glamorize the perfumes and the ready-to-wear clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   But really, how much? She won't say. She remembers chasing a
gray Lanvin coat down the Rue St. Honore in Paris in the late '50s
and paying just $300. No small amount back then, but compare it to
today's prices!
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years she hasn't bought a thing. She asked about
a nice Galliano skirt recently. ``They said they'd give it to me
for $38,000. I said, `Thank you very much.' '' She nearly sniffs.
(Of course, she said no.)
</P>
<P>
   Bravo, says her husband of 51 years, Carl. He supports her
scrounging and bargaining, and complains only when she indulges her
weakness for feathered coats. They're ``so impractical,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the Apfels run Old World Weavers, a company based in
New York that provides textiles for top interior decorators.
They've worked for the White House, the Flagler Museum, the Norton.
They honeymooned in Palm Beach and have lived here more than 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   Now, quite frankly, they are running out of room for Apfel's
clothes. ``I have more than I need or want,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not even her favorite collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``If push comes to shove,'' she says pertly, ``I'll go with my
accessories.''

 &HT;    Craig Kilborn goes big-time network with `Late Late Show'
 &HT;    By Kevin Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Arrogant. Sexist. Good hair.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Craig Kilborn, the one-time host of Comedy Central's
``The Daily Show,'' is often described.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, the hair has been consistent,'' Kilborn cracks. ``I wash
it everyday and use a little bit of gel.''
</P>
<P>
   And the other adjectives?
</P>
<P>
   ``Aw, it's just a little act I do,'' he shrugs. ``As a viewer,
it's somebody I'd like to see. But I'm actually kind of boring in
real life.''
</P>
<P>
   If you like your humor served up with a
I-know-it-all-and-you-don't smirk, Kilborn's your man. Starting
this week, that sometimes annoying smirk goes big-time network. For
2 1/2 years, the 36-year-old acid-tongued host made ``The Daily
Show'' one of TV's funniest programs. No wonder. Pretty-boy Kilborn
possesses two made-for-TV attributes: He's ladies-man smooth and
has a killer delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a plastic gun,'' a ``Daily Show'' writer once said,
``shooting cop-killer bullets.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the former SportsCenter anchor is firing those bullets as
host of ``The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn.'' The lanky
Minnesota native replaces Tom Snyder, one of TV's few remaining
dinosaurs. That's like yanking ``I Love Lucy'' and replacing it
with, say, ``Dawson's Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   The new ``Late Late Show'' will look nothing like Snyder's. For
starters, Kilborn will have a studio audience. Nothing ``Tonight
Show''-ish, though. Only 80 people. The producers say they want a
show that looks very intimate.
</P>
<P>
   You can also expect a drastic set change. The show is supposed
to take place in the den of Kilborn's lavish Hollywood Hills home.
That means you'll see big leather chairs, closets, a bar (!) and a
spectacular Hollywood view. Like Mister Rogers (or maybe Playboy's
Hef), Kilborn will often stroll over to his closet and take out a
jacket. If ratings are pretty bad, expect Kilborn to walk over to
the bar a lot, too.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Jay Leno or David Letterman, Kilborn will have no band
and no goofy sidekick. But he will have his Daily Show signature
piece ``5 Questions.''
</P>
<P>
   I played ``1 Question'' with Kilborn.
</P>
<P>
   Which is the better network? CBS or Comedy Central?
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously CBS, because of Sammo Hung!''
</P>
<P>
   Kilborn is a welcome addition to the late night arena and should
keep college-aged kids _ and probably countless baby boomers _ up
late. You know, it's funny how the mold of a late night talk show
host has evolved from IBM conservative to smart-mouthed MTV cool.
Kilborn is certainly the latter. But he's also a cocksure, loose
cannon who doesn't know when to keep his mouth shut.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``The Daily Show'' once suspended Kilborn for making
sexist remarks in Esquire about one of the show's female
co-creators.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bad joke,'' he admits.
</P>
<P>
   Listen up, Craig. Sometimes the wisecracking bit is screamingly
funny. But sometimes it's just downright mean. You'll do well at
CBS if you learn the difference.

 &HT;    Gen X cats can't claw way out of `Squad' script
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Palm Beach Post-Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ How bad is ``The Mod Squad''?
</P>
<P>
   It's so bad, it's funny. You'll scream when you hear '90s
characters spout such super-bad '70s phrases as ``Ya dig,'' ``Right
on!'' and ``pig.'' You'll howl at the garish hippie clothes
(vision-impairing plaid pants, dusty Levi jeans jackets and too
many brown and orange shirts). You'll crack up whenever one of the
uninspired actors intones such time-worn cop cliches as, ``I had to
call for backup.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh, how about calling for a better script?
</P>
<P>
   A more appropriate title for this film would've been The Odd
Squad. Everything about this mess of a movie is odd. The oddest
thing of all is that ``The Mod Squad'' got made.
</P>
<P>
   Where are Michael Cole, Peggy Lipton and Clarence Williams III
when you need them? The original Mod Squad stars certainly could
teach this woeful Gen X crop (Claire Danes, Omar Epps and Giovanni
Ribisi) a thing or two.
</P>
<P>
   You probably remember the premise: Three cats, er, we mean, kids
were on their way to the joint. Linc Hayes (Epps) is the cool,
angry one from the 'hood who likes to burn up stuff. Pete Cochrane
(Ribisi) is the snarling, wild (and most annoying!) one who likes
lifting stuff. And Julie Barnes (Danes) is the blond hottie who
likes beating up people and drinking bottles of rum.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of doing time, the three get tapped to serve as
undercover cops. After all, as their tough-talking captain (Dennis
Farina) barks, ``These kids can get into a thousand places we
can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Their first case: Bust up a seedy club that's a front for a
teen-age prostitute ring. But, before you can say, ``Solid,'' our
pimply-faced heroes are up to their turtlenecks (yes, we see '70s
turtle necks in hot L.A.!) in dirty cop scandals, missing drugs and
secret meetings in abandoned warehouses. If you squint, you can see
Starsky and Hutch, Mannix and Columbo in the background.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mod Squad'' fails on all levels and is the clear
front-runner for the worst film of 1999. Epps and Danes are
particularly disappointing. While talented, both were unable to
elevate the weak material they were handed. (Send angry letters to
screenwriters Stephen Kay, Scott Silver and Kate Lanier.)
Meanwhile, Ribisi, fresh from ``Saving Private Ryan'' and perhaps
best known as Phoebe's brother on ``Friends,'' is the kind of
smart-alecky kid you don't mind slapping upside the head a few
times.
</P>
<P>
   The film's only bright spots are Eddie Griffin as one of Linc's
former running buddies and ``The Practice's'' Steve Harris as an
Internal Affairs investigator. The problem: Both only get about
three minutes of screen time.
</P>
<P>
   Odd, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE MOD SQUAD''
</P>
<P>
   Rated R: Violence, profanity, sexual situations
</P>
<P>
   Running time: 1 hour, 34 minutes
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A laughably bad mess of a movie that trashes ``The
Mod Squad's'' good name.

 &HT;    Wreck 'n' roll
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The crowd is screaming, the announcers are
hyperventilating, the skaters are rolling around on the floor
pulling each other's hair. Roller derby _ that blue-collar brawler
of a quasi-sport (and television staple) _ has returned, billed as
``Rollerjam.''
</P>
<P>
   The updated version features a more ``Baywatch'' approach to the
female skaters (tight zippered tops and flowing locks) and some of
the Springer-esque feel of professional wrestling _ a potent brew
of cleavage and carnage.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Brian Gamble, the goateed blocker from the black-clad,
bad-boy New York Enforcers, shouted at the end of a recent match,
``We're the baddest team in the whole (gosh-darned) league, and
we'll bust anybody's (rear end) that wants to get up on the track
with us!''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, those Enforcers are so b-b-b-bad to the bone. Recently, in
fact, Gamble found himself in Atlanta with Laura Hyzer of a rival
team, the Texas Rustlers. He reached into his gym bag and pulled
out ... not brass knuckles, but a Ziploc bag full of Rice Krispies
marshmallow treats. The Enforcer broke off a gooey chunk and shared
it with the Rustler, who smiled sweetly and gave him a back rub as
thanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's supposed to be the mean one, I'm supposed to be the nice
one,'' explained Hyzer, nicely.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so we're not talking blood feuds. We're talking '90s
marketing applied to a competition that ran out of gas in the '70s,
and now features children and even grandchildren of some of the
original rollers.
</P>
<P>
   The revival is the work of the Nashville Network, which has seen
its ratings rise about 50 percent overall since ``Rollerjam''
debuted in January, and up to 300 percent among teen-age boys. Some
country music fans are outraged, but the country music channel is
attracting advertisers such as Sony PlayStation and the hit teen
movie ``Varsity Blues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hitting a real young audience that TNN doesn't reach,
which is what we really wanted,'' says Rick Cornish, research
manager for CBS Cable, the parent company of the Nashville Network.
There are already plans to sell the show around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The shows, which air from 8 to 10 p.m. Fridays and are repeated
from 5 to 7 p.m. Saturdays, are taped at an arena at Universal
Studios Florida in Orlando, Fla. There are six teams of five men
and five women each. Women skate against women for a quarter, then
men against men. There are bad teams and good teams, and the
``rules'' seem to involve getting one skater, a ``jammer,'' to
skate through a knot of the opposing team's ``blockers.'' But the
real bloodlust from the fans seems to come when somebody throws in
a quasi-wrestling move like ``the Eliminator,'' sort of a body slam
on skates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most parents are proud if their kids are doctors or lawyers,''
says Hyzer, a former Atlantan who's rollin'. ``My dad's proud cause
I beat people up.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many roads to ``Rollerjam'' _ some skaters are former
Olympic speedskaters, some played hockey or kickboxed, one's a
former ``American Gladiator'' and Gina Lombardo is a ``cream corn
wrestling champion'' (two years running) at Daytona Beach's Bike
Week.
</P>
<P>
   Hyzer is an odd duck in this flock. A former Junior Olympics
skater (her proud dad, Walter, owns a skating center in Cumming,
Ga.), the 20-year-old was on an academic scholarship at the
University of Georgia when she auditioned for ``Rollerjam.'' She
moved to Orlando, but continues her UGA studies in chemical
engineering via computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to really be in great shape,'' she says. ``It's
physically demanding. Some mornings I wake up, I feel like I've
been in a car wreck.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't know how to land right, you're history,'' agrees
Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike such break-from-the-pack ``Rollerjam'' stars as the
200-pound Jeannet Abraham, aka ``The Minister of Pain,'' or some of
the women like the self-styled ``Bod Squad,'' whose zippers seem to
get lower as the matches go on, Hyzer radiates wholesomeness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I smile too much,'' she says, smiling broadly. ``They told me
that I've got to stop smiling so much.'' And she adds, in reference
to some of the other queens of the rink, ``I'm out there to skate.
I'm not out there to flash myself to the crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   The original roller derby was invented in 1935, but it was the
new medium of television that made it so popular. In the late '40s,
before ``I Love Lucy'' or ``The Honeymooners,'' it was one of the
most-watched TV shows in prime-time on both CBS and ABC. The
sports' popularity peaked in the early '70s, when Joanie Weston
reigned as a San Francisco Bay Bomber and Raquel Welch starred in
the movie ``Kansas City Bomber.''
</P>
<P>
   After the sport folded and laid dormant for 25 years, it was
revived by Jerry Seltzer, son of Leo Seltzer, roller derby's
inventor. The younger Seltzer now holds the title of commissioner
of the World Skating League, although the league exists mainly in
the one rink at Universal Studios.
</P>
<P>
   Hyzer wasn't even born when the original roller derby took its
final fall in 1973. Although some original rollers are now coaches
and trainers, Hyzer is part of the new generation, at home on
inline skates and Polymax floors instead of wooden rinks. But some
things never change.
</P>
<P>
   She recalls her ``Rollerjam'' debut, which airs Friday night.
``I got a bloody lip after a fall. The cameraman was right in my
face, filming. I said, `No, don't shoot me with blood on my face.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, 'No, this is great!'''

 &HT;    Preachy release from Grisham good, but not his best
 &HT;    By Jay Milner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Grisham, the Mississippi lawyer who writes a best-selling
semi-mystery novel every year, is something of a phenomenon in more
ways than one. In this time of almost anything goes in the way of
sex and violence in our entertainment media forms, Grisham's
stories never delve into either, but still sell like the proverbial
hotcakes.
</P>
<P>
   That is to say, his heroes and heroines never wind up in bed
together and there are no car chases or exploding buildings and
that sort of thing that's so prevalent in today's books and movies
and TV action shows. Grisham's most recent books, in point of fact,
make me wonder if perhaps he hasn't been ``born again'' in a
religious sense.
</P>
<P>
   Last year there was his ``Street Lawyer,'' in which the
protagonist quit his high-powered job with one of Washington,
D.C.'s most prominent law firms to take on cases of street people
who couldn't afford to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Now along comes Grisham's 1999 book, ``The Testament''
(Doubleday) with a recovering alcoholic D.C. attorney who risks his
life in a search for a missionary lady who has inherited billions
from her eccentric father, who leaped from his office window to his
death, after writing his last will and testament leaving his long
lost daughter, the missionary, all his billions and disinheriting
his other seven children who are spoiled rotten and mean.
</P>
<P>
   As the story begins, Nate O'Riley, a litigator par excellence,
has just completed a term in an addiction clinic. He is a
recovering alcoholic, recovering for the third or fourth time, in
fact, after falling off the wagon each time he is released back
into the real world to practice law. This time, his boss lawyer
convinces him to take on the task of finding the heir to a recent
client's mega fortune after said client has leaped to his death
immediately after writing a new will leaving everything, meaning
billions, to his illegitimate daughter who is somewhere in the
swampy wilds of Brazil catering to the spiritual and medical needs
of the Indians there. She is a doctor missionary, who apparently
doesn't want to be found by the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   Nate's journey into the snakey, alligator and
I-don't-know-what-all infested swamps is filled with many
unexpected adventures and, when he finally finds her, she refuses
to come back with him or even sign the necessary papers to denounce
her inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   But Nate and Rachel bond in a strange manner as the story moves
along. She exerts an influence on Nate's attitude toward life and
he, apparently, reaches her in ways he cannot understand, but
senses.
</P>
<P>
   Grisham doesn't exactly preach in this book, but he comes close.
Since he has the knack for moving the story along at an absorbing
clip, this doesn't really get in the way. I read this one straight
through, just as I have other Grisham books, but I'd have to say it
isn't my favorite by any means.
</P>
<P>
   But what the hey, the man turns them out year in and year out
and they all keep selling big, so any complaints, especially from
someone who tries to write books himself now and then has to come
out sounding like sour grapes.
</P>
<P>
   So, I won't say some things I might feel like I'd like to say.

 &HT;    A fresh take on Stevie Ray Vaughn
 &HT;    By Don McLeese
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Over the course of his recording career, Stevie
Ray Vaughan didn't alter his musical convictions so much as
transform the musical climate surrounding him. Amid the reverence
with which Vaughan is almost universally held today, it might be
hard to remember what a daunting challenge it was for him to rescue
the blues from cliche, to revitalize the music in a manner that
would transcend revivalism. It's hard to recall a time when he
wasn't a guitar god immortalized with a statue by the river, but a
skinny kid, sweet and shy, whose entire life was wrapped up on
those six strings.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Vaughan is memorialized as much for his mythic image
_ the guitarist as border gunslinger in the Clint Eastwood/Sergio
Leone mode _ and his tragic end as he is for his artistry, but the
reissue of his recording studio catalogue with Double Trouble
offers the opportunity once again to approach this music fresh.
Each of the four albums he cut with the band in the '80s comes in a
remastered, expanded edition with previously unissued bonus tracks,
an interview segment and new liner notes. There is also a new
compilation titled ``The Real Deal: Greatest Hits Volume 2,''
though its selection largely will be redundant for Vaughan
diehards. Initiates will find ``Volume 1'' to be a better sampler.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Vaughan and band released their ``Texas Flood''
debut in 1983, the blues had long been considered a musical
anachronism in rock circles, a spent force, an indulgence of
guitarists who had nothing new to say and took way too long to say
it. More than 10 years after the guitar group Ten Years After, the
very notion of blues-rock sounded like a bad Woodstock flashback.
The power-trio format imposed additional limitations, along with
the inevitable comparisons to Cream and Hendrix. That Vaughan would
ultimately be embraced as an equal _ or even an inspiration _ by
the likes of B.B. King, Buddy Guy and Eric Clapton seemed about as
likely as the Black Crowes one day being hailed as trailblazers by
the Rolling Stones.
</P>
<P>
   It's little wonder, then, that the guitarist who asserts himself
so aggressively with the flurry of notes opening ``Love Struck
Baby'' sounds like a man on a mission, an artist with something to
prove, knowing that he has to be better than good to put the charge
back into the blues. Though Vaughan's major claim to fame beyond
the clubs of Texas was his guest guitar on David Bowie's ``Let's
Dance,'' 1983's ``Texas Flood'' debut offers no concession to rock
fashionability. Instead, the music hits so hard that it cannot be
denied, while daring the listener to resist the punch.
</P>
<P>
   Though his singing is merely serviceable at this point and the
material hit-and-miss, the music exists for only one purpose: to
allow Stevie to play his guitar. It is plain that he has already
mastered every trick in the book, and that he can't resist the
temptation to cram practically everything he knows into every solo.
It's a blessing, then, that the rhythm section of drummer Chris
Layton and bassist Tommy Shannon plays with so much focus and
efficiency, supporting the guitar rather than competing with it.
Highlighting the four bonus additions is a live performance of
Lonnie Mack's ``Wham'' that all but reduces the stage to cinders.
</P>
<P>
   While Vaughan's command of tone and bluesy focus remained
consistent throughout his career, each subsequent album represents
a progression, an improvement upon its predecessor. With the next
year's ``Couldn't Stand the Weather,'' both the title track and
``Cold Shot'' reflect a subtlety that was little in evidence on
``Texas Flood,'' while the expanded edition shows his voracious
appetite for all manner of bluesiness, from the jazzy
sophistication of ``Stang's Swang,'' reminiscent of Kenny Burrell,
to the raw assault of Hound Dog Taylor's ``Give Me Back My Wig'' (a
bonus studio outtake).
</P>
<P>
   Where his emulation of Jimi Hendrix had long played a larger
part in his live performance, the cover of ``Voodoo Chile'' shows
his confidence in inviting such comparison on album. Once fearful
of being dismissed as just another Hendrix imitator, it's as if he
were saying, ``Yes, I can do this. But it isn't all I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Hendrix with the Experience and Clapton with Cream, Double
Trouble had its limitations for Vaughan, who'd spread the
possibilities of the power-trio format pretty thin over the course
of two albums. Thus the recruitment of keyboardist Reese Wynans
during the recording of 1985's ``Soul to Soul'' proved crucial,
allowing Vaughan to pick his spots instead of filling all available
space and giving the music the interplay of another soloist. From
the sweet lyricism of the ``Goin' Home'' instrumental to the
prophetic anthemry of ``Change It,'' the album shows the band
soaring beyond the shuffles and slow blues that had previously
dominated its repertoire. Highlighting the bonus selections is an
extended medley of Hendrix's ``Little Wing''/``Third Stone from the
Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Following three albums in three years, and the ceaseless grind
of the touring schedule to promote them, ``In Step'' sounds like a
lifeline. It was the first music from Vaughan since he had left the
touring treadmill, entered rehab and kicked drugs, and the
reflectiveness of its material reflects a survivor's maturity.
Songs such as ``Crossfire,'' ``Tightrope'' and ``Wall of Denial''
are plainly about so much more than just playing guitar, while the
album-closing ``Riviera Paradise'' instrumental showed just how
much he had grown as guitarist as well. Where his playing once had
all the subtlety of a fistfight, this sounds like a whispered
prayer. Among the four bonus live tracks from an '89 concert,
``Texas Flood'' brings Vaughan's musical progression full circle.
</P>
<P>
   The albums thus document Vaughan's development from an
instrumental virtuoso into a well-rounded, triple-threat artist, as
powerfully expressive in his songs and vocals as he was on his
guitar. With his final sessions for the ``Family Style'' album that
he recorded with brother Jimmie, he never got around to cutting his
``Electric Ladyland'' or his ``Layla,'' but the progression of his
studio work with Double Trouble suggests that he was headed in that
direction. He seemed to be on the verge of reaching his creative
peak when that 1990 helicopter crash cut his life short.

 &HT;    Bullock's iron grip on Texas Senate is not mourned
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Sen. David Sibley purposely kept quiet on his
proposal to name the new Texas State Museum for former Lt. Gov. Bob
Bullock. Sibley (R-Waco) didn't tell anyone the proposal was coming
until he put forward his suggestion on the Senate floor Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Had Bullock known, Sibley said, ``I'm afraid he'd come down here
and whip all of us ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get a drive-by chewing,'' shot back Sen. Rodney Ellis
(D-Houston), ``we're all on your side.''
</P>
<P>
   Until January, Bullock ruled the Senate with an iron hand _ and
legendary temper. Now that he and his occasional
middle-of-the-night phone calls are a thing of the past, senators _
slowly at first _ are beginning to stretch their arms under the
leadership of Republican Rick Perry.
</P>
<P>
   While some say the Senate seems less focused, and a top House
official called it ``rudderless,'' the senators seem happier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The will of the Senate is better reflected when there isn't
just one person there, enforcing it with terror,'' said another
senator. ``Under Bullock, there wasn't anything that wasn't
scripted.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullock was the state's tax-collecting comptroller for 16 years
before his election as lieutenant governor in 1990. Even before he
took his hand off the Bible, he had intimate knowledge of and
enormous control over everything that happened in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   He also had a temper that could melt a statue _ and many a
senator, lobbyist and occasional journalist. Even two months after
he left the Senate _ he now hangs his hat at Public Strategies
Inc., where he counsels business clients _ almost all of the
senators would talk about his style only after reporters swore a
blood oath that they wouldn't be identified. Bullock, when he
learned the subject of this column, refused _ in characteristically
profane, insulting terms _ to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   When he headed the Senate, Bullock was up early and personally
set the Senate's daily order of business. When the Senate conferees
on the appropriations bill met with their House counterparts, the
Senate chairman carried a telephone to the meeting table, so he
could quickly report to Bullock.
</P>
<P>
   Perry delegates more to senators and staff. And he has farmed
out more of the power for controlling the flow of legislation,
senators say.
</P>
<P>
   While Bullock worked through committee chairs, and Perry also
meets with his chairs on a weekly basis, ``more power has evolved
to the other senators,'' said one of them. ``It allows senators to
be senators.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing some new talent emerge,'' said another. ``I'm
pleasantly surprised. I think we've got the same level of effort,
if not better.''
</P>
<P>
   A former House member who served the past eight years as
agriculture commissioner, but never in the Senate, Perry emulates
the consensus leadership style of House speakers like Pete Laney
rather than Bullock's dictatorial model, one senator said.
</P>
<P>
   Perry on Perry: ``I'm no Bob Bullock. I mean, Governor Bullock
had his style, which was very much hands-on, from the concept of
controlling a great deal of the ebb and flow of the Senate. I'm a
bit more of allowing the Senate and the senators to conduct their
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullock was known for calling lobbyists on various sides of an
issue into a room and telling them not to leave until they had come
up with a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perry calls people in and holds their hands,'' one senator
said. ``Bullock was more into breaking hands.''
</P>
<P>
   A lobbyist and former legislator said Bullock's absence is
``infinitely better for the system, because now the dynamics of the
system can work without an oppressive influence.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullock so controlled the Senate that his influence ``repressed
ideas and the system functioning in a spontaneous way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bullock did a lot of fine things,'' the lobbyist acknowledged.
``I think they could have been done with a lot less
heavy-handedness. I think the same goals could have been
accomplished with a lot less bodies along the trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I would think that those senators would be enjoying
their emancipation'' _ pursuing their own agendas _ ``and they're
getting to do that without having to stop and ask if they can have
a bathroom break,'' the lobbyist said. Dave McNeely writes about

   MOSCOW _ The Russian army offers dismal pay, wretched living
conditions and a reputation stained by its disastrous experiences
in Chechnya and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   It is a bleak world for army recruiters. Fortunately, Dana
Borisova is on their side.
</P>
<P>
   Blonde and lithesome, Borisova, 22, was hired five years ago to
host a television show called ``Army Store.'' She has gone on to
become a Playboy cover model and wildly popular pinup girl for a
deteriorating army that needs all the morale-boosting it can get.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mention the army and the first thing people used to think
about was a bunch of old generals. Now, they think of Dana,'' said
Alexander Ilyin, the show's producer and co-host.
</P>
<P>
   ``Army Store'' is part MTV, a dash of Saturday Night Live and a
dose of defense-promotional films featuring the gee-whiz machinery
of a modern army -- jet fighters, tanks and helicopter gunships.
</P>
<P>
   But the half-hour belongs to Borisova, in miniskirt and an
abbreviated version of the blue-striped T-shirt worn by Russian
soldiers and sailors.
</P>
<P>
   While they love her in the ranks, the brass is not as charmed.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Defense Ministry dropped its financial support
for the show and banned Borisova and her crew from military bases.
But ``Army Store'' continues to survive with private sponsors and
high ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Army Store'' began in 1994 as an updated version of a
monotonous Soviet-era military show. That show, ``To Serve the
Soviet Union'' was nicknamed ``Fairy Tale'' by soldiers because of
its distance from reality.
</P>
<P>
   The officers in olive drab who hosted that show, with its boring
lectures and war documentaries, are gone, succeeded by the
fresh-faced Borisova, a 17-year-old university student when she was
hired. She had no TV experience, but became an instant sensation
among servicemen and civilians alike.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, in February 1997, she posed seminude atop a
tank for the Russian edition of Playboy, and her fame soared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may be the reason they are watching. But the secret of why
the program has lasted is that we're simply talking about common
problems in a common language that soldiers identify with,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Army Store'' offers a rapid-fire 30 minutes of rock-music
videos, skits by a couple of comic regulars doing Gomer Pyle
routines and video of Borisova's base visits, where she chats
sympathetically with eager young conscripts.
</P>
<P>
   Borisova's celebrity has brought marriage proposals and modeling
offers. There also have been negotiations with a Russian
manufacturer to produce a Barbie-like Dana doll.
</P>
<P>
   She also represents the only outward sign that Russia is seeking
to stem the rising rate of draft-dodgers and deserters, the result
of the country's economic woes and chronic problems of hazing and
corruption inside the military. Borisova posed last year for an
Uncle Sam-like poster with the message: ``Your Country Needs You.''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the peppery show became even more irreverent, taking
up normally taboo subjects. It featured pictures of lavish country
houses built for generals by the army while soldiers in the ranks
were going unpaid. It also showed young female officers
moonlighting at a strip club to earn extra money.
</P>
<P>
   Unamused, the brass discharged Ilyin, a career officer, when he
balked at giving the generals more control over the show's content.
The Defense Ministry eventually pulled its support for ``Army
Store'' last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the show endures. Base commanders still allow Borisova and
the crew to film, against orders from the top. When contacted, a
Defense Ministry spokesman declined to discuss ``Army Store.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're their best propaganda tool,'' said Ilyin of the show and
the army, ``but they don't realize it.''

 &HT;    A. Jones feels secure, mature
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ When Andruw Jones was hitting around
.200 last spring, there was a collective groan at Braves camp.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, following the success of Marquis Grissom and Kenny Lofton
in previous years, was getting a long look at the leadoff spot, so
the scrutiny was severe. And the experiment went nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   So Jones begins this spring 2-for-22, and it's no big concern
for the Braves. Last year's concerns have been replaced by the
knowledge that slow starts don't necessarily equal slow finishes.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 21, proved after last year's horrendous start that he
could hit 31 home runs in the No. 8 hole. He also hit .271, had 90
RBIs and stole 27 bases to became the youngest 25-25 player in
major-league history.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have found other leadoff hitters _ most recently Otis
Nixon _ and a new-found confidence in Jones, who has responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel really more comfortable this year than last year,
because a lot of people were talking about leadoff hitter and this
and that,'' said Jones, who probably will bat seventh this season.
``All that just kind of messed me up. This year, I really don't
think about it. I know I'm making the team; I know the center-field
job is mine; I've just got to do the job and get myself mentally
and physically prepared for the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones has improved recently, getting seven hits in his past 15
at-bats and improving his average from .091 to .243.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good,'' Jones said. ``I feel like I have my swing
right. I'm seeing the ball pretty good. Hopefully, I'll keep doing
that until the season starts.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he came into camp in better shape _ he's 13 pounds
lighter _ and smarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've got better instincts,'' Jones said. ``I got more
mature with what's going on around the baseball field and in the
clubhouse. And I think I know the league just a little bit
better.''
</P>
<P>
   And he learned a good bit about himself, facing the first real
adversity of his career. It might have been an unfair amount of
pressure, but he has learned to handle it.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the point that my season was so bad, to get a good
season, I think that made me really strong mentally,'' Jones said.
``I just kept working hard and thinking positive. I know what my
ability is. I just had to put it in my mind. Just do it and don't
think about it much.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitting coach Don Baylor said Jones still has the tendency to
try to crush fastballs and chase breaking balls, but they're
working on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to figure it out,'' Baylor said. ``I'm going to
help him figure it out _ how good he can really be. He has a very,
very bright future, as far as being one of those rare young players
that come along.''

 &HT;    They're back to `Black': Crowes return to rock
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In 1997, the Black Crowes were hitting
rock's bottom.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta group's psychedelic-flavored album, ``Three Snakes
and One Charm,'' had garnered some decent reviews but confounded
much of the hard-rock audience that constituted the band's core
following. A stint on the Grateful Dead-inspired Furthur tour
placed the Crowes more out of their element: Other than the Dead,
what outfit could compete against all that tie-dye?
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't about the music, and we were always about the
music,'' says Crowes lead singer Chris Robinson. ``At the end of
the day, we're a rock band, and we didn't fit in.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Crowes' fans can rest assured: The boys are back in
their element _ and back in town.
</P>
<P>
   With their latest _ and fifth _ release, ``By Your Side,'' the
Crowes return to their glory days as what Melody Maker magazine
dubbed ``the most rock 'n' roll rock 'n' roll band in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By Your Side'' was made in collaboration with Aerosmith
producer Kevin Shirley (Nine Lives), and it's easy to see the
connection: Both groups favor a raunchy, classic-rock sound. In the
Crowes' case, they spice it to a further degree with a gospel
influence, which is most prominent on ``Go Tell the Congregation,''
arguably the album's best cut. Other songs include ``Horse Head,''
a pull-no-punches look at heroin addiction, and ``Go Faster,'' a
rev-it-up rocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``This album is up compared to `Three Snakes,''' admits
Robinson. As for the raw feel of the recorded sound _ at times,
you'd swear it was a live album _ the singer credits that to
Shirley. ``We just wanted to strip it down and he said, `Cool.' He
came in the first day and said, `We're going to have fun.'''
</P>
<P>
   The band also got a boost from some new members, most notably
bassist Sven Pipien, who stepped in for Johnny Colt. (Also missing
in action is guitarist Marc Ford: ``We couldn't depend on him,''
says a nonplussed Robinson.)
</P>
<P>
   But much of the energy of ``By Your Side'' comes from the same
source it always has since the Crowes' inception in 1990, namely
the love-hate relationship between Chris and his brother, Rich, the
band's lead guitarist.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my stock answer,'' says Chris when the subject
inevitably arises. ``I know how talented he is. I love him with
everything in my body. I just don't like him all the time. That's
something about family.''
</P>
<P>
   Another thing Robinson doesn't like is the majority of today's
bands. He has little use for what's left of the grunge or
alternative movement: ``There's no dimension in that. It's just
heavy metal without the big hair.'' Nor does he care for groups
that head in a pop direction, although he admits to being good
friends with Hootie and the Blowfish's Darius Rucker and his
bandmates: ``They're super nice guys but our music is more on the
other side of the tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, Robinson hates trend-watchers. After surviving a
decade in rock, he's convinced it takes true talent to make it.
Those who want to keep on latching to the next big thing need not
apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might sell a couple of million records, but you're not
going to have a career,'' he says. ``The next big thing is usually
washing cars.''

is going. Hellen and Donald Nicol of North Palm Beach are going.
Unlike the Duthies, whose longest cruise has been one week, the
Nicols have been on six round-the-world cruises. And 60, and

Beacher, a world traveler, a multiple divorcee, a collector of
Buddhist art, a size 2, a New York ``living landmark,'' a speaker

<P>
   COXNET ENTERTAIN _ 0325 _ One of the most important figures in
Southern folk art, Lonnie Holley started his career 20 years ago by
carving the soft sandstone that steel mills use as molds. He's
known a world of trouble in his 49 years. He has been beaten, shot,
jailed. He has been abandoned, cheated, stolen from. He has watched
as his home of 18 years _ along with much of the art and debris he
carefully placed around it _ was bulldozed into a trench to make
way for an airport expansion. But nothing in a life of Job-like
tribulations has prepared him for the misfortunes of the past few
months. (Auchmutey, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) Art includes
4-column color photo of Lonnie Holley, a 1-column color photo of
artist standing by a sandstone art and a 1-column photo of a Holley

   WITH: VIDEO REVIEWS _ In ``Pleasantville,'' two '90s kids are
zapped into a '50s sitcom and slowly bring sex, color and rock 'n'
roll to the black-and-white world. The movie's lustrous mix of
monochrome and color is a marvel of digital wizardry. (Staff,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution) With 2 column color studio photograph
from the film.

<P>
   WITH: CD REVIEWS - Not an easy concept to wrangle, Cassandra
Wilson's latest project is at once seductive and a little
frustrating. The vocalist finds a kindred soul in Miles Davis: the
iconographic, iconoclastic jazz trumpeter who was among American
music's great conceptualists, and a master of soulful cool who knew
the gestural power of a single, sustained note. (Staff, Atlanta

the witness who testified in the government's antitrust case

 &HT;    You can tune out `EDtv,' and rent `Truman Show' instead
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ If you were asked to turn your life into
a 24-hour-a-day media event, to star in a continuous broadcast of
your every action, chances are you'd be smart enough to decline. If
so, you'd be way ahead of Ed Pekurny, the poor schmo who learns too
late in Ron Howard's ``EDtv'' that celebrity has its drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The more important question: If you were offered a chance to see
a less interesting, slightly altered replica of ``The Truman
Show,'' would you care enough to bother?
</P>
<P>
   No, you're right, reviewing movies by comparison is not fair,
but neither is life. If there were no ``Truman Show,'' then
``Edtv'' could be greeted as a pleasant enough, though overly
obvious, entertainment. Instead, its entire premise seems
unoriginal and stale. And you diehard optimists who hope ``EDtv''
will take the cameras-in-your-face dilemma to new, intriguing
levels are going to be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   The key difference between the two movies, of course, is that Ed
(Matthew McConaughey), a 31-year-old video store clerk, actually
volunteers for this exercise in national voyeurism. It's a ratings
stunt dreamed up by an insecure cable programmer (Ellen DeGeneres)
and ridiculed by the snide top executive (Rob Reiner), until the
show becomes a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the station starts dangling renewal bonuses in front
of Ed to get him to continue the electronic abuse. And the suits
begin fiddling with Ed's life, trying to shape and alter it to make
better television. When a newspaper poll finds the public doesn't
approve of Ed's whiny girlfriend Shari (Jenna Elfman), she gets
dumped and a slinky British actress with her own agenda (Elizabeth
Hurley) takes her place.
</P>
<P>
   Like many studio movies, though, ``Edtv'' is all set-up, little
follow-through. Once the gimmick gets established, the screenplay
by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel _ longtime collaborators of
Howard's _ has nowhere to go. The movie cuts away from Ed
occasionally to show groups of fans glued to the tube, following
his every move like a reality soap opera. And when he's had enough,
Ed has to find a way to break his contract with the station. That's
it, folks.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, we meet Ed's family and see how they cope with
peripheral fame. Someone had the clever idea to cast Woody
Harrelson as Ed's conniving brother, drawing on a physical
resemblance that is awfully persuasive. But brother Ray turns out
to be a one-joke liability. The same goes for Ed's mother (Sally
Kirkland) and a wheelchair-bound stepfather (Martin Landau), whose
lives are disrupted by the return of Ed's biological father (Dennis
Hopper).
</P>
<P>
   Another squandered angle concerns the way Ed's show is packaged
and sold. A strip at the bottom of the television screen features a
parade of sponsors, but only occasionally do they tie in with
events in the program to create a joke. Mostly, they seem like a
new approach to product placements _ actual ads within feature
films. Certainly that's the case with Pepsi, which gets the most
blatant mentions.
</P>
<P>
   The cast is fine, but there are no real standouts and
McConaughey's star power remains questionable. When you find
yourself looking forward to seeing more media personality cameos
instead of the main character, that's not a good sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Truman Show,'' by the way, is now available on video.
</P>
<P>
   ``EDtv''
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 stars
</P>
<P>
   Rated PG-13: Language, non-graphic sexual situation
</P>
<P>
   Running time: 2 hours., 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A less interesting, sitcom-deep satire built around
a voluntary ``Truman Show'' which grows tiresome for the subject
and the audience.

   CALIF-MISSING (Mi-Wuk Village, Calif.) _ An intense sweep by
police searching for suspects in the murder of a Eureka, Calif.,
woman and possibly one of two teenagers traveling with her have not

   CATHOLIC-PROTEST (San Francisco) _ Trhough 20 years of street

   TV-REVIEW-MUTINY (Undated) _ NBC tells the story Sunday night of

syrup is also well suited for marinades, and because of its
viscosity, a half-cup goes a long way. By DOUG BLACKBURN.

   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Stand at a Muni station with

   CAMPAIGN-FINANCE (Albany, N.Y.) _ For columnist and commentator

merely an instrument that works for him about half the time. A
Democrat, on the other hand, sees his party as something of a
religion and the party's leader as practically infallible. By

A FUNNY MOCKUMENTARY ON THE MISERY OF DATING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Myles Berkowitz's docucomedy ``20 Dates'' has already opened in
several markets, so it's mere coincidence that it hits Fort
Worth-Dallas on the same weekend as ``EDtv.'' But the parallels are
there: Both movies have a normal schmo dealing with his love life
on camera, in front of scores of strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Two differences, though: ``20 Dates'' is nonfiction, and
Berkowitz, unlike the my-life's-a-TV-show Ed in ``EDtv,'' has
trained his camera upon himself.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz explains this blatant bit of self-involvement:
Recently divorced and struggling to break into movies, he decided
to film his quest for love, killing two birds with one stone.
</P>
<P>
   Great idea, right? Well, to a point. If you're a veteran of the
dating scene, recall all your misfires and disasters, all those
times that you knew from the first few lines of conversation that
the person across the table wasn't for you. Now imagine filming all
that. Unless you're Berkowitz, the correct response to this is
``ugh.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence, your response to ``20 Dates'' depends on how much you can
take of Berkowitz's self-absorption. At least he has a sense of
humor about it; he includes interviews with many friends who
correctly assess him as a pushy, annoying, sexist pig. But a little
of him goes a long way, and even at a brief 88 minutes, ``20
Dates'' is about 20 minutes too long.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz takes side trips to discuss financing with his vulgar,
foul-mouthed producer (we never see the producer, leading to the
suspicion that his character is largely fictionalized), and to
listen to film historian Robert McKee's pompous discourses about
love and movies. But mostly, ``20 Dates'' is all about Berkowitz,
and the women he dates, some of whom are good sports about being
filmed, some of whom react with unusual although not totally
unexpected violence.
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds audacious, realize that however amusing it is, it
amounts to a ``Seinfeld'' episode that features nothing but Jerry.
And Woody Allen explored the dating scene to much more amusing
effect nearly 30 years ago in ``Play It Again, Sam.'' If you're in
the right mood, though, ``20 Dates'' could still work as a ``date''
movie _ but only if you've already established a relationship with
your companion.

<P>
   This is a crisis without a happy ending. Unless there is some
extraordinary change of heart by the Serbs _ and the violence this
past weekend makes it clear there is little chance of that _ the
Kosovo war is either going to end in a NATO bombardment or the
betrayal of the Kosovo Albanians who so credulously signed up for
``peace'' in Paris last week.
</P>
<P>
   It is even possible that we could both bomb the Serbs and betray
the Kosovars. We could even betray our own high principles _
democracy, human rights, and so on _ if we find that the Muslims of
Kosovo insist on independence rather than autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   The approach of international conflict in the Balkans has been
so slow, and so littered with the usual cliches of threat and
counter-threat, that it is difficult to realize that we are
approaching the endgame.
</P>
<P>
   Both NATO and Slobodan Milosevic have reached _ cliche again _
the point of no return. Serbia cannot surrender Kosovo to foreign
forces. NATO cannot back down from its obligations to the Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when the Kosovo delegation coldly signed away their
independence in return for limited self-government, the men and
women who had hitherto played a starring role in the drama
preferred to stay away. British foreign secretary Robin Cook was in
Bonn, as was French foreign minister Hubert Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
   Madeleine Albright said she ``wished she could be there'' _ she
could have been, of course _ but stayed in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The stars suddenly wanted out of the movie. No one _ save the
luckless U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, his Austrian EU colleague and
Russian negotiator Boris Mayorski wanted to be there. And Mayorski
sullenly refused to sign the documents as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   Russia was not going to be a party to this particular surrender
of Serb sovereignty, nor lend its name to a treaty which may lead
to a NATO war.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov may still warn
Milosevic of his behavior _ and condemn the slaughter of ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo _ but his cancelled trip to Washington shows
that Moscow is not going to join the NATO crusade. Nor are the
Russians unaware of the divisions within NATO.
</P>
<P>
   American enthusiasm for an offensive against Serbia has scarcely
wavered during the weeks of negotiations at Rambouillet and Paris.
But Europe's threats _ symbolized by Cook's finger-wagging
diplomacy _ have grown steadily fainter as the prospect of conflict
approached.
</P>
<P>
   Wars in Southeast Asia and the Middle East invariably spread to
neighboring countries, their effect rippling like an earthquake
throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   Why should Europe be any different? And this, remember, will be
a European war _ far from the United States, but well inside our
own continent.
</P>
<P>
   Once we start bombing Serbia, will Montenegro seek independence
_ and our protection _ from Belgrade? Will the Albanians of
Macedonia declare for the Albanians of Kosovo _ or, worse, a
greater Albania? Could Greece tolerate internal dissent in
Macedonia?
</P>
<P>
   Would the Bosnian Muslims _ an outside chance, this, but one
that NATO has thought about _ choose this moment to conclude
unfinished business with the Bosnian Serbs and retake the Drina
Valley?
</P>
<P>
   In London, we are backing the Americans (more or less). But the
closer they are to the Balkans, the less enthusiastic are our
European partners. Italy and Austria and Greece really do not want
a war. And who can blame them?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are cracks in the Serbian edifice. Milosevic's
opponents are being quietly wooed by NATO ambassadors who know that
two of Serbia's top military strategists were fired by the Yugoslav
president earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Serb ``democrats'' fear that a war will give Milosevic the
opportunity to declare martial law, crush the remaining free press
in Belgrade, arrest dissidents and, perhaps, seize back control of
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo Albanians would then be fair game for the Yugoslav armed
forces; since the Kosovars would invariably support NATO, they
would be regarded as a fifth column, vicious traitors who must be
ruthlessly exterminated.
</P>
<P>
   As usual this past weekend, we were looking after our own,
hoping to extract the Kosovo monitors before the Serbs could take
them hostage _ while leaving the Kosovars to their fate.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA will, for a while, abide by the treaty signed in Paris
last Thursday; they will wait for the autonomy that NATO guarantees
_ until it becomes clear that NATO will not ride to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   If NATO bombs the Serbs, will the KLA remain in their villages?
And if they do not _ and the Serbs attack the Kosovars _ will the
western armies in Macedonia help them? Alas, that is not what the
Kosovo delegation signed up for in Paris last week.
</P>
<P>
   So will the Kosovars themselves stay united? The Americans are
desperately worried that they will not; hence their insistence last
week that the Kosovo delegation should return to Pristina for
``necessary consultations,'' the need to remain unified and ``stay
in touch'' with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the sudden invitation to the Kosovo delegation to visit
NATO headquarters for a briefing on what they can expect _ and not
expect _ in the way of support.
</P>
<P>
   For if the Kosovo Albanians seek independence rather than
autonomy once a NATO bombardment begins, the European casus belli _
the refusal of the Serbs to abide by the Paris peace agreement
which they refused to sign _ disappears. And then the world will
ask why NATO has gone to war.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Milosevic might still, at the very last moment, give way.
But the odds are increasingly against it. Serb president Milan
Milutinovic promised in Paris last week that the Yugoslav armed
forces would fight in the event of a NATO attack.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Milosevic allowed the Serbs of Krajina to be driven
from their homes by the Croatians, and abandoned the Serbs of
western Bosnia. He is unlikely to bow to American pressure in order
to save Serb lives in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   So what chance of a happy ending? &QL;

 By MARCUS TANNER  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ As the West prepares for war against Serbia, fears
inevitably are being voiced that the conflict will throw the entire
region into chaos.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Balkan tinderbox'' theory was frequently wheeled out by
Western politicians in the early Nineties to justify a ``hands
off'' policy towards the conflict then raging in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Balkan chaos theories have a long pedigree, dating back at the
very least to the first and second Balkan wars of 1912 and 1913,
which involved Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia, Montenegro and
the Ottoman Empire in a series of constantly shifting, short-lived
combinations.
</P>
<P>
   General Sir Michael Rose, former commander of the U.N. troops in
Bosnia, revived the tinderbox theory Tuesday on the ``Today'' (BBC
Radio) program.
</P>
<P>
   Warning of a possible ``third Balkan war,'' he said: ``There's a
grave danger that an act of war carried out against Serbia by NATO
will spread into Bosnia and possibly into Macedonia.''
</P>
<P>
   The general's worries about Macedonia are certainly shared by
most observers, and by many Macedonians, too. Serbia's southern
neighbor declared its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991 and is
an inherently unstable state, in spite of the presence of more than
10,000 NATO peacekeepers on its northern border.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday Macedonia closed its two border crossings with Kosovo,
while President Kiro Gligorov appealed to NATO to lend his country
extra security guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   The flow of Albanian refugees into Macedonia already threatens
to destabilize the country's explosive ethnic mixture, pitting the
dominant Slavs against a large and restive Albanian minority.
</P>
<P>
   Relief organization officials said about 1,000 Kosovars crossed
the border in the last 24 hours alone.
</P>
<P>
   Albania itself is another obvious worry. Although the left-wing
government is less inclined to pander to pan-Albanian rhetoric than
its right-wing predecessor, Tirana would still find it extremely
hard to stay aloof from all-out war on the ground, especially if a
massive Serbian assault on the population threatened them with
annihilation.
</P>
<P>
   Further afield, there are other potential actors in the Serbian
drama; Turkey for one, the former ruling power in the Balkans and
self-appointed protector of Balkan Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Bulgaria. Sofia has no direct interest in war with
Belgrade, other than exaggerated worries that its nuclear power
station might be hit by accident if missiles start flying around.
What it has does have is a very real stake in Macedonia, which
Bulgarian nationalists have always considered an integral part of
Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   Their predatory interest is shared by the Serbs, who ruled
Macedonia in the 14th century and seized it back from Turkey _ to
the fury of the Bulgarians _ in the Balkan wars.
</P>
<P>
   So it is the collapse of Macedonia, rather than war in Serbia
and Kosovo, that is most likely to make the Balkan ``tinderbox''
theory a reality.
</P>
<P>
   Two countries in the region that are not likely to join any new
Balkan war are Romania and Greece. In Bucharest, there is a
principled opposition to the notion of outsiders interfering in a
sovereign state. But those worries are more than balanced out by a
strong commitment to joining the EU and NATO. So no opposition to
the West there.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Greeks, although they provided their Orthodox
brothers with a valued diplomatic lifeline when Belgrade was at war
in Bosnia, ties have cooled since then. Greek diplomats are
dismissing the chances of Athens being involved _ or even affected
_ by air strikes on Serbia. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ As the West prepares for war against Serbia, fears
inevitably are being voiced that the conflict will throw the entire
region into chaos.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Balkan tinderbox'' theory was frequently wheeled out by
Western politicians in the early Nineties to justify a ``hands
off'' policy towards the conflict then raging in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Balkan chaos theories have a long pedigree, dating back at the
very least to the first and second Balkan wars of 1912 and 1913,
which involved Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia, Montenegro and
the Ottoman Empire in a series of constantly shifting, short-lived
combinations.
</P>
<P>
   General Sir Michael Rose, former commander of the U.N. troops in
Bosnia, revived the tinderbox theory Tuesday on the ``Today'' (BBC
Radio) program.
</P>
<P>
   Warning of a possible ``third Balkan war,'' he said: ``There's a
grave danger that an act of war carried out against Serbia by NATO
will spread into Bosnia and possibly into Macedonia.''
</P>
<P>
   The general's worries about Macedonia are certainly shared by
most observers, and by many Macedonians, too. Serbia's southern
neighbor declared its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991 and is
an inherently unstable state, in spite of the presence of more than
10,000 NATO peacekeepers on its northern border.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday Macedonia closed its two border crossings with Kosovo,
while President Kiro Gligorov appealed to NATO to lend his country
extra security guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   The flow of Albanian refugees into Macedonia already threatens
to destabilize the country's explosive ethnic mixture, pitting the
dominant Slavs against a large and restive Albanian minority.
</P>
<P>
   Relief organization officials said about 1,000 Kosovars crossed
the border in the last 24 hours alone.
</P>
<P>
   Albania itself is another obvious worry. Although the left-wing
government is less inclined to pander to pan-Albanian rhetoric than
its right-wing predecessor, Tirana would still find it extremely
hard to stay aloof from all-out war on the ground, especially if a
massive Serbian assault on the population threatened them with
annihilation.
</P>
<P>
   Further afield, there are other potential actors in the Serbian
drama; Turkey for one, the former ruling power in the Balkans and
self-appointed protector of Balkan Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Bulgaria. Sofia has no direct interest in war with
Belgrade, other than exaggerated worries that its nuclear power
station might be hit by accident if missiles start flying around.
What it has does have is a very real stake in Macedonia, which
Bulgarian nationalists have always considered an integral part of
Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   Their predatory interest is shared by the Serbs, who ruled
Macedonia in the 14th century and seized it back from Turkey _ to
the fury of the Bulgarians _ in the Balkan wars.
</P>
<P>
   So it is the collapse of Macedonia, rather than war in Serbia
and Kosovo, that is most likely to make the Balkan ``tinderbox''
theory a reality.
</P>
<P>
   Two countries in the region that are not likely to join any new
Balkan war are Romania and Greece. In Bucharest, there is a
principled opposition to the notion of outsiders interfering in a
sovereign state. But those worries are more than balanced out by a
strong commitment to joining the EU and NATO. So no opposition to
the West there.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Greeks, although they provided their Orthodox
brothers with a valued diplomatic lifeline when Belgrade was at war
in Bosnia, ties have cooled since then. Greek diplomats are
dismissing the chances of Athens being involved _ or even affected
_ by air strikes on Serbia. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Slobodan Milosevic has turned into a great dictator
with all the trademarks of one: madness, cruelty and longevity.
</P>
<P>
   He began his rise to power by exploiting Serbia's sentiments
about the sanctity of Kosovo and made a stepping stone of personal
ambition and dreams of territorial aggrandisement.
</P>
<P>
   When he ended Kosovo's autonomy in 1989, the Soviet Union was
still in existence and the shrill ravings of a Yugoslav nationalist
seemed to all but the most prescient an insubstantial threat.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the violence began in earnest in Croatia in 1991,
there was something faintly absurd about Serbia's leader.
</P>
<P>
   Early that year, I attended a dinner in Belgrade given by the
government. Milosevic looked and talked like a textbook Eastern
European Marxist-Leninist lecturer _ socially insecure, ham-fisted
but stubbornly bullish about his beliefs under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   When he tired of too much preprandial questioning about his
intentions, he announced sharply: ``Let's attack the soup.''
</P>
<P>
   I remember that this hawkishness, applied to the dinner, seemed
rather comical. Not so funny now, after Vukovar, Srebrenica and
Racak.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has outlasted Mikhail Gorbachev, George Bush, Margaret
Thatcher, Helmut Kohl and John Major. The endgame falls to Bill
Clinton and Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   When people complain that the aim of the NATO mission against
Serbia is unclear, they are wrong. There is one clear goal, without
which peace is impossible: to create a situation in which Milosevic
falls from power and the distorted, rapacious Serbia he has created
is humiliated.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Milosevic rouses himself from the nightmare of his own
making in the next few days, this is the course on which NATO will
embark: the most serious engagement in Europe since the Second
World War.
</P>
<P>
   There is no institutional or legal case for military action
against a sovereign power that has committed atrocities on its own
territory. We must rely on the more subjective assessments of
realpolitik and on the ethical imperative for reasons to act.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday in his Commons statement, Tony Blair entwined the two in
a proposition that can be summarized as: ``Not acting is more
dangerous than acting; and, anyway, it is right to intervene
because of the suffering imposed by Milosevic on Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   This is sound. But the mission is going to be a long and bloody
affair, its price and its outcome uncertain. The prime minister
will need to work harder in the weeks and months ahead to convince
people that Britain's involvement is justified.
</P>
<P>
   When he contemplated the post of prime minister, it is unlikely
that the consensual Blair imagined himself as a war leader. But
high office is unpredictable and this is what he may well be called
upon to become.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's role in Kosovo will be an even more difficult war to sell
than the last Gulf skirmish _ and that was far from being Blair's
most convincing piece of salesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Bombing the Serbs on behalf of Kosovo is as near as damn it to a
recognition of Kosovan independence.
</P>
<P>
   It may well be that in order to seal the strategic gains of a
bombing campaign, we will have to commit troops onto this territory
against the will of Milosevic _ indeed this is the outcome he
dreads, because it guarantees his disgrace and downfall. But its
political and human cost would be high.
</P>
<P>
   Given his strong commitment to European institutions, Blair was
a surprisingly reticent European when it came to laying out the
single binding reason why we are obliged to take in the risks of a
long conflict in Kosovo: it is a part of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative to Western intervention is to accept that the
Western ideals of basic human rights and freedom from persecution
by the state do not apply to Yugoslavia. I do not believe that
Europe should tolerate such ethical exclusion zones.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite argument of opponents of bombing is that since the
West is neither able nor willing to use force to tackle injustice
everywhere in the world, it should not do so in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But Europe is the point: the Continent's future is our future.
If we are not to fight a brutal aggressor after a delay similar to
that which allowed the carnage of Bosnia, where would we fight?
</P>
<P>
   One of the baleful consequences of the dominance of the single
currency in Western Europe's priorities has been the downgrading of
a wider sense of what it means to be a European, as bestowing some
basic values and duties of care for one another.
</P>
<P>
   Into this vacuum floods the kind of petty selfishness manifested
by the renowned Second World War historian Correlli Barnett in a
baffling and perverse newspaper article in which he compared the
prospect of NATO ground troops in Kosovo with an ``army of
occupation.''
</P>
<P>
   Technically , this may be a correct description. But Kosovo is
not the Sudetenland. The overwhelmingly Albanian population sees
NATO as a redeemer, not an invader.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett then worries about the risk of Kosovo distracting our
armed forces from some other pressing threat to British interests.
But what interest can be more pressing than peace in Europe?
</P>
<P>
   Much of the global-reach doctrine of our armed forces has
outlived its usefulness. Forging and maintaining the peace in
Europe and on its borders will be task enough for the next century.
</P>
<P>
   There is no such thing as a ``far-off corner of the Balkans'' in
a Europe that has a new NATO member in Hungary, bordering on Serbia
and in which refugees spill across open borders. The Iron Curtain
is no longer there to shield us from unpleasantness.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett and the rest of the new British isolationists might like
to cut Britain off from the security interests of Europe. But it is
neither possible nor desirable to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, a creeping ``I'm all right Jack''-ism is shared by
the sections of the left and right. They are intent on forming a
coalition of apathy and will fight for nothing and no one beyond
their own garden fence.
</P>
<P>
   It is to these latter-day appeasers that Prime Minister Tony
Blair needs to address himself more forcefully if he is to become a
great statesman, as well as great politician. &QL;

 By RUPERT CORNWELL  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Kosovo was where the 20th century's final cycle of
Balkan wars began. Now Kosovo is where they will end; not with a
peace agreement but, surely now, with the first attack by NATO in
its 50-year history on a sovereign state _ and, if the worst comes
to the very worst, with the first major European land war since
1945.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, as Serb forces continued to sack Albanian
villages, the final realistic chance of averting allied airstrikes
against Yugoslav targets vanished as first President Slobodan
Milosevic, and then the Serbian parliament which he controls,
rejected demands for a cease-fire and the deployment of a NATO-led
international peacekeeping force in the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   In dramatic further confirmation that war may be at hand,
Yevgeny Primakov, the Russian prime minister, dramatically
cancelled a visit to the U.S. which was due to start Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The onslaught, which the White House said would be ``swift and
substantial,'' could be unleashed as soon as early today
(Wednesday).
</P>
<P>
   In a grim interview as he left Belgrade for Brussels to report
back to NATO, the U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke made no bones of the
failure of his last-ditch mission. The circumstances, he declared,
were ``the bleakest'' he had known in his experience of negotiating
in the Balkans..
</P>
<P>
   That experience began in 1995, when Holbrooke took the Bosnia
crisis in hand, browbeat Milosevic and the other protagonists to
the conference table in Dayton, Ohio, and secured a peace which has
turned Bosnia into a virtual NATO protectorate.
</P>
<P>
   Alas Kosovo was omitted then. Four years later it has turned
into perhaps the gravest Balkan conflict of all.
</P>
<P>
   His talks had been a ``watershed moment,'' after nearly a year
of unavailing Western efforts to broker a settlement between ethnic
Albanians and Serbs, culminating in proposals put to last month's
Rambouillet conference which Belgrade refused to sign.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav president didn't want even to discuss either the
cease-fire or the foreign peacekeeping force, and ``fully
understood'' the consequences of that refusal, Holbrooke added. In
other words, the time for talking has run out.
</P>
<P>
   That, too, was the unvarnished message from Western capitals. In
the House of Commons the British prime minister, Tony Blair, warned
that 65,000 more Kosovars had been driven from their homes by the
latest Serb offensive.
</P>
<P>
   The West had made a solemn promise to the ethnic Albanians, and
would not permit a new humanitarian disaster in Kosovo. Nor would
it tolerate further repression by Belgrade that would probably drag
Albania, Macedonia and Bosnia _ and perhaps Greece and Turkey too _
into ``disintegration, chaos and disorder on the doorstep of the
European Union.''
</P>
<P>
   Later the prime minister even more plainly donned the mantle of
commander-in-chief, addressing ``those British pilots who may be
called into action, their families...all those people who are part
of the armed forces... I would not ask them to undertake this if I
did not believe it was necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington the mood was equally somber as Congressional
leaders of both parties rallied behind President Bill Clinton's
call for support for military action.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the well-aired misgivings of some senior U.S.
politicians, the sense was that airstrikes were all but inevitable
_ that even the master of brinkmanship Milosevic had finally passed
the point of no return.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground as well all seemed set for war. As Yugoslav and
Serb forces continued the offensive of recent days in the Drenica
valley north of Kosovo _ a strategy which had prompted some
speculation the Yugoslav president was staking out the ground for a
partition of the province _ an ominous calm descended on the
capital, Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   After a spate of bombings, Serb police rampages, and tit-for-tat
killings in the last few days, the city was deathly quiet. The main
market and schools were shut, and the traffic was a trickle.
</P>
<P>
   Tightening the vice, the Yugoslav authorities also closed the
southern border, thus preventing Albanians fleeing to safety in
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The real question Tuesday night was when the air attacks might
start. Faced with the fresh tide of refugees and Milosevic's almost
mocking intransigence, earlier waverers in the alliance like Italy,
Germany and Greece seem to have thrown their weight, however
reluctantly, behind airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is now united and prepared to carry out its warning,''
President Clinton said. ``If President Milosevic is not willing to
make peace, we are willing to limit his ability to make war.''
</P>
<P>
   The threat has been heard a dozen times; this time however it
rang true _ perhaps explaining why the Yugoslav leader Tuesday
sacked his army's security chief.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts saw the step as continuation of a purge of senior
officers opposed to a confrontation with the West which could cost
the country much precious military hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night the main political factor staying NATO's hand
disappeared when Primakov, leader of the country which is
Belgrade's staunchest ally and categorically opposed to NATO
airstrikes, called off his visit to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   To have launched them at the very moment Primakov was in the
Oval Office would have been an insult which even the present
wretched state of America's relations with its former superpower
rival would hardly justify.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, however, military preparations are virtually
complete. The hope now is that one crushing blow against key
military installations _ starting probably with Cruise missile
attacks against air defense and communications sites _ will suffice
to convince President Milosevic to change his mind and accept the
international peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   If not, matters could quickly escalate, even to the point where
a NATO ground invasion _ something the allies have vowed they will
never do _ was the only option left.
</P>
<P>
   That is a nightmare scenario which no NATO leader has yet
publicly confronted, but was implicit in the warning of one NATO
defense minister visiting London Tuesday, ``Kosovo is not Bosnia.
It needs a political solution; a military solution does not
exist.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, that solution will be up to Milosevic. In 1987,
as an ambitious younger member of the Serbian Communist party's
central committee, he went to Kosovo, the spiritual cradle of
Serbia, and made the speech that launched today's Serbian
nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later he stripped Kosovo, and the 90 percent ethnic
Albanian majority of its population, of its autonomy _ the autonomy
he refuses to return today.
</P>
<P>
   By then Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia had read the Serb writing
on the wall, and, in wars greater and smaller, left Yugoslavia. But
Kosovo, where it all started, remained a tightly controlled part of
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the last Balkan war, Serbia may lose even its heart. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Kosovo was where the 20th century's final cycle of
Balkan wars began. Now Kosovo is where they will end; not with a
peace agreement but, surely now, with the first attack by NATO in
its 50-year history on a sovereign state _ and, if the worst comes
to the very worst, with the first major European land war since
1945.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, as Serb forces continued to sack Albanian
villages, the final realistic chance of averting allied airstrikes
against Yugoslav targets vanished as first President Slobodan
Milosevic, and then the Serbian parliament which he controls,
rejected demands for a cease-fire and the deployment of a NATO-led
international peacekeeping force in the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   In dramatic further confirmation that war may be at hand,
Yevgeny Primakov, the Russian prime minister, dramatically
cancelled a visit to the U.S. which was due to start Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The onslaught, which the White House said would be ``swift and
substantial,'' could be unleashed as soon as early today
(Wednesday).
</P>
<P>
   In a grim interview as he left Belgrade for Brussels to report
back to NATO, the U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke made no bones of the
failure of his last-ditch mission. The circumstances, he declared,
were ``the bleakest'' he had known in his experience of negotiating
in the Balkans..
</P>
<P>
   That experience began in 1995, when Holbrooke took the Bosnia
crisis in hand, browbeat Milosevic and the other protagonists to
the conference table in Dayton, Ohio, and secured a peace which has
turned Bosnia into a virtual NATO protectorate.
</P>
<P>
   Alas Kosovo was omitted then. Four years later it has turned
into perhaps the gravest Balkan conflict of all.
</P>
<P>
   His talks had been a ``watershed moment,'' after nearly a year
of unavailing Western efforts to broker a settlement between ethnic
Albanians and Serbs, culminating in proposals put to last month's
Rambouillet conference which Belgrade refused to sign.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav president didn't want even to discuss either the
cease-fire or the foreign peacekeeping force, and ``fully
understood'' the consequences of that refusal, Holbrooke added. In
other words, the time for talking has run out.
</P>
<P>
   That, too, was the unvarnished message from Western capitals. In
the House of Commons the British prime minister, Tony Blair, warned
that 65,000 more Kosovars had been driven from their homes by the
latest Serb offensive.
</P>
<P>
   The West had made a solemn promise to the ethnic Albanians, and
would not permit a new humanitarian disaster in Kosovo. Nor would
it tolerate further repression by Belgrade that would probably drag
Albania, Macedonia and Bosnia _ and perhaps Greece and Turkey too _
into ``disintegration, chaos and disorder on the doorstep of the
European Union.''
</P>
<P>
   Later the prime minister even more plainly donned the mantle of
commander-in-chief, addressing ``those British pilots who may be
called into action, their families...all those people who are part
of the armed forces... I would not ask them to undertake this if I
did not believe it was necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington the mood was equally somber as Congressional
leaders of both parties rallied behind President Bill Clinton's
call for support for military action.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the well-aired misgivings of some senior U.S.
politicians, the sense was that airstrikes were all but inevitable
_ that even the master of brinkmanship Milosevic had finally passed
the point of no return.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground as well all seemed set for war. As Yugoslav and
Serb forces continued the offensive of recent days in the Drenica
valley north of Kosovo _ a strategy which had prompted some
speculation the Yugoslav president was staking out the ground for a
partition of the province _ an ominous calm descended on the
capital, Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   After a spate of bombings, Serb police rampages, and tit-for-tat
killings in the last few days, the city was deathly quiet. The main
market and schools were shut, and the traffic was a trickle.
</P>
<P>
   Tightening the vice, the Yugoslav authorities also closed the
southern border, thus preventing Albanians fleeing to safety in
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The real question Tuesday night was when the air attacks might
start. Faced with the fresh tide of refugees and Milosevic's almost
mocking intransigence, earlier waverers in the alliance like Italy,
Germany and Greece seem to have thrown their weight, however
reluctantly, behind airstrikes.
</P>

   ``NATO is now united and prepared to carry out its warning,''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Just a few miles away from the place where I write this, a small
coastal town in the Indonesian part of Borneo, human beings are
doing unimaginable things to one another in the jungle.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of ethnic Madurese have been burned out of their homes
and scores murdered, and the burning and the killings are
continuing. In the past three days armed warriors have paraded
through their villages carrying severed ears, arms and heads.
</P>
<P>
   The motive is pure racial hatred. The police and army are
impotent or indifferent. And the same kind of communal violence,
for different reasons and by different means, is happening all over
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago I was in the Spice Islands where Christians and
Muslims are locked into their own murderous battle of religion, a
tropical Northern Ireland in the making.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the archipelago, three of Indonesia's 27 provinces
have declared their independence _ one of them, East Timor, is
almost certain to break away from the republic in the next year.
</P>
<P>
   In Jakarta, demonstrations against the government are gathering
momentum in the approach to June's elections _ during the last big
demonstration, in November, 13 people were shot dead.
</P>
<P>
   To Europeans, all this should have a disturbingly familiar ring
_ a large state, ethnically and religiously diverse, which throws
off a corrupt dictatorship, only to find itself stricken by
communal violence.
</P>
<P>
   Is the world's fourth largest country breaking up? Will
Indonesia become an Equatorial Yugoslavia?
</P>
<P>
   It is an urgent question because the consequences of instability
here would be serious. Indonesia's 13,000 islands occupy the
crossroads of Asia, an area of profound strategic, political and
environmental importance to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   A substantial part of the world's oil passes through the
country's territorial waters _ prolonged disruption to shipping in
the Straits of Malacca, for instance, would seriously affect the
economies of both Japan and China.
</P>
<P>
   And Indonesia's sprawling expanse makes it a neighbor to the
whole region. The prospect of an exodus of refugees from a
population of 210 million causes alarm from Canberra to Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
   This is why foreign governments gave such enthusiastic and
unquestioning support to President Suharto, the man who bears the
greatest responsibility for Indonesia's present turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   For 32 years, he ruled a country which, from the outside,
appeared to be a model of Third-World development. GDP soared,
population growth was slowed, poverty was reduced and illiteracy
was virtually eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   His predecessor, Sukarno, had been an unpredictable demagogue
who flirted with communism and fought a low-intensity war with
Malaysia. No wonder the countries of the west, Britain among them,
were so willing to supply him with arms and to turn a blind eye to
the brutal annexation of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knew that Suharto's rule was based upon fear; the more
astute could see that the benefits of Indonesia's success were
disproportionately concentrated in Suharto's home, the main island
of Java.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, however, he seemed to have succeeded in bringing
about permanent stability. Only in the last two years it has become
obvious what an illusion that was.
</P>
<P>
   As a nation state, Indonesia was always an unlikely proposition
_ the only thing that its diverse people had in common was their
colonial history as the former Dutch East Indies.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than eliminating ethnic and religious difference, Suharto
froze them, forcing unity and stifling dissent with a repressive
military apparatus. Last May the thaw set in, and in the last 10
months the old enmities have emerged pristinely from the ice.
</P>
<P>
   This is the best way of understanding the grisly diversity of
violence presently on display in Indonesia. The hanging of
traditional sorcerers in East Java, and the beheading of Madurese
settlers in Borneo have nothing in common in terms of direct
motivation.
</P>
<P>
   But both are symptoms of the same sickness _ a combination of
economic distress and the breakdown of law and order, among
populations which have no other means of expressing a deep sense of
injustice and pent-up frustration.
</P>
<P>
   But there are huge differences as well as similarities, and for
several reasons the Balkans experience is unlikely to repeat itself
here. The most basic of these is Indonesia's size, a source of
passive strength as well as vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   In Yugoslavia, two religions and a handful of ethnic groups
battle for a geographically and historically uniform region _ they
are fighting for what they have in common.
</P>
<P>
   But Indonesians are as diverse as any people in the world. To an
ethnically Chinese Christian yuppy in Jakarta, the independence
struggles of animist tribesmen in Irian Jaya are almost as alien as
they are to the inhabitants of London or New York. However
concentrated power may be in Java, no single ethnic or religious
group is powerful enough to threaten the whole.
</P>
<P>
   For all their frustration with their central government,
Indonesia's provinces have much to lose from breaking away. East
Timor is misleading in this respect for in every way it is an
exception.
</P>
<P>
   As a former Portuguese colony, it was never part of the Dutch
empire and played no part in the Indonesian war of independence.
Despite its passive capitulation, the U.N. never recognized
Jakarta's annexation.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's announcement that it is prepared to give it
independence came as a result of international pressure, and a
brilliantly effective campaign by NGOs and East Timorese exiles.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor's struggle has been one of principle, but in the rest
of the archipelago dissatisfaction has its roots in practical
matters.
</P>
<P>
   In Borneo, Aceh and Irian Jaya, big corporations have made
fortunes in timber, oil and copper with negligible benefit to the
population at large. Resentment for this exploitation has laid the
ground for independence movements and outbreaks of violence. But
what people want is not sovereignty so much as justice.
</P>
<P>
   All now depends on the outcome of general elections to be held
in June _ the closest Indonesia has come to real democracy since
1955.
</P>
<P>
   A decisive victory for a popular and visionary president could
halt the paralysis which the country is experiencing under
Suharto's unpopular successor and appointee, B.J. Habibie. But with
48 parties competing and no clear favorite among a handful of
front-runners, such a clean result is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of sudden anarchy or civil war, Indonesia faces decades
of uncertainty, a directionless drift back into the Third World. &QL;

<P>
   For all their frustration with their central government,
Indonesia's provinces have much to lose from breaking away. East
Timor is misleading in this respect for in every way it is an
exception.
</P>
<P>
   As a former Portuguese colony, it was never part of the Dutch
empire and played no part in the Indonesian war of independence.
Despite its passive capitulation, the U.N. never recognized
Jakarta's annexation.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's announcement that it is prepared to give it
independence came as a result of international pressure, and a
brilliantly effective campaign by NGOs and East Timorese exiles.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor's struggle has been one of principle, but in the rest
of the archipelago dissatisfaction has its roots in practical
matters.
</P>
<P>
   In Borneo, Aceh and Irian Jaya, big corporations have made
fortunes in timber, oil and copper with negligible benefit to the
population at large. Resentment for this exploitation has laid the
ground for independence movements and outbreaks of violence. But
what people want is not sovereignty so much as justice.
</P>
<P>
   All now depends on the outcome of general elections to be held
in June _ the closest Indonesia has come to real democracy since
1955.
</P>
<P>
   A decisive victory for a popular and visionary president could
halt the paralysis which the country is experiencing under
Suharto's unpopular successor and appointee, B.J. Habibie. But with
48 parties competing and no clear favorite among a handful of
front-runners, such a clean result is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of sudden anarchy or civil war, Indonesia faces decades
of uncertainty, a directionless drift back into the Third World. &QL;

<P>
   War is never easy, and all the high technology in the world will
never make it so.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's new military toughness in Yugoslavia constitutes a deadly
gamble with many lives, and may become painful and unpopular. But
it remains necessary, in spite of all the final reservations that
accompany the fateful step of attacking a fellow sovereign state in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Our first instinct is to welcome military action against a
regime that has systematically attacked the rights of the people of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   This century has witnessed too many betrayals of small and
defenseless peoples in Europe, and it is to be hoped that the
action in Kosovo marks an end to that sad and shameful record.
</P>
<P>
   It is President Slobodan Milosevic who has forced the
predominantly Albanian population of that province into desperate
resistance. His government has denied them legitimate cultural
expression and legislative autonomy, discriminated against the
Albanian language and most Kosovars' Muslim faith, and finally
adopted the same techniques of ``ethnic cleansing'' that he
mobilized in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   For years we forced our troops in the Balkans to scuttle around
in armored personnel carriers, dealing out charity rather than
tackling the root cause of conflict: Serb aggression. Now that
humiliation may be over.
</P>
<P>
   But we must go further than emotional spasm. NATO's actions are
not the end of the struggle with Milosevic. In fact, they herald a
new level of conflict with this tough and cunning operator whose
capacity to trick, delay and dissemble will not be ended by
military action alone.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary: military action raises the stakes, creating new
situations for the Belgrade strongman to exploit, and forcing the
Western allies to concentrate every step of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Only a strategy for the whole course of this new and more
intense confrontation can hope to isolate and contain such
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   There is a need for such clear thinking over every aspect of
this new and dangerous conflagration. Having escalated the crisis,
we must face the consequences, building strategies for dealing with
the results of our actions.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomacy must remain to the fore, for in this field NATO's
position is far from secure. Russia and China oppose military
action, a stance Serbia will attempt to take advantage of. Without
unanimous international support or U.N. authorization, NATO must
not give the impression of go-it-alone warmongering.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomatic situation may get worse, as the conflict could
spread to Macedonia, Albania, and beyond. The political and
military groundwork must be laid to deal with that eventuality.
That means extra troops if necessary, and security agreements with
countries who share a border with Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   But there are technical and operational problems on a similar
scale. Serbia is no Iraq. With well-equipped air defenses and a
trained, tested and committed army, she will be no military
pushover.
</P>
<P>
   The lives of NATO personnel may be lost, perhaps in large
numbers. Alliance troops are strung out across Bosnia and
Macedonia, and will need protecting. For that there must be a plan,
for ultimate extraction or deeper and more forceful involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Provision must be made for refugees streaming across the border
into Macedonia and northern Greece. Once war is launched, there can
be no half-measures.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no quick or bloodless victory; in the Balkans,
there never are any simple solutions. But Milosevic has torn up
every agreement he has made in the last six months, and his ability
to defy sense and diplomacy must now be brought to an end.
</P>
<P>
   NATO should stand firm for the stark principles that necessitate
action. The credibility of the Western alliance, the Kosovar right
to self-determination and democracy, and the security of Europe
itself are at stake. &QL;

<P>
   MOSCOW _ The first NATO bomb to crater Yugoslav soil will stand
in history as the moment when Russia realized exactly how far it
has fallen since the days it stood astride the planet as a
superpower capable of counterbalancing American might.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's refusal to listen to Moscow's pleas to spare its
Slavic cousins in Serbia marks a new low in an increasingly
ambivalent relationship with the United States, in which Russia _
to its horror _ finds itself cast not so much an enemy as a
sponging lightweight.
</P>
<P>
   The warmth of the early post-Soviet era faded long ago, but
Kosovo has turned Russian reservations about the West _ and, in
particular, the supremacy of NATO _ into concrete resentment, shot
through with deep suspicion which is likely to influence policy for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday in Moscow outrage echoed across the political
spectrum, moderated only by the humiliating recognition that Russia
must turn again to the West for loans.
</P>
<P>
   After eleventh-hour calls to U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Jacques Chirac of France, Boris Yeltsin appeared on national TV to
appeal to Nato to stay its hand. He spoke ominously of the world
facing ``a war in Europe and possibly something greater.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the White House, Clinton's message was: ``We should
not allow a dispute on a single issue to derail the important work
we're doing on a wide variety of issues.'' Those issues include
nuclear weapons reduction, and peacekeeping in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Foreign Minister, Igor Ivanov, dropped hints about
arming the Serbs _ arguing that a NATO attack could render the U.N.
arms embargo null and void (although the Kremlin distanced itself
from these).
</P>
<P>
   Marshal Igor Sergeyev, Russia's Defense Minister, even talked
about Yugoslavia becoming a ``second Vietnam,'' as the he placed
the armed forces on a state of ``higher alert.''
</P>
<P>
   From the newly ascendant Communists, there were calls for
Russian military assistance; from the nationalists, blusters about
restoring a Stalinist dictatorship so that Russia should not be so
humiliated again.
</P>
<P>
   The mood is one of deep grievance, and it is not without cause.
This week Clinton was to meet the Russian premier Yevgeny Primakov,
but the latter's plane _ in a pure piece of Cold War theatre _
turned around over the Atlantic on Tuesday after he concluded NATO
bombing was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Beforehand, the American president made a speech about the need
for ``the right kind'' of relationship with the Russians, who could
be ``great partners.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is not much evidence he is willing to back his words
with actions. These days Washington mixes hardball, with a strategy
of ignoring Moscow altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Russian protests over the Anglo-American bombing of Iraq fell on
deaf ears, a response which undermined its treasured status as a
permanent member of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has been hectored by the U.S. _ including having
sanctions slapped on research institutes _ over weapons technology
transfers to Iran. And the International Monetary Fund has lectured
them tirelessly over how to run a market economy after last
August's crash _ this, despite the fact that the fund was partly to
blame.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's policy is perhaps based on the reality that
Russia's economy has shrunk to the size of Belgium's. But Moscow's
legacy of 30,000 nuclear warheads, its lake of chemical weapons,
and a time-tested ability to currying favor with the planet's
pariahs cannot be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton recognized as much in his speech. He would like
Russia's 40,000 nuclear scientists to do ``peaceful, good things
and not bartering their services to other countries to cause
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   A fine sentiment, but one which will not be furthered by NATO
bombing runs in Yugoslavia. &QL;

   LONDON _ In the late 1960s two ultra-bright boys from Little
Rock went to Oxford as Rhodes scholars. One was a straight arrow
who worked hard, took his degree, and left early in order to serve
in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The other, famously, didn't inhale, didn't get a degree and
didn't get drafted and is now President of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That first Arkansan is called Wesley Clark. At 54, he is two
years older than Bill Clinton, his commander-in-chief. More to the
point, he is a four-star general in the U.S. Army and as NATO's top
uniformed officer, the man who right now is giving the orders for
the bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Wes Clark, ``The Boss'' to his deferring aides, is that uniquely
American creature, the political soldier.
</P>
<P>
   A British general will have as little as possible to do with the
``political wallahs.'' But since that stint in Vietnam, where he
was wounded and awarded the Silver Star, Clark's subsequent rise
owes as much to his skills at dealing with the politics of defense
as his ability as a soldier and military organizer.
</P>
<P>
   On his return from Vietnam, he went to work in the White House
under Alexander Haig, Nixon's chief of Staff, and future NATO
Supreme Commander and Secretary of State _ another in the line of
modern politician-soldiers who include Dwight Eisenhower and Colin
Powell.
</P>
<P>
   Clark and Clinton's have white-grey hair in common, but very
little else. Where Clinton tends to sloppiness and verbosity, he is
disciplined and weighs every word.
</P>
<P>
   The President is a Southern Baptist through and through, while
Clark converted to Catholicism. And his private life truly is
private.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Balkans brought them together, the two Arkansans'
paths had barely crossed. But as Bosnia became an increasing U.S.
diplomatic priority, Clark emerged as a key Presidential adviser on
the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Later, along with Chris Hill, be was Richard Holbrooke's closest
aide during the 1995 Dayton conference.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to those talks, and several recent missions to Belgrade
to try and sort out the Kosovo crisis, he knows his foe Slobodan
Milosevic uncommonly well. But like everyone else, he has failed to
sway the Yugoslav president with words.
</P>
<P>
   He must now do it by war _ and in the process remember enough of
the tragedy of Vietnam to keep NATO out of a similarly disastrous
entanglement in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   If he does, the ladder may stretch higher still for Wes Clark.
The logical military promotion, to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, is
probably out, since the Army has filled the job twice in
succession.
</P>
<P>
   But there are political possibilities too: as National Security
Adviser or, who knows, even Secretary of State in a future
administration, be it Republican or Democrat. &QL;

WHY IS THERE A 'SIN TAX' ON MARRIAGE?

 &HT;    
 &HT;    ''Sin taxes'' on cigarettes or liquor discourage the harmful
behavior of smoking and drinking. Some states recently increased
cigarette taxes by 25 cents a pack to reduce teen smoking.
 &HT;    But why is there a federal ''sin tax'' on marriage?
 &HT;    Is this a harmful behavior that we want to discourage? Of course
not.
 &HT;    People who are married live longer, earn more and are twice as
likely as single people to be ''very happy.''
 &HT;    And children of married parents are only half as likely to drop
out of school or become delinquent compared to children of single
parents. Kids from broken homes are three times as likely as those
from intact homes to become pregnant as teenagers and are six times
more likely to commit suicide or to be in poverty.
 &HT;    Yet 21 million married working couples pay an extra $1,400 in
federal income taxes, on average, for being married compared to
couples who have the same income, but cohabit rather than marry.
This is what is called the ''marriage penalty'' in tax law.
Marriage is a sin to be taxed.
 &HT;    Sam is a machinist who earns $31,500 and lives with Susan, a
teacher who also earns $31,500. After claiming a standard deduction
and a personal exemption, each of their taxable incomes are
$24,550. So each pays a federal tax of $3,682.50, or $7,365 total.
 &HT;    However, if they marry, their federal tax bite jumps to $8,635.
That's a $1,270 sin tax
 &HT;    Why are married people taxed more?
 &HT;    A single person pays a 15 percent tax on income up to $25,350.
So a cohabiting couple can earn up to $50,700 and remain in the 15
percent bracket. But a married couple is in the 15 percent bracket
only if their combined income is under $42,350. They must pay a 28
percent tax on all earnings above that amount. Also, the standard
deduction of a single person is $4,250, but a joint return can
claim only $7,100, rather than double the $4,250, or $8,500.
 &HT;    Sharon Mallory, a 41-year-old factory worker from Indiana, told
the House Ways and Means Committee that if she were to marry her
live-in companion, Darryl Pierce, they would have to pay $3,700
more in taxes. ''Darryl and I love each other very much and want to
be married,'' she testified. ''The IRS won't let us. We're victims
of the marriage penalty.''
 &HT;    This is evidence that ''the tax code discourages marriage,'' as
Leslie Carbone of the Family Research Council puts it. Economists
James Alm and Leslie Whittington have reported that the probability
of marriage falls as the marriage tax rises.
 &HT;    Federal tax law is one reason marriage rates have fallen 41
percent since 1960, and the number of cohabiting couples has soared
TEN-FOLD from 430,000 to 4,236,000 in the same time.
 &HT;    Cohabitants are saving money, but they will lead shorter lives.
A cohabiting man who is aged 48 has a 61 percent chance of living
till age 65. But a married man has an 85 percent chance of being
alive at age 65, according to Linda Waite of the University of
Chicago.
 &HT;    Fortunately, there is a new bipartisan push to remove much of
this marriage penalty. A bill, the ''Marriage Tax Elimination Act,
has been proposed by Reps. David McIntosh (R-Ind.) Jerry Weller,
(R-Ill.), and Pat Danner (D-Mo.). It would double the current
standard deduction of $4,150 for singles, to $8,300 for married
couples, up from the current $6,900 for married couples.
 &HT;    And the Marriage Tax Elimination Act would also extend a married
couple's 15 percent tax bracket to $49,300, up from the current
maximum of $42,350. That would protect nearly $7,000 from the
higher 28 percent tax rate.
 &HT;    A similar bill passed the House last year, but was defeated in
the Senate. The odds look better this year for passage, partly
because House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, (R-Ill.), has made the
bill a top priority.
 &HT;    ''It's ridiculous that our onerous tax code makes it more
expensive to be married than to be single,'' Hastert says. ''The
government should not punish married working couples by taking more
of their hard-earned money in taxes than an identical couple living
outside of marriage.''
 &HT;    Will the Marriage Tax Elimination Act eliminate marriage taxes?
 &HT;    No. It will knock off only 55.6 percent of them.
 &HT;    The Earned Income Tax Credit, which reduces income taxes of
low-income workers, accounts for another 19 percent. Denise is a
single mom with one child, with an adjusted gross income of
$20,000. So she gets a $1,038 refundable tax credit. Bill, who lost
his wife to cancer, and earns $22,000, is eligible for a EITC of
$771. But if they marry, they will lose their EITCs, with a
combined income of $42,000. They will pay an added $1,749 in
marriage sin taxes.
 &HT;    There are still 61 other smaller marriage taxes.
 &HT;    President Clinton opposes the marital reforms. But then, he
doesn't believe much in marriage.
 &HT;    Do you? Will you write your Congressman?

CHARM OF HABANEROS BELIES CITY'S DECLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Second in a series &QL; 
HAVANA - The rays of morning light splashing against this city's
landscape offered a far different view to Havana than nightfall had
managed to disguise just hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Havana's dim night lights _ make no mistake, this is a dark city
at night _ provided an unyielding mask to its scars and ills that
daylight simply could not conceal.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, my thoughts were consumed by my two sons and wife.
I could barely contain myself as I viewed my first Cuban sunrise,
for this is a land where my roots are deeply embedded.
</P>
<P>
   I thought back to my grandparents and parents, who made this
their home before fleeing Fidel Castro's Communist regime in the
early 1960s. How they must have grappled with so much pain and
personal anxiety as they abandoned their homeland 36 years ago when
John F. Kennedy's administration offered an alternative in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The knot in my stomach tightened as the thoughts raced through
my mind. The dawn's light solidified in my mind how fortunate my
family is to have been given the chance to pursue dreams in the
United States, where hard work makes a difference.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a unique story to my family, for many Cuban families
went through similar journeys: in the 1960s, in 1980 during the
Mariel boat lift and more recently, when Cubans risked their lives
on the open seas in makeshift rafts.
</P>
<P>
   Havana is crumbling. Its artistic and elegant architecture, some
of it more than 100 years old, serves as a reminder of the city's
once-glorious past, when people called it the Monte Carlo of the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the buildings' facades seem to be begging for some _ any
_ form of upkeep. A paintbrush alone would cure some of this city's
ills, which include exposed corroding and pockmarked streets and
sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can we do?'' asked Orlando Ochoa (who strongly requested
his real name not be used) of Havana's San Li Opordo neighborhood,
a poor area where the government doesn't necessarily want foreign
journalists venturing but whose friendly inhabitants enchanted me.
``All you have to do is look around and see there are problems too
big to take care of all at once.''
</P>
<P>
   Havana's wounds are not hidden behind some curtain in a remote
area of the city. Prostitution is rampant because most young women
can't earn a living, residents said.
</P>
<P>
   They also said it's doubtful it will be evident this week. A
large foreign press presence in town for the exhibition baseball
game between the Baltimore Orioles and the Cuban National Team, and
the city is putting its best foot forward.
</P>
<P>
   The tourist area, where most of the nicer hotels are located, is
not what Havana is truly like, the residents said.
</P>
<P>
   The police presence is obvious from the moment you step onto
hotel grounds. A 15-year-old boy from the neighborhood ventured
near the cafeteria here, gesturing that he wanted some water, when
he was quickly whisked away.
</P>
<P>
   The nicer areas of Havana show the facade, but reality lies in
its nooks and crannies. When ``Republic'' photographer Dave Cruz
and I made our way to San Li Opordo, we were told of the crime
spree that had engulfed Havana late last year and early this year,
one President Fidel Castro put an end to with heightened security
and stiff prison sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Like most every Havanero I ran into during my first full day in
Cuba, they could not have been more warm or charming. They
routinely opened their homes, welcoming and encouraging all kinds
of talk, even if it meant occasionally treading into delicate
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Like Evelio Hernandez, they all said we could come back any
time.
</P>
<P>
   My obvious accent in Spanish made several people we ran into
Wednesday ask about my background. Without exception, everyone who
discovered I was born in America to Cuban parents told me how lucky
I am. ``You won the lottery by being born there,'' said one
resident.
</P>
<P>
   I was floored as similar responses came bounding my way.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no idea of how lucky you are,'' Ochoa's 27-year-old
son Armando said. ``I would give anything to change spots with you.
Anything. This system does not work.''
</P>
<P>
   Their words reinforced what I was already feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the main artery of 23rd Street at night and closing
my eyes, I am placed back in a time when roulette wheels spun and
salsa dancers took center stage every night of the week until dawn.
</P>
<P>
   In so many ways, time has simply stopped in Havana. With so few
buildings having been built after the '60s and so many cars from
the 1940s and '50 somehow still being driven, my thoughts drift
back in time.
</P>
<P>
   But then the stench of pollution in the air fills my lungs and
settles in my eyes, and I am reminded of the afflictions strangling
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The current decay is unmistakable and indelible to the mind.
Yes, this is now considered a Third World country. But Cuba was not
always so lacking in so many things.
</P>
<P>
   No amount of Communist propaganda, which fills the city's
billboards and buildings, can conceal Cuba's true ills.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying theme of Cubans is that they are filled with both
despair and an abiding sense of hope that seems to have no touch
with reality.
</P>
<P>
   They definitely know of the promise and riches that lie nearby
in the United States, yet they know they are trapped, unable to do
much of anything other than go with the life they have been dealt,
and one that very nearly became mine.

`THE HARMONISTS' FALLS A BIT FLAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Harmonists,'' a period piece about a German singing group,
has a classical directing style and a pictorial beauty _ each scene
has a slight sepia burnish, as if glazed in honey - that
contradicts its subject.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Frommermann (Ulrich Noethen), who has the wide, high
forehead of Roberto Benigni, but hurting eyes that take in
everything, is a struggling performer. A devotee of American
popular singing groups, specifically the jaunty Revellers _ he
spends hours at the local record store, listening to the sounds and
romancing long-necked clerk Erna _ he decides to form his own
version of such a group.
</P>
<P>
   When Bob (Ben Becker) reads about Harry's auditions, he pops
right over, still wearing the monk's costume he was wearing during
a rehearsal. Pushing to the front of the line past his would-be
competitors, he declares, ``I have to administer last rites.''
</P>
<P>
   Director Joseph Vilsmaier's heavy, portentous staging of ``The
Harmonists'' almost does that anyway. Though the storytelling is
simple, the picture itself is weighty and slow _ like an opera
singer forcing a light pop style.
</P>
<P>
   Harry and Bob find their four fellow group members, but their
success, starting almost immediately after their first job in 1927,
butts up against the rise of the Nazi movement. And because the
group includes three Jews, they learn that the Reich will not allow
them to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Harry is all too aware of the ripening anti-Semitism, while the
ambitious and hardheaded Bob _ who's also competing with Harry for
Erna's hand _ refuses to acknowledge what's going on around them.
</P>
<P>
   Harry, with his pained face, doesn't look like the kind of guy
who goes for the quick, improvisatory feel of jazz. He's not
particularly daring _ at one point, when brownshirts trash the
record store, Harry stands watching while Bob crashes through the
window to try to stop the carnage.
</P>
<P>
   It might make a little more sense if Harry were turned on when
he hears music, or if he got some kind of a jolt out of performing.
But he seems to have been cast because of his sufferer's face. Both
``The Harmonists'' and its protagonist lack the the audacity, the
bone-deep hunger to challenge, that would really affect us. (It
doesn't help that the movie also doesn't provide the anything-goes
decadence of Weimar Republic Berlin, in which it's set.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Harmonists'' has an interesting subject _ how the power of
popular art won't set you free _ though we get a lot of scenes with
allegorical weight. In the end, it's a movie with its feet planted
too firmly on the ground.

OPIE'S OPUS IS A LOT LIKE OPIUM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``EDtv'' director Ron Howard has gone out of his way to tell
interviewers that his movie, about a man who finds himself the
center of the world when his life is televised almost 24/7 by a
documentary cable outlet, is nothing like last year's ``The Truman
Show.''
</P>
<P>
   He aptly described ``Truman'' as being like a ``Twilight Zone''
episode, which means Howard is out to create a movie for those who
thought ``Truman'' was too intellectual. And there must be four or
five of them out there. ``EDtv'' exults in its superficiality, as
any movie in its right mind starring Matthew McConaughey would.
</P>
<P>
   McConaughey slides through on his smoky Texas charm, obviously
relieved that he doesn't have to carry the weight of saving the
world. Or, for that matter, to act like he graduated from college.
He's Ed, an amiably aimless video-store clerk who has no
inhibitions about recommending ``Smokey and the Bandit'' - ``the
good Burt (Reynolds),'' as he puts it. And then shooing customers
away from the store as unworthy when they're reluctant to follow
his suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   His cocky grin is trashily beatific, so even his raunchy
behavior seems honest. McConaughey's flyweight appeal _ he's
essentially the luckiest frat boy who ever staggered away from a
kegger _ is perfectly suited to comedy. Even one as shaggy and
earnest as ``EDtv,'' in which he's forced to learn a valuable
lesson about the perils of media.
</P>
<P>
   McConaughey auditions for the slot as the star of the
live-as-it-happens documentary along with his brother, Ray (Woody
Harrelson), a half-lazy schemer with a head full of get-rich-quick
plans. The shooting immediately catches Ed in a bad position,
starting with capturing him in early morning scratch in an area
best suited for cable TV.
</P>
<P>
   When it turns out Ed is falling in love with Shari (Jenna
Elfman), the girlfriend of his undeserving brother, the camera
films that, too. ``EDtv'' gets off a few funny lines and bits, but
it's way too long and simple-minded.
</P>
<P>
   You get the point early on, despite an engaging turn from Martin
Landau as Ed's stepfather. (There's a mildly funny visual motif,
too _ in a movie about television, most of the supporting roles are
filled by people we've seen on TV: Rob Reiner, Donny Most, Ellen
DeGeneres, Elfman, Harrelson, etc. And Harry Shearer _ who appeared
in ``Truman'' and co-wrote ``Real Life,'' Albert Brooks' comedy
about a documentary crew shooting ordinary people _ shows up with a
panel of pundits assessing Ed's plight.)
</P>
<P>
   Once Ed is legally trapped in the show, which even its creator,
desperate network executive Cynthia Topping (DeGeneres) feels
guilty about, you'll find yourself getting a headache from trying
to check your watch in the dark. But you also know he'll pull
through, because in Ron Howard's world, the nice guy always
triumphs.
</P>
<P>
   Howard, who probably understands as well as anyone the problems
of living one's life in the public eye, brings his brand of sticky,
predictable problem-solving to ``EDtv.'' Ironically, a movie about
the dangers of TV made by a man who was raised as a product of TV
suffers from the conservatism of TV thinking.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever really suffers in Howard's movies, and after
``Apollo 13,'' the first movie he ever made that was all about
adults, it's sad that he's gone back to two-ply comedies about
losers. McConaughey's ease and ability to make fun of his own
vanity add a couple of laughs. But ``EDtv'' might as well be a TV
show _ the kind that's pretested and doesn't want to hurt anyone.

THROW THIS ONE BACK INTO THE SWAMP

<P>
   Well, there aren't any rampaging 3-D dinosaurs in ``Doug's 1st
Movie,'' but there is a silly-looking, gap-toothed, reptilian swamp
monster.
</P>
<P>
   It's a pity, really. Some man-eating carnosaurs might have been
just the ticket to salvage this big-screen treatment of the popular
Nickelodeon kid cartoon, particularly if they devoured most, if not
all, of the main characters.
</P>
<P>
   Almost painfully unwatchable for adults, this sloppily animated
outing features Doug and the gang trying to keep a lid on their
discovery of a creature lurking in the nearby bog.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Nickelodeon's last effort (''The Rugrats'') at least
attempted to boost the quality of the animation, ``Doug'' looks to
have been a long episode of the TV series projected on the big
screen. It even has a number of musical crescendos and blackouts
that might send some youngsters strolling to the bathroom thinking
there's a commercial coming.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's acquisition of the Nick library probably seemed like a
slam dunk at the time, and considering the success of ``Rugrats,''
it was. But poor-quality cartoon products like this one only suffer
by comparison to the studio's feature work _ the trailers for
``Tarzan'' and ``Inspector Gadget'' were more entertaining than all
of the main feature.
</P>
<P>
   And don't be sucked in by the promise of a new Donald Duck short
feature, ``Donald's Dynamite `Opera Box.''' Donald's attempts to
extinguish a bomb inexplicably found in Daisy's purse is a
ridiculously unworthy return for the classic quacker.

AN INSIDE JOKE NOT WORTH GETTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the press notes for ``Tinseltown,'' there's a synopsis that
starts off like this: ``A black comedy that illustrates the lengths
to which no-talent people will go in order to make a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, don't give us an opening line like that. Whatever you say
can and will be used against you, especially if your movie is a
Hollywood satire that's more self-indulgent and pretentious than
the movies it seeks to lampoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tinseltown,'' the directorial debut of screenwriter Tony
Spiridakis (''Queens Logic''), plays like a sour-grapes screed from
someone who's frustrated that he can't get his ``good'' movies made
even though Hollywood keeps churning out junk.
</P>
<P>
   This might be OK if the movie weren't junk itself _ if it were
dark enough, or comical enough, or if its red herrings made much
sense. Arye Gross and Tom Wood play Max and Tiger, aspiring
screenwriters so down at their heels that they live in a storage
shed (the movie is adapted from a stage play, ``Self Storage'').
While looking for shelter, they discover Cliff, an actor who may or
may not be a serial killer who injects his victims with window
cleaner, dresses them like the cast of ``Gilligan's Island'' and
suffocates them with plastic bags. Ron Perlman, with his lantern
jaw and simian teeth, doesn't just chew the scenery in this role _
he bites it in half.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Max and Tiger convince a shady _ and homeless _
producer (''Bound's'' Joe Pantoliano, looking like he's auditioning
to play Trotsky) that they can turn Cliff's story into a movie,
with Cliff's collaboration. The producer, begging for ``fresh''
stories, apparently hasn't seen the past 10 years' worth of
serial-killer movies, and agrees. Along the way, a USC film student
(Kristy Swanson, moving into Elisabeth Shue ``I'm cute, but I can
be edgy'' territory) signs on as a director.
</P>
<P>
   One of the complaints frequently lobbed at critics, especially
when we pan mainstream films, is that we forget that many people go
to the movies simply to relax and be entertained. ``Tinseltown,''
hardly a mainstream film, is an example of a movie that forgets
that; moreover, it forgets that there are people in the audience
who don't live in Hollywood or make movies, and its anemic satire
doesn't make up for its overall air of self-pity.
</P>
<P>
   In its brief running time, it pulls the rug out from under the
audience many times, but it doesn't play fair in doing so,
disregarding common sense to give us plot twists that shouldn't
happen. Pseudo-cutting edge, deceiving itself about its
courageousness, it's a movie made by people who make low-budget
movies for people who make low-budget movies. Unless you count
yourself among that number, skip it.

CHARM OF HAVANA BELIES CITY'S DECLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Editor's note: Baseball columnist Pedro Gomez, a
first-generation Cuban-American, describes his impressions of his
parents' homeland. He is in Havana for Sunday's historic exhibition
game between the Baltimore Orioles and the Cuban National Team.
</P>
<P>
   HAVANA, Cuba - The rays of morning light splashing against this
city's landscape offered a far different view to Havana than
nightfall had managed to disguise just hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Havana's dim night lights _ make no mistake, this is a dark city
at night _ provided an unyielding mask to its scars and ills that
daylight simply could not conceal.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, my thoughts were consumed by my two sons and wife.
I could barely contain myself as I viewed my first Cuban sunrise,
for this is a land where my roots are deeply embedded.
</P>
<P>
   I thought back to my grandparents and parents, who made this
their home before fleeing Fidel Castro's Communist regime in the
early 1960s. How they must have grappled with so much pain and
personal anxiety as they abandoned their homeland 36 years ago when
John F. Kennedy's administration offered an alternative in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The knot in my stomach tightened as the thoughts raced through
my mind. The dawn's light solidified in my mind how fortunate my
family is to have been given the chance to pursue dreams in the
United States, where hard work makes a difference.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a unique story to my family, for many Cuban families
went through similar journeys: in the 1960s, in 1980 during the
Mariel boat lift and more recently, when Cubans risked their lives
on the open seas in makeshift rafts.
</P>
<P>
   Havana is crumbling. Its artistic and elegant architecture, some
of it more than 100 years old, serves as a reminder of the city's
once-glorious past, when people called it the Monte Carlo of the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the buildings' facades seem to be begging for some _ any
_ form of upkeep. A paintbrush alone would cure some of this city's
ills, which include exposed corroding and pockmarked streets and
sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can we do?'' asked Orlando Ochoa (who strongly requested
his real name not be used) of Havana's San Li Opordo neighborhood,
a poor area where the government doesn't necessarily want foreign
journalists venturing but whose friendly inhabitants enchanted me.
``All you have to do is look around and see there are problems too
big to take care of all at once.''
</P>
<P>
   Havana's wounds are not hidden behind some curtain in a remote
area of the city. Prostitution is rampant because most young women
can't earn a living, residents said.
</P>
<P>
   They also said it's doubtful it will be evident this week. A
large foreign press presence in town for the exhibition baseball
game between the Baltimore Orioles and the Cuban National Team, and
the city is putting its best foot forward.
</P>
<P>
   The tourist area, where most of the nicer hotels are located, is
not what Havana is truly like, the residents said.
</P>
<P>
   The police presence is obvious from the moment you step onto
hotel grounds. A 15-year-old boy from the neighborhood ventured
near the cafeteria here, gesturing that he wanted some water, when
he was quickly whisked away.
</P>
<P>
   The nicer areas of Havana show the facade, but reality lies in
its nooks and crannies. When ``Arizona Republic'' photographer Dave
Cruz and I made our way to San Li Opordo, we were told of the crime
spree that had engulfed Havana late last year and early this year,
one President Fidel Castro put an end to with heightened security
and stiff prison sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Like most every Havanero I ran into during my first full day in
Cuba, they could not have been more warm or charming. They
routinely opened their homes, welcoming and encouraging all kinds
of talk, even if it meant occasionally treading into delicate
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Like Evelio Hernandez, they all said we could come back any
time.
</P>
<P>
   My obvious accent in Spanish made several people we ran into
Wednesday ask about my background. Without exception, everyone who
discovered I was born in America to Cuban parents told me how lucky
I am. ``You won the lottery by being born there,'' said one
resident.
</P>
<P>
   I was floored as similar responses came bounding my way.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no idea of how lucky you are,'' Ochoa's 27-year-old
son Armando said. ``I would give anything to change spots with you.
Anything. This system does not work.''
</P>
<P>
   Their words reinforced what I was already feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the main artery of 23rd Street at night and closing
my eyes, I am placed back in a time when roulette wheels spun and
salsa dancers took center stage every night of the week until dawn.
</P>
<P>
   In so many ways, time has simply stopped in Havana. With so few
buildings having been built after the '60s and so many cars from
the 1940s and '50 somehow still being driven, my thoughts drift
back in time.
</P>
<P>
   But then the stench of pollution in the air fills my lungs and
settles in my eyes, and I am reminded of the afflictions strangling
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The current decay is unmistakable and indelible to the mind.
Yes, this is now considered a Third World country. But Cuba was not
always so lacking in so many things.
</P>
<P>
   No amount of Communist propaganda, which fills the city's
billboards and buildings, can conceal Cuba's true ills.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying theme of Cubans is that they are filled with both
despair and an abiding sense of hope that seems to have no touch
with reality.
</P>
<P>
   They definitely know of the promise and riches that lie nearby
in the United States, yet they know they are trapped, unable to do
much of anything other than go with the life they have been dealt,
and one that very nearly became mine.

   You know it's a bad sign when during MGM's ``The Mod Squad,''
even the characters are cracking wise at the hackneyed
predictability of the plot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep thinking one of us should say, `I'm getting too old for
this s---,'' jokes Giovanni Ribisi's Pete, referring to Danny
Glover's tagline in the Cadillac of hackneyed, predictable movie
series, ``Lethal Weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Pete, you don't know the half of it.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the late '60s TV series starring Peggy Lipton, Michael
Cole and Clarence Williams III as a trio of down-and-out criminals
turned undercover cops, this ``Mod Squad'' comes off as a
half-baked retread at best, a mushy TV dinner that could have used
another couple of minutes in the microwave.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the ingredients weren't right. The three young stars
are capable enough _ Claire Danes made a name for herself with the
groundbreaking TV drama ``My So-Called Life'' and has consistently
pulled off strong performances on the big screen. Ribisi's recent
win as ShoWest's male star of tomorrow is a testament to memorable
turns in pictures like ``Saving Private Ryan'' and ``The Other
Sister.'' And Omar Epps, last seen in ``Scream 2,'' just oozes
cool.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody gave these kids any characters to play with. Danes'
Julie is an insecure waif with puppy-dog eyes who hardly seems
capable of surviving the streets. Ribisi's take on Pete isn't much
of a stretch from his portrayal of Phoebe's half-wit brother on
``Friends,'' and Epps' Linc is so cool he's almost frozen.
</P>
<P>
   The attempt to fuse '90s Gen X club-kid mentality with the
hippie counter-culture of the original TV series consists mainly of
a techno rehash of the old show's theme music blaring loudly in the
background. Cool, huh?
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Farina adds a little heat to the mix as Capt. Adam Greer,
the team's reluctant police force supervisor, but his disappearance
early on drains the last shreds of interest in this by-the-numbers
story of bad police officers peddling junk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't tell me this is a whole corrupt-cops-and-drugs thing,''
Pete asks incredulously at one point.
</P>
<P>
   Sigh. Yeah, Pete, we know how you feel.

CLINTON'S LIES MUCH MORE THAN `ONE NEGATIVE'  
 (ADV: THIS EDITORIAL APPEARED IN THE MARCH 25 ARIZONA REPUBLIC) 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic

<P>
   PHOENIX - For the first time, President Clinton found himself
confronting the inglorious consequences of his most disgraceful
public act. Will the Clinton legacy ``be about lying?'' he was
asked at his first press conference since the awful cacophony of
the impeachment and Lewinsky scandals began.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a ``box score,'' the president angrily responded
last Friday. ``And there will be that one negative.''
</P>
<P>
   That one solitary, comparatively pathetic, little lie, he
argued, ``pales before the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
times when the record will show that I did not abuse my authority
as president, that I was truthful with the American people, and
scores and scores of allegations were made against me and widely
publicized without any regard to whether they were true or not.''
</P>
<P>
   You can't really blame the president for grasping at whatever
straw may rescue his heritage, but the plain fact is, his ``one
negative'' constituted one of the greatest whoppers of all time.
And if he wishes to build a box score, he'll need to do a better
job with the players and their positions.
</P>
<P>
   His lie was not a single, finger-wagging, scolding of the
American people for believing he ``had sex with that woman, Ms.
Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a series of lies told over and over _ to his staff, his
Cabinet officers, the courts, and ultimately, to the American
people. His lies to his aides bought political cover for past and
future lies; his lies under oath bought time; and, his lie to the
American people bought him sympathy, patience and pity. ``One
negative''? It was a cold and calculated pattern of deception.
</P>
<P>
   To compare this transgression to a shortstop bobbling a ground
ball completely ignores the lasting impact his ``one negative''
will have on the presidency for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the tone of this presidential election cycle is that of
a scouting jamboree. Elizabeth Dole, in particular, has staked out
territory as the one candidate who voters can trust to never tumble
into tawdry dalliances.
</P>
<P>
   At the same press conference, the president declined to comment
on the rape accusations of Juanita Broaddrick, who contends that
Clinton, as Arkansas Attorney General in 1978, assaulted her in a
Little Rock hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   All things considered, it was just as well he let that little
``negative'' be. &QL;

this month promoting ``Vector,'' a new book that was published
March 1. His novels include ``Coma,'' ``Toxin,'' ``Contagion'' and
``Outbreak.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of his books have been made into TV movies or
miniseries, including ``Robin Cook's Virus'' and ``Robin Cook's
Terminal.''
</P>
<P>
   The other Robin Cook, a British mystery writer, died in 1994 of
cancer at age 63. He used the pen name Derek Raymond and wrote
``The Crust on Its Uppers,'' ``I Was Dora Suarez'' and 13 other
books.

CLINTON'S BIG GAMBLE MUST WORK  
 (ADV: THIS EDITORIAL APPEARED IN THE MARCH 25 ARIZONA REPUBLIC)

 GAMBLE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - President Clinton and NATO are betting _ hoping,
really _ that the launching of airstrikes Wednesday will force
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to halt his killing and
aggression.
</P>
<P>
   In winning Senate support for a bombing campaign, the Clinton
administration argued that it was left with little choice but to
mount an air campaign after exhausting negotiations and essentially
running out of threats.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody questions the humanitarianism of this mission, that
thousands of Kosovar Albanian lives may be at stake and more
villages destroyed if something is not done. But Americans may wake
up to find this foray against a sovereign nation to be a bigger,
bloodier campaign than they expected.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has scarcely briefed the nation on what critics of
American intervention insist is an attempt by the Serbs to quell a
secessionist rebellion. In other words, what business is this of
the United States? The United States has chosen not to involve
itself in similar confrontations in at least a dozen other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., is among those who believe Clinton has
not made a convincing case that U.S. national security is
threatened by the conflict in Yugoslavia. Kyl doubts whether the
bombing campaign proposed by Clinton will force the Serbs to agree
to a peace settlement and says he can't support putting American
troops in harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is banking that airstrikes will prove so devastating
that Milosevic will sign a cease-fire agreement and give the
Albanian rebels limited authority over their own affairs. But what
happens if the Serbs refuse to buckle to cruise missiles and bombs?
What if an air campaign winds up strengthening the resolve of
Milosevic?
</P>
<P>
   What then? Do we send American ground troops into combat with
those from NATO? What option is left?
</P>
<P>
   History suggests conventional air campaigns typically are
followed by the use of ground troops. Witness the Persian Gulf War
in 1991, where American ground troops routed the Iraqis after heavy
bombing. The massive bombing of North Vietnam failed to produce a
U.S. victory.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and NATO attack against an array of Serbian military
targets must be so strong, so convincing, that the Serbs yield
under the pressure. However, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., fears that
the U.S.-led strikes may not be strong enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will the airstrikes be robust or will they be the classic
Clintonian action which is pinprick in nature and not nearly
sufficient to persuade our adversaries to act in a manner which we
want them to?'' McCain asks.
</P>
<P>
   There are other potential ramifications from NATO involvement
that worry observers. While seeking to force the Serbs to the
bargaining table, the allies must guard against the Albanians
pushing for all-out independence. There are fears that an
independent Kosovo would destabilize the Balkans. Further, NATO
must reckon with Russia's opposition to the alliance's military
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In raising the stakes in Kosovo, it is not at all clear whether
America can achieve its aims without paying some high costs. But by
keeping channels of communication open with Milosevic, it may still
be possible to reach an agreement without too much bloodshed. &QL;

FOR GOODNESS SAKE: NEW YORKERS DISCOVER RICE WINE 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as
desired.  
 By ANDREW GLAZER  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The microbrew revolution has come and gone. Martini
madness is so two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a new drink in town. It's clear. It's dry. It's
cool. It's ... sake.
</P>
<P>
   Although the rice wine has been around since 200 A.D., it's only
in the past two decades that Japanese brewers have been making sake
that appeals to Western palates. Last year, two ultra-hot New York
nouveau-Japanese restaurants, Nobu and Bond Street, began
advertising their extensive sake lists, where the price range for a
glass of sake is comparable to that of red wine. And New York's
sake bars, previously visited only by Japanese tourists,
businessmen and a few curious non-Japanese drinkers, in the last
year have begun filling up with New York hipsters and curious
drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, Slick, don't ask for peanuts or popcorn with your
drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cold sake and spicy squid go down good together,'' said
Michael Lonergan, one of the few non-Japanese kimono-clad servers
at Sake Bar Decibel, which was one of the first of its kind in New
York when it opened in the East Village six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lonergan said it's a part of the fusion of cuisine, styles and
culture that have become hot in the city. ``First there was sushi
in the 1980s,'' he said. ``Now there's sake. It's just part of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Decibel has two small dark rooms no bigger than an East Village
one-bedroom apartment, with a number of private booths _ a perfect
hangout for people who want to see and to be seen _ sort of. On a
Monday night, three young Japanese hipsters _ one man wearing
red-tinted glasses and a woman with her hair twisted into
Coolio-style braids _ sat huddled at the bar, chatting in Japanese
with the bartender, who had bleached hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of musicians, artists and supermodels coming
by,'' said Katsushi Takahashi, Decibel's droopy-eyed and bearded
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Lonergan said he recently served musicians Patti Smith and Todd
Rundgren and actor Joaquin Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Decibel's ambiance initially attracted a crowd of regulars who
were mostly sake-illiterate. Or they had tasted the generic hot
sake served at many of the city's sushi bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people have never tried the good stuff,'' said Takahashi,
a self-proclaimed ``heavy drinker'' who said he has tasted all 70
of Decibel's sakes. Most sushi bars and restaurants serve only one
type of sake, Takahashi said. ``The Budweiser. We don't serve the
Budweiser stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon Decibel regulars grew to appreciate its variety of 70
different sakes, which range from $6 to $28 a glass. The taste of
the wine can vary from subtle and fruity to pungent and grassy.
Sake is served either warm or cold and has an alcohol content of
about 16 percent, compared to 12 percent for regular wine and 5
percent for beer. Patrons at Decibel drink sake out of traditional
Japanese clay pots, glasses or wooden boxes, depending on which
sake is served.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Martin, spokesman for one New York's largest sake
distributors, Paramount Brands, said sales have gone up since the
newer, more nuanced sake hit the U.S. market. ``Before, the sake
was made with a gritty taste and a hard aftertaste,'' he said.
``Now there are more perfumy, light sakes, with different
qualities.'' But Martin said sake would always remain in a somewhat
niche market. ``Is it going to sweep the nation like Merlot? I
don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Lonergan said part of sake's appeal is the way it's consumed.
``It's social,'' he said. ``It comes in these little cups or boxes
and you share. Or you pour the warm sake from the clay flask.''
</P>
<P>
   One patron wearing a tight red thrift-store ski sweater said he
has developed a sophisticated appreciation of sake. ``I drink vodka
by the gallon,'' said Lower East Side resident Gary Shteyngart, 27,
a grant writer. ``But the sweetness and dryness of sake make you
not realize that you're getting drunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Although connoisseurs describe sake with the same adjectives
used to discuss wine _ flowery, fragrant, deep, full-bodied _
Decibel isn't that kind of place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say sake goes from sweet and light to heavy and sour,''
Lonergan said.
</P>
<P>
   In midtown is Decibel's more conservative younger sister bar,
Saka Gura. At Saka Gura, a row of gray-, black- and brown-suited
Japanese businessmen, like Masao Wada, an advertising executive
from Himeji, sat at the well-lit and well-stocked sake bar. Wada
was drinking cold sake he described as light. ``I recommend cold
sake because there is no headache in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   The large room also has booths where a mixture of Japanese
visitors and native New Yorkers go after work to unwind, eat spicy
radishes _ another typical sake side _ and sip sake.
</P>
<P>
   When Saka Gura opened three years ago, its clientele was almost
exclusively Japanese tourists and expatriates. But in the past
year, the after-work and weekend crowds have mixed. More upper
middle-class Americans who enjoy wine and spirits have started to
notice the variety of quality sake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think before, sake was not regarded as a wine,'' said Masa
Omichi, Saka Gura's 27 year-old spiky-haired manager from Osaka.
``But it is a rice wine.''
</P>
<P>
   Omichi said he also thinks health-obsessed Americans feel
drinking sake might not be so bad for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Americans ask me how healthy sake is,'' Omichi said. ``I
think many people think Japanese food is healthy,'' Omichi said.
``And they figure, it's made from rice.''
</P>
<P>
   Like grape wine, different sakes are best enjoyed with certain
foods. ``Drinking sake with grated radishes prevents hangovers,''
Omichi said. And aged sake, a sweet brown variety, is best with
cheesecake, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, trendy non-sake-exclusive bars like Bond Street have
started to serve sake and sake-based cocktails including the sweet
``saketini,'' a mixture of plum sake, grapefruit juice and
vermouth. ``It's by far the most popular drink we serve,'' said
Bond Street's black-clad manager, Andrea Marciani, 28, about the $8
drink. ``An updated Cosmopolitan without the harsh aftertaste.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of equivalent to California rolls and sushi,'' said
Mito Yamada, 24, who is originally from Tokyo, but now works as an
analyst at KPMG Peat Marwick in Manhattan. ``It's an American
version of a traditional part of Japanese culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, thousands of miles away in Japan, she said, another
cool, exotic drink has hit the scene: California red wine.

<P>
   STATEN ISLAND _ Vinnie Raia adores his thoroughbreds.
</P>
<P>
   Take King Nick, named for his grandson. Last year, King Nick
finished 11th in a race of 6,823 pigeons. That's right, pigeons.
</P>
<P>
   The bird sped 300 miles nonstop from Carlyle, Pa., to Raia's
Staten Island home. And he wasn't even winded.
</P>
<P>
   Pigeons don't get much respect in New York. But a small circle
of old-timers still compete in a sport that makes champions of
perhaps the world's most despised bird. They may look slow, but
pigeons can fly at speeds of up to 70 mph. It doesn't matter where
you drop them off, they come back like a boomerang.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a huge percentage of the American population that is
not aware of us,'' said Rick Phalen, director of the American
Racing Pigeon Union. ``It's an excellent recreational option. These
are just incredible athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   While pigeon racing was once a favorite pastime of working-class
men and young boys across New York City, the hobby is now
struggling to hold its own. In its peak in the 1970s, New York had
1,325 racers, said Val Matteucci, secretary of the International
Federation of American Homing Pigeon Fanciers. Today, only 700
racers are left.
</P>
<P>
   Few young people are replacing older pigeon racers who die or
become too feeble. Most racers are retirees like Raia. ``In 25 or
30 years, this sport is going to be almost nonexistent,'' said
Raia, who is 62.
</P>
<P>
   Not if the American Racing Pigeon Union can help it. The group,
based in Oklahoma City, is developing an advertising campaign, the
first since the organization formed more than 80 years ago, Phalen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Organized pigeon racing began in Belgium in the mid-1800s.
European immigrants brought the sport to the United States in the
1880s. In its heyday, 18,000 racers, known as flyers, were active.
Pigeon racing is still popular in Belgium and Holland.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how a race works. Pigeons are taken by truck 100 to 600
miles from their homes and released. Each bird wears a rubber band
stamped with a number. The pigeons immediately speed for home. A
100-mile race takes about two hours, while a 600-mile race can
stretch to 14 hours.
</P>
<P>
   When the birds arrive, their owners pull off the band and put it
in a special clock that records the arrival time, guaranteeing
flyers don't cheat. (Owners insist they do not bet.) The speed of
the bird is measured in yards per minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lost races in seconds,'' Raia said.
</P>
<P>
   Some birds don't make it back alive. Hawks pick them off, they
get sick or collide with a wire or other obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   So why do pigeons come home?
</P>
<P>
   It's mostly instinct, but intelligence plays a part, said Mindy
LaBranche of Project PigeonWatch, a research program at Cornell
University's Lab of Ornithology. Like a compass, the birds sense
direction magnetically. Their strong vision and hearing also helps.
</P>
<P>
   But not all pigeons are created equal. Some won't race and
couldn't possibly find home. ``It could be because we've bred it
out of the species,'' LaBranche said. ``And you have to develop
that sense a bit, even if it's in the genes.''
</P>
<P>
   No one seems to know how people discovered pigeons' homing
ability. East Mediterranean grain farmers who kept them for food
domesticated the birds 5,000 to 10,000 years ago. During World War
II, thousands of donated American pigeons carried messages for the
Allies. One pigeon, GI Joe, saved a battalion of soldiers by flying
from France to Holland to warn of a German advancement.
</P>
<P>
   Pigeons race no farther than many migratory birds. They are just
more focused. They don't stop, even to eat, unless the weather is
very bad. Home means safety, ample food and their nest _ the
answers to their subconscious desire for survival, LaBranche said.
</P>
<P>
   They are also fascinating. As a young boy growing up on Staten
Island, Raia helped an adult neighbor with his pigeons.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see them come home from such a tremendous distance and land
on a three-by-three-foot board,'' Raia said. ``To fly 500, 600
miles and come home, that was amazing to me as a child.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years later, he still loves the sport. The retired
construction company owner rises each day by dawn to feed King Nick
and the rest of his 200 birds. During the racing season, he loads
them in crates and drives his prized team away from his home and
lets them loose. In the evenings, he feeds them and cleans.
</P>
<P>
   While Raia loves his birds, those who tarry don't last long.
Every two years, he takes the slowpokes to his basement and, one by
one, puts them in a knapsack and rings their necks. It hurts him to
do it, but he doesn't have room to keep them all.
</P>
<P>
   It takes more than dedication to be a flyer, Matteucci said. It
takes money.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can spend three to five hundred dollars a year on
medication alone,'' he said. ``It used to be a poor man's hobby,
but if you dabble in it now, you need quite a few dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   When Rudy Cherney was growing up in a mostly Italian
neighborhood in lower Harlem, a good fancy pigeon, which doesn't
have the homing instinct, sold for 15 cents apiece. He started with
an eight-crate loft of the pigeons on his parent's fire escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every other apartment house would have pigeons on the roof,''
Cherney said.
</P>
<P>
   Cherney, who is now 75 and living in New Jersey, still races
pigeons, although the prices have changed in the past 60 years.
Today, a good racing pigeon costs $300 to $500.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Phalen calls the sport reasonable. One survey found that
40 percent of racers spend between $50 and $100 a month. ``Is golf
cost-prohibitive? Is bowling cost-prohibitive?'' Phalen said. ``You
can spend about what you want to spend.''
</P>
<P>
   Raia and Cherney want to see their beloved pastime live on.
Cherney takes his birds to classrooms and children's clubs to
encourage the next generation. His racing club donates free pigeons
to new racers. ``We'll do whatever it takes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Cherney knows today's children have more ways to pass the
time than he did. That's a shame, he says, because bird racing is
more than just a hobby. ``It kept us out of trouble when we were
children in New York,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   None of Raia's four children shows interest in the sport. He
figures he will have to sell his birds when he gets too old to
race. That makes him sad. To promote the cause, he recently slapped
a bumper sticker on his blue pickup that reads, ``Need a hobby? Fly
pigeons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey kids! You want to eat?'' Raia called to the adult
contingent of his loft. He was answered with much cooing and
flapping of wings. He skipped the adults to feed the babies first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, come on, come on, come on,'' he said, his hands, with
fingers thick as hotdogs, pouring a mixture of beans, safflower
seeds, Brewer's yeast and corn oil into a wooden trough. He moved
on to the adults, staying around to hand-feed them peanuts for a
treat. ``I would never think about getting rid of the birds,'' he
said.

WARTIME RACISM EXPOSED IN NBC STORY ON BLACK MUTINEERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, March 28)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the World War II generation gracefully exits the stage to a
final and deserved round of applause, you wonder what stories could
be left to tell about the conflict that defined this century.
</P>
<P>
   Then you are shocked, and in many ways saddened, to just learn
of an incident that killed so many men, ruined so many careers, and
for no good reason.
</P>
<P>
   For all that was right about America in leading that fight
against totalitarianism, our government was still mired in the sin
of racism. It was an ugly contradiction, fighting for the united
good with segregated armed forces, liberating the concentration
camps of Europe while Japanese Americans were incarcerated here in
the States solely because of their race.
</P>
<P>
   So the story of what happened near San Francisco one night in
the summer of 1944 faded underneath the bright light of glory.
Eventually, a nation forgot about Port Chicago, the tragedy and the
injustice, an injustice that lingers today. Thankfully, television
is reminding us.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the History Channel did an excellent documentary on
the Port Chicago Mutiny. Now NBC and actor Morgan Freeman, this
time behind the scenes as an executive producer, bring the story to
dramatic light in ``Mutiny'' (Sunday at 9 EST, NBC, check local
listings). It is a powerful and cautionary tale, one that even
Freeman did not know much about until he undertook the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think ideas float,'' Freeman said recently. ``This story,
yeah, has been around. It is just one of millions, thousands,
waiting to be told. It just spontaneously combusts.''
</P>
<P>
   The story once made headlines, how 320 men were killed and 390
wounded _ the overwhelmingly majority black sailors _ on the night
of July 17, 1944, when a transport ship anchored and being loaded
at the Port Chicago Munitions Base just outside of San Francisco
exploded.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the largest man-made explosions in history.
Everyone and everything within 1,000 feet of the blast site was
obliterated in an explosion that sent smoke and fire 12,000 feet
skyward. How devastating? A locomotive engine on train tracks on
the dock simply disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   It was the worst home-front disaster of World War II. The 202
black sailors killed (in addition to the 233 wounded) amounted to a
staggering 15 percent of all blacks killed in the war.
</P>
<P>
   Why so many blacks? Because in the segregated Navy, blacks were
given jobs filled with danger but none of the accompanying glories
of combat. Blacks, none with adequate training, were responsible
for loading the munitions ships. This was under white officers, of
course, some of whom, evidence suggests, were betting between
themselves as to which unit could load transports faster.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks after the disaster, 50 black sailors refused to go
back to work until they received proper training. The stage was
then set for the biggest mutiny trial in the history of the Navy.
All were convicted in a court-martial, despite the protests of a
courtside observer, NAACP attorney _ and later Supreme Court
justice _ Thurgood Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy tribunal took all of 80 minutes of deliberations to
convict, and the sailors were given various prison stretches
ranging from eight to 15 years. Two years later, the sentences were
commuted, and the sailors were discharged a year later. And while
some credit the incident for playing a role in President Harry
Truman's decision to integrate the armed forces, the convictions
were never overturned, even though there is evidence racial
prejudice played a role in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to expunge the blight on the sailors' records continue
to this day in Washington (for more information, visit the Web site
www.portchicagomutiny.com).
</P>
<P>
   So who or what was blamed for the blast? Lack of training? An
untenable schedule to keep supplies flowing to the Pacific? Racist
officers? Try the victims, at least in a Pentagon report that never
pinpointed the exact cause of the blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consensus opinion of the witnesses is that the colored
enlisted personnel are neither temperamentally nor intellectually
capable of handling high explosives,'' according to a portion of
the Navy report excerpted in the History Channel documentary. ``It
is an admitted fact that there was rough and careless handling of
explosives being loaded at Port Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mutiny,'' in which Freeman does not appear, is made up of a
capable cast of mostly unknowns and several familiar faces, with
several real-life stories melded into composites because of
dramatic purposes and time. It is not fun television, but it is
important television, and well done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is history. It is time to be dealt with ... and close the
books on it,'' Freeman said of the Port Chicago Mutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Let the postscript be written by Freddie Meeks, a black Port
Chicago ammunition loader and one of the 50 involved in the mutiny,
as he told the History Channel: ``And now it is out and I can talk
about it. Thank God. Long time. It hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   He then bowed and shook his head slowly.
</P>
<P>
   It's out. And as a nation, we can't afford to forget again, or
say it is too late to right the wrong.

SYRUP ISN'T JUST FOR BREAKFAST ANYMORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Maple syrup is the perfect topping for pancakes
and waffles. But don't limit maple syrup to breakfast topping.
</P>
<P>
   Be creative and regard it as a substitute for sugar. Maple syrup
is also well suited for marinades, and because of its viscosity, a
half-cup goes a long way.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, don't forget how well maple syrup works for glazing.
Want to add a sweet glaze to a ham as it finishes baking? Baste it
with maple syrup during the final half-hour. Likewise, pork chops
almost sing with sweetness when a quarter-cup of maple syrup is
added to the pan during the last five minutes of frying.
</P>
<P>
   There are three grades, or colors, of syrup _ light amber,
medium amber and dark amber.
</P>
<P>
   Light amber, which has a delicate flavor, is considered premium
maple syrup. It retails for approximately $40 per gallon, when it's
available.
</P>
<P>
   Medium amber maple syrup sells for about $34 per gallon, or $4
for an 8-ounce container.
</P>
<P>
   Sap harvesters often sell in bulk their dark amber to commercial
operations such as Log Cabin syrup.
</P>
<P>
   If you are eager for inspiration when it comes to using maple
syrup, try either of these recipes:
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MAPLE SYRUP CREME BRULEE
</P>
<P>
   Heat 2 cups heavy cream almost to a simmer. In a medium bowl,
stir 8 large egg yolks (or 3 large eggs) and 2/3 cup maple syrup
with a wooden spoon until blended. Gradually stir in the hot cream.
Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl or large measure with
a pour lip. Stir in 3/4 teaspoon vanilla.
</P>
<P>
   Pour into 6 or 8 custard cups and place all cups in a large pan.
Add enough hot water to the pan to come halfway up the sides of the
custard cups. Set the pan in the oven and set the temperature at
250 degrees. Bake until the custard is set but still slightly
quivery in the center when the cups are gently shaken, 1 to 1 1/2
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the custards from the water bath and let cool to room
temperature. Cover each one tightly with plastic wrap and
refrigerate for at least 8 hours and up to 2 days. Shortly before
serving, gently blot any liquid that has formed on the surface with
paper towels, then caramelize the surface by sprinkling the custard
with sugar and the melting the sugar under the broiler or with a
propane torch.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MAPLE SYRUP CHICKEN
</P>
<P>
   (Makes 4 to 5 servings.)
</P>
<P>
   1 (2 1/2- to 3-pound) chicken, cut up, or equivalent chicken
breasts
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon grated lemon rind
</P>
<P>
   Dash pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup butter, melted
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup maple syrup
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt, optional
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup chopped onions
</P>
<P>
   Heat oven to 400 degrees. Butter a shallow baking dish.
</P>
<P>
   Place chicken pieces in baking dish. Mix remaining ingredients
and pour evenly over chicken. Bake uncovered 50 to 60 minutes,
basting occasionally. Serve on a bed of rice.

<P>
   OLD GREENWICH, CONN. _ Katherine Ellenthal's class of
8-year-olds wanted to know more. Most of them understood that
something unusual was going on and a few had watched President Bill
Clinton talking about it on the television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does the war have a name?,'' one boy wanted to know. ``I think
we're bombing Siberia,'' offered another.
</P>
<P>
   In his address, President Clinton had suggested that Americans
look for Kosovo in an atlas. And so, like thousands of teachers
across America, Ms. Ellenthal started the school day by reaching
for the map _ one of those multi-colored canvases that rolls down
over the blackboard.
</P>
<P>
   It was an old one, though, and not tremendously helpful. It had
the former Yugoslavia but no place named Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody could blame these children for being a touch vague about
NATO operations in the Balkans. In fact, they measured up fairly
well against some of the adults interviewed Thursday outside.
(Certainly they seemed less confused than the lady heard on the
radio suggesting that Kosovo was a chain of gas stations.)
</P>
<P>
   Most had grasped this: There is someone bad doing bad things a
long way away and America wants to stop him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know its happening around Rome and Greece and people are
getting killed,'' one freckled boy volunteered, his hand in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   Another interrupted: ``We're being attacked by an ally and so
we're going to try to get a peace but if that doesn't work we're
going to make a war.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to my Dad,'' another boy chimes in. ``He told me
we were bombing them because they were having a war and so we have
declared war too.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone offered this vivid picture (perhaps a little too vivid
for Ms. Ellenthal): ``People have been taken out of their homes and
put in line and told to go on their knees. And then they've been
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Only three of the children _ it is a class of boys and girls _
had heard of Slobodan Milosevic (though everyone thought the name
funny). Saddam Hussein they knew _ he has been America's villain
for longer.
</P>
<P>
   And most had trouble with the concept of civil war. ``It's the
North fighting South,'' one boy noted. One of the girls in the
class, then spoke with great authority of Israel and Egypt once
going to war over Sinai. The same girl added that stopping wars is
important because sometimes they spread.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton would have applauded her. He would have been
pleased too that this class had a sense that going into a war can
be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   One boy turned anxiously to this visiting reporter to ask:
``Will they be sending planes here?'' Somebody else was worried
about the distance involved and the fact that U.S. soldiers had to
cross the Atlantic. ``That's where the Titanic sank,'' he reminded
his friends.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Brown is the manager of the gas station just across the
road from the Old Greenwich School. It's a Sunoco station. (I
suggested that maybe it was Sunoco that the lady on the radio had
confused with Kosovo _ or, more likely, Conoco).
</P>
<P>
   He was not much further ahead than the school children on what
was going on. ``I usually try to keep up on it, the news, but you
know...'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Recently he has working shifts from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. Give him a
map, he said, and he could point to Yugoslavia, but as for... Where
was it again? ``You see I can't even pronounce it.''
</P>
<P>
   Right next to the school is the ``Off Center Barber Shop.''
Behind the counter was Leslie Porter. She had seen most of
President Clinton's address and was more or less convinced that
bombing the Serbs was a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's a good idea,'' she said. ``But in some aspects
its stinks because people are going to get killed for something
that will never get resolved. Is it going to fix anything?''
</P>
<P>
   As for the president suggesting that she may not know where
Kosovo is, well, he was more or less right, she admitted. ``I heard
about it over the last couple of months, but it wasn't anything
important to me. What's Kosovo going to do for me? I never heard of
any new hairstyles coming out of there!'' &QL;

GEORGE WILL'S LONELY STANCE ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANN McBRIDE  
 and DONALD SIMON  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Newspaper columnist and commentator George Will
works himself into high dudgeon over the fact that Common Cause and
other political reformers don't share his peculiarly elitist vision
of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   He's right. We don't. In Will's world, democracy is a great
system _ for those who can afford to buy it. One of his recent
columns celebrates the growth of political soft money _ those huge
unregulated contributions from corporations, labor unions and
wealthy individuals that are at the heart of the scandals during
the last presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Will has a strange way of discussing soft money. He
notes that the almost $200 million of it raised by the two
political parties in the last election works out to a piddling 50
cents per voter. What could be more innocent than that?
</P>
<P>
   Not much, of course, if every voter had really given 50 cents of
it. Instead, 12 tobacco companies together donated more than $5.4
million in soft money during the 1998 election cycle. That's not 50
cents per voter. That's an average of $455,000 per tobacco company.
</P>
<P>
   Will may be naive enough to think that tobacco companies donate
that kind of money simply to express their civic enthusiasm for
participatory democracy. Maybe so. But those contributions also
just might have had something to do with the tobacco industry's
success in killing the tobacco bill that would have regulated the
sale of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   But for Will, it seems that's what democracy is all about. Every
citizen should have the same right as every tobacco company to buy
a million dollars' worth of influence on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   So Will's problem with campaign finance reform is that he just
doesn't get it. If you don't see a problem in mushrooming amounts
of big money being used in Washington to openly buy access and
influence with our national leaders in order to distort policy
outcomes in government, then you don't see the need for any
solution. From Will's lofty perspective, that's good old-fashioned
democracy at work. A great system for those who can afford it.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans can't. And thankfully, most Americans don't share
Will's vision of democracy. That's why polls show nine out of 10
Americans want significant political reform to reduce the influence
of big money in politics. That's why voters in Arizona,
Massachusetts, California, Colorado, Arkansas and Maine _ every
state where there was a reform proposal on the ballot in the last
two elections _ have enacted campaign finance reform at the state
level.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why a majority in Congress supports reform. Last
year, a bipartisan majority in both the House and the Senate voted
for a bill to end soft money. The legislation died only when a
minority of Senators used a filibuster to block the bill from a
final vote.
</P>
<P>
   The symmetry must have been perfect for Will _ a minority of
legislators using obstructionist tactics to preserve a system that
best serves the interests of the tiny minority of wealthy citizens
who can afford to participate in it. Elitist democracy at work.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the usual suspects who disagree with Will. A
growing number of business leaders, like Warren Buffett, are
calling for an end to soft money. And when he left Congress, former
Sen. Alan Simpson, a conservative Republican from Wyoming, said
that the role of bid money in politics today is ``poisoning the
system, it is prostituting ideas and ideals. It is demeaning
democracy and debasing debate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, thank goodness, also does not share Will's
vision. More than 20 years ago, the court correctly recognized that
bid money causes corruption in politics. And because of that, the
court said that the First Amendment does not bar efforts to reduce
the pernicious influence of money by limiting the size of
contributions, by banning corporate and union money in campaigns,
by providing for public financing, by requiring full disclosure and
by enacting voluntary spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   Had Will bothered to check, he also would have found that the
Supreme Court has upheld limits on contributions made by an
individual to a political party.
</P>
<P>
   There is still a debate in the lower courts about the role of
money in politics. Some lower courts have said that certain reform
efforts have gone too far in trying to rein in money. Others have
upheld these efforts.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are some tough questions here. But Will is
dead wrong about defining the soft money issue as an effort to ban
speech about issues or limit participation in politics. Rather it
is an effort to protect democracy from the corrosive effect of big
money and to preserve public confidence in the institutions and
ideals of government. That's hard to do when a quarter of a billion
dollars of soft money is sloshing around the White House and the
halls of Congress, as it was in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But Will doesn't care about that. He's too busy getting the
vapors whenever he thinks about Common Cause working with a growing
list of reformers in Congress to make the political process more
open and democratic. That will happen _ sooner, rather than later.
When it does, someone better fetch smelling salts for George Will.

   PRAGUE _ The decision by NATO to bomb Serbian forces has
provided NATO's newest members with an abrupt test of their
commitment to the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Already, leaders of the Czech opposition and the government of
Hungary, which borders Serbia and has a large ethnic minority
there, have expressed reservations about the air attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Polish government and President Vaclav Havel of the Czech
Republic have expressed their full support for the action by the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first great test, not only of our government but
also of our political elites and of public opinion which has never
been enthusiastic for conflict,'' said Jiri Sedivy, deputy director
of the Institute for International Relations in Prague.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear now what NATO is,'' said Jan Skorzynski, foreign
editor of the Polish newspaper Rzeczpospolita. ``The simple view in
Poland was that NATO was here to protect us, and now the moment
comes when we have to do something for others.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10 years after they threw off over four decades of
Communist rule and left the Warsaw Pact, Poland, the Czech Republic
and Hungary became members of NATO on March 12, and the new
members' armies have been eager to show they are now firmly on the
Western side.
</P>
<P>
   Poland has established a joint army corps with two other NATO
members, Germany and Denmark, and pledged a parachute brigade to
any NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Czechs, who have peacekeepers in Bosnia, have pledged a
field hospital to any new NATO force, despite some resistance from
the conservative opposition led by former Prime Minister Vaclav
Klaus, now chairman of the Czech Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking hours after Secretary-General Javier Solana ordered air
strikes on Serbian targets Klaus said he still favored a diplomatic
solution, saying it was necessary to ``remembers the pain and
suffering which is mostly borne by innocent people.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior members of Klaus's party also questioned the government's
offer of a field hospital to support NATO peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   But Havel said that while deciding to bomb was not easy, ``there
was no alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The sovereignty and freedom of the Serbs must not be asserted
at the cost of suppressing human rights and at the cost of the free
development of other nations in Yugoslavia,'' he said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In Hungary, the only NATO member state to share a border with
Serbia, the government took a low-key approach.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Viktor Orban stopped short of endorsing the
raids, telling state-run radio only that ``there is no sign that
Hungary is in any danger'' and pledging not to deploy Hungarian
troops in Yugoslavia. However, Hungary agreed to open its air space
to NATO for the raids and to provide a field hospital in
Macedonia. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MARIA, Calif. _ The impeachment trial is now a memory.
Those who wanted to put it all behind us have succeeded, at a
terrible price, and we are back to normal. House managers are
congressmen again and we have determined that something despicable
really wasn't all that bad.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, I am left with a thought that is more affirmation
than revelation. This is the essential difference between a
Republican and a Democrat. The great gap between the parties is far
more than ideological. Republicans and Democrats are of different
mentalities and show signs of being two distinct species of human
being.
</P>
<P>
   What separates them is party loyalty. To a Republican, the party
is merely an instrument that works for him about half the time.
</P>
<P>
   It is better than the alternative _ but this is as far as any
deep feelings exist. The Republican is basically a conservative and
this is what he cares about, where his passions lie. The Republican
Party is nothing more than a means of making it work, although it
hasn't really served him all that well.
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat, on the other hand, sees his party as something of a
religion. He sees himself as a Democrat rather than as a liberal.
</P>
<P>
   He will deny being a liberal even though he has just voted for a
candidate who is somewhere to the left of Leon Trotsky.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are good at looking the other way. When forced to look
at blatant corruption and immorality on the part of their leaders,
they brush it off with such phrases as, ``He is guilty only of
being human,'' ``Everybody does it,'' and the ever popular, ``That
is the way the game is played.''
</P>
<P>
   Big city political machines have invariably been Democratic. The
political bosses have ruled over their fiefdoms with the full
knowledge and consent of the Democratic voters who put them in
office and kept them there. Throughout this century, and even
before, these corrupt, larcenous individuals have had the full
approval of the peasants in the field, people who honestly believed
that they were better off because these old pirates were enriching
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans resented the obscenity, but Democrats applauded.
</P>
<P>
   This attitude has spilled over into modern times and has given
the Clinton administration a free ride. Those who repeated the
vapid inanity that Clinton's indiscretions did not ``rise to the
level of impeachment'' are the children and grandchildren of those
who smiled upon the corrupt big city machines and permitted the
pillaging to continue. To a Democrat, one's leaders are not to be
questioned. It is the Roman Catholic doctrine of infallibility,
transferred to Chicago and Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   When Republicans bid a dry-eyed farewell to Spiro Agnew, Richard
Nixon and Robert Packwood, they did so knowing that the country
would be better off without them. In one way or another, they had
all violated a trust and were not worthy of public office. It would
be unthinkable for Democrats to react the same way about one of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   It has all descended from those days of big boss politics when
stealing was all right as long as your guy was doing it. When
reminded that Big Ed has looted the parks department payroll to buy
himself a yacht, the loyal supporter will counter with the case for
the defense: ``When my old man died, this man sent flowers. You
can't fault a guy like that.'' It makes sense to a Democrat.

 Color slide of actress Gwyneth Paltrow in a scene from
``Shakespeare in Love.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    At 25, Gwyneth Paltrow virtually stole the Oscar show.
 &HT;    She's the new Grace Kelly_''the Meryl Streep of the '90s'' as
one critic put it, both tearful and radiant on Oscar night in her
pink Ralph Lauren gown.
 &HT;    Winning her first best actress Oscar for her role romancing
William Shakespeare, Paltrow has Hollywood at her feet. However
Paltrow, whose victory puts her into the $10-million-a-film
bracket, is single again after breaking up from her ``Shakespeare
in Love'' costar Ben Affleck.
 &HT;    ``I'm eager to remain single,'' Paltrow says. ``Today far too
many young people get married and those marriages end in divorce.''
 &HT;    Paltrow, who has worked nonstop for the past three years in
England, Italy and Canada, says she has been trying ``to get my
life back.''
 &HT;    Her blonde hair pulled severely back, and looking like a sexy
and very glamorous model, she admits she's glad to be back in
America: ``I just want a little quiet time_to enjoy life. There's
nothing wild planned. I just want to be normal again, to do my
thing. I missed American football all that time in Europe.''
 &HT;    She worked in Italy shooting ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' with
Matt Damon and in Vancouver doing ``Duets'' for her father, Bruce
Paltrow, who directed the film.
 &HT;    ``I want to do the normal things, hang out, see my friends,
read, wander through the bookstores and stay home and cook. I just
want to get my life back together and decorate my home in New
York.''
 &HT;    She's hardly been out of the spotlight since she broke up with
her fiancee Brad Pitt and then again very publicly split with
Affleck_whom she thanked on Oscar night, referring to him as ``my
friend.''
 &HT;    During her time with Pitt she had turned down some big pictures,
including ``The Avengers,'' so she wouldn't be separated from him.
But he fell into the arms of Jennifer Aniston_and Paltrow teamed up
offscreen with Affleck.
 &HT;    ``I've done a lot of movies during a short period of time,'' she
says. ``When you first get movies you say I'd better just work
because they're gonna pay me really well. But now I've changed my
priorities. I want to get my personal life together so I'm slowing
down.''
 &HT;    While ``Shakespeare'' won seven Oscars, including best picture,
fans of the film were surprised when Paltrow went topless in a love
scene with Joseph Fiennes as the young Will Shakespeare. (She
seemed to be naked opposite Ethan Hawke in ``Great Expectations,''
but a body double was actually used.)
 &HT;    ``My grandfather might be shocked,'' says Paltrow, ``and I think
some people were taken off guard by my nudity. Anytime someone gets
comfortable with the way they perceive me, or how I should behave
in a film, I think it's time for me to reverse it.''
 &HT;    In ``Shakespeare'' Paltrow plays a rich and titled Englishwoman
who disguises herself as a man to audition for a role on stage. In
Elizabethan England, only men and boys could act in stage roles.
 &HT;    ``It was exhausting,'' she says. ``It took so much out of me. I
had to dress like a boy, walk like a boy, speak in a low, deep
voice, all the time speaking in verse with an English accent.''
 &HT;    It gave her, she says, a whole new look at life from the other
side. ``It's so unbelievable to see how differently men treat me
when I'm dressed like a man. They say things to me they'd never
think of saying when I was in a wig and long dress.''
 &HT;    Though her refined good looks have made her a natural for period
films, Paltrow says she'd now like to do what she calls, ``a
grossout movie.''
 &HT;    ``I really want something different to the kind of roles they
send me. I get the same scripts as Claire Danes and Winona Ryder.
People don't think of me as Sandra Bullock or Nicole Kidman.
They're the ones who get the big movies. I just get the little
ones.''
 &HT;    Her next picture, ``The Passion,'' is a love story set in the
Napoleonic era.
 &HT;    ``I feel very fortunate to have the career I have,'' she says.
``Winning the Oscar is like a fairy tale come true. I'm happy
because I really believe I'm a centered person. Let's be realistic.
I've been happier at other times in my life, for different reasons.
It's all relative, of course. But yes...you can say Gwyneth Paltrow
is happy again.''

 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Can I say for sure? No, not really.
</P>
<P>
   But I deem it a reasonable presumption that the voice mail
message I got Wednesday came from one of the off-duty cops I'd seen
in the courtroom the day before. That was when I'd dropped by the
Albany County Courthouse to catch the close of the trial of
Officers Sean McKenna and Bill Bonanni.
</P>
<P>
   They were accused of beating up a suspect in handcuffs, a
belligerent college basketball player named Jermaine Henderson. A
good two dozen Albany cops were in that courtroom Tuesday. I
couldn't say if they were there to support their comrades, to
intimidate jurors or some combination of the two. But I will
recount the voice mail message for you.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wonderful of you to show up at the brutality trial
yesterday,'' the caller said. ``I saw you there in the back of the
courtroom for, what? Maybe two minutes after the jury had left and
the charges had been read?
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the words I want to see in your next column: `I
never attended one minute of the trial.' Then you can go ahead and
write all you want about how you think the verdict is just or
unjust. `I never attended one minute of the trial. Therefore, I
have no idea of what the facts in this case were.'''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, this guy never approached me to say his piece to my
face while I was standing just a few feet away from him. And,
naturally, he didn't leave his name or number when he called.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, neither did the other guys who'd called me
earlier complaining about what I've written about this case _ the
ones who made crude, anonymous death threats. Were any of those
guys in that courtroom Tuesday? I can only speculate. My guess is
that they were.
</P>
<P>
   Once it got rolling, I made it a point not to write about this
trial. I wanted nothing I might write to be construed as having
affected the jury's verdict. What I wanted from the start here was
to see Jermaine Henderson on the stand. I wanted him telling his
story and subjected to cross-examination while jurors watched,
listened and evaluated his credibility.
</P>
<P>
   But District Attorney Sol Greenberg wouldn't permit that. He
firmly refused to give the Henderson kid immunity in exchange for
his testimony in this case. Greenberg seemed to bend over backwards
to guarantee that the complainant never would enter that courtroom
to tell his story and have it fairly challenged.
</P>
<P>
   What I thought McKenna and Bonanni deserved _ and what this
community deserved as well _ was a fair trial. But the callers who
threatened my life _ as well as that nameless, craven bozo who
called me the other morning _ weren't at all interested in a fair
trial. They weren't prepared to settle for fairness.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that I've followed this case closely. I understand
the evidence. In fact, the only people who didn't have all the
available evidence were the jurors. That's because Greenberg saw to
it that Henderson wouldn't testify.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney behaved horribly throughout this whole
slimy adventure. So did some of the Albany cops. Most of the 350 or
so members of the Police Department are devoted public servants
with a strong desire to protect and a sharply honed sense of
justice. Some of them, though _ the ones I've heard from, anyway _
seem to be cowardly thugs and bullies who think it's perfectly fine
to kick around suspects in handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   Did McKenna and Bonanni actually do that? As I've said
repeatedly, I don't know. I wasn't there. A jury has determined
that there's reasonable doubt as to whether they did it. Fine.
That's the system _ although wouldn't it have been nice if this
jury had included just one of the six minority folks who were
methodically knocked out in jury selection?
</P>
<P>
   Whether they did it or not, however, nobody can argue that
McKenna and Bonanni haven't suffered. They still face perjury
charges. They still face administrative charges that could end
their careers. You can also bet that their lawyers, Steve Coffey
and Tommy Neidl, already have separated them from serious sums of
money.
</P>
<P>
   And Jermaine Henderson, who does seem to have started all this
by punching one of the cops in a bar dispute, is off in Illinois
somewhere with a $60,000 civil settlement from the city when he
probably should be doing time.
</P>
<P>
   So, maybe all that, taken together, constitutes rough justice _
at least to some people, if not to me. The problem is that so many
people involved in this seemed to view justice as their lowest
priority. Greenberg seemed much more interested in protecting
McKenna and Bonanni. And the cops marching on city hall and making
nasty phone calls to me seemed more interested in seeing their
comrades escape justice than in whether McKenna and Bonanni really
might have done what they were accused of doing.
</P>
<P>
   So, we're pretty much left with this:
</P>
<P>
   _ A minority community that constitutes two-thirds of arrestees
in a city 75 percent white;
</P>
<P>
   _ A minority community that now has seen white cops accused of
beating up a black suspect in cuffs effectively protected by a
district attorney who seems not to have a clue as to why that's
unacceptable conduct;
</P>
<P>
   _ A minority community whose widely documented fear of the
police and distrust of the criminal justice system can only be
intensified by the vile behavior of some of the people within that
system.
</P>
<P>
   _ A certain number of white cops in New York's capital city _ I
can't say precisely how many _ behaving like redneck skinheads.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, this has been the scummiest episode I've seen played
out in more than three decades of watching the criminal system
operate.
</P>

CHOOSE YOUR OWN MIX TO MATCH THE STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN PHINNEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Eclectic'' became a buzzword in home furnishings several years
ago. This spring it's a perfect description of fashion offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Eclectic means to gather items from several sources _ twin sets
(a 1950s look) worn with military-like cargo pants, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Eclectic style is easy to spot in a room arrangement that
includes a classic sofa, an antique armoire and perhaps a high-tech
plexiglass table. With clothing, it's not so easy.
</P>
<P>
   When designers previewed their spring '99 collections last fall,
they paraded everything from '60s hippie looks to paramilitary garb
_ sometimes simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Free-flowing shift dresses, color-blocked costumes resembling
Mondrian paintings, kimonolike jackets, skirts or tops resembling
aprons, and tops with three-quarter-length sleeves were all part of
the shows.
</P>
<P>
   While little white shirts and capri pants, a la early Audrey
Hepburn, are in the spring '99 picture, it's more of a
Cher-inspired, or rich-hippie happening with ethnic fabrics and
embroidery.
</P>
<P>
   And if the mere thought of bellbottoms, capris, daisy prints or
gypsylike mixes brings on a headache rather than an urge to shop,
there are options galore.
</P>
<P>
   That's the nice thing about eclecticism. It doesn't have to
involve a head-to-toe makeover. With the addition of a few pieces,
a wardrobe can appear updated.
</P>
<P>
   Take twin sets. These trendy twosomes of pullover _ this season
it's a tank or shell shape _ paired with a cardigan can give a
fresh look to pants and skirts already on hand.
</P>
<P>
   The cardigan also can be worn over a sheath or shift dress in
lieu of a jacket, or tied around the shoulders as a fashion
accessory. When weather warms, the shell or tank top can go solo.
</P>
<P>
   Another easy update would be a pair of flat-front (that means
pleat-free) long or cropped pants _ extra fashion points if they're
cropped.
</P>
<P>
   Adding pink _ and there's a shade of it for everyone _ is
another way to demonstrate fashion savvy this spring. Ralph Lauren
uses strawberry pink. Max Azria, designer for the BCBG label is
showing a vivid raspberry. But pale or bright, pink is powerful.
</P>
<P>
   So is white. Nordstrom is promoting a spectrum of whites _
stone, ecru, ivory, cement and bright white _ for lightening and
brightening the season.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Steele, Nordstrom fashion director for the Pacific
Northwest, calls the whites ``a refreshing counterpoint to last
season's dark shades.'' She also refers to white as ``an instant
mood-booster.''
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Gilmore, a divisional vice president at The Bon Marche
in Seattle, says gray, pink and white are the three dominant shades
for spring, with pink being more popular with so-called ``junior''
shoppers, a word that denotes an attitude, not necessarily an age.
</P>
<P>
   For a working woman, Gilmore suggests gray from head to toe, in
a linen or silk, for example. She bought a gray pantsuit, along
with a white cotton shirt blended with Lycra spandex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stretch for comfort is key,'' Gilmore says. It doesn't
necessarily mean a garment fits like a second skin, but it is
closer to the body. And stretch fabrics are showing up in capri
pants, shirts and T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to stretch, we're going to see a lot of wrinkle-free
and easy-care clothing _ linens that can be washed, dried and worn
without ironing, Gilmore predicts. ``That's one reason linen will
become more important this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Boatnecks and three-quarter-length sleeves are other signs of
spring '99, along with cargo pants adorned with big pockets,
drawstring pants and hooded sweaters.
</P>
<P>
   For evening, designers favor hip-slung skirts and pants with
cropped tops that let skin show. Linda Allard, designer for the
Ellen Tracy label, pairs tube tops or halters with hip-riding pants
and skirts.
</P>
<P>
   Don't want to join the navel show? Close the gap with a longer
top, and pull the drawstring in at the waist, instead of the hips.

detectors on satellites and triggering telescopic observations from
earth. Now a series of papers being published in Science and Nature

and what it might or might not have been. Among other things, it
appears now that the explosion was not a fireball but some kind of

NANCY WILSON TAKES HEART IN SOLO ALBUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GENE STOUT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long before she became famous in the '70s as a member of Seattle
hard-rock band Heart, singer and guitarist Nancy Wilson sang
simple, expressive folk songs at college coffeehouse
``hootenannies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing quite as raw and honest as one person and one
instrument,'' said Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a rare thing these days with our short attention
spans and disposable, theme-park-ride mentality about music.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson returns in spirit to her coffeehouse days with her first
solo album, ``Live at McCabe's Guitar Shop'' (Epic Records). The
13-song album was recorded in Santa Monica in March 1996 while
Wilson was in Los Angeles working on the score for the movie
``Jerry Maguire,'' directed by husband Cameron Crowe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time since my college coffeehouse days (that)
I'd done anything so nakedly human and fun,'' said the friendly,
easygoing singer-songwriter in a phone interview from New York.
</P>
<P>
   With Wilson's sister, Ann, on lead vocals, Heart rose from the
Northwest's thriving rock scene of the '70s to become a glamorous,
globe-trotting pop-metal band with a Led Zeppelin flair. The
group's 1976 debut album, ``Dreamboat Annie,'' sold more than 2
million copies, fueled by the hit singles ``Crazy on You'' and
``Magic Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Two decades later, the Wilsons formed a side band, The
Lovemongers, with Frank Cox and longtime collaborator Sue Ennis.
</P>
<P>
   The acoustic-rock ensemble contributed a version of Led
Zeppelin's ``Battle of Evermore'' to the soundtrack for the movie
``Singles'' (directed by Crowe). The song is featured on an EP that
includes ``Crazy on You,'' Todd Rundgren's ``Love of the Common
Man'' and The Temptations' ``Papa Was a Rolling Stone.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nancy Wilson's longtime dream of recording a solo album
remained on hold until she moved to Los Angeles to work on ``Jerry
Maguire.'' One day she strolled into McCabe's, an atmospheric
guitar shop with a cozy back room for live shows, to look for
instruments to use on the film score.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone at the store recognized me and said, `Hey, you wanna
come in and play our back room sometime?''' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, she returned for two concerts _ with Astrid
Young and Seattle songwriter Kristen Barry as background vocalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just did (the concerts) for the heck of it,'' Wilson said.
``And I thought, well, I might as well put them on (tape) while I'm
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Afterward, I gave copies to several people as gifts. And it
wasn't long before they were saying, `Hey, you should really think
about releasing this.'''
</P>
<P>
   The songs on ``Live at McCabe's'' are serene and instrospective,
yet the power of Wilson's distinctive vocals and guitar playing
give the album a Heart-like feel.
</P>
<P>
   The album includes several songs from the Heart repertoire:
``Angels,'' ``Even It Up'' and ``These Dreams,'' one of Wilson's
signature songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge handful on acoustic guitar,'' Wilson said of
``These Dreams.'' ``It's very challenging.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson also pays tribute to some of her favorite artists,
including Paul Simon (``Kathy's Song''), Joni Mitchell (``A Case of
You'') and Peter Gabriel (``In Your Eyes''). The Gabriel song is an
upbeat acoustic arrangement featuring Wilson's raw, sweet vocals.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's new original songs are as mystical and romantic as a
fairy tale, a reflection of her songwriting excursions to the
Oregon Coast, where the Wilson sisters own neighboring beach
houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ann bought a place there first, in the late '70s or early
'80s,'' Wilson said. ``Then about six years later, I bought the
place across the street. So we've got a sort of compound there.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the new songs on ``Live at McCabe's'' were written at
the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ann and I always try to do our writing there. We've been doing
it for years,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to get out where it's big and rugged and desolate
and you're in the elements. A lot of the new songs are about fires
and stars and ocean and rain. ... Those are my muses.''
</P>
<P>
   But one of the best originals on the album is ``The Rain Song.''
It was the first song Wilson wrote, at age 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (our family) first moved to Seattle, I fell in love with
the rain _ the sound of it, the smell of it, the romance of it,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways it's my best song, the best I've ever written,
because it's so simple. Everyone loves it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're 12, you have no gauge for what's hip or not hip _
or even who you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson dedicated the song ``Sister'' to the women in her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to write a song, not only for Ann, but for the other
women who are my mentors. So each verse focuses on one or two
people.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been a proliferation _ some would say a glut _ of
female singer-songwriters in recent years. This year's Lilith Fair
tour featuring female artists may be the last. But Wilson isn't
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people say that it's over because there have been too
many female singer-songwriters, girls with guitars. It's getting
old, everybody says. But for me, it's not getting old.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson believes that her history as a member of Heart has made
people curious about what she can do on her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a little bit in the background as a singer
and even as an acoustic-guitar player, although I crank it up and
rock with my Marshall stacks, too.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, the sisters Wilson will team up for an acoustic-music
tour. The two will alternate on lead vocals, and both will play
guitar. Nancy also will play mandolin, dulcimer, autoharp and
keyboards, while Ann will play bass and flute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be unusual for us to go out without a wall of
sound (behind us),'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   During the tour, Ann and Nancy will write songs for an upcoming
album. They hope to recruit songwriting legend Burt Bacharach, as
well as songwriter-producer Ben Mink (who has worked with k.d.
lang), to collaborate on the album.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've spoken to both of them and they're really interested,''
Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters also plan to write songs for Heart, whose third core
member is guitarist Howard Leese. But there are no plans to record
a Heart album or launch a tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heart is the ace that we have up our sleeves,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've turned down a lot of big offers to do the reunion-type
thing. ... Our instincts tell us to do something different right
now.''

HUMANA FEST PUTS ITS STAMP ON A FRESH CROP OF PLAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEFFREY ERIC JENKINS  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Every year, scores of theater critics,
producers and aficionados from around the world descend upon this
Ohio River town to find out what's up in American theater.
</P>
<P>
   Why, you might ask, doesn't this same gaggle of theatergoers
visit some other worthy theater town, say, Seattle?
</P>
<P>
   The answer lies in the Humana Festival of New American Plays,
which provides a platform _ several, actually _ for fully staged
productions of otherwise untested dramatic works. While many other
institutions in Seattle and around the country provide homes for
new works, nowhere else gives such concentrated exposure to newly
minted theater. After 23 years, this festival is grandparent to
many that have followed.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, 25 plays of various styles, lengths, formats and
modes of delivery were offered to the nation's professional
theatergoers. How did Actors Theatre of Louisville manage to
squeeze so many plays into a three-day weekend? When the plays in
question range from two minutes to two hours in length, it's easier
than you think.
</P>
<P>
   In a time when reception-oriented media such as dumbed-down
television programming, high-tech video games and Internet surfing
are on the rise, producing director Jon Jory and company are
reconsidering the theatrical form.
</P>
<P>
   Among the five main offerings at the festival, it began to seem
as though we were trapped in a kind of ``short-attention-span
theater.'' The first three shows, ``The Cockfighter,'' ``Cabin
Pressure'' and ``Y2K'' all clocked in at 90 minutes or less. As
these shorter, intermissionless plays have become more prevalent
around the country _ even on Broadway _ we must wonder why.
</P>
<P>
   Is it harder to sustain interest for a generation weaned on
half-hour sitcoms and five-minute video games? Do artists have less
to say these days or are they simply saying it more succinctly?
Whatever answers to these questions finally evolve, the highlights
of this year's festival included one of the shorter plays (``Y2K'')
and one of the longer (``God's Man in Texas'').
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Kopit's ``Y2K'' concerns itself only marginally with the
hyperbole of what will happen to computers (and society) on Jan. 1,
2000. This riveting, paranoiac and plausible tale revolves around a
twisted hacker (Dallas Roberts) who invades the lives of a British
book editor (Graeme Malcolm) and his incredibly gorgeous American
wife (Lucinda Faraldo).
</P>
<P>
   The hacker, who goes by a series of aliases that are word plays
such as Flow Bear and BCuzICan, becomes obsessed with the beautiful
couple _ particularly with her. Kopit and his director, Bob
Balaban, create a haunted, creepy environment (superbly designed by
Paul Owen) that constantly shifts perspective and keeps us
questioning the action. But the veteran playwright never loses
control of his 90-minute work.
</P>
<P>
   When the hacker manages to ensnare Joseph and Joanne in his
warped silicon fantasy, it is done merely with a few innocent
clicks of a computer mouse. And for those of us who have let
integrated computers and the Internet into our daily lives, Kopit's
skillful drama is all too easy to believe.
</P>
<P>
   In ``God's Man in Texas,'' Seattle-based director John Dillon
has created a taut three-man ensemble for David Rambo's accessible
new play. Based on a true tale of political struggle for the
leadership of a ``megachurch'' in Dallas, Rambo's play explores the
depths and conflicts of religious faith with generosity and
balance.
</P>
<P>
   As acted by Humana veterans V Craig Heidenreich, William McNulty
and Bob Burrus, these three characters grab the audience and never
let go. Heidenreich offers a bravura performance as a driven young
preacher and scholar who questions his own ambition, but never his
faith. The middle-age McNulty, who plays an 81-year-old pastor, is
a convincingly charismatic spiritual leader to vast multitudes of
worshipers (even if
</P>
<P>
   he does seem to channel Ronald Reagan at times). Burrus'
performance is edged with humor as the folksy, addled recovering
addict who
</P>
<P>
   gets caught amid the pastors' rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   It would be too bad if one of Seattle's major theater companies
couldn't find a spot for this play in a coming season. It isn't
simply an adept inquiry into religion and faith. Playwright Rambo
also interweaves a poignant tale of lost fathers and found sons,
which has resonance both religious and otherwise. (And Seattleite
Dillon has certainly proven that he's the director for the job.)
Like its characters, ``God's Man in Texas'' is neither sacred nor
profane. It is profoundly human.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cabin Pressure'' is experimental director Anne Bogart and her
SITI Company's exploration of theatrical performance and audience
reception. Bogart and company do physical theater like no one else
_ some would argue she's more choreographer than director. But
``Cabin Pressure'' is a kind of theatrical atom-splitting. The
company focuses on a tiny matter and attempts to burst it open. The
released energy, in this case, dissipates unharnessed because
Bogart is preaching performance to the converted: an audience
filled with theater people. It's unlikely that the uninitiated will
find this topic fascinating, even if its execution is masterly.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Murphy's evocative adaptation of the Frank Manley novel
``The Cockfighter'' stumbles over its coming-of-age story with an
unrelenting feel of white-trash tragedy in the making. As the
narrative shifts from character to character, we are left wondering
whose point of view can be believed and how a young boy can
possibly survive, much less come of age.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Naomi Iizuka made a strong showing at Humana with
her adaptation of Ovid's ``Metamorphoses'' titled ``Polaroid
Stories.'' A vivid rendering of adolescent life on mean streets, it
promised an exciting voice for our theatrical future.
Unfortunately, Iizuka's ``Aloha, Say the Pretty Girls'' fails to
live up to that earlier vision. Iizuka and her always-competent
director, Jory, fail to crack the code of this play's sprawling,
disjointed structure. Iizuka again probes the lives of the young
and confused, but there's nothing much below the surface. Think of
these characters as emotionally damaged ``Friends'' _ without the
charm.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the usual theatrical formats _ actors acting,
audiences reacting _ offered in ATL's three main theater spaces,
performances were overheard in five ``Phone Plays''; read on the
backs of people who wore one of six ``T(ext) Shirt Plays'' (after
shelling out 20 bucks for the shirt); and experienced up close and
personal from the back seat of a Lincoln Continental (the actors
worked in the front seat).
</P>
<P>
   While it is usually possible to find a slender thread that ties
the Humana offerings into a thematic package, this year's work
resists a universal reading. Bombarding us with theatrical images
that dominate a single sense in the phone plays (hearing) or the
T-shirt plays (reading while it moves through space or hangs on a
wall), Jory and his literary manager, Michael Bigelow Dixon, ask us
to rethink the theatrical experience.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though, the weekend visitors to Louisville are
looking for the Next Big Thing in theater. Which play, which
playwright will break out to become a staple of regional theater
seasons? Who will be co-opted by the big bucks Hollywood script
monster? Where is the young talent that will keep theater's flame
burning in the next generation?
</P>
<P>
   This year, eight young playwrights offered a bill of short plays
under the title ``Life Under 30.'' While the writers and the
writing were often concerned with the cultural significance of
``Gilligan's Island'' and the deep life lessons offered by rock
music (at least some things never change), one play was reminiscent
of the early, raw Eugene O'Neill (``The Blue Room'' by Courtney
Baron). In ``Just Be Frank,'' Caroline Williams also showed promise
with an amusing knack for satire as she lacerated mendacious
corporate culture. Indeed, promise abounds among these young
writers even if the current offer-
</P>
<P>
   ings lack depth and dramaturgical polish.
</P>
<P>
   So, what is theater? Does the form require a live audience to
receive a live performance? Or is reception of an overheard phone
call _ including one that asks ``Are they listening? Who are they?
Hello? Hello?'' _ an act of theater? What is performative about
silly little plays _ by such familiar names says Tony Kushner,
Wendy Wasserstein, David Henry Hwang, Mac Wellman and others _
printed on T-shirts?
</P>
<P>
   And what of Richard Dresser's delightfully funny and poignant
``Car Play'' titled ``What Are You Afraid Of?'' In less than 10
minutes, we see the unfolding and failure of a couple's life that
includes us in the action more than once _ if a bra flying into the
back seat and landing on a notepad qualifies as interaction.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these unusual formats potently reminds us of the
voyeurism inherent in being an audience member _ we eavesdrop, we
stare openly, we're a little too close for comfort.
</P>
<P>
   And next year, with any luck, we go back for more.

SIMULATORS TAKE WORLD WAR II DOGFIGHTS TO NEW HEIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When Mitch Varner isn't writing instruction
manuals for Silicon Valley software companies, he's usually trying
to shake a couple of Focke-Wulfs off of his tail, hoping he makes a
friendly runway, as oily smoke pours from his wounded P-38
Lightning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really gets the juices flowing,'' said Varner, 38. ``It
puts you in the mood to attack the rest of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Varner is talking ``European Air War,'' just one of a growing
number of World War II computer flight simulators that have been
gathering more shelf space at software stores and finding their way
onto the computers of an audience that normally shuns computer
gaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a growing category,'' said Christian Svensson,
editor and chief executive of MCV, a Redwood City-based gaming
trade magazine. ``It's pulling in people who wouldn't normally play
`Quake' or `Doom.'''
</P>
<P>
   The draw of these computer games, which immerse a user in a 3-D
world battling Messerschmitts and Mustangs, is their ability to
re-create, at least for a home computer pilot, the heart-pounding
experience that seems be lost in the more popular modern jet
fighter simulations.
</P>
<P>
   Games such as ``Falcon,'' a best-selling, complex F-16 simulator
that contains some of the same technology used in real fighter jet
simulators, are really an exercise in cockpit information control.
In the World War II games, on the other hand, propeller-driven
fighters approximate the twisting and turning agony of a dogfight
over 1940s Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't really fight in `Falcon,''' said James Lynn, a vice
president of computer gaming research at Los Angeles-based Wedbush
Morgan Securities. ``The enemy is a blip on the screen. With these
WWII simulators, the planes are slower, you get closer to your
enemy. You really get the feeling like you're in combat.''
</P>
<P>
   Also contributing to the computer dogfighting trend, said Lynn,
is Hollywood's renewed infatuation with World War II, evidenced by
the release last year of ``Saving Private Ryan'' and ``Thin Red
Line.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you have some kind of craze on the movie screen, you
get a similar interest in related computer gaming titles,'' Lynn
said. ``People want to continue the experience they have in the
theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is a run-down on some of the games:
</P>
<P>
   _ Combat Flight Simulator: This program is based on the
venerable Microsoft Flight Simulator program. But instead of
bringing in Cessnas on an instrument landing, you can drop
Spitfires into the River Thames.
</P>
<P>
   The program excels in its customization abilities, letting you
reduce the difficulty to a simple, arcade-like level. The ground
effects are rich, though they can slow down game play.
</P>
<P>
   _ WWII Fighters: This is one tough simulation game. While you
can dial down the difficulty, the fighting doesn't get good until
you've invested several hours in training.
</P>
<P>
   The planes stall easily, and turning them around in the heat of
battle can actually seem like heavy lifting. The cockpit interiors
are hyper-realistic, and damage graphics _ like bullet holes and
flaming explosions _ are uncomfortably authentic. And ground
targets are chilling: You can actually send deer scattering in the
woods with a low pass.
</P>
<P>
   There also is a ton of auxiliary content in the program,
including a virtual aircraft museum and video interviews with
veteran fighter aces. This is the game to get if you have a lot of
free time.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    `Gump' author makes room for Pancho Villa
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reading Winston Groom's books is like eating a box of assorted
chocolates: You never know what you're going to get. Fans of
``Forrest Gump'' were surprised by his next book, ``Shrouds of
Glory,'' a history of the South's last major Civil War offensive.
There was a Gump sequel, ``Gump &AMP; Co.,'' but then the Alabama
writer followed that with ``Such a Pretty, Pretty Girl'' (Random
House, $23.95), a Raymond Chandler-type mystery about a beautiful
Los Angeles television anchorwoman who's being blackmailed.
</P>
<P>
   And that novel was simply a diversion from his big book in
progress, ``In Fields Where They Lay,'' a sweeping saga about
Pancho Villa and the kidnapping of a wealthy American's two
children in 1916.
</P>
<P>
   Groom says he is happy with ``Such a Pretty, Pretty Girl''
despite several negative reviews, but his heart clearly is in the
Pancho Villa saga.
</P>
<P>
   The novel is based on a true story about the Mexican
revolutionary's kidnapping of a wealthy American's two children.
When President Woodrow Wilson refuses to do anything, the father
takes matters into his own hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mix of characters is wonderful,'' says Groom, 55.
``Ambrose Bierce was down there. B. Traven, the guy who wrote `The
Treasure of the Sierra Madre' was there. Tom Mix, the cowboy actor,
was down there as an aide to Pancho Villa. So if you weave all
these characters in along with the manhunt all through the Sierra
Madres, it's going to be a big tale. It's a lot of fun, but there's
so much reading I have to do. I've got 280 pages (written) and it's
only about half done.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Forrest Gump, Groom doesn't foresee any more installments
unless the movie sequel is as successful as the first. ``They're
writing the screenplay now and they're trying to reassemble
everybody who worked on the original, from the cameraman to the guy
who did the music. If they succeed, who knows what will happen? I
think I'm finished with Gump, but never say never.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Into the woods: Nevada Barr's fictional sleuth Anna Pigeon is
a forest ranger, but her mysteries are no walk in the park. Whether
they are set on Georgia's Cumberland Island (``Endangered
Species'') or in New Mexico's Carlsbad Caverns National Park
(``Blind Descent''), somebody always dies violently.
</P>
<P>
   Her latest work, ``Liberty Falling'' (Putnam, $23.95), is no
exception. Set on Liberty Island, Ellis Island and Manhattan
Island, the mystery pits Anna against a deranged killer determined
to eliminate anyone who is not a ``real'' American. Part of the
backdrop is an abandoned 19th-century hospital that's now covered
with vines. ``It's a perfect place for a crime,'' Barr says.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Nevada who lives in Clinton, Miss., Barr, 47, did
not intend to become a writer. Originally, she aspired to be an
actress and performed in several off-Broadway shows in New York. By
age 36, though, she realized she had reached her limits as an
actress and took a job as a park ranger.
</P>
<P>
   During a tour of duty in the Guadalupe Mountains of Texas, Barr
conceived the idea of Anna Pigeon. Barr worked in each of the parks
in which her novels have been set. ``Track of the Cat'' was in the
Guadalupe Mountains, ``A Superior Death'' took place in Isle Royale
National Park in Michigan, and ``Firestorm'' was in Lassen Volcanic
National Park in California. Her next novel will be set on
Mississippi's Natchez Trace.
</P>
<P>
   Like her protagonist, Barr has fought fires, flown planes and
hiked through wilderness areas. Unlike Anna, she didn't get to
solve any murders when she was a ranger. ``Most of my time was
spent writing tickets and saving visitors from themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr will sign her novel at 6 p.m. Monday at the Science Fiction
&AMP; Mystery Bookshop, 2000-F Cheshire Bridge Road N.E. 404-634-3226.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Big Prize: American writers Don DeLillo (``Underworld''),
Francisco Goldman (``The Ordinary Seaman'') and Cynthia Ozick
(``The Puttermesser Papers'') are among the eight worldwide
nominees for the Impac Dublin Literary Award. The $150,000 award,
given for a work of fiction published in the English language, is
the world's richest literary prize. Other nominees are Ian McEwan
(``Enduring Love''); Andrew Miller (``Ingenious Pain''); Haruki
Murakami (``The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle''); Jim Crace
(``Quarantine''); and Bernard Schlink (``The Reader''). Winners
will be announced May 17 in Dublin.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie, Steve Murray, Bob Longino, Jill
Vejnoska and Tom Sabulis
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Affliction'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nick Nolte and James Coburn.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Nolte gives a searing, career-defining performance in this
soul-weary study of one of the walking dead. Nolte plays a troubled
New England cop whose ``afflictions'' include an angry ex-wife, a
frightened young daughter, a boss who belittles him and a roaringly
abusive father (James Coburn, who received an Oscar for best
supporting actor). (ERG) 1 hour, 44 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Analyze This'' R (profanity, sexuality, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robert De Niro, Billy Crystal and Lisa Kudrow.
</P>
<P>
   This farce about a mobster (Robert De Niro) who takes his issues
to a psychiatrist (Billy Crystal) never becomes the laugh-riot it
could be. It's an offer you could refuse, but the stars (plus Lisa
Kudrow as Crystal's fiancee) make it worthwhile. (SM) 1 hour, 46
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby Geniuses'' PG
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kathleen Turner,
</P>
<P>
   Peter MacNicol, Christopher Lloyd.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Turner and Peter MacNicol play rival researchers _ she
the breathy villainess, he the bland do-bee _ rushing to crack the
talk code emanating from five brilliant babes. Sly _ the toddler
leader _ has got a secret twin and you've got yourself 94 minutes
chock full of stupid pint-sized tricks from the brain of Bob Clark.
At first, ``Geniuses'' is dumb, and then it just gets dumber. (Bob
Longino) 94 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Central Station'' R (profanity and mature themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Fernanda Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   In this tender and unexpectedly moving Brazilian film, a sour
old woman (Fernanda Montenegro) takes a motherless boy she barely
knows into rural Brazil to find the father he's never met.
Montenegro's performance is a beautiful study in bitterness
dissuaded, of possibility and optimism stumbled on after too long
an absence from someone's life. Subtitles. (ERG) 1 hour, 55
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Children of Heaven'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mohammad Amir Naji, Mir Farrokh Hashemian,
</P>
<P>
   Bahare Seddiqi.
</P>
<P>
   You can go see this movie intent on divining all sorts of hidden
messages in its tale of abject poverty, scary authority figures and
other aspects of Iranian life. But then you'd miss seeing a
simpler, much more delightful story about two little kids and their
quest for one pair of shoes. The ending is by turns touching,
heartbreaking and hilarious. (Jill Vejnoska) 1 hour, 27 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Corruptor'' R (violence, profanity, sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Chow Yun-Fat
</P>
<P>
   and Mark Wahlberg.
</P>
<P>
   Chow Yun-Fat and Mark Wahlberg play Chinatown cops forging an
uneasy truce in this violent, densely plotted action flick. Fueled
with betrayals and gunfire, it's the closest thing yet to Chow's
Hong King collaborations with John Woo. (SM) 1 hour, 51 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Cruel Intentions'' R (profanity, sexual situations, drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sarah Michelle Gellar,
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Phillippe and Selma Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Last decade's ``Dangerous Liaisons'' gets a makeover with Sarah
Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe as a couple of desultorily rich
teens manipulating the romantic lives of everyone around them,
purely for their own amusement and without a whit of concern about
who may be hurt in the process. It's practically guaranteed to be a
runaway hit with the teen audience. (Jill Vejnoska) 1 hour, 37
minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Deep End of the Ocean'' PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Treat Williams.
</P>
<P>
   What happens when your son turns up living two blocks away with
a man who has no idea his then-unbalanced, now-deceased wife
kidnapped him years ago? Well, in this movie you become Michelle
Pfeiffer and self-absorb your way to family bliss. They should post
a warning: the deep end of this ocean is filled with melodrama.
(Jill Vejnoska) 1 hour and 45 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Doug's 1st Movie'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of Thomas
</P>
<P>
   McHugh, Fred Newman,
</P>
<P>
   Constance Shulman.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Nickelodeon series on which it's based, this movie's
appeal is centered in the carefully nurtured normalcy of its title
character, Doug Funnie, a nice kid coping with some typical preteen
passions. The gently anarchic, pro-environment plot is simply a
framework to dispense the quiet main-street morals and vivid
comic-book colors that make the wholesome Doug a superstar with
children. (Tom Sabulis) 1 hour, 17 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``EDtv'' PG-13 (profanity, partial nudity, sex-related
situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew McConaughey, Jenna Elfman.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew McConaughey plays the subject of a 24-hour-a-day
documentary in Ron Howard's new comedy. Yeah, it's too much like
``Truman Show'' for its own good, but the slick packaging and
strong cast (including Jenna Elfman, Ellen DeGeneres and Martin
Landau) help it stand on its own. (SM) 2 hours, 3 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight Millimeter'' R (strong perverse sexuality, violence,
profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nicolas Cage
</P>
<P>
   and Joaquin Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   A new example of Morbidity Chic from the screenwriter of
``Seven.'' Nicolas Cage plays a private investigator pursuing the
possible death of a girl in a snuff flick. It's an unpleasant crawl
through the world of porn; you can tell the filmmakers think it's a
troubling exploration of moral ambiguity, but it's an exploitation
flick tricked out as art. (SM) 2 hours, 3 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth'' R (violence and sex)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Cate Blanchett
</P>
<P>
   and Geoffrey Rush.
</P>
<P>
   This opulent period film puts a slight feminist gloss on the
early reign of 16th-century monarch Elizabeth I, showing her
transformation from a radiant, saucy innocent to a polished,
guarded ruler. Cate Blanchett gives a luminous portrayal, and
Geoffrey Rush gives her sturdy support as court politics and
intrigues swirl about. This is a really good story. (ERG) 2 hours,
4 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Enemy of the State'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Will Smith,
</P>
<P>
   Gene Hackman and Jon Voight.
</P>
<P>
   Recycling paranoia plot devices from other movies (``The
Conversation,'' ``Three Days of the Condor''), Tony Scott's lively
thriller keeps Will Smith and Gene Hackman on the run from big
government bad guys. A sharp cast and slick production compensate
for the movie's occasional lapses in logic. (SM) At area discount
theaters. 2 hours, 7 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' (SM) 44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Forces of Nature'' PG-13 (profanity, sexuality, drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sandra Bullock
</P>
<P>
   and Ben Affleck.
</P>
<P>
   Opposites attract as strait-laced Ben Affleck heads to his
wedding with free-spirit Sandra Bullock. Like ``My Best Friend's
Wedding,'' it's a savvy blend of romantic-comedy formula and wise
'90s updates. (SM) 1 hour, 41 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Gods and Monsters'' Not rated, but includes sexual themes and
brief nudity
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ian McKellen
</P>
<P>
   and Brendan Fraser.
</P>
<P>
   A brilliant re-imagining of the final days of gay British
director James Whale. Whale, best known for his classic horror
movies (``Bride of Frankenstein''), died mysteriously in 1957.
Played here by the marvelous Ian McKellen, he's an isolated,
forgotten recluse who becomes interested in the hunky new gardener
(Brendan Fraser). (ERG) 1 hour, 35 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Harmonists'' R (nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ulrich Noethen and Ben Becker.
</P>
<P>
   Director Joseph Vilsmaier can't find a way to make this
rags-and-riches biopic of a Berlin singing group persecuted by
Nazis resonate beyond its own outline. And he makes some groaner
choices, like intercutting the illicit first kiss of secret lovers
with the bloody slugs of a boxing match. ``The Harmonists'' is
smartly acted, but it's by the numbers. Subtitles. (SM) 1 hour, 5
minutes B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The King and I'' G
</P>
<P>
   Voiced by Miranda Richardson and Martin Vidnovic.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first animated feature based on a work by Rodgers
and Hammerstein, but does this second-rate animated King of Siam
really need to high-five the paw of his pet black leopard? This
king has a hot-air balloon to fly around in and to swoop into
action when somebody's about to drown. Kids will probably be
charmed. For everybody else, it's a puzzlement. (Bob Longino) 1
hour and 26 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Last Days'' PG-13 (extreme adult themes, including
genocide)
</P>
<P>
   A documentary on the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Life isn't beautiful in this documentary about five survivors of
Hitler's Holocaust in Hungary. Produced by Steven Spielberg and an
Oscar winner for best documentary, this small-scale history lesson
gains its impact through its narrow focus: 438,000 Jews sent to the
camps in six weeks. The movie says a kind of kaddish for the dead
Jews of Hungary and it does so with respect, honor and undiminished
hope. (ERG)1 hour, 27 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Is Beautiful'' PG-13 (Holocaust-related atrocities)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Roberto Benigni.
</P>
<P>
   Three Oscars, including best actor. An Italian Jew shields his
son from the horrors of a concentration camp by pretending their
predicament is part of a big, complicated game. Roberto Benigni's
low-comedy slapstick approach isn't entirely convincing and is
often chillingly wrongheaded. Subtitles. (ERG) 2 hours, 2 minutes.
B
</P>
<P>
   ``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'' R (violence and
profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nick Moran and Jason Flemyng.
</P>
<P>
   Smokin'. This whip-smart lark is an English caper comedy
glistening with confidence and a wicked sense of humor. Four
likable, conniving East End lads have a week to settle the debt
they owe a hood named Hatchet Harry. Rookie writer/director Guy
Ritchie piles on the characters, plot twists and violence, but one
thing is clear: everyone involved had a fine time making this
movie. You'll have fun watching it. (ERG) 1 hour, 45 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Message in a Bottle'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Costner, Robin
</P>
<P>
   Wright Penn and Paul Newman.
</P>
<P>
   Two messages here: Old-fashioned romances still work, and Kevin
Costner needs an ego check. Badly. For a good while, the movie lets
us luxuriate in the pleasures of sailboats, sunsets, candlelit
dinners, etc. Plus, there's comic relief courtesy of Paul Newman
and Robbie Contrane. But the last 15 minutes are a lunkheaded
embarrassment and Costner (he co-produced) is to blame. (ERG) 2
hours, 12 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mod Squad'' R (profanity, violence, nudity, sexual
situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Claire Danes, Omar Epps, Giovanni Ribisi.
</P>
<P>
   It's the look that matters. Not the plot involving drugs,
murder, good guys turned bad and a car wash. This ``Mod Squad'' _
with Claire Danes, Omar Epps and an occasionally inspired Giovanni
Ribisi _ is a fashion layout for ``Details'' magazine. All image.
All blurry visuals. All reds and blacks. All jazz riffs and retro
TV music with plenty of bongo drums and brass. (Bob Longino) 1 hour
and 34 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``My Favorite Martian'' PG (violence, partial nudity and
profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jeff Daniels and Christopher Lloyd.
</P>
<P>
   A big-screen remake of the '60s TV series, with the annoying and
unsubtle Christopher Lloyd as the Martian who camps in Jeff
Daniels' living room. The movie is cobbled together with cheesy
special effects and easy gags. But for kids, it's an OK
baby-sitter. (SM) 1 hour, 33 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``October Sky'' PG (profanity, sensuality, alcohol use, some
thematic elements)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Chris Cooper and Laura Dern.
</P>
<P>
   Deeply satisfying tale of West Virginia teen Homer (Jake
Gyllenhaal) and three friends who, in the 1950s, began to build and
shoot off model rockets. Their goal: to win a science fair, which
could help them escape a future of working in the coal mine of
their small town. Based on Homer Hickam's autobiography ``Rocket
Boys,'' it makes the process of learning seem as exciting as a
special FX-driven action flick. (SM) 1 hour, 48 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Other Sister'' PG-13 (thematic elements involving
sex-related material)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Juliette Lewis and Diane Keaton.
</P>
<P>
   Juliette Lewis' effective performance as a mentally challenged
woman is the best reason to see this comedy drama, an uneasy
mixture of sentimentality and yucks. Diane Keaton plays her
overprotective mother, and Giovanni Ribisi (also very strong) is
the man she falls for. (SM) 2 hours, 11 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Payback'' R (violence, profanity, drug and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mel Gibson and Gregg Henry.
</P>
<P>
   A by-the-numbers vengeance thriller starring Mel Gibson. It's as
generic as its unnamed, dull gray city. (SM) 1 hour, 42 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rage: Carrie 2'' R (violence, gore, sexuality, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Emily Bergl and Amy Irving.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Bergl plays a misunderstood, telekinetic teen in this
cheap, dull horror flick. The sort-of sequel is so bad, you might
mistake it for self-parody. Amy Irving also stars as the first
film's survivor, but skulks through her scenes looking like she's
ready to kill her agent. (SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``Ravenous'' R (violence and gore)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Guy Pearce and Robert Carlyle.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Carlyle and Guy Pearce star in a 19th-century black
comedy about cannibalism. It's energetically made and gleefully
gross, but it outstays its welcome. (SM) 1 hour, 44 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love'' R (sexuality, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth
</P>
<P>
   Paltrow and Geoffrey Rush.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Oscars, including best picture. Poor, overworked Will
Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) has to finish his play ``Romeo and
Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter'' and try to win the hand of
noblewoman Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow, who received an Oscar for best
actress) in this witty comedy that uses some of the Bard's more
outrageous plot devices. (SM) 2 hours, 2 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``T. rex: Back to the Cretaceous'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liz Stauber and Peter Horton.
</P>
<P>
   The IMAX film has awesome special effects but, as a fictional
story, is too short. Ally Hayden (Liz Stauber) is a budding teenage
paleontologist who wants to go on a dig with her dino-hunting dad
(Peter Horton). When her dad brings what could be a dinosaur egg
into his lab, Ally accidentally cracks it and is thrust back in
time 65 million years, when the big beasts roamed the Earth. (ERG)
40 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``True Crime'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Clint Eastwood
</P>
<P>
   andIsaiah Washington, James Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Producer-director-star Clint Eastwood plays a hard-boiled
newspaper reporter trying to prove a death-row inmate's innocence.
It's so full of
</P>
<P>
   cliches, you'd think it was a self-parody. (SM) 2 hours, 7
minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``20 Dates'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Myles Berkowitz.
</P>
<P>
   This faux documentary about a young filmmaker's dating life in
Los Angeles, though not a total love connection, has its charms.
Myles Berkowitz sets out to make his first feature by combining his
two greatest failures: ``My personal life and my professional
life.'' The movie is never as adorable, clever or original as it
thinks it is, but it touches a few raw nerves about the dating
game. (ERG) 1 hour, 32 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Wing Commander'' PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Starring Freddie Prinze Jr., Mathew Lillard and Saffron Burrows.
</P>
<P>
   It's one loopy space lark, with pretty boy Freddie Prinze Jr.
and ``Scream's'' wonderfully woozy killer Matthew Lillard playing
fighter pilots in a galaxy at war. Earth is threatened by a
lumbering band of catlike creatures wrapped in armadillo armor. It
takes eons for ``Wing,'' based on the popular computer game, to get
to the first big dogfight. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 53 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Wolves'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Not as visually stunning as some IMAX films, this is a highly
instructive look at the once nearly vanquished gray wolf's gradual
reintroduction to Yellowstone National Park and other parts of the
American West. Covers a bit too much ground, historically and
geographically; the best parts show wolves ranging from adult pack
leaders to newborn cubs exploring and adjusting to the wild again.
(Phil Kloer) 41 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``You've Got Mail'' PG
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.

   This Internet update of ``The Shop Around the Corner'' stars Tom
Hanks as a book-chain magnate and Meg Ryan as the small-store owner
he's putting out of business. Little do they know that they're each

Ephron gets the charm working again in a remake that delivers. (SM)

CATHOLIC CHURCH WON'T INDULGE THESE SISTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Through 20 years of street theater and social
activism, the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence have never been the
type to duck controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The group of 30 people representing homosexuals, bisexuals and
heterosexuals who dress up as nuns _ assuming names like Sister
Helen A. Handbasket and Sister Reyna Terror _ has raised the ire of
Catholic Church officials with its plans to hold a 20th anniversary
party in San Francisco on Easter.
</P>
<P>
   The event will feature a bonnet competition, gay performers,
information booths and a ``Hunky Jesus'' contest for the
best-looking Jesus costume.
</P>
<P>
   After the city Board of Supervisors approved a plan to block off
Castro Street for the party, a San Francisco Catholic Archdiocese
spokesman called it tantamount to allowing a group of neo-Nazis to
close a street on Passover.
</P>
<P>
   But members of the group vow to party on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not backing down,'' said Ken Bunch, a founding member
of the group. ``The whole reason we celebrate on Easter is not
because it's a Christian holy day. It's our anniversary.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``sisters'' got their start on Easter of 1979, when they
used a set of nuns' habits acquired from a convent in Iowa _ they
told the real nuns they wanted to stage ``The Sound of Music'' _ to
dress up in drag. Just for fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so electric,'' Bunch said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with appearing in the city's gay pride parades and other
community events, members of the group have organized AIDS
benefits, handed out free condoms, visited AIDS hospices and
spearheaded anti-gay-bashing campaigns.

   KOSOVO-STRIKES _ AVIANO AIR FORCE BASE, Italy or WASHINGTON _

Slobodan Milosevic to accept a peace plan with the Kosovar
Albanians. Developing. (Deans-Holmes, Cox News Service)

   KOSOVO-CLARK _ WASHINGTON _ Supreme NATO Commander Wesley Clark
is a guy who looked down the hatch at his friends burned alive
after their APC tumbled over Mt. Igman outside Sarajevo in August
1995. The reason they were on the mountain at all was that the
Serbs wouldn't grant safe passage to Clark _ then the military
attache on a diplomatic mission headed by U.S. Sepcial Envoy
Richard Holbrooke _ that would have allowed them to travel by
helicopter. In other words, Clark _ who negotiated, if that's the
word for it _ the military occupation annex to the Dayton accords _
has a long and unhappy relationship with Milosevic. He's far
closer, though, to his fellow Arkansan and Oxford scholar, Bill
Clinton. (Deans, Cox News Service)

who grew up to be president. Hell, the job didn't even exist until
John Quincy Adams was 22 years old. A look at the life and failed

   JASON _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Once he played Jason in ``Friday

Gillet III, the actor behind Jason, says he's a victim now _ and
he's pointing a finger at a Fort Lauderdale law firm that he says
cheated him, and his Palm Beach friends, out of millions. (Clough,
Palm Beach Post)
</P>
<P>
   VOUCHERS _ The Florida Legislature was expected to vote next
week on Gov. Jeb's school voucher program. It's a limited program
that would allow vouchers only in districts where schools are
chronically underperforming, and at this point only a couple of
schools around the entire state might qualify. But it would be
precedent-setting in the South. Depending on when they take this
up, we either advance the vote or cover it. (MWilliams, Atlanta

STOP STALLING: AUTHORS SUGGEST WAY TO SAVE YOUR COMPANY FROM
PROCRASTINATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA MCUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Be honest.
</P>
<P>
   Are you reading this column to pick up some kernel of knowledge,
some new piece of information from the vast body of business books
out there that may improve your work?
</P>
<P>
   Or are you just avoiding a project, delaying a meeting or
finding one more excuse to not tackle a growing mound of paperwork?
</P>
<P>
   In other words, are you procrastinating?
</P>
<P>
   If you are, or are frustrated because you think your employees
are, or if you want to procrastinate further, read ``The 2,000
Percent Solution: Free Your Organization from `Stalled' Thinking to
Achieve Exponential Success'' (Amacom, 258 pages, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   The authors, consultants Donald Mitchell and Carol Coles and New
York Times columnist Robert Metz, have a handle on the issue of
complacency. They have come up with eight bad habits, or ``stalls''
as the authors call them, commonly used by employees and eight ways
to bust through those production inhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how successful your organization is, it is
performing way below its easily achievable potential,'' they write.
``If your organization is like most, it is probably functioning
below average in many important activities.''
</P>
<P>
   And not just a little below. Mitchell, Coles and Metz suggest
that your operation can run as much as 20 times more efficiently if
the general haze of indifference is lifted from employees' eyes.
Hence the title of their book.
</P>
<P>
   ``In your own organization, there may be dozens of powerful
ideas or bits of knowledge that could create exponential future
success,'' they write. ``But many of these ideas are not pursued
because people are pressed for time. Imagine what you and your
company could accomplish if only you could stop the clock.''
</P>
<P>
   But the most common forms of procrastination are not always easy
to see, warn Mitchell, Coles and Metz.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trickiest part about overcoming stalls is to recognize
them as such, both in your own personal habits, and in
organizational cultures,'' they write. ``Habits become ingrained so
that you may forfeit your ability to make the best use of your
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Their list of the most common bad habits in the workplace
include: The traditional stall. In this stall, new ideas can't come
forward because it's always been done one way. This is the most
powerful form of complacency, the authors suggest, and they provide
numerous case studies of companies that have overcome the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The disbelief stall. Many employees have trouble accepting new
information, technology or ways of operating, especially if it
makes the old ways obsolete. The authors suggest watching for blind
spots, such as what your competition may be working on, to break
through this stall.
</P>
<P>
   The misconception stall. This stall suggests that some company
beliefs may be based on untrue concepts. When a bright employee
uncovers this, he or she becomes disillusioned and then complacent.
The authors offer a number of questions to help employers identify
whether this is true in their company.
</P>
<P>
   The unattractiveness stall. If an idea deals with a boring,
mundane or even dirty part of the company, it may not be looked at,
the authors suggest. Yet Wal-Mart made a fortune capitalizing on
improvements in a retail distribution system, something other
retailers didn't want to tackle.
</P>
<P>
   The communications stall. Never assume that your message is
perfectly understood, the authors warn. Often ideas are lost or not
implemented correctly because of poor communication.
</P>
<P>
   The bureaucratic stall. Streamline paperwork required and levels
of approval before an idea can be implemented, the authors suggest.
</P>
<P>
   The procrastination stall. Procrastinators believe that problems
will solve themselves or go away. Generally, neither is true, and
any action is better than none, the authors write.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, Coles and Metz provide a clear and concise look at the
many roadblocks that good ideas must overcome in most companies. By
identifying and offering other directions, they show how companies
can avoid these blocks and find smoother roads.

   ``What the IRS Doesn't Want You to Know: A CPA Reveals the
Tricks of the Trade''
</P>
<P>
   By Martin Kaplan and Naomi Weiss
</P>
<P>
   Villard, $14.95
</P>
<P>
   Now in its fifth edition, this book has become a national
bestseller of tax tips. Kaplan claims to go beyond the thick tax
books offered by accounting firms and give a more behind-the-scenes
look at the IRS and how to deal with it.

   ``Job Discrimination II: How to Fight ... How to Win!''
</P>
<P>
   By Jeffrey M. Bernbach
</P>
<P>
   Voir Dire Press, $15
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever wondered whether your last missed promotion or
your recent dismissal from the company were based on some illegal
decision, this book may give you some answers. It may also provide
you with the fortitude to do something about it. Attorney Jeffrey
Bernbach has been on both sides of the legal question of job
discrimination, representing corporations and individuals. The book
clearly states the laws that protect workers, as well as a strategy
for using them.

   ``Work as a Spiritual Practice: A Practical Buddhist Approach to
Inner Growth and Satisfaction on the Job''
</P>
<P>
   By Lewis Richmond
</P>
<P>
   Broadway Books, $38
</P>
<P>
   This book attempts to link your inner, spiritual life with your
job, whether it's running a large company or waiting on tables.
Author Lewis Richmond, a Buddhist teacher and software
entrepreneur, does an excellent job of explaining the principles of
Buddhism and relating them to the workplace. The book is filled
with illustrative stories that make the reading enlightening for
those seeking more than just a paycheck.

STOP STALLING: AUTHORS SUGGEST WAY TO SAVE YOUR COMPANY FROM
PROCRASTINATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA MCUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Be honest.
</P>
<P>
   Are you reading this column to pick up some kernel of knowledge,
some new piece of information from the vast body of business books
out there that may improve your work?
</P>
<P>
   Or are you just avoiding a project, delaying a meeting or
finding one more excuse to not tackle a growing mound of paperwork?
</P>
<P>
   In other words, are you procrastinating?
</P>
<P>
   If you are, or are frustrated because you think your employees
are, or if you want to procrastinate further, read ``The 2,000
Percent Solution: Free Your Organization from `Stalled' Thinking to
Achieve Exponential Success'' (Amacom, 258 pages, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   The authors, consultants Donald Mitchell and Carol Coles and New
York Times columnist Robert Metz, have a handle on the issue of
complacency. They have come up with eight bad habits, or ``stalls''
as the authors call them, commonly used by employees and eight ways
to bust through those production inhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how successful your organization is, it is
performing way below its easily achievable potential,'' they write.
``If your organization is like most, it is probably functioning
below average in many important activities.''
</P>
<P>
   And not just a little below. Mitchell, Coles and Metz suggest
that your operation can run as much as 20 times more efficiently if
the general haze of indifference is lifted from employees' eyes.
Hence the title of their book.
</P>
<P>
   ``In your own organization, there may be dozens of powerful
ideas or bits of knowledge that could create exponential future
success,'' they write. ``But many of these ideas are not pursued
because people are pressed for time. Imagine what you and your
company could accomplish if only you could stop the clock.''
</P>
<P>
   But the most common forms of procrastination are not always easy
to see, warn Mitchell, Coles and Metz.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trickiest part about overcoming stalls is to recognize
them as such, both in your own personal habits, and in
organizational cultures,'' they write. ``Habits become ingrained so
that you may forfeit your ability to make the best use of your
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Their list of the most common bad habits in the workplace
include: The traditional stall. In this stall, new ideas can't come
forward because it's always been done one way. This is the most
powerful form of complacency, the authors suggest, and they provide
numerous case studies of companies that have overcome the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The disbelief stall. Many employees have trouble accepting new
information, technology or ways of operating, especially if it
makes the old ways obsolete. The authors suggest watching for blind
spots, such as what your competition may be working on, to break
through this stall.
</P>
<P>
   The misconception stall. This stall suggests that some company
beliefs may be based on untrue concepts. When a bright employee
uncovers this, he or she becomes disillusioned and then complacent.
The authors offer a number of questions to help employers identify
whether this is true in their company.
</P>
<P>
   The unattractiveness stall. If an idea deals with a boring,
mundane or even dirty part of the company, it may not be looked at,
the authors suggest. Yet Wal-Mart made a fortune capitalizing on
improvements in a retail distribution system, something other
retailers didn't want to tackle.
</P>
<P>
   The communications stall. Never assume that your message is
perfectly understood, the authors warn. Often ideas are lost or not
implemented correctly because of poor communication.
</P>
<P>
   The bureaucratic stall. Streamline paperwork required and levels
of approval before an idea can be implemented, the authors suggest.
</P>
<P>
   The procrastination stall. Procrastinators believe that problems
will solve themselves or go away. Generally, neither is true, and
any action is better than none, the authors write.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, Coles and Metz provide a clear and concise look at the
many roadblocks that good ideas must overcome in most companies. By
identifying and offering other directions, they show how companies
can avoid these blocks and find smoother roads.

RON HOWARD, CAST HAVE EXPERIENCED `EDtv' FOR REAL 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Twenty-odd years ago, while on hiatus from
``Happy Days,'' Ron Howard was bumping around Texas, scouting
locations for a television movie he planned to direct. Hungry, he
and some friends stopped in at an old-fashioned cafeteria where
they feasted on fried chicken, vegetables and pie. Howard, who has
been famous almost since the day of his birth, signed several
autographs and posed for a few pictures, routine stuff for the
popular star.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then something a little different happened,'' Howard says. ``I
was getting up with my tray to leave, and these people came running
after me and said, `Can we ask one more favor?' And I said, `Sure,'
thinking they wanted another picture. Instead, they asked, `Can we
have your chicken bones?' And, well, what could I say, but,
`Absolutely, you can have my chicken bones.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I wonder,'' Howard muses, ``if those chicken bones still
exist somewhere ... Something tells me no.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that he's not sure, much less still pondering the
question, makes Howard an ideal person to tackle the nature of
celebrity and all of its strange side effects. Howard's new movie,
``EDtv,'' does just that, working as sort of ``The Truman Show'' in
reverse. A white-trash slacker named Ed (Matthew McConaughey)
volunteers to have every aspect of his life documented for a
round-the-clock television show and becomes a media sensation in
the process.
</P>
<P>
   The spotlight soon shines on Ed's family and girlfriend, Shari
(Jenna Elfman), who suffer harsh scrutiny, fickle fans and public
opinion polls that border on the inhumane. (Should Ed dump Shari?
Vote now!'')
</P>
<P>
   The film humorously comments on our insatiable fascination with
the private, mixing in elements of MTV's ``The Real World,'' Albert
Brooks' ``Real Life'' and the famous 1970s PBS documentary on the
Loud family.
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons to ``The Truman Show'' are inevitable as well, but
``EDtv'' actually is more reminiscent of Howard's own
``Parenthood'' in the affectionate way it looks at family foibles.
Both movies were written by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, who
also collaborated with Howard on ``Splash'' and ``Night Shift.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The tone of `The Truman Show' is completely different, which,
I must say, was a complete relief,'' says Howard, who saw the Jim
Carrey movie with his wife last year as he was putting the
finishing touches on ``EDtv.'' ``Certainly, this film is about fame
and the double-edged sword of celebrity. That's a given. But I love
playing with the myth of the functional family, too, because I
don't think it exists. We're all nuts, and I love showing that in
movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Offers writer Mandel: ``Enough about `The Truman Show.' It
wasn't an audience-friendly movie like this is. It left me cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard and his longtime producing partner Brian Grazer
intentionally cast the film using actors with intense experiences
in the spotlight's white glare, giving the film yet another level
of subtext in its look at fame. It's impossible to watch Ellen
DeGeneres (playing a TV executive) giving the finger to her network
executive bosses without thinking of her highly publicized battles
with the ABC brass over her sitcom, ``Ellen.'' (``I think she
enjoyed that scene,'' Howard says smiling.)
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, McConaughey's sudden rise to fame in 1995 (Vanity Fair
put him on the cover before his first big movie, ``A Time to
Kill,'' opened in theaters) neatly parallels Ed's instant
notoriety. ``Matthew's story is really Ed's story,'' says co-star
Sally Kirkland, who plays Ed's befuddled mother. Adds co-star
Martin Landau (Ed's stepfather): ``I think it's very courageous for
him to do this film because the material hits so close to home.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, McConaughey brushes off such talk of courage but
doesn't deny the fact that instant celebrity made his life
infinitely more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the Friday the movie (`A Time to Kill') came out in
theaters, and I was walking down the Third Street Promenade in
Santa Monica with a thousand other people, all of whom were
completely oblivious to me,'' McConaughey says. ``Monday afternoon,
I'm walking down the same street, and 999 out of 1,000 are staring
at me. I was a little more self-conscious off the bat, but mostly I
was thinking, `OK. This is pretty cool.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I still think that,'' McConaughey continues, ``although it
can get a little much sometimes, where you let the fame control you
instead of you controlling it. Mostly, you just learn to choose
your battles and have fun with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other cast members bring their own peculiar baggage to their
roles. Elizabeth Hurley has endured the snipes of British tabloids
for years and famously went through the wringer when police caught
her boyfriend Hugh Grant with a prostitute. Woody Harrelson has
taken flak for his political activism; DeGeneres for her outspoken
homosexuality. And on a slightly less profound note, Elfman took
some heat for her spiky hairstyle at the recent Golden Globes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing how many people were angry _ I loved it!''
Elfman says. ``But then I think, `If people were more literate and
were reading books, they would have more to think about than what I
am doing with my hair.'''
</P>
<P>
   Producer Grazer agrees, but he doesn't think we'll be seeing a
run on library cards any time soon. And in a way, he wouldn't want
that. It would probably mean less business for his movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrity has had the mystery taken out of it during the past
decade,'' Grazer says. ``There's so much media accessibility now
that the public thinks they know you. I've seen drunk guys come up
to Ron and ask him to come over to their tables and kiss their
wives. I've been with Tom Hanks, standing in line for takeout, and
heard women say, `Can I go out with you?' Completely serious. And
Tom says, `Um ... don't you know? I've got a wife and kids.'''
</P>
<P>
   Howard believes such episodes are inevitable and, like bad
reviews, part of the deal you make when you go into show business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, you don't imagine that going in,'' he says. ``It's
like when I was making `Apollo 13' and talking to the men who had
walked on the moon. They tried like hell to explain it to me, but
they couldn't. It's the same thing with fame. It's impossible to
communicate exactly what it's like.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's saying something because Howard, who still gets
called Opie and Richie _ and Opie Cunningham (``Eddie Murphy coined
that one,'' he says) _ has spent his whole life thinking about the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still feel a little strange when somebody asks for an
autograph,'' he says. ``And every once in a while, somebody will
kind of sum up my career in a sentence or two, like, `Hey, Opie,
have you seen the Fonz? You did a good job directing `Apollo 13.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But I take it as a compliment,'' he continues good-naturedly.
``At least they've been paying attention.'' &QL;

BIGGER-THAN-LIFE `RUGRATS' STAND BY THEIR FRIENDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(``Tonight'' refers to Friday, March 26)  
By NANCY HEWITT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ First they had their own TV show. Then they became
movie stars. Now those adorable darlings, the Rugrats, have taken
over the musical stage.
</P>
<P>
   The fame of those irrepressible babies who share their pint-size
view of the world on an animated weekday TV series continues to
grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rugrats: A Live Adventure'' comes to the Universal
Amphitheatre for six days beginning tonight. A special performance
to benefit the Children Affected by AIDS Foundation was held
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of the 1}-hour production is simple: Friends stand by
friends. When Chuckie Finster gets really scared by a thunder
storm, Tommy Pickles decides to ``imbent something for my bestest
friend that'll make things not so scary!''
</P>
<P>
   The end result is a People-ator _ a machine that brings
inanimate objects to life. Tommy tests the People-ator on some
tools, they come alive _ and the adventures begin.
</P>
<P>
   But putting together a stage show didn't happen overnight.
</P>
<P>
   For almost five years, Jonathan Hochwald, executive producer and
president of PACE Entertainment Inc., has worked with Nickelodeon
using his expertise as a Broadway and rock 'n' roll tour producer
to develop a show that would translate to the stage. ``Nickelodeon
has a hipness with what kids want,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But choosing a kids' show that could work on stage was tough.
After considering some possibilities, they took a leap of faith and
decided on ``Rugrats.'' ``It's the best possible show for kids.
It's very theatrical,'' Hochwald says. ``It's been on the air since
1991 and continues to grow. But the biggest challenge was to take a
two-dimensional show on the small screen and make it
three-dimensional on stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Since most kids have never seen a live show, he continues, ``the
goal was to create a new kind of live theatrical experience'' for
them. One that ``would speak to kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching 6-foot-2-inch babies on stage is believable and makes
sense to the younger audiences. ``(The Rugrats are)
larger-than-life characters and the audience accepts them,''
Hochwald says.
</P>
<P>
   The stage production also relies on the talents of Mark
Mothersbaugh, formerly of the '70s pop group Devo, and composer of
the music used on the Rugrats series.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hochwald, ``Mike has brought a Rugrats sound _ from
reggae to opera to disco. It crosses all genres. But the music
sounds true to Rugrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Mothersbaugh says he enjoys composing for children's TV. ``It's
less restrictive for me. (It's) not precensored by MTV,'' he says,
``and (I can) go into new territory with kids music because I'm not
looking for a hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Mothersbaugh has been composing for children's television for
about 10 years. He began his career creating music for ``Pee-Wee's
Playhouse.'' In preparing for the stage version of ``Rugrats,'' he
juggled both pacing and technical demands to keep the action
moving.
</P>
<P>
   ``When reading the script, I picked the logical places to place
the music to drive the story,'' he says. He also had to consider
how the music would affect the choreography and sets.
</P>
<P>
   But he is pleased with the selection of songs. In fact, he even
attended a show to gauge crowd reaction. ``Kids were singing songs
coming out of the matinee,'' he says proudly. ``It was a good
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideas for his songs come from odd sources, he reveals.
``Nightmares, bad food, stress _ everyday experiences,'' give him
inspiration. And he really enjoys the kid-show experience. ``What I
like is the kid is treated like a person instead of just like a
kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Mothersbaugh says youngsters will really like the songs. Judging
by the reactions he heard at the performance he attended, he
believes kids like the songs that go with the character they
identify with. ``If I Were Princess of the World' '' is Angelica's
song. And ``If I Could Count to Two'' shares the special friendship
of Tommy and Chuckie, he says.
</P>
<P>
   It took approximately four months to put the musical part of the
show together. But it was well worth it, he says. ``It's great to
watch a show with young kids. It's their first time seeing a live
show.'' &QL;

GROUP SAYS HIGHWAY HERBICIDES POSE HEALTH RISK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYCHE HENDRICKS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Herbicide sprayed along roadsides may be
threatening public health and the environment, according to an
environmental group that tracks chemical use in California.
</P>
<P>
   The California Department of Transportation, or Caltrans, and
county agencies last year sprayed roadsides with more than 132,000
gallons of liquid and 93,000 pounds of solid chemical weed killers,
some of which may cause cancer and birth defects, according to a
report by Californians for Alternatives to Toxics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't drive our cars into an agricultural field while it
was being sprayed,'' said Patricia Clary, the organization's
executive director, ``but Caltrans and the county road agencies
spray along these incredibly heavily used public facilities: our
roads. They don't warn us and we have to drive right through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Caltrans contends that the chemicals are necessary to keep down
brush that can become a fire hazard and weeds that crack pavement
and obscure visibility for drivers. In addition, said Caltrans
spokesman Greg Bayol, the state transportation agency has strict
safety standards for how the herbicides are applied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be more concerned about my next door neighbor than I
would be about Caltrans,'' he said. ``We use herbicides in the
safest possible manner. You can go into a hardware store and buy
stuff that's much more potent than what we use.''
</P>
<P>
   The study by Californians for Alternatives to Toxics found that
Los Angeles, Orange and Contra Costa counties had the highest
concentrations of herbicides used.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Clark, director of the West County Toxics Coalition in
Richmond, said Contra Costa residents were so concerned about toxic
releases from the county's numerous oil refineries that the issue
of herbicides was overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report is of concern to me in terms of the exposure people
would have living near the freeways that are sprayed,'' he said.
``I'm especially worried about children, who are much more
vulnerable to chemicals than adults.''
</P>
<P>
   Clary, who has also studied chemical use in California's
agriculture and timber industries, said the use of herbicides by
Caltrans is small in contrast, but still potentially dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Five of Caltrans' eight most frequently-used weed killers have
been listed as possible cancer agents by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, Clary said.
</P>
<P>
   Clary said she was very concerned about spraying around school
bus stops and in sensitive watersheds, especially near drinking
water reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
   Bayol countered that the poisons Caltrans uses breakdown into
harmless, inert ingredients, and thus pose no health hazard.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've developed pesticides that are pretty tame, really, and
still can do what we need them to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, Caltrans has committed to reducing its herbicide
use, in response to pressure from Californians for Alternatives to
Toxics and other environmental groups.

HALT ORDERED TO STUDIES AT LOS ANGELES VA CENTER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the most sweeping federal action ever taken against
violations of research rules, the US government is suspending all
studies at the nation's largest Veterans Affairs medical center, in
Los Angeles, where researchers have done experiments that worsened
the mentally ill, among other controversial studies.
</P>
<P>
   The joint action by the Department of Veterans Affairs and a
division of the National Institutes of Health means that more than
500 psychiatric and medical studies will be suspended, effective
Friday, until further notice.
</P>
<P>
   While the suspension order referred only to procedural
violations and not to the ethics of specific tests, the West Los
Angeles VA is among the facilities highlighted in a Globe series on
psychiatric research abuses in November, specifically for being
part of a 1987 study that gave amphetamines to the mentally ill to
induce psychosis in order to study the disease's biology.
</P>
<P>
   The facility has also been one of the key sites for
pharmaceutical industry-funded tests of potential new
antipsychotics in which some mentally ill patients were given a
dummy sugar pill, or a placebo, instead of medications known to
work. As a result of such placebo testing, up to 70 percent of
mentally ill patients enrolled in these studies in the United
States and Canada experienced such a worsening of their symptoms
that they dropped out of the research, according to a Globe review
of the scientific literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``So disabled veterans wind up as laboratory guinea pigs for
academic researchers, and the federal government has been
supporting, approving and funding and _ until now _ looking the
other way at the harmful consequences,'' said Vera Hassner Sharav,
co-founder of the New York-based Citizens for Responsible Care in
Psychiatry and Research.
</P>
<P>
   She credited the Globe series with helping to prompt these
developments, ``because it brought out the fact that the problem is
not a few, isolated, unrelated instances.'' Sharav Wednesday called
for an independent investigation of psychiatric research, at VA
hospitals and elsewhere, by the US Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Wannemacher, a disabled veteran and associate national
legislative director for Disabled American Veterans, said that
while he believes most VA research is properly conducted, the news
about the West Los Angeles VA raises concerns with him and his 1.1
million-member organization, ``that veterans could be put in
additional harm's way.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Wannemacher said he supports VA headquarters's actions
to suspend research there, ``we're saddened that this would have
been allowed to occur.''
</P>
<P>
   The suspension means that hundreds of researchers, many of them
affiliated with the University of California at Los Angeles, ``will
be unable to do their research until these issues are resolved,''
said Dr. Dean Norman, acting chief of staff at the West Los Angeles
VA, which is now known officially as the VA Greater Los Angeles
Healthcare System.
</P>
<P>
   In rare instances, however, where patients might be harmed if
research they are already enrolled in were abruptly halted, studies
would be allowed to continue with pre-approval.
</P>
<P>
   Norman stressed that the federal agencies have not documented
any harm to research subjects, only procedural problems. He added
that care for patients who are not in research will continue as
usual at the 1,056-bed center.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost, I'd like to make the point that we're
confident that no patients or research animals have been harmed by
these administrative deficiencies. Second, we provide excellent
care to our patients,'' Norman said.
</P>
<P>
   In letters this week to the West Los Angeles VA and affiliated
research organizations, the NIH's Office for Protection from
Research Risks and VA headquarters did not identify any harm or
cite specific experiments, according to documents obtained by the
Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the focus was on repeated violations of US regulations
designed to protect research participants, which came after several
years of warnings that the agencies had given the West Los Angeles
VA.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in its March 22 letter, OPRR found that the West
Los Angeles VA failed to include on its board for reviewing
psychiatric research a representative of people with mental
illness, as OPRR had required as far back as 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In an inspection of minutes from nine institutional review board
meetings held over a three-month period by the West Los Angeles VA
last year, OPRR found seven instances of meetings held without a
quorum, or without a non-scientist representative, such as an
ethicist, as required by federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of these and other similar findings, OPRR suspended
the ability of the West Los Angeles VA and two affiliated research
organizations to conduct federally funded research on human
subjects, until all research projects have been reviewed by the
agency. OPRR has no authority over state or privately funded
research, a weakness in the regulatory system that has been
criticized before.
</P>
<P>
   But adding to the scope of the action against the West Los
Angeles VA is the VA headquarters's two-page memorandum, also dated
March 22, suspending all research activities no matter what the
funding source. The memo is signed by Dr. Kenneth W. Kizer,
undersecretary for health for the Department of Veterans Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John R. Feussner, chief research and development officer for
the Department of Veterans Affairs, said Wednesday that VA
headquarters independently found some of the same concerns as
uncovered by OPRR, beginning as far back as 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found no evidence at all that any human research
participants have been harmed, or that animals have been harmed,''
said Feussner, adding that this is the first time the VA has ever
had take such action at one of its facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``But given the process violations, we're concerned, and we're
not willing to wait,'' he said. ``We have to take action to prevent
harm.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no specific issue precipitating this action, Feussner
said. ``This is one of those situations where you don't have one
huge problem,'' but many small ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suspension will last until these problems are fixed to our
satisfaction. We hope to do that within the next 30 to 90 days,''
Feussner said. But because of the West Los Angeles VA's track
record, headquarters will probably not remove probationary status
for as long as a year, even if the suspension is lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Aller _ whose son Gregory was enrolled in schizophrenia
research at UCLA, and who filed complaints with OPRR several years
ago about the research practices at the West Los Angeles VA and
elsewhere _ Wednesday said of the actions against the VA facility:
``They just apparently never cleaned it up.''

STUDENTS DEBATE OPENING JOURNAL TO ALL
</HEADLINE>
 BC - YALE-JOURNAL-BOS  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For 109 years, the Yale Law Journal has chosen the top students
to edit its pages, giving them the chance not only to set the
national legal debate but also to score the plummiest clerkships
and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But now, amid complaints that membership has become too elitist,
students have launched a vigorous campaign to open up admission to
anyone who wants to join.
</P>
<P>
   It has set off a debate between excellence and inclusion at the
nation's top-ranked law school.
</P>
<P>
   Those fighting to change the process say membership at the
journal, published monthly during the school year, has become too
much a determinant of self-esteem and success; students who don't
make it on the staff believe they are automatically shut out of the
best jobs, and stigmatized among their classmates.
</P>
<P>
   The journal editors, though, defend the process as a matter of
standards. Students who edit the journal are choosing articles
written by prominent professors and scholars that can have national
influence; it only makes sense that those students would be chosen
with rigor. Competition is part of life, they say, and certainly
part of law school.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has been carried out on postings and petitions on
``The Wall,'' a free-speech bulletin board in the narrow main
corridor of the law school in New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 first-year students have signed a petition vowing to
boycott the competition for journal membership if the publication
does not agree to open up admissions. And at a meeting last week,
the editors of the review faced blistering criticism from law
students who accused them of being snobbish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a complete booster rocket for your legal career; that's
what makes it objectionable,'' said Wesley Kelman, a staff member
in his second year who unsuccessfully ran for president of the
journal last year on a platform of open admissions. ``People who
don't make it feel awful. It stigmatizes you with employers. If
employers want to look at grades, fine, but this shouldn't be an
exclusive thing at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Law review membership is highly coveted at any law school, but
even more so at the oldest and most prestigious schools. The Yale
Law Journal literally helped write the book on law reviews; the
so-called blue book, a thick guide that sets standards for
citations in legal publications, is published by the law reviews at
Yale, Harvard, Columbia, and the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   At Harvard, the oldest law review in the nation, admission is
based on grades. At Yale, the law school itself abandoned a grading
system years ago, trying to ease competition among students. So
journal membership is now based on a three-part test that students
take over a period of several weeks during the summer before their
second year. One part measures blue-book knowledge. The two other
parts ask students to read and edit three articles submitted by
professors and to choose one for publication, explaining their
reasons in a memo.
</P>
<P>
   Each test is graded by three law journal staff members. Journal
editors say that in each class of 180 law students, about 100 apply
for the journal and about half are accepted.
</P>
<P>
   But critics _ those who are on journal staffs as well as those
who were rejected _ argue it is not fair to have students
administering and grading a test that can ultimately turn into a
resume credential.
</P>
<P>
   Stories about journal membership's heavy influence on future job
offers abound. One student tells how a past journal editor was
named a clerk for the US Supreme Court the day she was named
editor; another tells how some judges categorically weed out any
resumes that don't include journal membership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone at Yale is capable of doing the type of work the
journal requires,'' said Rohit Khanna, the first-year student who
started the petition. ``Having a test is creating an arbitrary
elite that is unnecessary. If you want to make the journal
prestigious, don't do it on a method that has subjective judgments.
My own preference is, don't have the prestige of the Yale Law
Journal. That way, it would no longer distinguish students in a job
interview, and it shouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   But journal editors say it would be unwieldy to simply admit
anyone. Aside from guaranteeing quality, a test also guarantees a
degree of commitment. Students who are willing to spend so much
time on the test, the editors argue, demonstrate a willingness to
work long hours to see the journal to press.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over admissions has raged before, and at other law
schools. At Penn, one top editor quit three years ago, saying that
attempts to diversify the staff by easing requirements on the
admissions test had led to poor quality. That same year at Yale,
editors allowed students to retake the test as often as it took to
pass, and let in anyone who did.
</P>
<P>
   The result, said this year's editor-in-chief, Laura Ahn, was
that the journal had too many voices, and too many mistakes, and
ultimately spent thousands of dollars to correct last-minute errors
in the publication. Yale abandoned that system.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could argue that the process produces resentment, but I
don't think that divisiveness is a necessary result,'' Ahn said.
``That has more to do with how people interact.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahn and others on the journal say the critics overstate the
connection between journal membership and getting a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous coming from Yale Law students,'' said Michelle
Mello, a second-year journal member. ``This is the number-one law
school in the country; I don't know anyone who wasn't completely
satisfied with the job search this year. It's hard for me to
believe someone would be denied for not being on the journal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is competition,'' she added. ``Of course there's
competition, and there's always competition. My point is,
everyone's going to do well. There's no reason to get nasty,
there's no reason why we can't have a process where not everyone
makes it and still get along, and still get good jobs.''

SLEEP TAKES A BACKSEAT FOR HONKY-TONK SINGER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Story for release Friday, March 26) 
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
LOS ANGELES _ Rosie Flores needs caffeine. And she needs it now.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It goes from zero to 100 every morning for me,'' says the
honky tonk singer-songwriter, speaking by phone from Austin, Texas.
``I'm awake with a cup of coffee and ready to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the glamorous road life. The previous night, Flores
explains, she was rehearsing with her band until, oh, around 2 in
the morning. The night before, it was 1 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   This evening she'll be back in Los Angeles sharing a triple bill
with Katie Moffatt and Lily Hayden at the Moondog Cafe on Melrose
Avenue. Then Saturday it's on to the annual Cowboy Poetry &AMP; Music
Festival in Santa Clarita, where Flores will headline a late-night
honky tonk hootenanny.
</P>
<P>
   At each stop, she'll do her best to boost her latest release,
``Dance Hall Dreams'' (Rounder Records). Then Flores will begin the
cycle all over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started managing myself back around the middle of last
year,'' she says, ``and all of a sudden I started taking on the
huge overload of trying to get phone calls and all the e-mails that
come through and the offers. And then somewhere in there you try to
write songs and work on your guitar.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, reckoning by the percolating warmth and candor in her
voice, you wonder what Flores sounds like when she's really awake.
</P>
<P>
   Those trademark qualities permeate ``Dance Hall Dreams,'' a disc
that derives its kick from its live recording setting _ at the
Cibolo Creek Country Club, a San Antonio dance hall _ and its
quietly reflective tone from some recent losses in Flores' life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's Gonna Fix It Now?'' is a tribute to her late father,
Oscar, and his habit of pasting little notes above his tool bench,
reminding himself to ``fix bathroom sink'' or ``fix shower door.''
Now that he's gone, Flores asked herself, who'll take care of those
things? Flores says she finished the song, which she co-wrote with
Don Henry, in a candlelit room in Amsterdam, tears streaming
cathartically down her face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in losing my father, it changed my life probably more
provocatively than anything else has in 20 years,'' she says. ``So
I had to kind of look at life and put different priorities in
place. I've gotten closer to my family because there was a need _
there was a loss, more of a need for me to be around.''
</P>
<P>
   Flores also is coping with the loss of her longtime drummer Don
Lindley, who died of lung cancer in February at age 47.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there's some talented drummers out there, and I'll find
one, but it won't be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   The quiveringly beautiful ``Tremolo,'' the bluesy ``The Man
Downstairs'' and the self-explanatory ``This Ol' Honky Tonk'' are
the other standout tracks on an upbeat record gently tinged with
melancholy. Flores' musical guests include Radney Foster doing
harmony vocals and Tammy Rogers playing viola and mandolin and
singing backup.
</P>
<P>
   Born in San Antonio in 1950, Flores was 12 when she moved with
her family to San Diego. There, she formed Penelope's Children, a
``psychedelic country-rock'' band and the first of several
all-female outfits that included the '70s rockabilly group Rosie
and the Screamers and, in 1984, the cow-punk ensemble Screaming
Sirens. Lately she's been touring with country-rock godmother Wanda
Jackson, a woman who, like Flores, has never fit neatly into
conventional radio or music marketing genres.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that Nashville kind of needs to reinvent itself, and
I believe it may be looking toward kind of different songwriters,''
Flores says. ``I think even the top executives in Nashville know
radio's in trouble because not everybody's buying that stuff. Not
to say there isn't some good stuff, when you wade between the muck.
I for one have never not enjoyed a good Vince Gill record. I
appreciate Trisha Yearwood's voice _ I think she knows what a good
song is. So there are the gems.''
</P>
<P>
   Underlining those remarks, Flores is contemplating relocating to
Nashville after nearly a decade in L.A., now that such
progressive-country songwriters as Duane Jarvis, Jim Lauderdale and
Lucinda Williams have colonized middle-of-the-road Music Row.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I'm very famous for trying to reinvent myself
constantly, and I think I'm a bit of a chameleon. I take what I've
learned, and I reshape my little life and try to start over again.
I think in life you do have to start over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'm only lucky and capable of doing that because I'm a
single woman. But the only thing that keeps me going is change,
because I can get moldy if I stay in one place.'' &QL;

HOW TO GAMBLE AT A RACETRACK WITH NO HORSES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLAINVILLE, Mass. _ There's a new horse track in town, and what
a booming business it is. It opened just eight days ago, but
already the parking lot is full, and hundreds of gamblers are
scrambling for a piece of the action.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they bet well over $100,000 every day last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Plainridge Racecourse has no track. It doesn't have a
grandstand. In fact, it doesn't have a single horse.
</P>
<P>
   But just because there isn't a live trotter in sight doesn't
mean it isn't post time. Because what the state's newest track does
have are 300 tiny TV sets that carry races via satellite feed from
racing at Saratoga, Hialeah, California _ even Australia. And
customers plunk down bets just as if the horses were running right
outside the newly installed windows.
</P>
<P>
   (The windows aren't the only new feature: Plainridge almost had
no running water. Just hours before the track opened on March 17,
Plainville forced the track's owners to fork over $40,000 to hook
up to the town's water supply.)
</P>
<P>
   Plainridge marks the latest chapter in the ludicrous story of
gambling in Massachusetts, in which billions of dollars a year are
legally wagered in a state that publicly frowns on betting.
Gambling is supposedly banned in Massachusetts, with some
exceptions being the state Lottery at your neighborhood convenience
store, and four legally sanctioned racetracks. Now we've graduated
to legal gambling at a racetrack with no horses.
</P>
<P>
   It's completely legal, but no less ridiculous. Anyone taking a
look around the $14 million facility can see that these owners are
not in the business of horse racing. In addition to the off-track
betting _ racespeak for gambling on races at other tracks _
Plainridge has a room set aside for 400 slot machines, ready to
spring into action the day the Legislature approves slots at
racetracks.
</P>
<P>
   Even by the standards of modern-horse racing, in which tracks
typically make more money on races at tracks other than their own,
Plainridge is unique. Real, live racing is tentatively scheduled to
begin on Patriots Day, but even then, the track's president says, a
whopping 94 percent of its revenue will still come from
simulcasting. The horses will be little more than equine props for
a $100 million-a-year gambling operation. At Suffolk Downs, by
comparison, simulcasting accounts for about 55 percent of the daily
handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I told you I wouldn't make more money without horses, I'd
be lying to you,'' Plainridge president Gary Piontkowski said
Monday. ``Anyone in this business would be.''
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, the track has been plagued with financial
issues and ethical concerns. Several investment teams pulled out
amid concerns from the racing commissioner, aired in the press,
that the track was being built on a shoestring, and that one
prominent prospective investor, Louis Guiliano, who owns the land
the track sits on, had refused to provide critical financial
information to the state. Opening dates came and went.
</P>
<P>
   The state racing commission _ which Piontkowski headed from 1991
to 1993 _ approved his group's application for a license (minus
Guiliano as an investor) by a 2-to-1 vote. Robert Hutchinson,
Piontkowski's successor as state racing commissioner, voted against
it; Christ Decas and Arthur Khoury, who had served on the
commission with Piontkowski, voted in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson, the odd man out on the commission he heads, makes no
secret of the fact that he considers Plainridge a scam. While the
state requires tracks to run 150 racing dates a year, most of
Plainridge's races will run Monday and Tuesday  &UR; afternoon &LR; s, in
front of minuscule crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that they are effectively off-track betting
facilities or like a race bookroom in a casino,'' Hutchinson said.
``One of the concerns we have is that the live racing schedule is
scheduled to be on Saturday, with doubleheaders on Monday and
Tuesday. Who's going to be there Monday and Tuesday?''
</P>
<P>
   For years now, debate has intermittently raged in this state
over how much gambing is acceptable. The huge expansion of the
lottery pushed the line back. Foxwoods in Connecticut has
intensified the pressure for casinos here. But as often happens
while government wrings its hands over policy, reality keeps
charging right ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Plainridge isn't a racetrack; it's a gambling parlor. The debate
over whether to have casinos has missed the point. We have one now,
right off I-495, in the shadow of a makeshift grandstand, bordered
by an unfinished cinder track.

MONICA LEWINSKY ON THE DOWN ELEVATOR OF AMERICAN CELEBRITYHOOD
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky's 14 months of fame are over now. They came and
went in the blink of an eye. Her life, in the sense of a normal
life, is finished, though no one seems to have the heart to tell
her. She's riding the down escalator of celebrity, medications in
her purse. A Hollywood Square awaits.
</P>
<P>
   She is, remarkably, the most despised public figure in modern
American life. Her personal favorability rating, as measured by the
Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll, is 10 percent positive and 76
percent negative. We now like everyone else better than we like Ms.
Lewinsky. Even O.J. Simpson, at the time of his murder trial, had
better numbers than hers.
</P>
<P>
   What does this say about us? Much of the last year has been
given over to thrashing President Clinton for exploiting Lewinsky
in the way that he did. That was fair enough. His conduct toward
her was in every way irresponsible, reprehensible, and inexcusable.
But Clinton was hardly the only one who used and exploited Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The media feasted on her. Is there a difference between Linda
Tripp and Barbara Walters, really? It is true that Tripp taped
Lewinsky without her knowledge or consent. It is also true that
Tripp manipulated Lewinsky to do and say things that Tripp knew
could only make Lewinsky's legal stance more perilous.
</P>
<P>
   But on a human level, Tripp's treachery isn't really
distinguishable from Walters's faux empathy. They were both after
the same thing. By the time of the ``exclusive'' interview,
Lewinsky was a young woman in desperate need of adult guidance. She
needed one true friend, preferably a worldly woman, to help her get
her act together. Her mother had come undone. Her twenty-something
friends were too young. The handlers were interested only in their
billable hours. She was alone in the shark tank.
</P>
<P>
   Walters's interview with Lewinsky _ all that phony concern and
feigned intimacy _ was in its way every bit as despicable as Bill
Clinton's conduct. Clinton at least tried to keep her servitude
secret, not because he cared about her but because he feared the
political cost. Walters's intentions were entirely mercenary. She
would wring from Monica every last drop of Nielsen blood.
</P>
<P>
   And for this Walters was celebrated, unlike Lewinsky, who was
reviled. The press pronounced Barbara the queen of the ``get.''
Anchormen like Dan Rather and talk-show hosts like Charlie Rose
genuflected at Walters's altar of celebrity journalism. Only
Barbara could have done it, said Rose. This is what makes her the
premier television interviewer of her time, said Rather.
</P>
<P>
   And there wasn't a trace of irony in their voices.
</P>
<P>
   Not one ranking member of the media _ not one _ said that what
Walters did in getting the interview and during the interview
itself was irresponsible, reprehensible or inexcusable. The ratings
were great _ better than the Academy Awards, as it turned out _ so
Walters reigned, and everyone fell into line.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time as the Lewinsky interview, Paul Weyrich,
a leading political strategist, sent an open letter to his friends
and acquaintances in the conservative movement. Therein he wrote:
``Politics has failed because of the collapse of the culture. The
culture we are living in becomes an ever-wider sewer. In truth, I
think we are caught up in a cultural collapse of historic
proportions, a collapse so great that it simply overwhelms
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Weyrich's letter was a declaration of defeat in what we have
come to call the culture wars. As such, liberals greeted it with
satisfaction, conservatives with consternation. The superior forces
of the media culture would win, said Weyrich. They already have
won, he admitted later. There was no longer any point in pretending
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   So whose view of the culture is right? Dan Rather's or Paul
Weyrich's? Over the course of the last year, the mainstream media
devoted an extraordinary percentage of their time and energy to the
cause of exploiting Monica Lewinsky for profit. NBC News had as an
explicit strategy ``all Monica, all the time.'' And it worked.
MSNBC's ratings improved. CNBC's prime-time ratings improved. NBC
News did better on nights when Monica was prominently featured. And
it wasn't just NBC (where I once worked). ABC News, CBS News, Fox
News, National Public Radio, The Washington Post, The New York
Times _ all of these media empires mainlined Monica every day.
</P>
<P>
   They'd like you to forget that now. They'd like you to believe
that Monica was an aberration. But it was hardly an aberration.
Sunday night, in prime time during the Academy Awards ceremonies,
the host simulated masturbation while introducing a ``presenter.''
And the show went on as if nothing unusual had happened.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Weyrich may be cranky, but he's not wrong. The cultural war
has been lost. The only question left is how much worse it will
get. Monica Lewinsky, at the age of 25, has already lived the
answer to that question.

OSCAR-WINNING DOCUMENTARIAN IN FRONT OF CAMERAS AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB MCCARTHY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Keiko Ibi is one of the beautiful people, though
she's probably too modest to admit it.
</P>
<P>
   In case you missed it Sunday night, this former Miss Japan Grand
Prix won an Oscar for her 37-minute documentary, ``The Personals:
Improvisations on Romance in the Golden Years,'' and became an even
bigger part of academy history in the process. With the short
documentary category being eliminated, her name closes the book on
that genre.
</P>
<P>
   Ibi's route to filmmaking started when she won her country's
equivalent of the Miss America Pageant at age 19. That led to the
expected promotional tours and personal appearances, after which
she studied acting, singing and dancing in anticipation of starting
a career in front of audiences. But, alas, she found herself less
than satisfied with it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``My adventurous nature and wanting to do unexpected things led
me to learn more about writing screenplays,'' she says. ``I decided
to enroll in film school in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Off she went in 1993 to New York University's film school, where
she eventually made ``The Personals'' as a senior thesis. She's the
first to admit that her making a film about a senior-citizen troupe
of actors (the subject of her winning documentary) produced an
unlikely pairing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I become curious how the performance fits into their lives and
thought to follow them on and off stage until the next
performance,'' she says. ``Jewish seniors and a Japanese girl is
almost as opposite as it can get. ... I didn't know their stories,
but somehow I had a whole movie in my head.''
</P>
<P>
   The production was a collaboration with cinematographer and
fellow NYU alum Greg Pak (a Student Academy Award winner in 1998),
and the original version ran 79 minutes _ nearly twice what it
ended up being. Her film drew acclaim at the San Francisco
International Film Festival, Film Fest New Haven, the National
Educational Media Festival and the Jewish Video Competition and
received an honorable mention at the Philadelphia International
Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Her story of growing old in America with grace and humor will be
televised in June on HBO. She is currently in preproduction on her
next documentary being shot in Dallas and is working on a
screenplay for a full-length feature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would've thought a girl from Japan can make a film about
senior citizens and get nominated for an Academy Award!'' she
marveled. ``When I set foot in the United States seven years ago,
it was inconceivable.''
</P>
<P>
   The phone at her publicist's office hasn't stopped ringing since
Sunday night's Oscars, and a now-weary Ibi has appeared on ``CNN
Live,'' ``Late Night With Tom Snyder,'' taped a ``Roseanne''
segment and talked with practically every major publication in
Japan in the days since. While her status as a former Miss Japan
certainly makes people sit up and take notice, Ibi doesn't want to
be stereotyped by her past accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wants people to know she's not just another pretty face,''
says her publicist, Tom Chen.

THIS CAMPAIGN RIDES ON TRANSIT SYSTEM'S TROUBLES 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Stand at one of the city's Municipal Railway
stations with Clint Reilly for two hours and you learn some things:
First, it's cold out there. Reilly has been accused of having a
super-heated ego, but most other parts of him were freezing at the
entrance to Castro station early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   This guy is serious about running for mayor. He's burning
calories as well as his own money.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly is paying the price of his transformation from political
consultant to political supplicant. He spends most mornings passing
out copies of his plan to fix the transit system called ``Riders
First!''
</P>
<P>
   Streams of commuters passed as he kept saying, ``Hi, Clint
Reilly, running for mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Some commuters smiled. Others blew him off.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain amount of making a fool of oneself,'' he
said. ``Real people are rough.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes entire crowds of people would blast by.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny. If the first person in a bunch takes a book, they
all do,'' Reilly said, probably the first time this minor bit of
mass behavior has ever been noticed by a high-powered political
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   I kept wondering how the public would react if Mayor Willie
Brown were standing at a station handing out his plan to fix Muni.
</P>
<P>
   The second and most important thing you learn standing with an
insurgent candidate for mayor at a Muni station is that San
Franciscans are serious about making city services work, especially
Muni, a subject on which they're all experts.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Hall told Reilly he'd already read his Muni book. ``It's a
great compilation of what everyone knows,'' he said. ``If the Board
of Supervisors and mayor used Muni and cabs, they'd know what was
wrong, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what Muni's motto is, don't you?'' said Annie Jew.
``Their motto is: `We're already at work.'''
</P>
<P>
   And the heck with everyone else trying to get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave up on Muni a long time ago,'' Jew said. ``No way you
can make arrangements to meet people. We don't make our own time.''
</P>
<P>
   She told Reilly: ``You're going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another woman passing by looked at Reilly's Muni book and said,
``Oh, yeah, fix it, baby.''
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the rush hour, there was a breakdown and
hundreds of commuters were stuck on the platform. Reilly went down
to work the packed crowd.
</P>
<P>
   John Preckel, who commutes a mere five stops, said: ``It's the
kind of commute that sucks the life out of you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If management hasn't improved over the years, then it's the
mayor's fault,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I kept thinking about the reception Brown would get on the
platform. It probably wouldn't be as bad as it was during the great
Muni meltdown last year when he was booed and cursed.
</P>
<P>
   Many people say the service has improved since the big meltdown
(and how could it not?). Many also are encouraged by Brown's hiring
of a professional transit director from Philadelphia, Thomas Burns.
</P>
<P>
   The question is why Brown waited three years to hire a real pro.
As Marc Gofstein put it sardonically, ``Suddenly we get a Muni
director.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said everyone he spoke to in Philadelphia told him Burns
is first-rate. The question is what Burns can do squeezed between
the unions and their friend, the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   One of Reilly's problems is that only 30 percent of the people
know who he is. Brown's problem, though, is that 100 percent of the
people know who he is.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Reilly has gotten a lot of bad press, not least
from me, but I'll say this. The whole two hours we were at the
Castro Muni station, no one offered a cheer for Brown, or called
Reilly a political consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Just wait. We'll hear worse.

STEAKS AND MARRIAGES ARE BEST WITH A LITTLE SEASONING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been said that longevity has its place. Obviously, that
is an old aphorism. We are all aware that the trend today is toward
youth, youth and more youth. However, it is true that there are
times when even the most progressive among us would prefer a
seasoned veteran.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on an airplane I would prefer a pilot with 20 years
of experience over one who just got his or her license yesterday.
In the operating room, the title of chief of surgery has a
reassuring resonance to it, don't you think? And, of course,
there's marriage, where a few years under the belt can make the
union seem more like a wonderful, well-seasoned steak instead of a
sizzling stake through the heart. (If you're not a meat eater, that
analogy doesn't work, but just work with me anyway.)
</P>
<P>
   See, when we were first married, my husband was bluntly honest.
Not that truth is bad, but when a woman asks her husband, ``Do I
look fat in this skirt?'' she really does not want to hear, ``Yes,
it is kind of tight around the hips.''
</P>
<P>
   A veteran, elderly husband would say, ``You look nice in
everything you wear, but I prefer the blue skirt because it matches
your hair.'' Of course, he knows that the skirt is too tight and
she knows that the skirt is too tight, but he also knows that the
blue skirt is pleated and a size larger than the one she's squeezed
herself into.
</P>
<P>
   At times, we simply need reassurance from our spouses. The skirt
question really boils down to, ``Do you find me unattractive
because my hips have spread since I bore those children for you?''
OK, the chocolate had something to do with the hips also, but
children make mothers eat chocolate. It relieves stress. Really.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, when my husband asks me, ``Will you still love me
when I'm bald?'' I now know not to start making jokes about that
3-foot-long strip of hair that some men use to disguise their
smooth domes. Nope. I say, ``Honey, I think bald men are sexy. I
loved you with that big Afro, and I'll love you when you wear your
hair like Caesar or Michael Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   And I will. Hair loss is the least of my worries. There are
worse things.
</P>
<P>
   And while I'm not privy to the male psyche, I think the hair
question boils down to, ``Am I the man?''
</P>
<P>
   And I think, ``Yes, you work hard to provide for our family, you
come home every night, you're a pretty nice guy and you never tell
me that I look like a fat cow even when I do. Heck, yeah, you're
The Man!''
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, like aged cheese and I Love Lucy reruns, some things do
improve with time. Although the idea of old cheese has never
appealed to me. I like to think of it as being new when I purchase
it, and then I toss it out when it turns green. Forget the cheese;
Lucy is good, though. Wait, didn't she divorce Desi Arnaz?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, never mind.

STAIRWAY RUNNERS: INSTALL THEM YOURSELF, SOMETIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who has never had problems with his stairs _ indoor stairs, that
is. It never fails that the nicely-varnished treads look good for a
month, if you're lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Such treads always get badly treated by feet walking up and
down, scuffing the varnish down to the bare wood. You just can't
help sort of sluffing your feet on stairs, so the problem is not
solved by having everyone climb the stairs flat-footed.
</P>
<P>
   And the risers, those nice, white-painted risers, also look good
for a month or so; after that, they too get scuffed or scarred by
the toes of those walking feet. It is unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   So what to do, what to do?
</P>
<P>
   Is there something that will protect the treads and risers? One
solution is to do what a friend of mine did many years ago; he
applied a marbleized contact paper to the risers. It lasted many
years, scuffing of the marble pattern didn't show, and when the
paper got too messy, all my friend had to do was replace the paper.
It did no good for the treads, however.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate in protecting both treads and risers is a stair
carpet, or runner. There is a bonus; it muffles the sound of feet
galumphing up and down. And, they may even prevent you or anyone
else from being caught coming home in the wee hours. And, you can
argue that it makes the stairs safer.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy stick-on pads for the treads only, even in an
Oriental pattern. This is a quick and easy fix, but will not help
the risers.
</P>
<P>
   These stick-ons might be good for another friend of mine, who
needed an easier way for his old dog to get up the stairs. It seems
the dog could not get a good grip on the stairs, and ended up
sprawling up as best he could. The stick-ons would give him
something to really dig his paws into.
</P>
<P>
   Such stick-ons are sold in some catalogs, the Improvements
Catalog, for one (800-642-2112).
</P>
<P>
   But for good looks, comfort, and safety, a stair carpet is the
way to go. And, you can do it yourself, if your stairs do not take
funny turns with pie-slice-shaped treads. If your stairs do take
funny turns, pay the bucks and let the pros do it. A runner has to
be cut and fitted to make those funny turns, so it is worth
spending the money for a professional installation.
</P>
<P>
   But if you have a straight run or your stairs turn a corner with
one or more square landings, you can do it yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Buy a quality runner: A thick, all-wool, Oriental design is
best. Adding a pad will extend the life of the runner. Such quality
runners cost up to $27 a running foot at standard stores; you can
get them for much less at discount, salvage, and surplus stores.
</P>
<P>
   The Improvements Catalog and Renovator's (800-659-2211) carry
runners of various synthetic fabrics. They are less expensive than
those of wool and, in this handyman's opinion, are not as good as
the wool ones.
</P>
<P>
   First, measure your stairs. Measure a tread and multiply by the
number of treads. Then measure a riser and multiply by the number
of risers. Add them together and add two feet for good measure. The
two extra feet allow for wastage and also allow you to double the
runner at the high riser; that way, when the runner wears, you can
unfold that doubled runner and reinstall the runner, exposing fresh
runner at no cost at all, except the labor.
</P>
<P>
   In most stairs, all risers are the same height and all treads
are the same depth. If you are in doubt about that, measure each
riser and tread individually.
</P>

EDITOR RECOUNTS DISTINGUISHED CAREER AT THE TIMES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The biggest problem with ``The Times of My Life: And My Life
With The Times,'' is that its author saves the best for first. This
worthy memoir from retired New York Times executive editor Max
Frankel opens with the breathtaking tale of his family's
nick-of-time escape from Germany and the Holocaust. After that, his
distinguished career as a journalist who works his way to the top
of the Times masthead _ surmounting the paper's byzantine
bureaucracy and opening its gray pages to livelier journalism _
seems like an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite. After one is finished marveling at Frankel's
mere survival, ``The Times of My Life'' succeeds as a sharp
analysis of US miscalculations during the Cold War. (Frankel, who
became the Times's man in Moscow at age 27, had a bird's-eye view
of world leaders toiling under the burden of mutually assured
destruction.) It also provides a reasonably candid look at the
internal machinations of America's newspaper of record.
</P>
<P>
   All this is skillfully executed by an author whose craftsmanship
certainly exceeds that of the average journalist. Today, Frankel
continues to write an eminently readable column in the New York
Times Magazine that _ in contrast to his predecessor A.M.
Rosenthal's op-ed pleadings _ proves that former Times editors can
go gracefully into that long goodnight.
</P>
<P>
   The primary historical significance of Frankel's book is his
insistent portrayal of Soviet boss Nikita Khrushchev as the
original Gorbachev, a quasiheroic figure struggling to ``overhaul .
. . the Soviet political structure'' and to trade guns for butter
long before it was politically feasible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I considered Khrushchev the most robust politician of my
time,'' he writes. And Frankel did ply his trade in interesting
times. A firsthand tale of Khrushchev, Fidel Castro, and Malcolm X
all converging on Harlem's Hotel Theresa one night in 1960 suggests
just how bland our news landscape seems these days.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel traces a series of American missteps during the Cold War
_ including the ``domino theory,'' which helped justify the Vietnam
quagmire. (Unlike Oliver Stone, he believes that had John Kennedy
lived, he would have become fully involved in the ``Vietnam
muck.'') He also suggests that the press began its ``gradual,
fitful estrangement'' from the government during the dark days of
Cold War duplicity _ well before Walter Cronkite saw the light in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel's discussion of his career at the Times is most notable
for what he is noted for: expanding the definition of ``all the
news that's fit to print.'' This idea goes back as far as an early
Frankel dispatch from Cuba, speculating that the communists were
winning the heart of the newly ascendant Castro, ``that barely fit
the conventions of newspaper language.'' And it extends to this
famous 1994 Page 1 story on Bill Clinton's visit to Oxford written
by Maureen Dowd at the end of Frankel's tenure as executive editor:
``President Clinton returned today for a sentimental journey to the
university where he didn't inhale, didn't get drafted and didn't
get a degree.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankel's reasoning is disarming. The decision to publish this
``apt spoof of an otherwise inconsequential presidential photo op''
was partial revenge for the Times's refusal to publish a poem he
once wrote lampooning Richard Nixon's travels to Limerick, Ireland,
in search of his Irish ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel uses the book to make an unapologetic case for
redefining news, proudly recounting how he green-lighted front-page
Times stories on everything from country music to shorter hemlines.
And to his credit, he addresses some of the more significant
controversies that arose as part of the so-called
``tabloidization'' of the Times during his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a longstanding policy against naming victims of sexual
assault, he is unrepentant about the 1991 Times story that
identified Patricia Bowman as the woman who accused William Kennedy
Smith of rape, a story that triggered in-house protests.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, Frankel acknowledges that another Dowd Page 1
blockbuster _ a 1991 summary of Kitty Kelley's Nancy Reagan
biography featuring allegations that the first lady had bedded
Frank Sinatra _ ``was not appropriate news for the Times.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest anyone think Frankel's Times actually tumbled down the
slippery tabloid slope, he defends the paper's hands-off treatment
of Gennifer Flowers's ``alleged escapades'' with Clinton and other
affairs of the flesh. ``Whenever we were somehow forced to delve
into people's private lives, we preferred not to be first with lewd
and lurid details,'' he writes, describing a philosophy still
evident in the Times's gingerly handling of recent allegations that
Clinton sexually assaulted an Arkansas woman 21 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long way from divining the workings of Khrushchev's
Kremlin to deciding whether to detail the hormonal urges of
presidential hopefuls. But then, Frankel's ``Life With The Times''
spanned the equivalent of several sociopolitical eons.

<P>
   Even in the software business, looks matter. Which is why the
red-hot Linux operating system is getting some cosmetic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   To devoted technophiles, Linux is already quite sexy. Developed
by Finnish computer student Linus Torvalds and a worldwide network
of programmers coordinated by the Free Software Foundation in
Cambridge, Mass., it's powerful, sophisticated, and available at
little or no cost.
</P>
<P>
   But Linux is a clone of the powerful Unix operating system. It
shares Unix's complex command structure, forcing the user to
memorize dozens of arcane instructions like ``tar xvf'' or ``mount
/mnt/sda1.'' Linux is excellent for running powerful server
computers, and it's now a significant challenger to Microsoft
Corp.'s Windows NT. But because of its complexity, Linux hasn't got
a prayer of supplanting Windows 95 and 98 on desktop machines.
</P>
<P>
   The solution is clear enough. Linux needs a good graphical user
interface, or GUI, like Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh or
Microsoft's Windows. Nearly everybody uses GUI-type computers
today. Instead of typing commands, we point and click at images on
the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Many computer purists sneer at GUIs. They're a barrier between
the user and the machine. When I was a kid and the TV broke down,
we'd unscrew the back and replace a few vacuum tubes. Today's sets
can only be fixed by trained technicians.
</P>
<P>
   GUIs can have much the same effect on software. With a Mac or
Windows computer, you usually don't know what's going on under the
hood, and can't do much about it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just fine with people who want to turn on the
computer and get to work. These are the users who must become true
believers if Linux is to be more than just this year's software
fad. So the best Linux brains are writing up programs that slap a
pretty smile across Linux's ugly mug. I've got the two most popular
Linux GUIs running on my home machines, and both of them are just
good enough to make me wish they were better.
</P>
<P>
   The best-behaved of the two is a German product called KDE,
which is included with a number of popular Linux packages, like
Caldera Systems Inc.'s OpenLinux.
</P>
<P>
   The KDE look is cool, efficient, and rather plain. But it gives
you the kind of push-button features that most computer users
expect these days. Text editors and file managers come to life with
a click. You can set up a wide range of standard Linux functions
without learning all of those nasty commands.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad it's not as easy to use applications like Netscape's Web
browser or Star Office, a German-made Linux word processor. Icons
for such programs don't automatically appear on the desktop, and
putting them there takes a fair amount of know-how.
</P>
<P>
   If KDE sports a girl-next-door look, the Free Software
Foundation's Gnome interface calls to mind an episode of
``Baywatch.'' Gnome is ultra-flashy, with big icons and a lavish
selection of visual ``themes'' for designing the desktop of your
dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Gnome is pretty, but it's also pretty buggy. Utilities like the
file manager would refuse to work. The Netscape browser often
wouldn't load up. And Gnome has an irritating streak of
absent-mindedness. It let me customize the desktop, putting all of
the icons right where I wanted them. But the next time I ran Gnome,
all of my changes were gone. Good looks are well and good, but
reliability comes first. Which is why I'm sticking with KDE, at
least until a debugged version of Gnome turns up.
</P>
<P>
   KDE and Gnome have one thing in common: They're difficult to
install. And to make them work on a PC, you must first install a
program called XFree86 _ a task so complex you could almost devote
a book to it. Besides, XFree86 is incompatible with many computers'
graphic accelerator cards _ something to check before experimenting
with Linux.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Gnome and KDE don't simplify Linux very much. All of
the complexity is still there, just below the colorful wallpaper.
What's needed isn't plastic surgery but a brain implant _ a way to
make ease of use integral to the software. Until that happens,
Microsoft's hold on the desktop is secure.
</P>
<P>
   One more thing. Remember last week's column about the dark side
of Internet auctions? Antique collector Cindy Allen certainly does,
and with good reason. I got her name wrong. Terribly sorry. Won't
happen again.

   KOSOVO-RDP (Washington) _ NATO launched an aerial bombardment on
Yugoslavia for a second night, firing on Serb targets from ships in
the Adriatic. Western leaders had promised a second night of
attacks by bombers and cruise missiles after a devastating first
round that reportedly killed at least 11 people and delivered a
serious blow to the Yugoslav military infrastructure. (Early

Yugoslav offensive intensified in Kosovo, dimming hopes for a quick
end to the crisis. By Eric Schmitt.

nation's priorities in an anticipated era of fiscal plenty. The
Senate was completing debate on a similar plan, and a Thursday vote
was also possible. The Republican plan in both chambers calls for a
tax cut of nearly $800 billion over the next 10 years, a hefty
increase in Pentagon spending and more money for education. But to
remain with strict spending limits that both parties have vowed to

WORKGROUP PRINTERS CAN SPEED UP WORK AT THE OFFICE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ?????  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A workgroup printer is a high-speed printer designed for heavy
use in a small to medium-size office environment. These printers
typically have large paper trays, heavy-duty mechanical parts, and
built-in network interfaces. Workgroup printers are great if you
frequently print large jobs, or if you find that people in your
office are frequently queuing up behind the printer.
</P>
<P>
   Workgroup printers are significantly more expensive than those
$200 inkjet and $400 laser printers that have been flooding the
market. But they are frequently cheaper than buying three printers.
</P>
<P>
   I looked at two printers from Hewlett Packard: the 2000Cse color
inkjet and the LaserJet 2100TN.
</P>
<P>
   If you are going to buy a color printer and you have the money,
I heartily recommend HP's 2000Cse. This printer has 600-by-600
black-and-white resolution, 1,200-by-1,200 color resolution, and
prints really fast for an inkjet _ roughly 20 seconds per page in
my tests. (HP quotes 6 seconds per page: I guess their pages have
more white space than mine do.)
</P>
<P>
   The printer comes in two versions: the HP2000Cse ($799), and the
HP2000CN ($945), which includes a built-in ethernet interface. You
can also get a second paper tray for $199. The printer can handle
envelopes one at a time or in a whole stack. Unfortunately, there
is no way to insert an oversize 9-by-12 envelope, since the
printer's paper path is limited to 8 1/2-by-11-inch paper.
</P>
<P>
   While other reviewers have complained about the 2000C's print
quality on standard paper, it looked just fine to me. The one
exception came when printing on transparencies; I got occasional
black smears and drops from one transparency to the next.
Fortunately, ink comes in big high-capacity cartridges, which HP
says lowers the cost of printing to 3.5 cents per page for
black-and-white text, 12 cents per page for full-color.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that's often ignored when considering a new printer is
the quality of the printer's drivers. A driver is the program
inside your computer that controls the printer. Without a driver,
the printer is just a hunk of metal and plastic. A good driver can
make a good printer terrific.
</P>
<P>
   The HP2000C comes with a driver called the ``Printer Toolbox.''
This program lets you monitor the printer's ink levels,
troubleshoot, align print heads, calibrate the color, and access a
fairly well-written set of help pages.
</P>
<P>
   The printer driver further allows you to select ``Ordered
Printing,'' which causes the printed pages to come out in reverse
order, so that the printer stacks them in the correct order.
</P>
<P>
   HP's black-and-white LaserJet 2100 is a fairly zippy printer,
delivering 10 pages per minute for normal office work. Where this
printer stands out is its resolution: 1,200-by-1,200 dots per inch.
Photographs printed on this printer look like photos rather than
like a copy of something that was printed in the newspaper. It
comes with a 250-sheet paper tray that has an indicator on the
outside showing how much paper is left.
</P>
<P>
   HP's driver can automatically pull the first page of a print job
from one printer and the second page from another. A third
fold-down paper tray holds envelopes, checks, and other special
items.
</P>
<P>
   The basic 2100xi ($650) comes with parallel and infrared
interfaces. For $750 you can move up to the 2100M, which includes a
Macintosh serial interface and a built-in PostScript engine. For
$950 you can get the 2100TN, which adds an ethernet interface.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, while HP sent me the 2100TN to review, I was
never able to get the ethernet interface to work. Instead, I just
hooked the printer onto a spare computer's parallel port and shared
the printer over the network.
</P>
<P>
   I tried printing to the 2100TN using both the HP PCL (Printer
Control Language) and the PostScript. I couldn't see any difference
on the printouts, confirming a statement I made last year in this
column that Windows users have no real need for PostScript
printers.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of its other modern laserjets, the 2100 series has an
infrared port on the front, allowing you to print from a laptop or
Windows CE palmtop computer. Although this is an interesting
feature, I don't know a single person who uses the infrared
printing ability on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, I really like these two printers. But if I had to
choose between them, I would probably go with the 2000C. Although
it prints black and white at half the speed, it also prints color,
and it isn't that expensive to operate.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Linux followup
</P>
<P>
   Last week I asked readers to drop me an e-mail about whether
they'd like to have Microsoft's Office applications running on
their beloved Linux operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The response was far from overwhelming: I got e-mails from
roughly 25 people, nearly 90 percent of whom said that the only
reason they still run Windows was to run Office. When they are not
using a word processor, they boot their computer into Linux to take
advantage of that operating system's speed, agility, and
reliability.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps Microsoft is better off not coming out with an Office
for Linux. After all, if Office ran on Linux, there would be one
less reason to buy Microsoft's operating systems.

FIDELITY'S VENTURE CAPITAL OPERATION LOOKING FOR ANOTHER WINNER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ?????  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is there another Colt in this stable?
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Ventures, the low-profile venture-capital arm of money
management giant Fidelity Investments, would do well to find
another winner on the scale of Colt Telecom Group PLC in its
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the venture arm was one part of Fidelity Capital, the
investment unit that also controlled wholly owned and operated
businesses like the company's newspaper, limousine, and
executive-recruitment subsidiaries. It split off on its own two
months ago and Fidelity Capital's president, Tim Hilton, became the
head of Fidelity Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton declined to talk to us this week. But a review of
Fidelity Ventures materials in print and on the Internet shows that
the company has more than $300 million invested in young companies
and their emerging technologies. Fidelity's portfolio of
investments now includes nearly four-dozen companies.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity ranks as a top 20 player among the 200 or so venture
capital firms in New England, according to PriceWaterhouseCoopers,
the accounting firm that tracks the venture business.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Ventures may not be the biggest player in the venture
field, but unlike many other venture capital firms it is
bankrolling all of its own investments and not raising funds from
outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   The jewel of the Fidelity Ventures portfolio remains the famed
Colt, a European telecommunications success story that went public
in 1996. Fidelity still owns about half of the company, which has a
market value of $9.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Fidelity venture portfolio has a decidedly
high-tech flavor. Most of its money is sunk into software,
telecommunications, or health care businesses.
</P>
<P>
   It has also dabbled in modest-size leveraged buyouts and a few
new interests, including education and employer services. Advantage
Schools Inc. of Boston, the charter-school operator,  &UR; yesterday &LR; 
announced a new $25 million round of venture funding from a pack of
firms including Fidelity Ventures, which was one of the company's
original backers.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond Colt, you won't find many well-known names with
wildly successful initial public stock offerings to their credit in
the Fidelity Ventures portfolio. It is stocked with smaller
ventures with relatively obscure names like PakNetX, Future Tense,
and Verbind.
</P>
<P>
   An exception: GeoTel Communications of Lowell, a Fidelity
venture investment that dates back to 1995. GeoTel, which makes
computer telephony software, went public at 12 in 1996 and traded
above 42  &UR; yesterday &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Executives at other venture firms and the small companies that
seek investment capital say Fidelity can offer a few unique
advantages. Tops on the list: name recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The venture business is an almost unbranded business,'' said
Chris Gabrieli of Bessemer Venture Partners in Wellesley, who has
co-invested with Fidelity in Advantage Schools and several other
deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were to ask even sophisticated investors to name any
venture firm, few would know any. Fidelity has enormous brand
value. Compared to a potentially fine venture firm no one has heard
of, the Fidelity name helps companies more with employees, vendors,
and customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Some technology companies can also get something more than the
usual venture offerings _ money and some management help _ from
Fidelity. They can sometimes land a big customer, or even more
importantly, a high-tech site to test new technology inside an
organization that spends hundreds of millions of dollars on
hardware and software every year.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity has also loaned out a handful of executives from its
huge lineup of technology employees to venture companies in need.
</P>
<P>
   Foundation Technologies of Waltham, a company that develops
Internet software for human resource departments, ran into just
that problem last fall. Fidelity, which was one of the company's
two original venture investors, provided an executive with
specialized Internet skills to step in as the company's active vice
president of engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Foundation chief executive Tod Loofbourrow said his company
selected Fidelity from a field of nearly two dozen interested
venture firms. He said Fidelity was already involved in the
company's field and didn't need a quick payoff to pass through to
other investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very patient capital,'' said Loofbourrow, who hopes
Foundation can go public next year.
</P>
<P>
   Patience aside, there is still the payoff question. Before
Loofbourrow got his money, he had to meet with Fidelity chairman
Edward C. ``Ned'' Johnson III for two hours. For all of his
longterm perspective, Johnson doesn't like to be disappointed.
</P>

SEARCH GROWS FOR SUSPECTS IN CALIFORNIA KILLINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 and ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MI-WUK VILLAGE, Calif. _ An intense two-county search for
suspects in the killing of a California woman and possibly one of
two teen-agers traveling with her has not led the police to any
suspects, authorities said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But the sweep has had some beneficial side-effects. Authorities
in Tuolumne and Mariposa counties have recovered about 15 stolen
cars, arrested a handful of parolees and probation violators and
may have caused other criminals to lay low or flee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great. They're driving away everybody with a criminal
record,'' said Louise Guthmiller, the owner of a Chevron station in
Sierra Village, a hamlet in Tuolumne County. ``I don't know if
they're going to find the person they want up here, but they're
making all the other bad guys nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI descended on the rural are in eastern California last
week after a badly burned rental car used by Carole Sund, 42, her
daughter Julie, 15, and family friend Silvina Pelosso, 16, was
found in a densely wooded area about two miles from Guthmiller's
gas station.
</P>
<P>
   The charred remains of two people, one of them Carole Sund, were
found inside the trunk on March 18. The other body has not been
identified, but investigators expect it to one of the girl's. The
third person has not been found.
</P>
<P>
   The car was found hidden in a ponderosa pine forest some three
hours north of the Cedar Lodge in El Portal, the town near the
Yosemite National Park where the woman and two teen-agers had been
staying before they disappeared in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Thursday they had not made any arrests in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and other investigators are said to be looking at about
10 to 15 men as possible suspects. Among them are convicted sex
offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are talking to people, they are following leads, they are
verifying alibis,'' said Tuolumne County sheriff's Lt. John Steely.
``They are checking through all the thousands of tips that we have
received.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the car was found more than three hours from where the
woman and two children were last seen, investigators believe the
three met violence in or around Yosemite National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, people here have been rocked by the developments.
Mariposa and Tuolumne counties have very low crime rates. Tuolumne,
with 52,000 residents, had one homicide last year and none in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The last homicide in Mariposa County, with about 16,000
residents, was in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   John Engel, a resident of Tuolumne County, said the mountains
are a good place for someone to hide from the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in these hills there are a lot of people who don't want
law enforcement to know about them,'' said Engel, who moved to the
area in 1995. ``It's kind of natural for them to come here.''

<P>
   EMC Corp. said it may buy up to $3 billion in computer parts
from IBM Corp. over five years in an unusual deal that also gives
the Hopkinton company access to technology developed by Big Blue.
</P>
<P>
   The pact announced Wednesday comes despite that the two
companies are archrivals in the market for large disk drive
systems. They compete fiercely to sell the systems used by
airlines, banks, and other corporations to track accounts and
customer data.
</P>
<P>
   EMC already buys many disk drives from its competitor in Armonk,
N.Y. Now, by moving into a closer alliance, EMC hopes to attract
new customers who want more assurances that parts made by the two
companies would mesh, said EMC spokesman Mark Fredrickson.
</P>
<P>
   Among customers, ``there's still an element of `FUD', or fear,
uncertainty, and doubt, that's erased'' by the technical
cooperation, Fredrickson said.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how much of the $3 billion in potential purchases
by EMC represents fresh orders for IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Fredrickson said the figure represents little change from EMC's
previous purchase plans.
</P>
<P>
   EMC also emphasized that the $3 billion figure was ``a target''
and said that it made no firm commitments to buy the entire amount.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Beermann, an IBM spokesman, said the agreement will produce
``significant'' new revenues for IBM, but declined to specify how
much.
</P>
<P>
   For IBM, the cooperation is part of a broader strategy shift in
which the company plans to increase its focus on producing parts
for other computer companies. Last year, such operations accounted
for $6.6 billion of IBM's total revenue of $81.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, IBM said it would sell $16 billion worth of
parts to Dell Computer Corp. over seven years, even though it plans
to continue to sell personal computers in competition against Dell.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said that the technical cooperation between EMC
and IBM was the most noteworthy part of Wednesday's agreement.
</P>
<P>
   EMC said its engineers will begin cooperating with their
counterparts at IBM, sharing technical details on storage
technology to ensure IBM parts run smoothly within EMC systems.
</P>
<P>
   Under their agreement, EMC gains access to 30,000 IBM patents,
Fredrickson said. EMC pledged not to compete against IBM in areas
such as the production of chips or certain computers.
</P>
<P>
   Tighter relations between EMC and IBM will help the latter
attract orders for mainframe computers from current EMC customers,
said John McArthur, senior analyst at International Data Corp. in
Framingham.
</P>
<P>
   ``This lets IBM move forward with their (mainframe) solution
quickly, and that's very important to them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   EMC is the biggest supplier of large information-storage
systems. Last year, it accounted for 35 percent of sales in the
market, according to Dataquest, a California research firm. IBM,
which once dominated the market, last year had 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement doesn't mean IBM is throwing in the towel for its
storage business.
</P>
<P>
   Big Blue will still compete against EMC in selling disk drives,
maintenance services and other areas, said B.T. Alex Brown analyst
Phil Rueppel.
</P>
<P>
   EMC shares closed at 118 7/8, up 5. IBM stock rose 4 1/8 to 169
1/2.

HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR THINKS PUBLISHER MORE DANGEROUS THAN WOLVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ?????  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In her book, Misha Defonseca, a Holocaust survivor, tells an
extraordinary tale of walking 3,000 miles across Europe in search
of the parents she would never find. It was the wolves that
befriended her that allowed her to survive, she says.
</P>
<P>
   American publishers, she says today, are a much more dangerous
breed of animal.
</P>
<P>
   Just 7 when her parents were taken by the Nazis in war-torn
Belgium, Defonseca spent four years living as a beggar child,
sleeping in the woods, sometimes reduced to eating worms or her own
scabs. She says she saw Nazis murder dozens of children; she killed
a Nazi soldier in self defense.
</P>
<P>
   What makes her story so compelling _ and not everyone believes
it _ is her account of her life and travels with a family of
wolves. From a chance encounter in the woods of Poland, she came to
be accepted by the wolves, she writes, sharing scraps of deer meat
and sleeping against their warm fur on freezing nights. She called
one of them ``Maman,'' French for mother. And it was the wolves who
taught her about freedom. After years of silence, Defonseca told
her story in ``Misha: A Memoire of the Holocaust Years,'' published
two years ago. It has turned into a second nightmare: Nazis, she
says, robbed her of her family; her publisher has robbed her of her
story.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit, Defonseca has charged that tiny Mt. Ivy Press LP
has withheld royalties and underreported sales. In a complaint, she
alleges that Mt. Ivy appears to have transferred the book's foreign
rights to an off-shore entity for $1 ``in a transparent attempt''
to hide their activities. Her probono lawyer, Larry L. Varn of
Sullivan &AMP; Worcester in Boston, also says Mt. Ivy has blocked one
potential movie deal in France, where the book was a bestseller,
Varn says.
</P>
<P>
   Mt. Ivy and its lawyers deny all. They say Defonseca doesn't
understand the publishing business; they say they have disclosed
fully her royalty payments and that things like book-store returns
have reduced sales. The foreign entity is for tax reasons, Ivy
says. In all, Defonseca has earned if not received roughly $100,000
from the book, a number she disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Mt. Ivy is hardly Random House. Its other titles include:
``Gigolos: The Secret Life of Men Who Service Women''; ``Main Dish
Salads''; and ``Venus: A Lover's Guide to Charms, Potions &AMP;
Aphrodisiacs.'' The company's lawyer says Mt. Ivy's headquarter's
address is a post office box in Newton. Mt. Ivy's chief executive,
Brett Kates, says the office in is Blue Belle, Pa. _ in his Dad's
house. Kates, 42, complains that Defonseca has run through several
lawyers in this suit; Kates says he hasn't practiced law since he
was suspended from practice.
</P>
<P>
   Defonseca, 65, blames the whole mess on Mt. Ivy's publisher,
Jane Daniel, who is also being sued by Defonseca's former
colaborator, Vera Lee of Newton. Defonseca says she and her
husband, Maurice, are in danger of losing their Millis home and
have been reduced to taking food from Jewish charities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see Jane Daniel and Brett Kates eating dog
food, as we had to, while they were withholding at least $27,000
owned to me for several months, somewhere on a bank account in the
West Indies,'' Defonseca says.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel says she feels bad, but says there would have been no
book if not for her. ``People get star struck,'' she says of
Defonseca. An Oprah Winfrey TV crew was filming a segment on the
story _ complete with wolves _ when Defonseca stopped cooperating,
Daniel says. What would that have done for sales?
</P>
<P>
   It's all a shame, Daniel repeats. But the rights belong to Mt.
Ivy. And that's that.

CRUISE MISSILES HAVE IMPORTANT BENEFIT OF REDUCING RISK TO PILOTS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new generation of cruise missiles deployed for use against
targets in the Balkans has proven effective during recent raids
against Iraq, the Pentagon says, where they struck 80 percent of
their targets.
</P>
<P>
   That would mark a significant improvement for the Navy's
long-range Tomahawk missile, built by Lexington-based Raytheon Co.,
and could give NATO forces an important advantage during the air
campaign that began Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Tomahawk received mixed reviews for its performance during
Gulf War, and some military observers remain skeptical because past
claims about the pilotless Tomahawk proved overblown.
</P>
<P>
   But even these people agree the Tomahawk and other so-called
``standoff'' weapons also serve a valuable domestic mission:
reducing the likelihood of pilot casualties while creating the
impression of powerful military action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the reason the Pentagon is touting these things is
because they don't want to use people'' to deliver bombs against
Serb targets, said Richard Shultz, a professor at Tufts
University's Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   But even a lower success rate does not mean the weapons are not
valuable, said Chris Hellman, senior analyst at the Center for
Defense Information, a nonprofit group in Washington and a frequent
Pentagon critic. ``Even if they work just half the time, that's
good enough if it means we don't have to put people in harm's
way.''
</P>
<P>
   No NATO losses were reported in the first day of the air
campaign, a combination of missile strikes and attacks by manned
aircraft. That could may change over the course of a longer
campaign, Hellman said, because Yugoslav air defenses are likely to
be more robust that those fielded by the Iraqi military.
</P>
<P>
   In Serbia, ``You've got a lot of mobile targets in moutainous
terrain, and that's an attacker's nightmare,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tomahawk, which can carry up to 1,000 pounds of explosives,
is generally launched from US Navy vessels in attacks on
infrastructure like buildings and airfields. A larger cruise
missile built by Boeing and used by the Air Force can carry twice
as much payload.
</P>
<P>
   The Tomahawk received much attention during the Gulf War. But a
Pentagon study that came to light in 1997 suggested the missile
reached just half its intended targets.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the main builder of the Tomahawk was Hughes
Electronics Corp., which has since been acquired by Raytheon. Both
Raytheon and the Pentagon decline to discuss criticism of the
weapons' previous performance. But of more than 300 missiles that
were fired on Iraq in December, 80 percent reached their target,
Navy spokeswoman Lieutenant Meghan Mariman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Another new munition available to NATO forces is the Joint
Standoff Weapon, essentially a winged glider bomb that can travel
long distances to a target after been dropped from an aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   So far 17 of the Raytheon-built bombs have been launched against
targets in Iraq and all 17 have hit their targets, according to
Navy officers quoted in trade publications.

   KOSOVO-CLARK _ WASHINGTON _ Supreme NATO Commander Wesley Clark
is a guy who looked down the hatch at his friends burned alive
after their APC tumbled over Mt. Igman outside Sarajevo in August
1995. The reason they were on the mountain at all was that the
Serbs wouldn't grant safe passage to Clark _ then the military
attache on a diplomatic mission headed by U.S. Sepcial Envoy
Richard Holbrooke _ that would have allowed them to travel by
helicopter. In other words, Clark _ who negotiated, if that's the
word for it _ the military occupation annex to the Dayton accords _

With its high oil content, it feels luxurious in your mouth. With
its lack of pinbones poking through the fillets, it feels safe. And
no surprise that it is quickly becoming so overfished that the

HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR THINKS PUBLISHER MORE DANGEROUS THAN WOLVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Steve Bailey 
c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In her book, Misha Defonseca, a Holocaust survivor, tells an
extraordinary tale of walking 3,000 miles across Europe in search
of the parents she would never find. It was the wolves that
befriended her that allowed her to survive, she says.
</P>
<P>
   American publishers, she says today, are a much more dangerous
breed of animal.
</P>
<P>
   Just 7 when her parents were taken by the Nazis in war-torn
Belgium, Defonseca spent four years living as a beggar child,
sleeping in the woods, sometimes reduced to eating worms or her own
scabs. She says she saw Nazis murder dozens of children; she killed
a Nazi soldier in self defense.

her story in ``Misha: A Memoire of the Holocaust Years,'' published
two years ago. It has turned into a second nightmare: Nazis, she
says, robbed her of her family; her publisher has robbed her of her
story.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit, Defonseca has charged that tiny Mt. Ivy Press LP
has withheld royalties and underreported sales. In a complaint, she
alleges that Mt. Ivy appears to have transferred the book's foreign
rights to an off-shore entity for $1 ``in a transparent attempt''
to hide their activities. Her probono lawyer, Larry L. Varn of
Sullivan &AMP; Worcester in Boston, also says Mt. Ivy has blocked one
potential movie deal in France, where the book was a bestseller,
Varn says.
</P>
<P>
   Mt. Ivy and its lawyers deny all. They say Defonseca doesn't
understand the publishing business; they say they have disclosed
fully her royalty payments and that things like book-store returns
have reduced sales. The foreign entity is for tax reasons, Ivy
says. In all, Defonseca has earned if not received roughly $100,000
from the book, a number she disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Mt. Ivy is hardly Random House. Its other titles include:
``Gigolos: The Secret Life of Men Who Service Women''; ``Main Dish
Salads''; and ``Venus: A Lover's Guide to Charms, Potions &AMP;
Aphrodisiacs.'' The company's lawyer says Mt. Ivy's headquarter's
address is a post office box in Newton. Mt. Ivy's chief executive,
Brett Kates, says the office in is Blue Belle, Pa. _ in his Dad's
house. Kates, 42, complains that Defonseca has run through several
lawyers in this suit; Kates says he hasn't practiced law since he
was suspended from practice.
</P>
<P>
   Defonseca, 65, blames the whole mess on Mt. Ivy's publisher,
Jane Daniel, who is also being sued by Defonseca's former
colaborator, Vera Lee of Newton. Defonseca says she and her
husband, Maurice, are in danger of losing their Millis home and
have been reduced to taking food from Jewish charities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see Jane Daniel and Brett Kates eating dog
food, as we had to, while they were withholding at least $27,000
owned to me for several months, somewhere on a bank account in the
West Indies,'' Defonseca says.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel says she feels bad, but says there would have been no
book if not for her. ``People get star struck,'' she says of
Defonseca. An Oprah Winfrey TV crew was filming a segment on the
story _ complete with wolves _ when Defonseca stopped cooperating,
Daniel says. What would that have done for sales?
</P>
<P>
   It's all a shame, Daniel repeats. But the rights belong to Mt.
Ivy. And that's that.

FIDELITY'S VENTURE CAPITAL OPERATION LOOKING FOR ANOTHER WINNER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 bY STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN 
c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is there another Colt in this stable?
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Ventures, the low-profile venture-capital arm of money
management giant Fidelity Investments, would do well to find
another winner on the scale of Colt Telecom Group PLC in its
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the venture arm was one part of Fidelity Capital, the
investment unit that also controlled wholly owned and operated
businesses like the company's newspaper, limousine, and
executive-recruitment subsidiaries. It split off on its own two
months ago and Fidelity Capital's president, Tim Hilton, became the
head of Fidelity Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton declined to talk to us this week. But a review of
Fidelity Ventures materials in print and on the Internet shows that
the company has more than $300 million invested in young companies
and their emerging technologies. Fidelity's portfolio of
investments now includes nearly four-dozen companies.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity ranks as a top 20 player among the 200 or so venture
capital firms in New England, according to PriceWaterhouseCoopers,
the accounting firm that tracks the venture business.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Ventures may not be the biggest player in the venture
field, but unlike many other venture capital firms it is
bankrolling all of its own investments and not raising funds from
outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   The jewel of the Fidelity Ventures portfolio remains the famed
Colt, a European telecommunications success story that went public
in 1996. Fidelity still owns about half of the company, which has a
market value of $9.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Fidelity venture portfolio has a decidedly
high-tech flavor. Most of its money is sunk into software,
telecommunications, or health care businesses.
</P>
<P>
   It has also dabbled in modest-size leveraged buyouts and a few
new interests, including education and employer services. Advantage
Schools Inc. of Boston, the charter-school operator,  &UR; yesterday &LR; 
announced a new $25 million round of venture funding from a pack of
firms including Fidelity Ventures, which was one of the company's
original backers.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond Colt, you won't find many well-known names with
wildly successful initial public stock offerings to their credit in
the Fidelity Ventures portfolio. It is stocked with smaller
ventures with relatively obscure names like PakNetX, Future Tense,
and Verbind.
</P>
<P>
   An exception: GeoTel Communications of Lowell, a Fidelity
venture investment that dates back to 1995. GeoTel, which makes
computer telephony software, went public at 12 in 1996 and traded
above 42  &UR; yesterday &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Executives at other venture firms and the small companies that
seek investment capital say Fidelity can offer a few unique
advantages. Tops on the list: name recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The venture business is an almost unbranded business,'' said
Chris Gabrieli of Bessemer Venture Partners in Wellesley, who has
co-invested with Fidelity in Advantage Schools and several other
deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were to ask even sophisticated investors to name any
venture firm, few would know any. Fidelity has enormous brand
value. Compared to a potentially fine venture firm no one has heard
of, the Fidelity name helps companies more with employees, vendors,
and customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Some technology companies can also get something more than the
usual venture offerings _ money and some management help _ from
Fidelity. They can sometimes land a big customer, or even more
importantly, a high-tech site to test new technology inside an
organization that spends hundreds of millions of dollars on
hardware and software every year.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity has also loaned out a handful of executives from its
huge lineup of technology employees to venture companies in need.
</P>
<P>
   Foundation Technologies of Waltham, a company that develops
Internet software for human resource departments, ran into just
that problem last fall. Fidelity, which was one of the company's
two original venture investors, provided an executive with
specialized Internet skills to step in as the company's active vice
president of engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Foundation chief executive Tod Loofbourrow said his company
selected Fidelity from a field of nearly two dozen interested
venture firms. He said Fidelity was already involved in the
company's field and didn't need a quick payoff to pass through to
other investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very patient capital,'' said Loofbourrow, who hopes
Foundation can go public next year.
</P>
<P>
   Patience aside, there is still the payoff question. Before
Loofbourrow got his money, he had to meet with Fidelity chairman
Edward C. ``Ned'' Johnson III for two hours. For all of his
longterm perspective, Johnson doesn't like to be disappointed.

 &HT;    FINALLY, THE B-2 GOES INTO COMBAT
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-B2-0326.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS

<P>
   B-2 SPIRIT
</P>
<P>
   Overall Mission: The B-2 manned bomber was designed to deliver
both conventional and nuclear bombs over long distances virtually
undetected by radar.
</P>
<P>
   First Combat Mission: The current NATO air campaign against Serb
military targets in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Features: The B-2's stealth characteristics allow it to
penetrate the most sophisticated radar defenses and destroy the
most important targets from high altitudes. This increases its
range and provides a better field of view for the B-2's sensors.
Its range is about 6,000 nautical miles without refueling. The
primary aspects of its ``stealthiness'' are classified, but the
B-2's materials, coatings and wing design all contribute. It also
has a crew of only two pilots.
</P>
<P>
   History: The first B-2 was rolled out for public display on Nov.
22, 1988 at Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale, Calif. Its first flight
was July 17, 1989. Whitman AFB, Mo., is the B-2's only operational
base. The first aircraft, Spirit of Missouri, was delivered Dec.
17, 1993.

HOME VIDEO: DVD UPDATE; WWII CLASSIC DOCUMENTARY; NEW RELEASES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DVD Showing Its Strength
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, signs in store windows summed it up: DVD is
here. After a sputtering start in 1997, more than 2,500 films were
available on the compact digital video disk and more than 1 million
players had been sold. Where do things stand?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been safe growth _ the key word is safe,'' said Martin
Greenwald, president of Image Entertainment, a large distributor of
the disks. Safe is defined in two ways: The public is taking to the
new format in promising numbers, and the studios are not flooding
the market with too many disks.
</P>
<P>
   Suppliers like Greenwald measure success by returns from
retailers, which are low. ``That's the sign of a very healthy
marketplace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry sources say that DVD is adding 80,000 to 90,000
households a month. The format is making particularly large strides
in chains like Tower and West Coast Video, a predominantly East
Coast chain that has a reputation for innovation. Steven Apple, a
vice president, said that 10 percent of West Coast inventory was
DVD, a high figure for such a new line.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers everywhere report keen consumer interest in new and
older films on DVD and an increasingly strong inclination to rent
disks as one would videocassettes. ``Initially, DVD is a sales item
because people want to immediately build a little library when they
buy the player,'' Apple said. ``Now that they have owned the
players for a year in some cases, they're interested in renting as
they would traditionally.''
</P>
<P>
   Heroism Amid the Flak
</P>
<P>
   Before World War II, William Wyler directed films like
``Wuthering Heights'' and ``The Westerner.'' During the conflict,
he jumped on a B-17 called the Memphis Belle and made a documentary
that stirred the country and brought tears to the eyes of Franklin
D. Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   The Belle was flying its 25th and last mission into Germany
before the crew would return to the United States. Wyler crawled
around the aircraft with a hand-held camera recording a
heart-stopping and often strangely beautiful drama, ``The Memphis
Belle,'' that stands up very well today on a tape from Antiquary
Video.
</P>
<P>
   The mission was to bomb naval installations at Wilhelmshaven on
the North Sea. ``The Hun is expecting us,'' rumbles the rhetorical
narration written for the folks at home. Bombers climb to freezing
heights and are strung across clear azure skies. Flak starts
arriving in black puffs and gradually fills the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest part is the flight back to England. German fighters
come from everywhere. A 19-year-old waist gunner blazes away in all
directions. An engine is on fire. At the airfield, ground crews
count the returning planes. Colored flares signal ambulances from
B-17s carrying wounded. ``It's lost its nose,'' the narrator says
of one craft. ``The navigator is dead. The pilot is wounded. The
bombardier is wounded. There are no brakes, no flaps. The hydraulic
system is shot out.''
</P>
<P>
   Not on the Memphis Belle, however, which returns safely. Wyler's
film was reviewed on Page 1 of The New York Times on April 14,
1944.

<P>
   New Releases
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest''
</P>
<P>
   Removed from the eight-story-high Imax theater screen, David
Breashears' and Greg MacGillivray's account of the storied 1996
climb loses visual grandeur but still stands up as an account of a
brutal experience even for those who made it to the summit. Everest
takes everything to extremes. One climber is so badly wracked by
coughing fits that she cracks ribs. With the wind chill at minus
100 degrees, another climber is rendered temporarily blind and
later will have both hands amputated. At 20,000 feet rescue
helicopters lose control because their blades don't have enough air
to bite. Eight people from one party die. Others reach the summit,
however, including the production team who, Lawrence Van Gelder
wrote in The New York Times, shot an ``absorbing film and a story
of hope and hubris.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1995. Miramax. $19.99. 48 minutes. No rating. Release date:
March 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rugrats Movie''
</P>
<P>
   The talking babies of the Nickelodeon series try to get used to
the newborn addition in their midst, Dylan Preston (Dil) Pickles,
but find him unacceptably assertive right off the starting block.
Attempting to turn him back in, the Rugrats hop a ride in a
mattress truck, which crashes and spills them into a forest full of
danger. As in any such woodlands, there's a ravenous wolf, and in
this case a crazy bunch of circus monkeys who make off with Dil.
Given the popularity of the series, it's a movie that had to
happen. ``The pleasant surprise is that the film is a delight''
(Anita Gates).
</P>
<P>
   1998. Paramount. $26.95. 80 minutes. Closed captioned. G.
Release date: March 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home Fries''
</P>
<P>
   Serving as a reminder of how much Hollywood could use some good
screwball comedy, Dean Parisot's film at least reaches for a
bizarre situation. Sally (Drew Barrymore) is a waitress at the
local Burger-Matic and pregnant with the baby of a married man. The
wife of the father-to-be gets his two stepsons to buzz him in a
helicopter in order to scare him into mending his ways. Instead he
dies of fright. Suspecting that Sally can implicate them, one of
the stepsons (Luke Wilson) takes a job at the Burger-Matic and
falls in love with her. Well, the story ``at least has the right
attitude. It just isn't funny enough in its particulars'' (Stephen
Holden).
</P>
<P>
   1998. Warner. $107.37. 93 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13.
Release date: March 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Safe Men''
</P>
<P>
   Two failed singers (Sam Rockwell and Steve Zahn) from
Providence, R.I., are mistaken for a pair of safecrackers (Mark
Ruffalo and Josh Pais) and are conned into grabbing an easy
$300,000 from an old man's safe. But that puts them under the thumb
of a local mob boss (Michael Lerner), which leads to their
participation in other jobs. Unfortunately, nothing grabs the
attention in a film that ``is far longer on dull talk than
inventively comic action'' (Van Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   1998. Universal. $99.36. 94 minutes. Closed captioned. R.
</P>
<P>
   Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a
theater release at one time, appeared on television or been on
videocassette in earlier editions:
</P>
<P>
   ``TERROR 2000.'' Christoph Schlingensief's punk expressionist
fable lampoons neo-Nazism and xenophobia in contemporary Germany.
Looking into the disappearance of a social worker who was escorting
Polish immigrants to a refugee camp, a husband-and-wife detective
team run into one crazy adventure after another. Imagine, Stephen
Holden wrote in The New York Times, a Keystone Kops film ``written
by ``William S. Burroughs, peopled with characters from George
Grosz by way of Russ Meyer and directed in a style that suggests
Jean-Luc Godard on speed.'' 1994. Water Bearer. $29.95. 79 minutes.
German with English subtitles. Release date: March 30. Information:
(800) 551-8304.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE BLACK HOLE.'' It took ``Star Wars'' to launch Gary
Nelson's film about a madman who tries to fly a space ship into a
black hole. Accomplished special effects are the story here. The
cast wasn't too shabby either: Anthony Perkins, Maximilian Schell,
Ernest Borgnine, Roddy McDowall. 1979. Anchor Bay. $14.98. 97
minutes. Release date: March 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``MURDER IN A SMALL TOWN.'' Playing against type, Gene Wilder
makes a charming low-key amateur sleuth named Cash Carter. A
successful theater director, Cash has retreated to Stamford, Conn.,
to try to forget the murder of his wife. This being 1938, he gets
to carry on an old-fashioned romance with his girlfriend (Cherry
Jones) and run a local theater troupe. As for the case, a mean
fellow has been murdered and the police need Cash to solve the
case. A&AMP;E. $19.95. 96 minutes. Closed captioned. No rating. Release
date: March 30.

   MATZO-PRICES _ Once again, you can get a box of matzo for your
Passover celebration for $11.99. Or, you can hop a plane to Jersey
and buy a box for $4.99. But Bob Butterworth, Florida attorney
general, has looked into the matter and blames a variety of other
factors, but not collusion. (Sedore, Palm Beach Post)

   NORRELL _ ATLANTA _ Norrell Corp., the temporary employment
service founded by former gubernatorial candidate Guy Millner, is
sold to Interim Services of Fort Lauderdale for an estimated $553
million in stock. The combined company, with $4 billion in revenue,

   DELTA _ ATLANTA _ The first of 13 custom Boeing 777s from an
order valued at more than $1.4 billion arrives at Delta Friday. For
more than a year, Delta has worked with the manufacturer to develop
the new wide-body flagship, which has been designed exclusively
with the airline's long-haul passengers in mind. Delta Ship7001 is
the first 777 with the BusinessElite cabin with 52 seats for
premium passengers. Not only has Delta introduced the first
intercontinental business class with five feet of space between its
sleeper seats, it has also taken the unusual step of choosing a
two-by-two configuration in the premium cabin of the 777 with no
middle seats. (Thurston, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) TENTATIVE

   DELTA-SELL _ ATLANTA _ Delta sells 119 Pratt &AMP; Whitney
JT8D-15/15A-powered Boeing 727-200s and up to 39 spare engines over
the next six years to a United Technologies unit. The equipment is
being retired from Delta's fleet. This is the largest used aircraft
fleet transaction. (Thurston, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

Duke is competing in the Final Four this weekend considering that
the Blue Devils have been favored to win the national title since
the beginning of the season. However, it was only four seasons ago
that the Duke program was in disarray after Coach Mike Krzyzewski
missed most of the season following back surgery, the team finished
with a losing record and recruiting appeared to be down. But
recruiting efforts over the last four years have landed several
prep All-Americans and the Devils are back in the Final Four for

winning the national title. (Barnhart, Atlanta

the team spent last summer wondering if coach Andy Landers was
leaving to accept a job in the WNBA. Landers declined, returned to
Athens and has led Georgia to its fifth Final Four appearance in

<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ He is the embodiment of today's Russian
army: pale, thin and weak.
</P>
<P>
   Anatoly, know by his nickname ``Tolek,'' has been on the run
from the army for three years. During his short few weeks in the
service, he says, he and other recruits were ill-fed and terrorized
by violent hazing within the ranks, and their rations and uniforms
were stolen by officers looking to sell them and pocket the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid, everyone was afraid, because you didn't know who
to trust,'' he said, explaining why he ran away.
</P>
<P>
   The once-proud army has been demoralized by its painful
experiences in Afghanistan and Chechnya. Since the breakup of the
Soviet Union in 1991, the military has been hobbled by the same
economic and social problems affecting all of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The country's economic crisis last August reduced soldiers to
foraging for potatoes in the fields and begging for change in
subway stations. With the ruble's steep evaluation, a new recruit
earns only about $5 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Defense Ministry estimates about 40,000 deserters
are roaming the country. There are no reliable figures for draft
dodgers, but some 80 percent of the eligible pool of men can obtain
deferments on health grounds or to attend school or family needs.
Inside the army, the suicide rate is high.
</P>
<P>
   As U.S. and NATO warplanes launched strikes this week on Serbia,
Russia ruled out using force to assist its Slavic ally. But there
is little Russia could do, even if it so wished.
</P>
<P>
   Respected military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer, who writes for the
daily Sevodnya, has warned that the current rate of decline in
Russia's ranks leaves the country with a credible nuclear deterrent
with some 6,000 warheads, but vulnerable to attack by a force of
1,000 well-trained guerrillas because of the weakened conventional
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's twice-a-year draft began this month, in which the
government will induct 150,000 new soldiers by the end of May. Many
more who are eligible will be seeking ways to avoid military
service.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of ``mothers' committees'' operate in cities across
Russia seeking to help young men like ``Tolek'' avoid the draft or
leave the army. They sprouted during the war with the breakaway
republic of Chechnya, from 1994-96.
</P>
<P>
   Since the economic squeeze last August, the number of deserters
and draft dodgers has doubled, according to advocacy groups who
work with disaffected soldiers. In a partial amnesty for draft
dodgers last year, some 12,000 young men came out of hiding.
</P>
<P>
   Because of chronic shortages in recent years of supplies and
cuts in training, Russia could fully field only one or two of its
some 70 divisions, analysts say. Airplanes remain in their hangers
for lack of spare parts and fuel. Ships are rusting in port for the
same reason.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to strengthen Russia's army is to reduce its size,
many officials contend. In recent years President Boris Yeltsin has
advocated severe cutbacks in military spending and manpower to
reform a military still bloated from the Soviet era.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a basic problem: Russia cannot afford the size of the
military it maintains,'' said Valentina Meylnikova, leader of the
mothers' committee in Moscow and an outspoken advocate for an
all-volunteer army. ``We cannot allow this to go on. Russian
soldiers are in tattered uniforms and are going hungry. This is not
what life is supposed to be like in a professional army.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia trimmed its forces by 400,000 in 1998 to 1.2 million
troops, down from a high of 2.5 million earlier this decade.
</P>
<P>
   But the reduction is more akin to desperation layoffs and
no-shows than a well-considered restructuring of the force.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechen War was fought with units that had little or no
field training and struggled with shortages of fuel and spare
parts.
</P>
<P>
   An internal study by Russia's general staff and reprinted in the
respected Russian Independent Military Review said the current
force strength must be cut in half, to no more than 600,000 troops.
The country simply cannot afford more, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's stated intention to convert the military to an
all-volunteer force by the spring of 2000 has been delayed ``until
well into the next decade,'' because Russia lacks the will and
coherent plan to carry it out, according to a recent State
Department report.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the decline in military living standards has put the
military ``at the low end of the country's economic scale,'' the
study said.
</P>
<P>
   It's an uneasy policy task: soothing generals outraged by the
plan to pare their forces, holding off opposition political leaders
from Communist and nationalist parties attempting to capitalize on
the dissatisfaction and convincing the public that their
morale-battered army can be improved by cutting it back further.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problem is the world's problem,'' said Alexander Zhilin, a
retired air force colonel and now military analyst for the Moscow
News. ``Russia's military might depends on its strategic nuclear
forces and because of that the more we dismantle our conventional
forces, the more this reliance on nuclear force grows.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Russia places an emphasis on maintaining its aging
nuclear force. Also, selected airborne units and interior ministry
forces in and around Moscow continue to be well supplied and
trained.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, some of its best troops are not in Russia. Those
serving in United Nations peacekeeping roles in the Balkans and
elsewhere, are equipped and financed by the international
community, not cash-poor Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Tolek,'' he hopes to build a case around his medical
history -- underweight and with persistent headaches -- to
demonstrate that he never should have been drafted in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   But the army, he says, is no place, even for an able-bodied man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our army is for building dachas for the generals and digging
useless holes,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   His bitterness aside, independent analysts also question whether
Russia would be able to fight a war if, for instance, the simmering
ethnic troubles on its southern border in the Caucasuses were to
explode.
</P>
<P>
   ``At best, it will take a decade or more to create an efficient
military machine; at worst, the new-found will to tackle the
problems will not survive the difficulties that beset the country
in general and the reform process in particular,'' concluded a
recent report by the respected defense publication, Jane's
Intelligence Review.

CATCHING UP ON SCIENCE EDUCATION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER 
c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Idon't believe how smart I'm getting.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead. Ask me what e(EQ)mc2 means.
</P>
<P>
   Well, c is the speed of light, and this formula reveals how much
energy is released, not only in nuclear explosions, but in any
energy event. Einstein was driven to develop this equation by the
inadequacies of previous theories, and I know what those
shortcomings were because my husband and I are taking a course
called ``Einstein's Relativity and the Quantum Revolution: Modern
Physics for Non-Scientists.''
</P>
<P>
   You have to understand that I needed a private tutor to pass
high school geometry, that I dropped out of high school chemistry
after three classes because I was already lost, and that I passed
high school physics only because a sympathetic teacher coached me
in the areas he ended up asking about on the final exam. I
concluded from this evidence that I was not gifted in science or
math. Not only did I never dream I could understand this stuff, I
couldn't imagine wanting to understand it.
</P>
<P>
   Until I saw a 12-part video series called ``Canticles of the
Cosmos'' as part of a Unitarian-Universalist Church's adult
education program.
</P>
<P>
   The video introduced me to creation spirituality, an approach to
religion in which science is no longer at war with religious dogma.
In exploring the spiritual dimensions of current scientific
knowledge, cosmologist Brian Swimme divined a direction, even a
spiritual meaning, to the unfolding of the universe. As a result, I
began to feel connected to the stars in a new way. If billions of
years of history was one of God's means of revelation, I wanted to
know everything I could about it.
</P>
<P>
   Jack and I began reading Chet Raymo's ``365 Starry Nights,'' a
self-taught, one-concept-a-night handbook on the magic and the
mystery of the universe. Every night before bed, we'd read a page
and then step outside to take a look for ourselves. It was
impossible to do that on a regular basis and not become fascinated
by the world circling overhead. First we saw double stars with our
binoculars. When our kids gave us a telescope for our anniversary,
we got to see the rings of Saturn and the Great Nebula in Orion's
sword. Jack and I began showing up at Harvard's Smithsonian
Observatory, where monthly talks on subjects like black holes and
spiral galaxies are offered to the public free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   Though I understood less than half of what was said, I
understood enough to want to understand more.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, we began attending the Lowell Lecture Series on
astronomy at the Museum of Science, held without charge every
spring. While viewing glorious photos from the Hubbard Telescope, I
listened to speakers who'd actually made the discoveries they were
sharing with us. Soon I was using phrases like ``event horizon''
and ``dark-line spectrum'' with ease. I thought I'd gone just about
as far as I could go, until I stumbled upon the Superstar Teachers
Series in the audio section of our library.
</P>
<P>
   The cassette case describes Middlebury College professor Richard
Wilson as a ``high energy particle,'' and promises that he will
take the listener effortlessly from Copernicus, Newton, and
Einstein to Planck, Heisenberg, and Schroedinger in 12 easy
lectures. Despite the fact that I'd never heard of the last three,
how could I not accept the invitation ``to hold a universe in the
palm of your mind''?
</P>
<P>
   These winter nights, we curl up in bed and listen. My poor
husband, who majored in nuclear physics, struggles to overcome a
head full of obsolete preconceptions while I have no problem at all
imagining speed shrinking and space stretching while the speed of
light races across the sky, constant as, well, constant as the
speed of light.
</P>
<P>
   This is the wonderful part about becoming a lifetime learner, no
matter what topic you choose. You have everything to gain and
nothing to prove. When you're learning for yourself, you decide
when you know enough. You can visit one Web site or read every
available book on the topic. There is no pressure; there are no
tests. You pick your own topic and set your own schedule. Free to
skip over the parts that don't interest you, free to quit in the
middle without losing face, free, on tape at least, to go over the
material as many times as it takes, you can tackle those subjects
you've been afraid of all your life.
</P>
<P>
   You also get to measure your own success. And at the end, you
receive the most prestigious degree there is, in my book, at least.
</P>
<P>
   An immeasurable Degree of Satisfaction.

NEW ON DVD: THE DUKE, BRUNO AND MUSICALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The sales of DVD players continued on a brisk pace
after Christmas with 102,000 sold in January, five times the number
sold last year at the same time. This corresponds with dropping
sticker prices. Low-end models are selling for about $300, while
the average player sold for $422 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   So, to keep feeding these new machines, studios have been
rolling out truckloads of DVD titles. Here's a look at some of the
more interesting ones that have hit stores in the last month. Most
of them include a number of options _ such as wide-screen formats
and interactive menus _ not available on videotape.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start with the tough guys first. This week, Artisan
released the John Wayne video collection, including three of the
Duke's best on DVD _ ``The Quiet Man (1952),'' ``Rio Grande''
(1950) and ``The Sands of Iwo Jima'' (1949).
</P>
<P>
   ``Quiet'' and ``Rio Grande'' are two films by legendary director
John Ford; in both, Wayne's leading lady is Maureen O'Hara. Ford,
known for his westerns, returned to his Irish roots for ``Quiet,''
a romantic comedy about an American prizefighter and a
strong-willed woman. Filled with blarney, it nevertheless is Ford
and Wayne's most charming film. The DVD includes a featurette on
the making of the film hosted by Leonard Maltin. In ``Rio Grande,''
Wayne and O'Hara battle each other and the Apaches. That film,
along with ``Fort Apache'' and ``She Wore a Yellow Ribbon''
(neither is available in this set) make up Ford's excellent Cavalry
trilogy. ``Iwo Jima,'' directed by Alan Dwan, features one of
Wayne's best performances. He plays tough Sgt. John Stryker, a
battle-hardened Marine who has to train and take a bunch of
recruits into action. Wayne got an Oscar nomination. He didn't win
but eventually bagged a statuette for ``True Grit (1969).''
</P>
<P>
   One tough guy who hasn't muscled his way into an Oscar nod yet
is Bruce Willis. But fans who think he deserves one can take their
frustrations out by watching the ``Die Hard'' trilogy, which was
released by Fox Home Entertainment earlier this month. Actually,
this trio of films is among some of the better action films of the
last decade, and Willis' sarcastic demeanor helps keep the films
lively, even more so than the explosions. The first and third
movies also benefit from having terrific villains _ Alan Rickman in
the original, and Jeremy Irons. The triple pack lists for $79.98 or
$29.98 each.
</P>
<P>
   If your taste runs more to dynamite song-and-dance numbers,
there are a number of new classic releases on the market. The 1962
release ``The Music Man'' (Warner; $24.98), starring Robert Preston
and Shirley Jones, is a corny treat. Led by ``76 Trombones,'' the
score also includes ``Till There Was You,'' a song even covered by
the Beatles. The DVD has a documentary hosted by Jones about the
film.
</P>
<P>
   Jones also co-stars with Gordon MacRae in two of the Rodgers and
Hammerstein musicals released on video by Fox Home Entertainment _
``Carousel'' (1956) and ``Oklahoma!'' (1955). The others are ``The
King and I'' (1956), starring Yul Brynner and Deborah Kerr; ``State
Fair'' (1945) with Dick Haymes and Jeanne Crain; and ``South
Pacific'' (1958) with Mitzi Gaynor and Rossano Brazzi.
</P>
<P>
   The films, which are digitally remastered and THX certified, are
out on VHS but will be released on DVD on April 27. Considering the
added quality and extras you get, it might be worth the wait. The
videos list at $14.98 for pan and scan, $19.98 wide-screen, and the
DVDs are expected to go for $24.98 each.
</P>
<P>
   While all of them were great successes on stage, their film
translations didn't always capture their essences. Still, there are
just so many wonderful Rodgers and Hammerstein songs that any lover
of musicals probably will be willing to forgive any of the films'
weaknesses. &QL;

LIKE IT OR NOT, `EDTV' IS STILL NO `TRUMAN SHOW' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The publicity blitz for Ron Howard's new comedy, ``EDtv,'' is
making a larger-than-usual amount of noise about the fact that the
film is actually a remake of an ``obscure'' French-Canadian film
called ``Louis XIX: King of the Airwaves.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, when the same studio, Universal, and same director
remade the 1927 MGM film ``The Fire Brigade'' as 1991's
``Backdraft,'' they didn't feel any need to mention it all, and
conveniently left the fact out of the credits and publicity.
</P>
<P>
   But since their new film is the story of a handsome young man
who becomes the rage of the nation as the hero of a reality
television show, they're understandably a little paranoid. Clearly,
they don't want people to think they're ripping off ``The Truman
Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one is likely to be fooled. The film seems to be a lot
closer to the high points of ``Truman'' than it is to my memory of
``Louis'' _ which may be obscure, but still managed to score a slot
at the 1994 Seattle International Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   The Ed of the title is a charming 31-year-old San Francisco
video store clerk (Matthew McConaughey) picked by the True-TV
network to have his unscripted, unrehearsed life put on 24-hour
display to satisfy America's voyeuristic curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   In no time, America falls in love with Ed; his various romances
become a national obsession, and his family and friends all become
media celebrities. Gradually, however, the loss of privacy gets
oppressive. And, as you might expect, Ed's life goes all to heck.
</P>
<P>
   The movie gets by mostly on the laid-back, good-ole-boy, Texas
charm of Matthew McConaughey. Never very convincing as cerebral
types (as in ``Contact,'' ``Amistad'' or ``A Time to Kill''), he's
at his best playing dim-witted slackers (as in ``Dazed and
Confused,'' ``The Newton Boys'' and here.)
</P>
<P>
   It also scores when it stops trying to be hilarious for a moment
to show us the unique corruption of fame, and the agony of what
it's like to be famous and not rich _ to have a face that's
instantly recognizable while not having the protection that only
money can buy.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the action is grindingly familiar, and it's only
so-so as a comedy: overloaded with hundreds of reaction shots of
anonymous people oogling the show; too many bits with Howard's
brother, Clint (a dead-time fixture of every Ron Howard movie); and
too many low-humor gags about private body parts.
</P>
<P>
   Thematically and structurally, it's so similar to ``The Truman
Show'' that it's impossible not to compare them, and ``EDtv'' loses
out. ``Truman'' actually made us believe its outlandish premise to
the point where we gave a considerable emotional investment to its
characters. ``ED'' never does. It is amusing, but finally tiresome
and then instantly forgettable.
</P>
<P>
   EDTV. Directed by Ron Howard. Screenplay by Lowell Ganz &AMP;
Babaloo Mandel. Cast: Matthew McConaughey, Jenna Elfman, Woody
Harrelson, Ellen DeGeneres, Martin Landau, Rob Reiner, Dennis
Hopper. Universal. 123 minutes. Rated PG-13 for some bad-taste
humor.

SPORTS COLUMN: BILL FRANCE STILL PULLS THE STRINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Bill France, it's a matter of taking a small step back so he
can move NASCAR a giant step forward.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to this year's Daytona 500, France took himself out of the
day-to-day operation of NASCAR, the governing body of stock car
racing, naming Mike Helton to run the show.
</P>
<P>
   But France remains very much involved in stock car racing's
future as NASCAR's president, and there is no doubt who has final
say.
</P>
<P>
   Based on recent happenings, it appears that NASCAR is on the
verge of unprecedented expansion once 2000 arrives.
</P>
<P>
   First, NASCAR announced it will now negotiate all TV deals for
the Winston Cup, Busch and Craftsman Truck series.
</P>
<P>
   At present, individual tracks negotiate their own TV contracts,
so NASCAR won't be heavily involved until after 2000, when most
current contracts expire.
</P>
<P>
   But with NASCAR dictating terms and playing the various networks
against each other for different packages, rights fees are expected
to skyrocket.
</P>
<P>
   Financial analysts are saying that NASCAR could pull in anywhere
from $300 million to $400 million for the Winston Cup series alone.
</P>
<P>
   To justify that kind of money, NASCAR is going to have to create
a demand for stock car racing in the country's major markets.
</P>
<P>
   By 2002 or 2003, France or business interests closely allied to
the France family will have tracks in operation in all key markets.
</P>
<P>
   France recently entered into an agreement with Donald Trump to
build a track outside New York.
</P>
<P>
   He and Tony George, who owns the Indianapolis Motor Speedway,
are proceeding with plans to build an oval outside Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   And France owns 12 percent of Roger Penske's operation, which
already has tracks running near Los Angeles and Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, France is building a track outside Kansas City,
Mo., which could be open by the end of next year, and he controls a
facility in Homestead, Fla., which will host its first Winston Cup
event this season.
</P>
<P>
   France also owns tracks in Daytona, Fla.; Talladega, Ala.;
Darlington, S.C.; Phoenix, Ariz.; and Watkins Glen, N.Y., all stops
on the Winston tour, while Penske owns Rockingham, N.C. George has
Indy.
</P>
<P>
   What all this means is that by the time France gets ready to
negotiate his TV deal, he should be able to deliver an audience in
most major markets throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   And he has also eliminated the possibility of a split in stock
car racing by outflanking his only potential rival, Bruton Smith,
who simply doesn't have enough tracks now to fight France. Smith
owns tracks in Charlotte, N.C.; Atlanta; Dallas-Fort Worth;
Bristol, Tenn.; and Sears Point, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   So while France may not be as visible as he once was, he still
pulls the strings. And anybody who doesn't think so is likely to
get a good, hard yank.

`HEAVEN OF HEAVEN' REVISITED 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In 1978 Terrence Malick, who had once worked as a
wheat harvester, made a rapturously beautiful film well remembered
for its golden fields and sublime magic-hour light. But ``Days of
Heaven,'' now opening for a two-week revival at the Film Forum,
looks different today.
</P>
<P>
   Its thematic and stylistic resemblances to ``The Thin Red Line''
are striking, and hindsight casts much of it in a nostalgic glow.
This film is nominally about a pastoral idyll in an all-too-fragile
paradise, but now it brings to mind another kind of heaven: the era
when films this eccentric, daring and original were not unexpected,
and not the flukes they would be today.
</P>
<P>
   The casting alone is enough to make ``Days of Heaven'' a special
curiosity. In his first film role, Sam Shepard broods
charismatically as a rich, lonely farmer whose fate becomes
intertwined with those of three migrant workers from Chicago. And
as one of those workers, the pre-``American Gigolo'' Richard Gere
cuts an incongruously alluring figure, bristling with sexual energy
and managing to do his farm work in well-tailored black.
</P>
<P>
   Gere's Bill poses as the brother of Abby, the fetching prairie
goddess who is played by Brooke Adams, though in fact they are
lovers. Their little quasi-family is completed by teen-age Linda
Manz, with her feisty New York accent and angelic look.
</P>
<P>
   Malick sentimentalizes these laborers in ways that would seem
naive if the film's visual sophistication were not so phenomenal.
And he uses Ms. Manz's unforgettable voice-over narration to fill
gaps among characters not given to small talk. Dialogue here seems
deliberately stiff and spare.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Days of Heaven'' creates a rivalry between Bill and the
farmer for Abby's attentions, it works in ways very similar to
those of ``The Thin Red Line.'' Here too is the sense of a
pristine, exquisitely sensitive Eden that falls victim to mankind's
darker passions. (``Nobody's perfect,'' Ms. Manz intones. ``There
was never a perfect person around. You just got half Devil and half
angel in you.'')
</P>
<P>
   And here is the same peculiar verbal naivete offset by
astonishing visual poetry. From the foreboding that accompanies the
workers' arrival to one of the most Biblical-looking calamities
ever captured on film, ``Days of Heaven'' (shot by both Nestor
Almendros and Haskell Wexler, scored by Ennio Morricone, and
featuring Jack Fisk's inspired art direction) is as haunting as its
vision of a crystal glass dropped into moonlit water. It lives up
to its title.

`DOUG'S FIRST MOVIE': IN WHICH HERMAN MELVILLE, A BLUE MONSTER,
WEARS WIG 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Children who go to see ``Doug's First Movie'' will come home
knowing the name Herman Melville. Of course they will know it only
as the name of the gentle, soulful-eyed blue monster from Lucky
Duck Lake, but that's better than nothing. (The monster gets the
name because while visiting a human family's house it tries to eat
``Moby-Dick.'' In hardcover.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Doug's First Movie,'' based on the ABC Saturday morning series
now known as ``Disney's Doug'' (on Nickelodeon, it was just
``Doug''), is not inspired children's entertainment, but it has a
certain charm. Actually the animated world inhabited by Doug
Funnie, a likable 12{-year-old with a flat head and pin-dot eyes,
is more appealing in still photographs than in much of the film.
</P>
<P>
   Doug lives in Bluffington, which is pretty much owned by Bill
Bluff, the owner of Bluffco Industries and the richest man in town
(in the tradition of Potter in ``It's a Wonderful Life''). The most
popular hangouts for young people are Swirly's, for hamburgers and
ice cream, and Funkytown, an amusement park stuck in the '70s. In
this world, dogs _ at least Doug's dog, Porkchop _ play the piano.
</P>
<P>
   The plot involves Doug's discovery of the Lucky Duck Lake
monster, which turns out to have the personality of E.T. Doug and
his best friend, Skeeter, try to protect the monster (which hides
out at Doug's house, often under the bed, where monsters are meant
to live) while exposing Bluffco's criminal pollution of the lake.
At one point, this involves plopping a blond wig on Herman and
passing him off as an exchange student named Hermione.
</P>
<P>
   In a romantic subplot, Doug tries to win the heart of his
longtime pal Patti Mayonnaise. The town's bad boys are busy
building a robot called Robocrusher, which inexplicably turns into
a British nanny. And everything comes together at the big
Valentine's Day dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doug's First Movie'' is the voice of good advice. ``It's
important to do the right thing,'' Doug says at the end, no matter
what other people think. To the credit of the screenwriter, Ken
Scarborough, the film sometimes makes fun of its own guidance:
``Violence is only for those who have run out of good ideas,'' Doug
announces during a fantasy in which he's a superhero. After which a
monster, a bad one, promptly swallows him.
</P>
<P>
   There are also some nice visual images, including a crowd of
reporters in identical beige raincoats, brown fedoras and black
sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   You couldn't call Bluffington multiracial, but the characters do
have a variety of skin colors. Doug is beigey-pink, Skeeter is sort
of aqua, Patti is light brown and Roger (the leader of the bad
boys) is green. Let's hope Jerry Falwell's people don't see this
film; several characters' faces and the entire Beebe Bluff School
building are lavender. &QL;

 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    When I was a girl, Christmas far eclipsed Easter as my favorite
holiday.
 &HT;    Anticipation gripped me for weeks as I awaited Santa's visit and
all those presents.
 &HT;    Easter paled by comparison. Although my parents bought me a new
dress and spring coat, the Easter Bunny and his basket of candy
appeared Scrooge-like compared to Santa.
 &HT;    Then there was church. At Christmas, the baby Jesus, his
beautiful mother, the angels, shepherds and wise men entranced me.
Christmas' simplicity spoke to my childhood world.
 &HT;    But Easter? It made no sense. Although the baby grew up and
helped some people, others got so angry with him that they killed
him. God didn't like this, so he raised him from the dead.
 &HT;    Apparently, Easter doesn't make sense to many Americans.
Although 66 percent of us attend church on Easter Sunday, fully 20
percent admit to not understanding Easter's message.
 &HT;    The holiest day for Christians, Easter is about grown-up faith.
Jesus Christ, loving and sinless, suffers and dies at the hands of
fearful people. To prove the power of love, God raises Jesus from
the grave.
 &HT;    Easter's message startles: Christ has died. Christ has risen.
Death and resurrection.
 &HT;    Grown-up faith? Yes. Believing in a virgin birth, a cute baby,
and angelic hosts is easy stuff in comparison. But new life out of
death?
 &HT;    Mature faith gazes into the mystery of suffering and
resurrection. Only from life's unwanted pain and darkness can new
insight, wisdom and unconditional love arise.
 &HT;    Fifteen years ago, a friend suffered a terrible car accident.
Wrapped around a tree, his Volkswagen encased his twisted form
until paramedics cut him loose and rushed him to the hospital.
 &HT;    Amazed that he lived, the doctors said he would never regain
consciousness. Poised between life and death, he slept in a coma.
We anointed him with oil and prayed.
 &HT;    Unbelievably, he recovered _ even to the point of graduating
from college. As a result of his experience, he became a nurse who
treated those dying from AIDS.
 &HT;    For him, suffering brought forth compassion and service.
 &HT;    A few years ago, he died of AIDS. In the midst of his own pain,
he worked to heal others. No miraculous recovery this time. He
suffered only to suffer again.
 &HT;    Trying to come to terms with his death, I realized existence
moves from one death to another. Without the hope of new life, the
human story is little more than senseless tragedy.
 &HT;    But Easter insists upon _ indeed, Easter shouts _ triumph over
an endless cycle of suffering.
 &HT;    Hanging on the cross, Jesus suffered. In his pain, he cried out,
``Father, forgive them. They know not what they do.''
 &HT;    Breathing his last, he sighed, ``It is finished.'' Then he died.
 &HT;    Finished. Death is the ultimate end. As I grew up and began to
understand death, I reeled under its terror. Eternal nothingness.
It is finished.
 &HT;    The heart of the Easter story lies in Jesus' suffering. Good
Friday and Easter Sunday embrace in joyful triumph as the cross
leads to the empty tomb. Resurrection overcomes death.
 &HT;    Little children, charming in their Easter finery, chase each
other around the churchyard and hunt for colored eggs. They enjoy
Easter, but they don't grasp its power because, for the most part,
they haven't suffered.
 &HT;    Adults often do everything possible to escape pain and
suffering. But not until we grow up and face ``it is finished,''
can Easter have any meaning.
 &HT;    For Jesus it wasn't finished. After three days, God overcame the
horrifying injustice of the cross and raised him from the dead.
 &HT;    This fundamental theological insight _ that suffering brings
forth new life _ is adult faith. Although hard to believe, once it
is embraced, we find true freedom.
 &HT;    As the old hymn reminds us, ``He is risen! Death is conquered,
we are free!''

 `JUDY BERLIN': LOVE IN A SUBURB OF THE '50s  
 (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Much of ``Judy Berlin,'' Eric Mendelsohn's
evocatively eerie meditation on modern suburbia, takes place during
what may be the longest solar eclipse known to movies. That solar
event in the middle of a sleepy late September afternoon draws the
lonely, withdrawn inhabitants of a middle-class Long Island town
out of their immaculate houses to wander through the deserted
streets like zombies stirring to life after a long, silent sleep.
</P>
<P>
   As they encounter one another in an apocalyptic gloom, in which
the street lights seem to cast a nuclear glow, they tentatively
reach out to reconnect with one another in ways they haven't done
in years.
</P>
<P>
   The first feature film of Mendelsohn, a former costume design
assistant to Woody Allen, ``Judy Berlin'' is set in Babylon on Long
Island, but it feels more like that eternal television limbo of
dark shadows and anxious faces, ``The Twilight Zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Suburban alienation and boredom may have been done to death by
movies and by ``The Twilight Zone'' itself, many of whose episodes
were saturated in suburban angst. But Mendelsohn's fusion of
science fiction and Chekhovian melancholy finds a fresh perspective
on a familiar theme.
</P>
<P>
   The black-and-white cinematography helps give this contemporary
story a timeless aura. Like ``Pleasantville,'' which ``Judy
Berlin'' sometimes resembles, the movie has the stifling ethos of
an eternally rerunning 1950s sitcom whose characters are either
tranquilized or sleepwalking.
</P>
<P>
   The movie feels especially '50s when it goes indoors and the
camera lingers over furniture, kitchen appliances and cabinets full
of neatly arranged bric-a-brac.
</P>
<P>
   It is the filmmaker's subtly drawn characters that keep ``Judy
Berlin'' from becoming mired in suburban-angst cliches. Madeline
Kahn and Bob Dishy are Alice and Arthur Gold, a compulsively talky
housewife and her taciturn husband, an elementary school principal
who exudes a deep unspoken disappointment and fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   The couple have a 30-year-old son, David (Aaron Harnick), an
aspiring filmmaker recently returned from Los Angeles who wanders
around the house in a state of agitated depression, fighting back
tears.
</P>
<P>
   The movie crosscuts among members of the Gold household, their
neighbors and the school where Arthur presides as principal. The
fall term has just begun, and Sue Berlin (Barbara Barrie), an
excessively polite and buttoned-up teacher, is instructing the
pupils on how to view the imminent solar eclipse without hurting
their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of her demonstration a retired teacher, Dolores
Engler (Bette Henritze), with Alzheimer's disease, wanders into the
classroom and momentarily commands the children's attention. The
clash of authority, in which Arthur intercedes, leaves Sue in
tears. As Arthur comforts her, their unexpressed romantic feelings
well up unexpectedly.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to Sue's unhappiness is the imminent departure of her
spunky daughter Judy (Edie Falco), an aspiring actress who has been
working in period costume as a milkmaid in a historical village,
for Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's wittiest scene follows a group of tourists around
this make-believe 1857 farm as a guide explains in wooden tones the
grueling rituals of mid-19th-century agricultural life on Long
Island. The comparison between then and now is tacit. Life may not
be as hard today, but it is just as boring.
</P>
<P>
   Judy, whom Ms. Falco plays with a winning verve, is the only
live wire in this heap of downed power lines. Garrulous and
optimistic, she is about to undertake the same journey westward
that David made. And when the two, who were high school classmates,
run into each other on the street you can feel the attraction of
opposites. Her optimism rushes to fill his despair, while his gloom
tugs her down to earth.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the dramatic tension of a movie that at times moves too
slowly derives from a sense that the filmmaker is biting his tongue
to keep from turning these people into biting satirical
caricatures.
</P>
<P>
   At first Ms. Kahn's Alice seems like the kind of insufferable
yammerer who would drive anyone mad. But as the movie goes along
her inane chatter seems more like a desperate psychic survival
tool. And at a moment when she fears she has lost her husband, she
shows a flash of insight. ``I ground him down,'' she observes
bluntly.
</P>
<P>
   Dishy gives the film's deepest performance as a man so weary and
long-suffering that all his dialogue comes in carefully measured
murmurs. ``Judy Berlin'' is the rare movie in which the pauses,
silences and things that remain unsaid by the characters are as
eloquent as anything that comes out of their mouths.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Judy Berlin,'' which New Directors/New Films is showing at
the Museum of Modern Art Friday evening at 6 and 6:30 and Saturday
afternoon at 3:30, is an impressive exercise in cinematic mood, it
is a very small movie whose narrow, claustrophobic vision
concentrates on only a single aspect of suburban life. The film
would become tedious if it lasted even a minute longer. &QL;

`A WALK ON THE MOON': A GIANT LEAP FOR A NEW YORK HOUSEWIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``A Walk on the Moon'' is as seductive as the handsome,
itinerant hippie who turns its heroine's life upside down. In this
nostalgic, beautifully acted tale of romance and responsibility,
that heroine is a housewife who could not be at a more dangerous
time and place for maintaining the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   As she has every summer, Pearl Kantrowitz (Diane Lane) totes her
ironing board, dish drainer, children and mother-in-law to a Jewish
holiday camp in the Catskills to vacation all summer while her
husband Marty (Liev Schreiber) stays in New York City repairing
television sets. It's a peaceful but dull existence, and that's the
way it is supposed to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Knowingly directed by the actor Tony Goldwyn, ``A Walk on the
Moon'' is about something different in the air. The year is 1969,
the event of the title is about to happen and the camp is near the
site where Woodstock will soon explode.
</P>
<P>
   That might seem like a much too convenient coincidence if the
screenwriter, Pamela Gray, had not been there to see the local
kosher butcher shop rename itself the Funky Chicken in honor of
hippies in the neighborhood and seismic currents too powerful to
ignore. In any case, the film lets this situation yield a steamy,
enveloping romance, a family crisis and the fallout that crisis has
to bring.
</P>
<P>
   Originally called ``The Blouse Man'' in honor of its
traffic-stopping title character, ``A Walk on the Moon'' has its
elements of attractive fantasy. The blouse man is one of the
peddlers who visit the camp to sell their wares, and it took Ms.
Gray many rewrites to turn him into an object of desire. However,
as played with silky eroticism by Viggo Mortensen, the gentlemanly
Walker Jerome arrives to charm the camp's old ladies and weaken
Pearl's knees.
</P>
<P>
   It took just as many rewrites to make the straight-arrow Marty
equally appealing in his own way, but the film succeeds in doing
that too.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lane movingly captures the dilemma of a woman married at 17
and yearning for freedom just as her own daughter (Anna Pacquin,
utterly persuasive as a turbulent American adolescent) feels very
much the same. And in a film that, as Goldwyn said when it was
shown at the Sundance Film Festival, means to mirror changes that
shook the nation during that era, ``A Walk on the Moon'' lets Pearl
follow through on her yearnings.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of the moonwalk, Pearl embarks on her own dangerous
adventure into terra incognita, which the film renders with a
tenderness virtually unknown on screen these days. The mood is set
by a soundtrack of sweet, liberating music, mostly album tracks or
cover versions rather than familiar hits, from the artists (Joni
Mitchell, the Jefferson Airplane, Jesse Colin Young, the Grateful
Dead, Bob Dylan) whose voices defined the times.
</P>
<P>
   With a little too much meddlesome wisdom from Grandma (Tovah
Feldshuh), the film leaves Pearl with a sexual Sophie's Choice and
at last gives Schreiber's character his due. In a film with Dustin
Hoffman as one of its producers, Schreiber makes Marty the kind of
touching, insistent presence that Hoffman has himself often played,
and does full justice to the ``What next?'' questions raised by the
Blouse Man's magnetic pull.
</P>
<P>
   The film's final image is among those that could be dismissed as
preposterous for anyone so inclined. Sternly analytical viewers
need not apply. However, ``A Walk on the Moon,'' with its evocative
Catskills aura and warmly attractive look (with cinematography by
Anthony Richmond), is more likely to quell such objects than to
raise them.
</P>
<P>
   Even when it turns turbulent, the film sustains its warm summer
glow, and makes itself a conversation piece about the moral issues
it means to raise. &QL;

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: Scientist's cure for hot summers: Paint it white
 &HT;    The American Physical Society's 100th annual meeting
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A partial solution to the summertime ``urban heat
island'' that plagues Atlanta and other big cities might be to use
lighter-colored materials in buildings and paving.
</P>
<P>
   The urban heat and discomfort ``can be relieved by as much as 4
degrees Fahrenheit if everyone installed whiter materials during
new construction and resurfacings,'' said researcher Melvin
Pomerantz of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recommend that engineering and building standards adopt
cooler materials,'' he said in Atlanta at the 100th-anniversary
meeting of the American Physical Society.
</P>
<P>
   Pomerantz said it is ``well-documented'' that major cities are
warmer than their rural surroundings, an effect known as urban heat
islands. Researchers with the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration and the University of Georgia have found that the
city of Atlanta can have temperatures up to 10 degrees Fahrenheit
above surrounding areas, disrupting weather patterns and causing
thunderstorms south of the city.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, the loss of trees is a major reason for the urban
heat island. But, as in other cities, the causes also include the
use of dark-colored materials for roofs and pavement, which absorb
sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Dark materials ``can become very hot, more than 70 degrees above
the air temperature,'' Pomerantz said. The hot surfaces then heat
the air, which increases demand for air conditioning and can cause
smog to form.
</P>
<P>
   Whiter surfaces reflect sunlight, causing surfaces to stay
cooler. Pomerantz and his colleagues estimate that if all possible
surfaces nationwide were cooler, the energy and smog savings would
be about $10 billion per year. Cooler surfaces in Chicago might
have prevented many of the 700 heat-related deaths of mostly
elderly people in that city during a heat wave in the summer of
1995, Pomerantz said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers with NASA's Global Hydrology and Climate Center in
Huntsville, Ala., are working with several groups in Georgia to
help roofers, builders, paving contractors and others learn about
the benefits of using lighter materials.
</P>
<P>
   In another report at the APS meeting Thursday, Princeton
University physicist Freeman Dyson said that many of the climate
models used to make long-range weather forecasts are unreliable
because they still use ``fudge factors'' rather than physics to
represent important things such as evaporation, clouds and
rainfall.
</P>
<P>
   One major shortcoming, Dyson said, is that the climatic models
do not predict the existence of the phenomena known as El Nino.
``Since El Nino is a major feature of the observed climate, any
model that fails to predict it is clearly deficient,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does not mean that climate models are worthless; they are
not yet adequate tools for predicting climate.''

`AMONG GIANTS':THE UNEXPECTED CHARMS OF A CRAGGY KIND OF GUY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The free-spirited daredevils who cavort through ``Among Giants''
are about as close to American cowboys as you are likely to find in
a British film set in contemporary England. Rugged rock climbers
from the working class, they earn their living taking risky
free-lance work painting the electrical towers connecting power
lines over hundreds of miles of English landscape.
</P>
<P>
   In their spare time, these paint-smeared wretches hang out in
pubs where the musical fare is American country. While working as a
team at dizzying elevations, smacking paint against the girders of
power stations looming over the moors around Sheffield, they join
voices to sing American pop songs like ``Stand by Me.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence that these offbeat characters should have
the same hardy spirit as the unemployed miners in ``The Full
Monty.'' Both ``Among Giants'' and ``The Full Monty'' share the
same screenwriter, Simon Beaufoy. Like ``The Full Monty,'' ``Among
Giants'' goes out of its way to celebrate the earthy sexual
magnetism of good old blokes with craggy faces, some of whom are on
the far side of 40.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, the movie's weather-beaten central character, is played by
that wonderful British character actor Pete Postlethwaite, who
brings a characteristically gruff, low-keyed authority to his first
screen role as a romantic lead. Playing opposite him is Rachel
Griffiths, who makes an impressive turnabout from her portrayal of
Jacqueline du Pre's sweetly self-sacrificing older sister in
``Hilary and Jackie.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, she is Gerry, a wiry, curt, backpacking mountaineer from
Australia who is drifting around England pursuing outdoor adventure
and trying to avoid romantic entanglements. If Postlethwaite and
Ms. Griffiths don't exactly ignite the screen with white heat,
together they strike enough sparks to make you believe in an
attraction whose intensity catches them both by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Ray and Gerry meet while she is hitchhiking around looking for
cliffs to scale, and she impulsively asks to join Ray's crew,
becoming its only female member. The love that develops between her
and Ray, who is divorced with two children and a bitter ex-wife, is
something that sneaks up on them. That bond has a lot to do with
their being fellow adventurers who share a fear of commitment.
</P>
<P>
   The film's boldest scene follows Ray and Gerry as they frolic
naked in the cascading waters of a nuclear power plant. And the
sight of a middle-aged actor's less than model-perfect body
un-self-consciously exhibited in this scene of romantic horseplay
strikes a small but welcome blow for movie realism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among Giants,'' directed by Sam Miller, is essentially a group
portrait of working class Englishmen, their life style and their
love-hate relationship with a profession that's both dangerous and
financially insecure.
</P>
<P>
   That profession's cowboy mystique is embodied by Ray's much
younger best friend and roommate, Steve (James Thornton), a hothead
and womanizer of considerable charm who views Gerry with a mixture
of suspicion and suppressed desire. Thornton's performance gives
the movie a necessary Woody Harrelsonesque shot of adrenaline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among Giants,'' which opens Friday in Manhattan, is breezily
entertaining, but fairly predictable. Until close to the end, it
successfully avoids the sort of aerial daredevil suspense that a
Hollywood version of the same story would have insisted on throwing
in within the first 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, however, it succumbs to melodrama in several
tying-things-together scenes that feel rushed and halfhearted.
Fortunately, that loss of balance comes late enough not to ruin the
rest of the movie. &QL;

`THE STICKY FINGERS OF TIME': COOL, CHIC AND TRAVELING THROUGH
TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not every time traveler is a wide-eyed innocent (Michael J. Fox
in ``Back to the Future,'' Kathleen Turner in ``Peggy Sue Got
Married,'' Malcolm McDowell in ``Time After Time''), mouth agape at
the wonders on every corner. Some, like Tucker Harding in ``The
Sticky Fingers of Time,'' take the experience in stride.
</P>
<P>
   One morning in 1953, Tucker (Terumi Matthews, best known for
having played Madonna in two television movies), a New York writer
whose real name is Violet, gets up from her typewriter, kisses her
girlfriend goodbye, goes out to buy coffee and finds herself
transported to 1997. At a bar that evening, she runs into a woman
who has bought her novel from a secondhand book bin, but kept only
the cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too bad,'' says Tucker, taking a long, slow drag on her
cigarette. ``You could have helped me with the ending. I just
started writing it this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew, an East Village type, is skeptical. ``This book is 40
years old,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker explains, ``It's been a long day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sticky Fingers of Time,'' written and directed by Hilary
Brougher and made for a reported $250,000, works, in its
deliberately low-key way. It is probably the first film to combine
the time-travel genre with an A-bomb-mutation plot (which in 1950s
horror movies resulted in giant ants and giant crabs) and lesbian
chic.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker travels through time because she viewed an atom-bomb test
(she was writing a lucrative magazine article about it) and the
fallout upset her ``code'' (which, as her friend Isaac explains, is
to the soul as DNA is to the body). There are a number of ``time
freaks'' like her, says Isaac (James Urbaniak), who is one himself
and manages to look hip and perfectly at home in both periods, a
fashion and attitude blend of Robert Oppenheimer and David Byrne.
In fact, some time freaks are dangerous, like the ones who attack
Drew's girlfriend, Gorge (Samantha Buck), in the dentist's chair.
Isaac has brought Tucker to the 1990s to help her escape whoever
was about to murder her in the 1950s, but things don't work out
exactly as he planned.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the plot of ``Sticky Fingers,'' which opens Friday at
the Screening Room, becomes a little too existential for comfort,
and the villains seem too much like self-consciously odd
performance artists. But overall this is a satisfying film,
offering the true joy of time travel: the opportunity for a fresh
look at our culture, our moment in time. The humor works, and
Teresa Mastropierro, the production designer, deserves a round of
applause for the great period detail.

DRAGGING DOWN THE SUPREME COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Of the three branches of government, only the
Supreme Court retains the institutional respect that used to be
automatic but now barely exists for the White House and Congress in
the wake of the nasty impeachment charade.
</P>
<P>
   Few voters are looking any more for principled leadership from
the disgraced, pragmatic president or the narrow-minded,
sermonizing conservatives who dominate Congress. But the nine
black-robed justices are still considered pillars of legal
integrity, influenced by philosophical outlook but essentially
reliable guardians of the Constitution and the law.
</P>
<P>
   The high bench is in grave danger, however, of toppling into the
partisan cesspool that infects the rest of official Washington.
Many politicians are determined to bring the judicial branch down
to their own low standards, undercutting the grand democratic
concepts of separation of powers and judicial independence.
</P>
<P>
   If we can't trust the Supreme Court to do the right thing simply
because it's the right thing, whom can we trust? If the court
develops a reputation for doing the political thing because it's
the political thing, this republic is in deep trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The high bench is not immune to political tides, shifting to the
right or left as presidents appoint justices in tune with their own
philosophy to replace those named by prior presidents with rival
ideologies. But philosophical approach is one thing. Putting on
that black robe with the specific goal of overturning a prior court
decision is quite another.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion is at the center of this. Antiabortion activists are
demanding that the Republican presidential candidates swear they
will put forward for the Supreme Court only those nominees who
pledge to overturn Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 decision that legalized
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The inflexible specificity of this demand is a frontal assault
on our constitutional system. It would transform the high court
into a totally political rather than primarily judicial body. It
would trivialize and degrade the solemnity of a legal process that
must be legitimate if it is to be obeyed.
</P>
<P>
   Only once before has a president named Supreme Court justices
with the openly acknowledged task of overturning a previous court
decision. It is not a pretty precedent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1870, President Ulysses S. Grant named two new justices who
earned the honor by promising to reverse a prior decision that had
invalidated a legal tender act compelling the public to accept
paper money. With the addition of the pair, Grant had a majority on
the court and within one year he had his reversal.
</P>
<P>
   All the GOP candidates insist they are opposed to abortion, but
some are more dogmatic than others. Gary Bauer and Patrick Buchanan
are the chief advocates of restricting Supreme Court nominees to
committed antiabortionists who would sit in judgment with a
pre-ordained goal of criminalizing the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   They do not mention how they expect such a person to be
confirmed by a Senate sharply divided on the subject. (President
George Bush, remember, got Clarence Thomas and David Souter
confirmed in part because neither had a record on abortion and both
denied holding any opinion.)
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush is cagey, saying that he does not
think the nation is ready to overturn Roe vs. Wade and therefore
won't fight for it. An aide says his policy is to appoint ``judges
who share his philosophy that judges should interpret the law and
not legislate from the bench.'' So-called legislating from the
bench, of course, is in the eye of the beholder and can mean
whatever Bush wants it to mean.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole is also vague, refusing to elaborate for the
moment on the details of where she stands. Sen. John McCain's
spokesman says McCain has an antiabortion record but that it's
``too early'' to address Supreme Court qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes says that in naming Supreme Court justices ``my
model would be Justice Antonin Scalia,'' an outspoken abortion
opponent who is the court's most conservative jurist. Not a direct
commitment, but certainly suggestive.
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle has presumably forgotten that
he once said if his daughter had an unwanted pregnancy, he would
``support her in whatever decision she'd make.'' Now he insists he
would pick for the Supreme Court judges who ``share'' an opposition
to abortion that is ``rooted in conscience,'' as he claims his to
be.
</P>
<P>
   On the opposite side, President Clinton and Vice President Al
Gore also understand the importance of the Supreme Court in the
abortion debate. They both defend the constitutional right to
liberty and the implied right to privacy that form the legal basis
of Roe vs. Wade. Clinton's two high court appointees, Ruth Bader
Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, fit that thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton admits that he would never nominate an opponent of Roe.
But he insists that beyond protecting the principle of a woman's
right to choose, he would be ``uncomfortable'' quizzing a potential
nominee about his or her views on the various restrictions the
courts have been considering, and he has not done so.
</P>
<P>
   This is no small distinction. This is the difference between
trivializing the judicial system and treating it as a co-equal
governmental power that may be influenced but never subsumed.

`HARD': SERIAL SEDUCTION AND HOMICIDE IN LOS ANGELES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Hard,'' a strident, grisly thriller about a gay serial killer
in Los Angeles who plays fiendish cat-and-mouse games with a
closeted gay cop assigned to his case, isn't exactly the Jeffrey
Dahmer story, although there are some obvious similarities.
</P>
<P>
   The killer, Jack (Malcolm Moorman), a handsome super-macho type
who preys on young hustlers, drifters and hitchhikers, doesn't
store his victims' body parts in a refrigerator in anticipation of
tasty cannibalistic treats.
</P>
<P>
   The few victims who aren't garroted and castrated after being
tortured and sodomized are transported to the cavernous basement of
an abandoned theater where they are bound, gagged and strung up
like slabs of meat to await further torture and possible execution.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, directed by John Huckert, might be described as a
crude, independently produced corrective to ``Cruising,'' William
Friedkin's ludicrous homosexual horror film of 1980. ``Hard'' isn't
ludicrous, just unrelentingly grim and depressing. Almost as
villainous as the serial killer in the world of ``Hard'' are the
Los Angeles police officers the movie portrays as rabid homophobes.
</P>
<P>
   The film's main character, Raymond (Noel Palomaria), is a
freshman homicide detective who is deep in the closet when the
story begins. While investigating the slaying and mutilation of a
gay man, Raymond visits a bar patronized by the victim and
encounters Jack, who, intuiting Raymond's homosexuality,
aggressively pursues him, eventually breaking down his defenses.
The two go home to Raymond's for sex. But when the detective
awakens in the morning, he finds himself handcuffed to the bed.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of releasing Raymond, Jack makes off with his police
badge and taunts him to come find him. When the detective's
straight, hard-boiled police partner, Ellis (Charles Lanyer), shows
up, Raymond's secret is out. Ellis is the only male officer to
stand by Raymond, who is taunted and beaten up by two fellow cops.
</P>
<P>
   A subplot follows Jack's seduction of a married man (Michael
Waite). Moving into the man's house as a supposed guest, Jack
menaces his host's young son and arranges for the boy's mother to
catch him in flagrante with her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard'' is a nasty piece of work whose sadism and visual
fixation on bluish, blood-stained corpses recalls David Fincher's
``Seven,'' although this washed-out-looking movie lacks the elegant
visual style of that revolting film.
</P>
<P>
   The acting and screenplay are wildly uneven, several of the plot
contrivances are problematic and the soundtrack is blurry. But
Moorman's Jack is a chillingly convincing psychopath, one who is as
skillful at seduction as he is at homicide.

`RUN LOLA RUN': A DANGEROUS GAME WITH SEVERAL ENDINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By JANET MASLIN

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This year's New Directors/New Films series, sponsored
by the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the Museum of Modern Art,
blasts off Friday night with the jolting, futuristic energy of the
hit German film ``Run Lola Run.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a furiously kinetic display of pyrotechnics from the
director Tom Tykwer, who fuses lightning-fast visual tricks,
tirelessly shifting styles and the arbitrary possibilities of
interactive storytelling into the best-case scenario for a
cinematic video game.
</P>
<P>
   Tykwer does this with a vigor and pizazz that offset the
essentially empty nature of the exercise. He makes ``Run Lola Run''
sufficiently hot, fast and post-human to pull that off. For its
sheer cleverness and gamesmanship, its altered sense of emotion and
meaning in the face of breathless forward momentum, his film makes
a startling harbinger of things to come. Tykwer deliberately blows
away all traces of the mundane and the familiar, so that not even
the closing credit crawl moves in the expected way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Run Lola Run'' opens with typical smashing bravado, as a few
vague voice-over speculations about the nature of mankind give way
to a strikingly bold image. A crowd milling around suddenly forms
the word Lola as the camera shifts from ground level to aerial
view, and with that we're off and running. Or Lola (Franka Potente)
is, anyhow, in a film that keeps her hurtling forward almost all
the time. The setup sounds like something out of a game's rule
book: Lola's boyfriend, Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu), will be killed if
she can't come up with a large sum of money and meet him across
town in 20 minutes' time.
</P>
<P>
   As Lola takes off, trucking along with a muscular R. Crumb look
and distinctive flaming-cranberry hair that sets her off from any
crowd, the fun is in the details. There are marking points along
her route that will be important later. A visit to her father's
office, an encounter between an ambulance and a sheet of plate
glass, assorted encounters of the street: all of these will be
refracted later in various ways. Meanwhile everything looks as
dazzling as possible, like the way the camera watches Lola run past
her idle mother, spins around the mother and then zooms in on a
television screen where Lola is now running as a cartoon version of
herself.
</P>
<P>
   The trip to Manni ends in death, but that hardly carries any
weight here. Soon everything is erased and we are back with the
flying red telephone receiver that sparked Lola's journey.
</P>
<P>
   This time each encounter is somehow different, just different
enough to alter the course of fate in playfully profound ways.
Tykwer's visual virtuosity revels in the possibilities here, as
when he splits the screen between Lola and Manni, then lets a
ticking clock approaching zero hour (noon) slide up from the bottom
of the image.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a difference a day makes,'' the soundtrack croons
mischievously, while the destiny of each minor character (shown in
rapid-fire flash cuts, a whole lifetime in a matter of seconds) is
made utterly different each time. The story eventually replays yet
another time, and it takes on new sardonic twists with each new
permutation, in a show of creative fireworks that is almost the
most remarkable aspect of the film. The real miracle, though, is
that Lola (like the filmmaker) seems to run through it all without
losing her verve or breaking a sweat.

`THE MOD SQUAD': SQUAD THAT WAS MOD IS RESHOD
</HEADLINE>
  (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When P.T. Barnum said, ``There's a sucker born every minute,''
he might have been anticipating the moviegoers who will pay as much
as $9.50 to see the torturously boring ``The Mod Squad.''
</P>
<P>
   Devoid of original plotting or suspense, clumsy in exposition,
reliant on ponderous music to underline its attempts to portray
action, played by unbelievable principals and ill-defined
subsidiary characters forced to mouth dull dialogue that reaches
the ridiculous, ``The Mod Squad'' is a film of unusual ineptitude.
</P>
<P>
   The main mystery surrounding this film (derived from an ABC
television series that ran from September 1968 to August 1973) is
why it was made. The precise culture and counterculture that
spawned the TV show are long past, and a tale of lawbreaking young
people given a second chance as members of a special youth squad of
police officers no longer resonates as it did in that turbulent
era.
</P>
<P>
   But even on its own terms, the movie ``The Mod Squad,'' directed
by Scott Silver and written by Silver, Stephen Kay and Kate Lanier,
is a notable failure.
</P>
<P>
   Just for the record, the unfortunate stars, introduced by
credits that seem likely to finish at about the same time as the
film does, are Claire Danes as Julie, Giovanni Ribisi as Pete and
Omar Epps as Linc. The three, saved from jail terms by Dennis
Farina as Adam Greer, a tough but kindly police captain, work
undercover in places like clubs and bars, where their youth
constitutes camouflage.
</P>
<P>
   But few of the police officers besides Greer find the youngsters
tolerable. When the film begins, a lot of cocaine is missing from a
police evidence locker, and the mod squad is sent into a club
suspected of being a link to prostitution. Before long, Greer is
dead, and the leaderless, unpopular mod squad is on its own in an
investigation into murder and police corruption.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, theater exit signs are welcome beacons.

COLUMN: THE RISE OF THE ALL-AMERICAN BREAST FETISH

<TEXT>
<P>
   Large breasted women are thought to be less smart than small
breasted woman. Yet, large breasted women are desirable and small
breasted women are ignored. However, both get made fun of.
</P>
<P>
   It is commonly understood that breasts are designed for nursing
babies, yet the sight of a nursing breast offends some people.
Breasts are, however, available for public viewing in magazines,
movies, advertisements, on some TV programs and on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Men take their shirts off to work on scaffolding in the middle
of downtown. A woman needs a special law to whip her's off in her
own front yard.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``go figure'' comes to mind in considering the above
and any number of cultural behaviors regarding the female breast.
It is no wonder the breast bearer or barer, herself, feels
ambivalent about her breasts. They belong to her but become
everyone else's business as soon as they appear.
</P>
<P>
   In her book, ``Breasts, the Women's Perspective on an American
Obsession,'' writer Carolyn Latteier says, ``It is strange living
in a body with a sex organ that is also a public institution.''
</P>
<P>
   We could be going through a new breast awareness phase. As
Latteier, a free-lance magazine writer in Port Townsend, Wash., was
finishing her book last year she learned of another author writing
the history of the breast. Latteier now counts at least five new
books out about breasts, including one for little kids.
</P>
<P>
   In November the residents of Newport, Maine, voted down an
ordinance that would have punished women for displaying their
breasts in public. It was brought to a vote after a woman in her
30s decided one hot day to mow her lawn minus her shirt and a
neighbor woman called the cops, complaining it was indecent and
worrying that motorists might get distracted and cause an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said that while it was against the law to bare
genitalia or have sex in public, bare breasts don't fall into
either category. A vote to expand the law was required. Voters said
let her take her shirt off.
</P>
<P>
   Latteier's intent is to help women feel better about their
breasts and not let themselves be judged by their size, shape or,
in the unhappiest of cases, because of a lost one.
</P>
<P>
   She thinks society doesn't see enough normal, average breasts,
which hardly ever match the airbrushed, often silicone-pumped ones
that cause many a woman to glance toward her own cleavage with an
``Oh, well.''
</P>
<P>
   Latteier says that breasts are as different as faces, but most
women tend to think that only their breasts are the odd ones. Every
woman she photographed for the slides she shows when talking about
her book apologized for her breasts.
</P>
<P>
   And yet it's only been in recent history that the breast has
gotten such attention. Her research shows that during the Middle
Ages and the Renaissance a woman's stomach was considered a symbol
of sexuality. Vain women would walk around thrusting out their
bellies and holding back their breasts. Imagine that at a Miss
America pageant.
</P>
<P>
   Latteier found that in many cultures today breasts are not the
sex objects they are in America. The women of Mali in West Africa,
for example, think it's amusing that men would be aroused by
breasts, so clearly is the breast considered the exclusive property
of babies.
</P>
<P>
   Latteier, who says she's quite satisfied with her own small
breasts, found that women with large breasts often get branded as
hypersexual. Also as not smart, immodest and incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more bosom, the less brain,'' is the cultural assumption.
</P>
<P>
   The small-breasted get labeled asexual, but reliable and smart.
</P>
<P>
   In the '50s, breast size and even projection were part of
postwar propaganda. Latteier says the ideal female body type
portrayed by the media had ample, even pointy breasts, emphasized
by bras that looked like warheads and hood ornaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was during the time that we were containing Communism,
skeptical of anyone different and needed to protect the white,
heterosexual nuclear family which was headed by a man who was very
masculine and a woman was who very feminine.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also a way, she said, of leading Rosie the Riveter
factory workers back home and into dresses and traditional female
roles.
</P>
<P>
   Later came a few years of liberation in the '60s and '70s, when
women stopped wearing bras or at least took on the soft, natural,
hang-loose look. Starting in the '80s the trend favored what she
calls ``the machine-like body.''
</P>
<P>
   The ideal female form calls for tight buttocks, small waist,
slender legs and impossible, rarely-found-in nature, voluptuous
breasts. The solution, and for some women a resulting health
problem, was breast implants.
</P>
<P>
   It's encouraging to examine the rise and fall of the breast
throughout history. It offers hope that the pushed up, squeezed
together, over the top look could be a passing cleavage.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we'll go back to the adoration of the belly. Maybe
braless will return. Or there's always that fresh trend out of
Newport, Maine, which may, in future years, have us marking spring
with the first reported sighting of a bare-breasted weed whacker,
size 36B.

   WRESTLEMANIA (Undated) _ The red-hot growth sector for media
analysis in 1999 is the apocalpse theory. And the word
``Millenarianism'' is the belief in a battle between good and evil
at the end of the millennium that lays waste to the earth and is
then followed by a thousand years of peace and human perfection.
(Mill(italics)i(end italics)nerianism, on the other hand, is the
belief in, um, hats.) What better way for the pop-cult eggheads and
satraps to earn their living than by pointing out for us the early
warning signs to the death of civilization? One such harbinger, the
seemingly inexplicable resurgence of professional wrestling, is
already being written about and spoken of by those on the critical
edge of the crackpot apocalypse. Wrestlemania, apparently, is the
end of the world as we know it. In our Age of Incivility, it should
come as only a small surprise that professional wrestling is now
the hippest ticket in town and a regular ratings juggernaut on
cable television. By Jeff MacGregor. &UR;  &LR; (Moved). Photo.

<P>
   ARTISTS-MUSEUMS (Undated) _ Europe has more than 400
single-artist museums; in this country, there are fewer than 40. A
single-artist museum, as the clunky phrase implies, is a public
institution devoted to the work of one lone artist, and the
tradition has given rise to such universally beloved haunts as the
Musee Picasso in Paris, the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, the Miro
Foundation in Barcelona and the Edvard Munch Museum in Oslo. And in
this country? Government indifference to the arts is an old story,
yet despite the obvious obstacles, artists' museums are finally
gaining some momentum. By Deborah Solomon. (Moved). Photo.

<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ARCTIC-CIRCLE-FILM (Undated) _ Julio Medem, 40, makes
sophisticated, elegantly constructed films whose characters seem to
wander blindly through a maze of experience. The director has
earned a reputation as Spain's most promising auteur; but as an
artist, he prefers not knowing where he's going. Spanish audiences
have had no trouble connecting with ``Lovers of the Arctic Circle''
(``Los Amantes del Circulo Polar''), Medem's fourth feature and a
surprise hit. The movie will be presented in the New Directors/New
Films series at the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan on April 7
and 8, and will open theatrically the next day. Highly stylized,
the film is a love story told alternately from the perspective of
each of the lovers, and it plays with the tension between the
lovers' fairy-tale idealism and the hazards of chance and will that
govern their fate. By Leslie Camhi. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TONY-GOLDWYN-FILM (Undated) _ About five years ago, the actor
Tony Goldwyn started getting restless. His performance in the 1990
off-Broadway play ``The Sum of Us'' had put him on the New York
theater map. The same year, his portrayal of the yuppie villain in
``Ghost'' had done the same in Hollywood. But he wanted more. His
response was perhaps inevitable for the son of the movie producer
Samuel Goldwyn Jr. and the grandson of the Hollywood legend Sam
Goldwyn. He would find a script he wanted to act in and produce it
himself. He saw it as something that might happen 10 years down the
road. But it didn't turn out the way he expected because of a
script called ``The Blouse Man,'' by a poet and playwright named
Pamela Gray. As ``A Walk on the Moon,'' the film opened on Friday,
and although Goldwyn does not act in it, he is indeed one of the
producers and, more important, its director. By Sylviane Gold.

   NO-FRILLS-CINEFEST (Liverpool, N.Y.) _ The phrase ``film
festival'' conjures glamorous images: the beaches of Cannes, the
slopes of Park City, Utah, and a crush of photographers aiming at
the latest starlet. Then there's Cinefest, which prides itself on
offering lots of films and not much festival. Held at a
standard-issue Holiday Inn here off Interstate 81, just northwest
of Syracuse, Cinefest has quietly developed a reputation as the
un-Cannes. For four days, several hundred people gather to sit on
banquet chairs in the hotel ballroom and watch movies that run from
9 a.m. until well past midnight. The films being screened are not
orphans in search of a distributor or indies hoping to generate
buzz, but rather spirits from the past: rarely seen movies from the
silent and early talkie era. By Ted Loos. (Moved). Photo.

   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NONPROFIT-MUSICALS (subslug) (New York) _ For musicals with big
bold intentions, they certainly didn't make much noise. The first
to come and go quietly was ``Parade,'' the funereal $5.5 million
Lincoln Center Theater show about the lynching of Leo Frank. Next
was ``Bright Lights Big City,'' the $500,000 musical adaptation of
the Jay McInerney novel that opened and closed at New York Theater
Workshop in what seemed like the span of a single yawn. The last to
depart, ``Captains Courageous,'' a $1 million musical that opened
in mid-February to the equivalent of a citywide shrug, is to vacate
the Manhattan Theater Club next Sunday. There you have it. Over the
course of a few punishing winter months, the musical hopes of three
of New York's most successful nonprofit theaters were smothered in
a blizzard of mixed-to-negative reviews. By Peter Marks. (Moved).

<P>
   NY-BALLET (Undated) _ Rehash or celebration? As a work in
progress, the New York City Ballet's 50th anniversary year looks
like both. The celebration is, in effect, a retrospective: Now
halfway through the 100 ballets it plans to present through June,
the company leaned toward the familiar in its recent winter season.
Yet the packaging was often different, and new contexts made for
new insights. By Anna Kisselgoff. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   WEIR-THEATER (London) _ Ian Rickson says he admires auteur stage
directors like Robert Wilson and Anne Bogart, who leave their
emphatic imprint on a production. But he prefers to burrow out from
the inside of a play. And if people don't notice what he has done,
that may be the highest compliment. Rickson's work is on display in
``The Weir,'' by the 27-year-old Irish playwright Conor McPherson,
which opens on Thursday at the Walter Kerr Theater in Manhattan.
This meditative drama of barroom blarney that gives way to a sense
of loss and then of healing is the director's first Broadway
effort. By Matt Wolf. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   RIDE-THEATER (Undated) _ Bizarre Murder!!! A Lesbian Forces
Blind Holocaust Victim on Roller Coaster!'' This phony headline is
trumpeted by Lisa Kron about herself halfway through her one-woman
show ``2.5 Minute Ride,'' directed by Mark Brokaw and opening
Sunday night at the Joseph Papp Public Theater in Manhattan. The
headline refers to an amusement-park ride that Ms. Kron takes with
her retired father, who lives in Lansing, Mich. The ride proves to
be a breeze compared with a trip to a concentration camp _ the
other major story in ``2.5 Minute Ride.'' By Steven Drukman.

   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FORZA-OPERA (Milan, Italy) _ Last month under the direction of
Riccardo Muti, after an absence of 20 years, ``La Forza del
Destino'' returned to La Scala, where in 1869 Verdi introduced the
opera in its significantly revised, definitive form. By Matthew
Gurewitsch. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   CHOPIN-MUSIC (Undated) _ Another anniversary is upon us, yet the
music business is strangely muted. Frederic Chopin died 150 years
ago, and the relative silence has less to do with our forgetfulness
than with our despair. For what are we to give the man who has
everything? Centennials _ bi-, tri-, sesqui- or of whatever nature
_ promise concentrated looks, resuscitations of neglected works,
re-evaluations of worth, new editions and musicological
discoveries. By Bernard Holland. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   GRAND-MACABRE-OPERA (Undated) _ Probably no opera of the last
quarter-century has been seen by more people than Gyorgy Ligeti's
``Grand Macabre.'' Since its premiere in Stockholm in 1978, the
work has had several different stagings in Europe, though none so
far in this country. Now comes its second recording, taken from
public performances in Paris a year ago of the production made for
the 1997 Salzburg Festival (Sony SK2 62312; two CDs). Esa-Pekka
Salonen leads the Philharmonia Orchestra, the London Sinfonietta
Voices and an excellent cast, most of whom will be returning in
December, when the production moves into the newly reopened Royal
Opera House in London. By Paul Griffiths. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   PHILLY-ARTS-CENTER (Philadelphia) _ An emphatic article in a
newspaper here stated that the Philadelphia Orchestra, the only
major American ensemble to play on a proscenium stage, should have
a proper hall of its own. That was in 1908. Successive generations
have taken up the cry. Plans for a new hall were drawn up during
the music directorships of Leopold Stokowski, Eugene Ormandy,
Riccardo Muti and now Wolfgang Sawallisch. Finally, a plan may be
realized. Ground was broken last November for a new Regional
Performing Arts Center, with a 2,500-seat symphony hall and a
650-seat recital theater, scheduled to open in 2001. By Anne
Midgette. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ROSCOE-MITCHELL-JAZZ (Undated) _ Roscoe Mitchell, whose album,
``Nine to Get Ready'' has just appeared, is a leading member of
jazz's forgotten avant-garde. Once hailed as an heir to Ornette
Coleman and Albert Ayler, Mitchell found himself pushed to the
margins in the 1980s by Wynton Marsalis and his traditionalist
followers, who reviled free jazz as an evil second only to fusion.
Since the early 90s, Mitchell has been staging a comeback,
recording and performing at a furious clip. He might not be welcome
at Lincoln Center, where musicians are expected to adhere to
blues-derived forms and steer clear of European dissonances. But
among younger jazz listeners who chafe at such restrictions,
Mitchell's audience is expanding. By Adam Shatz. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ROCK-IMAGE (Undated) _ Today, rock-and-roll is having problems.
Promoters say there are no new bands with members under 40 that can
sell out stadiums the way wrestling can. Monster truck shows, on
the other hand, have no problem selling out stadiums night after
night. And monster truck shows don't even have real celebrities, as
wrestling does: just unseen drivers like Gravedigger, who is
basically loved because he takes his turns too fast and too tight
and likes to drive through stadiums destroying props. There's that
violence and danger again. And maybe that's what rock needs. By
Neil Strauss. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   HIDDEN-MUSIC-TRACKS (Undated) _ The music of Whitney Houston,
the Offspring, Robert Earl Keen, Sheryl Crow, Korn, Beck and Jewel
has little in common, but the musicians do share one thing: they
all included hidden tracks on their most recent CDs. From
hip-hoppers to singer-songwriters to rockers, more pop artists than
ever are adding hidden tracks _ bonus tracks that are not listed on
the song lineup _ in an effort to surprise, delight, mock or annoy
fans. By Scott Sutherland. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   HIGH-LOW-CULTURE (Undated) _ There is nothing these days that is
too Low for High thought: trailer parks, snuff films, Mickey Mouse.
Some of this is because of the unparalleled power of American
popular culture, its extraordinary influence with world audiences
and its aggressively democratic perspective. Boundaries are
dissolving so fast that even the lowly life of a cultural critic is
swept up in the maelstrom: in recent months I have written about
swimming pools, video games and lingerie as well as Arnold
Schoenberg, Isaiah Berlin and Shakespeare. By Edward Rothstein.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-INFLUENCE (Undated) _ Americans got the message in 1961, when
the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission looked out
upon the television landscape and saw that it was bad. ``A vast
wasteland,'' he thundered. Everybody nodded in agreement, then
flipped through the TV Guide to see what was on that night. But the
phrase stuck _ became lodged, in fact, in the national corpus of
received wisdom and stock phrases. Finally, worn out, it was tossed
onto the ash heap of cliches, to be retrieved and reused thereafter
only with ironic intent. Television, it seems, had stopped being
the worst thing ever. That isn't to say we had learned to stop
worrying and love the tube. People, with good reason, have never
stopped beefing about television: there's too much sex, there's too
much violence, there are too many commercials, there's too much
Howard Stern. By William McDonald. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ANCIENT-GAMES-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ On the surface, board games
seem intended to amuse and entertain, but on closer look they have
much in common with military campaigns or religious rituals.
According to a Chinese legend from the Qin Dynasty, to avoid
further bloodshed, a war between an uncle and nephew was settled by
a game of weiqi, a kind of chess. This and many other stories are
charmingly related through the nearly 100 objects exhibited in
``Games People Play: Ancient Pastimes of Asia'' at the E.&AMP;J.
Frankel gallery in Manhattan until May 1. By Paula Deitz. (Moved).

 `EdTV': ALL LIFE, ALL THE TIME, NO MATTER HOW DULL  
 (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his good-humored, deceptively easygoing satire ``EdTV,'' Ron
Howard holds up a fun-house mirror to a world ruled by voyeurism
and specious fame.
</P>
<P>
   It's a world where a simple ``He's cute!'' can lead to overnight
stardom and where a book can be written by someone who has never
read one. It's a world where tabloids and television truly snoop to
conquer, and where the distinction between nobody's business and
everybody's business is unclear. And it's all too well-trod
territory. Howard can't really say much about it that's new.
</P>
<P>
   But what he can do, and does here so amusingly and fondly, is
bring the effects of such cultural topsy-turviness right home, not
just to this film's hilariously embattled characters but to the
viewer as well. In a film that begins almost nonchalantly, Howard
soon lures his audience into a morass of peeping-Tom opportunism
and advertising hustle that's an awful lot like what you can see on
the evening news.
</P>
<P>
   And because it would be easy to savage this state of affairs,
``EdTV'' does something more interesting: it makes palpable the way
viewers are compromised by what they see. Whether within the film
or merely while watching it, audiences are turned into becoming
part of the process that transforms a good-looking nobody like Ed
Pekurny (Matthew McConaughey) into our latest disposable toy.
</P>
<P>
   Having been sliced and diced by this same process in his own
life, McConaughey understandably plays Ed with a vengeance, and
with slyly raffish style. It also helps that most of the principals
(in a cast including Ellen DeGeneres, Elizabeth Hurley, Rob Reiner
and Woody Harrelson) and the director himself have been here and
done this in some fashion. A funny ensemble cast clearly savors the
absurdity of what unfolds here in an affectionate, rambling comedy
whose ideas about deranged media needn't really brook comparison
with ``The Truman Show.'' ``EdTV'' doesn't aspire to such a cool,
conceptual overview. With down-to-earth comic instincts, it simply
invests its story with a loud ring of truth.
</P>
<P>
   In a dependably jokey screenplay by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo
Mandel, ``EdTV'' casts Ms. DeGeneres as a San Francisco television
executive in dire need of a brainstorm (``We are this close to
having chalk outlines around our careers!''). And it puts Reiner in
the entertainingly villainous role of her boss, who fancies himself
a television taste maker and makes no bones about where his values
lie. (``You know how I know I'm right? Because I'm driving the big
car and you're driving the little car.'') Together, they agree to
try putting an ordinary Joe on 24-hour television, insist that this
has nothing to do with MTV's ``Real World'' or PBS' ``American
Family'' and see if it flies. Auditions in Ed Pekurny's
neighborhood bar reveal him as just oblivious, boisterous and
handsome enough to be the guinea pig of choice.
</P>
<P>
   The mere circumstances of Ed's first on-camera wake-up are
enough to show off the film's eye for embarrassing detail. Indeed,
as Ed shows off his hubcap collection, champions his favorite movie
star (Burt Reynolds) and works on personal hygiene (``You know,
most people like to hurry a toenail-clippin' session''), the
potential for gaffes is all too clear. But of course this is
exactly what endears the show to viewers, who find themselves
hooked on Ed for reasons they can't explain. Howard intersperses
Ed's own story with glimpses of the chefs and couples and college
girls who are soon transfixed. Their impulse is explained best by
the gay man who tells his lover: ``I don't know, it's just . . .
just let me watch!''
</P>
<P>
   In a perfect casting coup, the film presents McConaughey and
Harrelson (who do share a resemblance) as brothers who don't easily
adjust to Ed's growing fame. Harrelson is a particular treat as
Ray, the show-off Pekurny, who like Ed is easily lured into airing
private matters while a camera is in his face. ``EdTV'' turns into
a romantic comedy once Ed is drawn to Ray's girlfriend, Shari
(Jenna Elfman); Ray cheats on her, and the home viewers begin
second-guessing everyone's every move. Women think Ed should kiss
Shari. Men complain that she isn't hot enough. A USA Today poll
finds that 71 percent of readers don't think Shari is good enough
for Ed, and supplies him with a list of other women he should date.
</P>
<P>
   Shari delivers packages for U.P.S. and the film finds apt ways
to illustrate how she pays the price of fame. She gets filmed on
the job. She gets soaking wet when a fan steals her hat as a
souvenir. And in a small gem of a scene she is greeted by one woman
with: ``Oh, this is so exciting! A real celebrity is delivering my
figs!'' The film shows how this woman goes right from fawning to
nasty in only a sentence or two, in a manner too knowing to play
like fiction. Eventually, because Shari isn't happy about having
her breasts on the Internet, Ed's new fame begins to ruin the
romance.
</P>
<P>
   With very funny turns from Martin Landau as the brothers'
wisecracking stepfather, Sally Kirkland as their unexpectedly
vixenish mother and especially Elizabeth Hurley as the model with
whom fans (in an orgy of the vicarious) desperately want Ed to have
sex the film (which also briefly brings on Dennis Hopper as a blast
from Ed's past) stays conventional yet fresh, even when it has to
scramble for a sunny ending.
</P>
<P>
   All along the way, ``EdTV'' tells a secondary story as it brings
the world of commerce into plain view. Ed's success on television
is measured by the advertisers' names that flash constantly below
his image, starting with pizza parlors at first and going to brand
names like Maytag when he makes it big. By the same token, a Pepsi
machine at home becomes one of the film's most conspicuous
trophies.
</P>
<P>
   And there are so many such tie-ins that they create a strong,
seemingly sardonic sense of commercial overkill. It would be nice
to think that ``EdTV'' is above capitalizing on such product plugs
in its own right, which would befit the way it otherwise takes the
long view. But Universal Pictures would not comment about whether
this advertising was included in the film for fiscal or satirical
reasons. &QL;

 &HT;    MICROSOFT SETTLEMENT TALKS TO OPEN NEXT WEEK
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
 &HT;    Editors: the states in the suit are N.Y., Calif., Conn.. Fla.,
Ill., Iowa, Kan., Ky., La., Md., Mass., Mich., W. Va., Wis., Minn.,

<P>
   WASHINGTON - Antitrust settlement talks between the government
and Microsoft will open in Washington Tuesday. But as they prepare
to begin face-to-face bargaining, both sides remain far apart on
key issues.
</P>
<P>
   If they prove unable to strike a deal, then the marathon
Microsoft antitrust trial, which began in October, will resume
before U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, probably
in mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   The upcoming talks were confirmed after a meeting of attorneys
general Thursday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be sitting down with them on Tuesday,'' said New Mexico
Attorney General Patricia Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and the 19 states that have sued
Microsoft are crafting a response to an initial four-page proposal
offered Monday by the software giant. They have rejected the
company's initial offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we've put on a very strong case,'' said Ohio
Attorney General Betty Montgomery. ``If we had not, they wouldn't
be sending us a (settlement) proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Although a settlement remains in doubt, investors appeared
heartened by the news. Microsoft shares rose $8.50 to an all-time
high of $179.75. It was second most active stock on any U.S.
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Justice Department nor the company would comment on
the upcoming talks, which are to alternate between a third-floor
conference room at the Justice Department and the Washington
offices of Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell_ Microsoft's trial lawyers _ near
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Klein, the Justice Department's antitrust chief, and
William Neukom, Microsoft's general counsel, will be the key
negotiators. Their initial session will be held at the Justice
Department at 2 p.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The parties are also due to appear Wednesday (March 31) before
Jackson, who had urged them to seek an accord during the long trial
recess. Since Monday, Jackson has been presiding over a
two-defendant murder trial that his clerks (CQ plural) expect will
run seven more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates visited Washington briefly
Thursday but never came near the Justice Department, which has
featured his videotaped deposition at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   On tour to promote his new book, ``Business (at) the Speed of
Thought,'' Gates did not take questions from the press after his
hour-long talk at Georgetown University's business school. He left
for London immediately after that session.
</P>
<P>
   ``By late 1995, we had made the Internet our top priority,''
Gates told his student audience. ``We drove to integrate Windows
standards into our products.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that move, centered on the browser wars with rival
Netscape Communications, that prompted the antitrust suit last May.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday on NBC's Today show, Gates reiterated
his stand that Microsoft ``would love to settle the case as long as
there's a reasonable way to settle this thing, one that allows the
company to have integrity in our Windows product.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has offered to end its long-standing policy of signing
exclusionary contracts with various vendors and to ease strict
licensing demands for its Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   But the company refuses to yield on what it views as a vital
issue: Allowing the government to dictate how it could weave new
technologies into Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The government, however, sees a need to insure a level playing
in the fast-moving industry, given Microsoft's de facto Windows
monopoly over the operating system that runs on 90 per cent of the
world's personal computers.

<P>
   KIEVO, Yugoslavia _ Even after the air raid sirens wailed, Sara,
nearly 5, refused to go down to the basement shelter until the
``Ninja Turtles'' program was over.
</P>
<P>
   Then the night sky turned orange over this southern suburb of
Belgrade, and on a hill just a mile or so away, where a radar
antenna sits, a NATO missile or bomb exploded. Sara's father, Mile,
ran to his balcony, a little stupidly, he admits.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a big cloud of dust and a huge pressure of the
air,'' he said. ``I told Sara, `Where are our Ninja turtles to help
us now?' and then we went to the shelter.''
</P>
<P>
   Mile, his wife, Biljana, Sara and her brother, Nemanja, 6, slept
in a tiny concrete storage area in their basement. There were more
explosions to the south and near Zarkova, where there are aircraft
plants and technical compounds, and Sara was very frightened, her
mother said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She huddled in the corner, and she said, `I want to die,
Mommy.' We calmed her by saying it was just explosions in the stone
quarry nearby, and she said, `I was afraid they were Americans.'''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, hot and sunny, was Biljana's 32nd birthday.
``The Americans arranged these fireworks for you,'' her husband
said.
</P>
<P>
   Her face crumpled, but she stifled tears and managed a wan
smile. ``I'm the guilty one, then,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Who is guilty, really, she was asked. President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia? The ethnic Albanians? The Americans?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is plenty of guilt to go around,'' she said. ``No one
need feel left out.''
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor called up to the balcony and asked in English,
``Where are you from?'' A colleague said, truthfully, ``Austria.''
</P>
<P>
   The neighbor said bitterly, ``Well, you're still neutral, at
least so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbian anger at the West, and especially the United States, is
both media-fed and genuine. Ordinary Serbs like Mile, 37, who works
in an electrical-engineering plant, are both stupefied that the
bombs are falling and outraged that the world is treating them
``like savages,'' he said, ``just because we want to keep our
country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't try to take territory away from any other country,''
Mile said, getting angrier. ``America is intervening 100 percent on
the side of the Albanians in Kosovo. It is supporting separatism
and terrorism and trying to take away our state. Who gives them the
right to bomb anybody they want?''
</P>
<P>
   Biljana patted him on the hand, and he reverted, almost
instantaneously, to being the genial Serbian host, offering Turkish
coffee and homemade plum brandy, colored golden by the wooden cross
embedded in the bottle. ``We call this our Tomahawk,'' he said
cheerily. ``It's a precision-guided weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he darkened once more. ``We'll be in the shelter again
tonight,'' he said. ``And how many more nights? And what will be
the end? We enter the 21st century in this country with bombs
falling on us, as if we are the last and most savage place on the
earth. We used to have a good life here. Is it just Milosevic, or
is it someone else?''
</P>
<P>
   Their friend, Alexander, lives close by in Zarkova, also a
target of NATO. A missile hit near a heating plant less than a mile
from his apartment building, shaking the chandelier and the
furniture like an earthquake, he said.
</P>
<P>
   His family and his sister, who lives in the same building, went
down to the shelters. ``The whole situation in my family changed
immediately,'' he said. ``All the foreigners, the Americans and the
English, all look like enemies now. Before the bombings, my father
didn't know what to think. Now he says, `Don't talk to these
foreigners; don't work with them; their money is dirty.'''
</P>
<P>
   He shook his head. ``It's like they've bombed an opinion into
our brains, and it will only help Milosevic. I don't like him, but
this bombing unifies all the Serbs against the world.''
</P>
<P>
   It is strange, he said, and primitive when war begins. ``Now
Clinton and all the Americans are all the same in this moment: they
are criminals. It's not just because the television said so. People
are afraid. They didn't expect this to happen. They just didn't
think it could happen.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Thursday morning, when the air raid sirens wailed again in
Belgrade, his wife finally managed to get through to him on his
cell phone, to tell him to take shelter. ``I am empty,'' he said.
``My wife and my mother are full of sedatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Miles away, in the elegant center of old Belgrade, in an
exquisite apartment stuffed with every modern convenience, Slavko
Curuvija waits for the police to come. He is the publisher of the
independent newspaper Dnevni Telegraf and the newsmagazine
Evropljanin and has been sentenced to five months in jail after
refusing to pay enormous fines under a new media law, passed in
October.
</P>
<P>
   His appeal is pending, suspended by the declaration of war
Yugoslavia issued on Wednesday night. His wife, Branka Prpa, is a
well-known historian at the Institute for Modern Serbian History.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will go to jail for five months, and after this bombing,
who will care?'' she asked. ``The West can't help him _ that's
another effect of this bombing. Milosevic can act like a dictator
and lock us all up, and who will care for us? I agree the West
should care for the human rights of ethnic Albanians, but do they
also care for mine?''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia is a European nation a millennium old, she said.
``You can't rub it out with an eraser and pretend it's some nation
without culture, without reason, without civilization, that we are
all savages, because of a Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   The West is degrading itself by using Milosevic's own tactics of
force and diktat against him, she said. ``You cannot use evil
against evil or you become the same. I only hope Serbia can survive
this one man and the madness he's done in this moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Curuvija, said it is impossible now for any
democrat or dissident to raise up their heads in this war fever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs feel under a collective guilty verdict, and the
democratic forces are pushed into their mouse holes because of this
permanent state of emergency,'' he said. ``In this moment, you
cannot say you want to change something, or bring Serbia closer to
the West, which is bombing your country _ it makes you a traitor.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to his soft yellow sweatshirt, with a Gant logo and
its red-white-and-blue colors, on his chest. ``I'd be afraid now to
wear this outside in the street,'' he said. ``There are a lot of
crazy people right now.'' He rubbed his hands over his beard and
straightened his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this helps Milosevic,'' he said. ``Everything Western is
terrible right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Another air raid siren sounded. When it died away, Ms. Prpa, his
wife, said softly, as the sunlight hit polished wood: ``The worst
of all is to feel you have no future. What kind of future do we
have?''

REMAKE OF `MOD SQUAD' EXUDES A RETRO CHARM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The movie version of ``The Mod Squad'' is one of the less
self-conscious and less pretentious of recent big-screen remakes of
vintage television shows. It plays very much like an extended
episode of the old series _ half-heartedly updated to the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   It has no inside jokes for former fans or splashy cameo
appearances by the former stars. It doesn't try to elevate its
material into something more significant. For that matter, it
doesn't show any undue respect for its source. It's just a
nostalgic exercise in early-'70s-style TV schlock.
</P>
<P>
   As you may recall, the series _ which ran on ABC-TV between 1968
and 1973 _ chronicled the cases of a trio of ex-juvenile
delinquents pressed into service by the Los Angeles Police
Department as spies within the youth counterculture: undercover
cops disguised as hippies.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those characters are back for the movie. There's the
pretty young female ex-addict, Julie (played by Peggy Lipton in the
series; Claire Danes in the movie), and the taciturn young black
man, Linc (played by Clarence Williams III _ with smoldering rage
and the world's tallest afro _ in the series; Omar Epps in the
movie).
</P>
<P>
   But the third character, Pete (played by Michael Cole with
tight-lipped '60s cool in the series), has been totally revamped
into a goofy comic-relief figure played by Giovanni Ribisi
(Juliette Lewis' mentally handicapped suitor in ``The Other
Sister'') who is only a step or two away from Curly of the Three
Stooges.
</P>
<P>
   The script has the trio staking out a trendy downtown rock club
that's a hangout for high-class pimps and prostitutes, and somehow
stumbling onto a huge conspiracy by rogue LAPD cops _ seemingly
half the department _ to traffic in drugs that have been seized as
evidence. Before long, every cop in Southern California is after
the kids.
</P>
<P>
   The characters are likable as they wriggle out of this
impossible situation, the story is fast-paced and not terribly
demanding, and the style is so sedate compared with today's
mean-spirited youth action movies that it all comes together with a
certain retro charm. High cinematic art it's not, but it is
something remarkably close to my memory of the TV ``Mod Squad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mod Squad. Directed by Scott Silver. Written by Silver,
Stephen Kay and Kate Lanier. Cast: Claire Danes, Omar Epps,
Giovanni Ribisi, Dennis Farina, Josh Brolin. MGM. 94 minutes. Rated
R for prostitution and drug themes, and violence.

   MOSCOW _ The U.S. State Department in February issued an
extraordinarily detailed report to Congress on the status of
Russia's military. It estimated that Russia's Defense Ministry is
operating with a $9 billion debt, which includes about $2.5 billion
in back pay and pensions to active and retired servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the findings:
</P>
<P>
   An internal Russian military analysis found that ``the average
Russian soldier is only marginally combat capable,'' as chronic
economic problems faced by the government have curtailed training
of the country's 1.2 million soldiers, sailors and airmen.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, sea duty for Russian submarines was reduced by 25
percent, while surface ships spent 33 percent less time at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Russian air force pilots in 1998 got only 15 to 40 percent of
normal flying time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the government was three-to-four months behind in
paying salaries to servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   The wage arrears and decline in living standards on Russian
bases has placed the military ``at the low end of the country's
economic scale.''
</P>
<P>
   The result as been an increase in crime, ``particularly theft,
and corruption in the armed forces, as well as suicides among
service members and widespread evasion of military service.''

ANTIQUES: IT'S JADE TIME AT THE GALLERIES AND THE FAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To the Chinese, jade is more than a gemstone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been part of their entire world for at least 4,000 years;
it's one of the most valuable things they had,'' said Robert
Ellsworth, a private New York City dealer who is showing an early
eighth-century Tang Dynasty white jade bull with gold and silver
trappings at the International Asian Art Fair, which runs through
March 30 at the 7th Regiment Armory on Park Avenue and 67th Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jade is synonymous with China,'' Ellsworth continued. ``It's
revered, respected and valued. It was used as currency. It was how
you put your wealth on display.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvin Lo, a fourth-generation dealer who owns the Lo Gallery at
5 E. 57th St., said, ``For the Chinese, jade is seen in terms of
ethics.'' He added: ``Jade has profound meaning, beyond monetary
return. It's part of Chinese culture. It protects you. It is a good
omen.''
</P>
<P>
   Lo said the best way to understand jade was to read Confucius
(551-479 B.C.), who compared the visual traits of jade to worldly
virtues. According to a translation in ``Jade'' (Lorenz Books,
1995), a collection of essays compiled by Roger Keverne, he wrote:
``Its polish and brilliancy represent the white of purity, its
perfect compactness and extreme hardness represent the sureness of
intelligence, its angles, which do not cut although they seem
sharp, represent justice.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``Its color represents loyalty, its interior
flaws, always showing themselves through the transparency, call to
mind sincerity; its iridescent brightness represents heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Collectors should be aware that jade can easily be faked and
should be bought only from dealers who guarantee its authenticity.
But this week, those who want to see the real thing are in luck
because it's Asian Art Week in New York, and there is heavenly
Chinese jade at the fair and at art galleries all over town.
</P>
<P>
   In China the ``Jade Age'' predated the Bronze Age. ``It came
before porcelain, painting and bronze,'' said Sam Bernstein, a San
Francisco dealer of Chinese antiques who is giving a seminar on
jade Saturday morning at 9 at the Four Seasons Hotel ($55). ``It
even came before pottery.''
</P>
<P>
   As early as 3500 B.C., the Chinese were shaping jade into
funerary ornaments and tools _ nephrite jade from China, not the
bright emerald green Burmese jadeite that arrived in China about
1750.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the finest early jades in town are at J.J. Lally &AMP; Co.
Oriental Art, 41 E. 57th St. in Manhattan, which this week opened
an exhibition of ancient Chinese jades, bronzes and ceramics that
runs through April 10. In their restraint and minimalist design,
these pieces appeal to collectors of contemporary art and the
Calvin Klein set as well as to connoisseurs of Chinese art. The
show is half sold out.
</P>
<P>
   The gallery has a squarish, thin, 4.5-inch-long, dark green jade
ax head from a Shang Dynasty (16th to 11th century B.C.) burial
site. ``I think it is a ceremonial ax,'' said James Lally, the
gallery owner.
</P>
<P>
   The ax may or may not have been used. ``It is the quality of
jade that makes it the toughest of gem materials,'' wrote Jill
Walker in the Keverne book. ``The toughness of gem material is not
the same as its hardness; toughness is the resistance to breaking,
chipping or cracking, while hardness is the resistance to
scratching or abrading.'' She continued, ``This attribute of
nephrite was recognized by prehistoric peoples, as evidenced by its
use in early tools.''
</P>
<P>
   Lally also has a Neolithic jade cong, a hollow cylinder in a
square body, like a square bangle. He says the cong was used in
rituals to worship the earth. These rituals were performed only by
powerful officials, so the cong became a status symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Dated 3300 to 2250 B.C., Lally's pale olive cong has four
stylized masks with huge round eyes incised in its corners. The
masks look like the faces on totem poles in the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Lally also has jade pendants with dragons and phoenixes incised
on them. The dragon is thought to represent the emperor; the
phoenix, the empress.
</P>
<P>
   ``In archaic China, pendants were worn as an emblem of power or
were used for burials,'' Lally said. ``They would be strung on a
cord on a belt or used as a toggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Lally also has a charming, yellow-green jade ram from the Sung
Dynasty (A.D. 960 to 1279). Nearly three inches long, the ram is
lying down, his head sharply turned back; it is priced at $40,000.
Lally said the piece ``has an extraordinary color and a good
provenance.''
</P>
<P>
   Many jade animals are in the Asian fair; Ralph Chait, Spink,
Sydney Moss, A.&AMP;J. Speelman, Alistair Sampson, S. Marchant &AMP; Son,
Gerald Hawthorn, Lo and Ellsworth all have them. ``The Chinese like
jade animals,'' Ellsworth said. ``They were like personal toys,
often touched during a person's life and then placed in his tomb.`
</P>
<P>
   Jade snuff bottles were also made to be held, said Robert Hall,
a dealer in them. ``Snuff bottles came into fashion in 1642 when
they were endorsed by the Emperor Kangzi,'' he said. ``The
literati, the well-connected and the imperial households all
collected them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall is selling a late-18th-century uncarved green jadeite snuff
bottle for $20,000. ``They tended to leave the best jade uncarved,
to show off the color,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jade comes in many shades of green, yellow, white, lavender,
black, gray, brown, even red. ``For collectors of jade, the three
most important things are color, color, color,'' said Hawthorn, a
London dealer. ``If the carving is great, it's a bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   Lally agreed. ``The whole story is size and color in ancient
jade,'' he said. ``Yellow is very desirable because it's hard to
find. Dark green is the less sought after because it's more
plentiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Keverne, who is a dealer in London and will be at the fair,
said, ``Today brilliant white and yellow seem to be fashionable.''
He is selling a white jade sculpture of a boy with pomegranate,
which symbolizes fertility, at the Sampson booth.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Weisbrod, a Manhattan dealer, is selling 125 ancient
jades in his show, ``Jades From Traditional China,'' at 36 E. 57th
St. through April 6. He said, ``Spinach jade is a little out of
fashion now.''
</P>
<P>
   Jade likes to be touched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jade is a little like pearls; it can dry up,'' Ellsworth said.
``It seems to be absorbent to a point. Wearing it does not enhance
the depth of the color but keeps it more translucent.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellsworth said he dangles an early Shang jade water buffalo from
his belt and wears a 2000 B.C. jade bead around his neck.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Childs-Johnson, author of the 219-page catalog that
accompanies the Weisbrod show, said: ``Jade has a protective
function and brings good luck. It is seen as an auspicious symbol
because of its properties.''

   LONDON _ Europeans reacted on Thursday with a mixture of dread
at the return of large-scale combat to the continent where two
world wars were fought, apprehension that the conflict could
spread, and widespread if sometimes grudging support for the allied
decision to take military action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war between Serbia and NATO for Kosovo is forcing us into
a kind of `great leap backward' toward places, tensions, fears that
history had seemed to have left behind forever: war in the Balkans,
Russia's return to the language of the Cold War and the apparent
impotence of the U.N.,'' said Rome's La Repubblica in a front-page
editorial.
</P>
<P>
   Describing Europe's choice as one between ``cholera'' and
``plague,'' the Belgian paper Le Soir said the outcome was unclear
but that leaders were right to choose the ``plague'' of airstrikes
on Yugoslavia to put an end to the ethnic violence in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The European press has been giving stark and ample coverage to
the massacres of villagers in Kosovo and the flight of refugees,
and this has built up substantial popular feeling for taking steps
seen as bringing some relief to the beleaguered residents of the
province and punishing the people harming them.
</P>
<P>
   A common concern expressed even by strong supporters of the
bombings was the failure to obtain U.N. approval before going in.
Lord Healey, a former Labor defense minister in Britain, called it
a ``terrible error.'' In Spain, El Pais, the country's most
influential newspaper, said, ``It should not be forgotten that this
is the first offensive operation against a sovereign country and
that it does not carry the legal legitimacy that a U.N. Security
Council resolution would have lent it.''
</P>
<P>
   Outright opposition came mostly from politicians with leftist or
Communist backgrounds, though their protests did not carry the
force they would have a decade ago when the left held more
influence on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   In Spain, Willy Meyer of the Communist-led United Left called
the action a ``leap backward in civilization in favor of
barbarism,'' while in France, Robert Hue, head of the French
Communist Party, said he disapproved of the strikes as a ``direct
violation of the United Nations charter.'' The daily Liberation
said, ``At this stage, we must ask whether airstrikes are a
substitute for a political solution and the answer can only be
negative.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Benn, a longtime Labor militant, led a group of the party's
left-wing members in the House of Commons in denouncing the allies
for conducting a ``war of aggression.'' It was, they said, an act
that violated their party's values of ``internationalism, peace,
and the peaceful settlement of disputes.''
</P>
<P>
   They were far outnumbered by Labor members who shouted out their
backing of the government's decision to bomb. Prime Minister Tony
Blair, in Berlin for a European Union summit meeting, said, ``We
really have no alternative but to act in the interests both of
humanity and the wider strategic interests of the region.''
</P>
<P>
   British newspapers across the board gave their backing to the
bombardment while expressing anxiety about whether it would be
effective in persuading Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
negotiate. They cautioned the need to keep control of the scope of
the action. ``A deadly gamble, but we are right to strike at
Milosevic,'' The Independent headlined its editorial while The
Guardian said that Britain should be making ``discreet but serious
preparations for the use of ground troops.''
</P>
<P>
   German newspapers gave cautious support to the attacks, noting
they were the first hostile action by German forces since the end
of World War II. ``The aim of the action is definitely morally
justified, but questionable in terms of international law and not
backed by the U.N.,'' said the mass circulation Bild.
</P>
<P>
   Reactions sometimes followed the pattern of traditional
alliances. Many Turks welcomed the airstrikes as a blow in defense
of fellow Moslems. ``A slap for the Serb Hitler,'' the normally
sedate Milliyet newspaper said. Greeks and Greek Cypriots, with
historic ties to Orthodox Christianity, deplored the strikes,
saying they proved that Europeans still had not found a way short
of war to solve their own problems.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even Socialist opponents of the government of Prime Minister
Jose Maria Aznar in Spain expressed ``support and solidarity'' for
the bombing, though they criticized him for not explaining the
country's commitment of fighter planes and an in-flight tanker to
parliament. The leader of the ruling conservative Popular Party,
Javier Arenas, said that Spaniards understood the need for force.
``The bombings were done in the name of freedom and human rights
and came after an intense negotiation process,'' he claimed.
</P>
<P>
   El Pais said that ``NATO is covered by a moral legitimacy'' in
taking to the skies. ABC, a leading conservative daily, argued:
``The intervention is large-scale because the clamorous brutality
that made it necessary also is large-scale.''
</P>
<P>
   With French air force and naval units involved in the attack on
Kosovo, President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
have so far unequivocally backed NATO action against their
historical Serbian ally.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac, in a statement made on Wednesday from the summit meeting
in Berlin, said ``the French people will understand the necessity
of action,'' adding ``peace is in jeopardy today, peace on our
soil, peace in Europe and human rights. Everything has been done to
find a reasonable and peaceful solution, one that adheres to the
tenets of human rights. Everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of Jospin's address before the French Parliament on
Friday, only Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement, a
left-leaning nationalist who resigned as Minister of Defense in
1991 at the outbreak of the Gulf War, has hinted at objection to
NATO airstrikes. He expressed ``his conviction that Serb and
Kosovar coexistence can only be achieved through political
channels'' and reiterated ``his preference for a political
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Le Monde editorialist Alain Frachon said NATO's action is based
on several gambles: that Milosevic is ``a poker player who is
bluffing'' and will end up ceding to pressure; that, having built
his career around the Kosovo issue, he needs the pretext of
international ``aggression'' to back down; that he is above all
concerned with retaining power and will not prolong a crisis that
could eventually topple him; and that he cannot long absorb the
political impact of NATO's attacks on his military machine.
</P>
<P>
   Frachon concluded: ``Neither the military nor politicians can
guarantee any of this. They are counting on the relevance of the
military attacks to their political objectives. Certain experts are
skeptical.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Wesley Clark, the four-star American general
who as Supreme Allied Commander Europe is in charge of the powerful
NATO air offensive against Serbia for its attacks against ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, knows his adversary well.
</P>
<P>
   Too well, perhaps, mused one allied diplomat, not an American,
who said on Thursday that he thought the general was intellectually
the most impressive commander the alliance had ever had, but
fixated on the idea that force is the only language the Serb
leadership understands.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, 54, arrived at that conviction through long experience
with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. It was Milosevic's
refusal to accept a peace agreement in Kosovo involving the
deployment of 28,000 NATO peacekeepers that made the bombing
inevitable, the general and other allied leader say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to systematically attack, disrupt, degrade,
devastate and, ultimately, unless President Milosevic complies with
the demands of the international community, we're going to destroy
these forces, with their facilities,'' Clark said Thursday in
characteristically forceful language, describing a bombing campaign
that allied officials say could destroy the Yugoslav army as an
effective fighting force.
</P>
<P>
   He personified the battle, as generals often do. When reporting
that two American F-15 fighters and a Dutch F-16 had apparently
shot down at least three Yugoslav Mig-29s in dogfights Wednesday
night, Clark referred to the Yugoslav aircraft as ``some of his
most advanced and capable aircraft,'' with ``his'' referring not to
an abstract enemy, but to Milosevic personally.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's short, well-groomed gray hair and piercing eyes (he
wears contact lenses) bespeak an intensity he has shown throughout
his army career over the last three decades.
</P>
<P>
   His intimate familiarity with Milosevic and his thinking stems
from the hundreds of hours that he spent with the Serbian leader in
1994 and 1995, when Clark served as Richard Holbrooke's military
adviser during the American special envoy's diplomatic quest to end
the war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   On one of their trips, three other members of their team were
killed in an accident on the dangerous Mount Igman road to
Sarajevo, forced to take that route because of the Bosnian Serb
refusal to guarantee their safety on a more direct one. Clark
rappelled down a steep mountainside to try to rescue the victims
from their burning armored personnel carrier.
</P>
<P>
   In the marathon peace negotiations that Holbrooke brokered in
Dayton, Ohio, in November 1995 after Milosevic abandoned the
Bosnian Serb cause, Clark personally oversaw the drafting of the
military chapter of an accord that gave free rein to a NATO
peacekeeping force in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO's senior officer, he now commands that peacekeeping
force, and the British commander of the similar force planned for
Kosovo under the peace plan would report to him, too.
</P>
<P>
   Was there a hint of exasperation in the general's remark on
Thursday that bombing Yugoslavia to make it willing to make peace
was the culmination of a long _ in fact, quite long _ planning
process?
</P>
<P>
   People who know him say that Clark is much too politically
astute to express publicly any impatience with the long _ in fact,
quite long _ hesitation President Clinton and other allied leaders
showed in reaching their decision to use force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Unusually, Clark had no military command experience in Europe
before Clinton put him in charge of the alliance's military
establishment, as well as the 100,000 American troops stationed in
Europe, in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Clark was director of strategic plans and policy on the joint
staff at the Pentagon when Holbrooke drafted him for his
negotiating missions in Bosnia. He then went to Panama to take
charge of the United States Southern Command for a year before
taking up his NATO duties at Mons, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Clark and Clinton both grew up in Arkansas, and both were Rhodes
Scholars at Oxford University in the 1960s, though they only got to
know each other well later.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton avoided military service, but Clark graduated, first in
his class, from West Point in 1966 and took a master's degree in
philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford before starting his
rise through the military ranks as a ``tanker,'' or armor officer,
in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   There, he received the Silver Star medal for bravery in combat
and was wounded four times. Later, he was selected to be a White
House Fellow in 1975 and 1976, when the young officer worked as a
special assistant to the director of the Office of Management and
Budget.
</P>
<P>
   He converted to Roman Catholicism after meeting his wife, the
former Gertrude Kingston of Brooklyn, N.Y., at West Point. They
have one son, Wesley, who after living in California and trying to
make a living writing film scripts is now preparing to go to
business school.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, though almost slight of build, is in superb physical
shape, as might be expected of an officer who wears the elite
Ranger and Airborne army badges on his uniform. Long laps in the
swimming pool allow him to indulge a weakness for popcorn, corn
chips and Coca-Cola, and friends say he has recently taken up golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is always totally focused on whatever he's doing,'' one old
friend said. ``When he skis, he wants to be first down the hill,
and he has gone into every job he has ever had with incredible
intensity. He has never had an easy job.''
</P>
<P>
   After commanding a battalion and a brigade of the Fourth
Infantry Division in Fort Carson, Colo., in the 1980s, he became
commander of the National Training Center from 1989 to 1991, one of
several such posts in which he played a key role in helping adapt
army big-battalion tactics and combat doctrines suited to the Cold
War to the more nimble, rapid-deployment needs of the less stable
era that succeeded it.

A TRIBUTE TO W.C. HANDY, THE MUSICIAN WHO TURNED RAGTIME INTO THE
BLUES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JON PARELES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ American popular music depends on entrepreneurs as
well as musicians, and William Christopher Handy was a savvy
combination of both. The W.C. Handy Foundation marked his 125th
birthday _ he was born Nov. 11, 1873 _ with a concert at Alice
Tully Hall on Monday night, bringing together singers and musicians
who will tour cities associated with Handy from May until November.
</P>
<P>
   Handy was a cornetist in minstrel shows, a brass-band leader and
the first composer to publish a blues, ``Memphis Blues'' in 1912.
He soon realized the value of copyrights and started his own
publishing company. He was also an early advocate of the American
Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (Ascap), the
songwriters' organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took ragtime and changed it into blues,'' said the pianist
Terry Waldo, demonstrating some of the structural innovations Handy
put into print. Historians have considered Handy more a businessman
than a musician, collecting and consolidating the music he heard
around him.
</P>
<P>
   Handy himself described his job as being ``to dream and build
upon our folk melodies.'' But whether he was inventing or selecting
musical ideas, he had an ear for shapely melodies and archetypal
lyrics. His name was attached to songs that have served blues and
jazz musicians through nearly a century.
</P>
<P>
   With Frank Owens conducting a big band plus a string section,
the overstuffed concert presented Handy's songs as gutsy blues,
orchestrated ragtime, spirituals, swing arrangements, jazz ballads,
modern pop-soul and briefly as a backup for tap-dancing children.
Paul Robeson Jr. narrated Handy's biography between selections;
Valerie Simpson announced a scholarship sponsored by Ascap in
Handy's name.
</P>
<P>
   The songs could be summed up as heartbreak with a map,
juxtaposing confessions of woe with local references. Ruth Brisbane
growled ``Yellow Dog Blues'' in the style of Bessie Smith; M'zuri
gave a sultry warmth to the New Orleans bounce of ``Chante les
Bas''; Freddie Cole let his voice soft-shoe through ``St. Louis
Blues,'' neatly understating its desolation. Emme Kemp sang
spirituals with restrained dignity and later took over the piano
for a boogie-flavored ``Atlanta Blues.'' Genovis Albright, a
pianist and singer, treated ``Harlem Blues'' with modal piano
harmonies and ululating improvisations. And Sandra Reeves-Phillips
belted ``St. Louis Blues'' with charismatic fervor, flinging her
feather boa across the stage.
</P>
<P>
   The band, which will not tour with the singers, handled the
arrangements with the aplomb of first-rate freelancers,
particularly when sparked by solos like Al Grey's earthy, urbane,
plunger-muted trombone lines or Virgil Jones' jaunty New
Orleans-style trumpet. Although the concert rambled at times, a
final jam session made clear the affection the musicians held for
Handy's durable tunes.

   KOSOVO-MILITARY-ASSESS (Washington) _ NATO's air campaign
intends to bomb the Yugoslav leader, Slobodan Milosevic, into
submission or pound his military to the point where it can no

on a hill just a mile or so away, where a radar antenna sits, a
NATO missile or bomb exploded. ``There was a big cloud of dust and

   BEIJING _ China pressed an all-out verbal assault on the NATO
air strikes against Serbian forces Thursday, issuing multiple
demands that the attack be halted, while the flagship state
newspaper called the operation a ``dangerous precedent of naked
aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   Several major newspapers in Beijing were delivered late Thursday
after they took the unusual step of holding up the presses for
several hours on Wednesday night, apparently so they could include
reports on President Jiang Zemin's condemnation of the NATO attack.
</P>
<P>
   One source of China's unease is resentment of its own history of
colonization and invasion by Western and Japanese forces. But even
more potent is China's concern that foreign powers might treat its
own sometimes violent ethnic conflicts in Tibet and the Muslim
province of Xinjiang as requiring international intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang, who is also chief of the Communist Party, made his
remarks just after the attack began, at a banquet Wednesday evening
in Milan, part of a European tour.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang was the first of several officials to demand ``an
immediate end'' to the air strikes. Prominent on the front page of
People's Daily, alongside the report of the Jiang's remarks, was a
harsh, pre-prepared editorial that accused NATO of ``flagrantly
using barbaric military force to interfere in Yugoslavia.'' The
newspaper is the mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   China says the air strikes required approval by the United
Nations Security Council (where China and Russia could have vetoed
the plan).
</P>
<P>
   But Prime Minister Zhu Rongji still plans to visit the United
States in April, a foreign ministry spokesman said Thursday after
delivering his own broadside.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu recently said he hopes his visit will enable China and the
United States to resume progress toward the ``constructive
strategic partnership'' that both sides pledged last year. The
dispute over Kosovo joins human rights, accusations of Chinese
espionage, American research on missile defenses and China's huge
trade surplus with the United States as issues dividing the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
   But both governments hope to avoid a new Cold War. With Zhu's
visit weeks away, American and Chinese trade officials are
negotiating feverishly here to see if they can produce a plum for
the visit by agreeing on terms for China's entry into the World
Trade Organization. This would require China to reduce its trade
barriers.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of Kosovo, at least, the People's Daily editorial
and other official statements revealed how far apart the two
countries are and hinted at why the Chinese feel so threatened by
the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that ethnic conflict in Yugoslavia has ancient roots, the
editorial blames the recent violence in Kosovo on ``illegal
Albanian armed forces.'' Instead of condemning the brutal tactics
of Serbian forces as Clinton did, it says Serbian actions have been
``entirely appropriate and legitimate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many countries with problems involving ethnic
minorities,'' the editorial says. ``If we encourage division, won't
the world fall into chaos?''
</P>
<P>
   China is also hypersensitive about international support for
Taiwan, which it considers a breakaway province.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO's use of military force to meddle in Yugoslavia is
without reason or legal basis,'' People's Daily said, arguing that
the action was part of a dark new ``strategy for global
intervention'' by NATO.

RECIPIENTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Thursday signed legislation
that prohibits nursing homes from evicting people on Medicaid, as
some have done in recent years as part of an effort to recruit more
affluent patients.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, passed by Congress with bipartisan support, protects
Medicaid patients who live in nursing homes that decide to withdraw
from the program.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new law, if a nursing home decides to pull out of
Medicaid, it must continue to care for people who live in the home,
including those who may later qualify for medical assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid helps pay the bills for two-thirds of the 1.6 million
people in nursing homes in the United States. Though it is
generally perceived as a program for low-income Americans, it also
covers many middle-class people who deplete their assets in old
age.
</P>
<P>
   Families can easily exhaust their assets on nursing home care
because the costs average more than $110 a day nationwide, and much
more than that in urban areas like New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation results directly from the efforts of a Florida
couple who fought back when a nursing home in Tampa tried to evict
54 Medicaid patients.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, Nelson and Geri Mongiovi, went to court to stop the
evictions last March. And they went to Congress for help. The
problem was well defined, and Congress responded faster than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Mongiovi, a retired letter carrier who was at the White House
for Thursday's signing ceremony, said the law came too late to help
his mother, Adela Mongiovi, who died in November at the age of 93.
But he said, ``This bill is a good memorial to her and will help
thousands of other people.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill was pushed through Congress by three lawmakers from
Florida: Sen. Bob Graham, a Democrat, and Reps. Michael Bilirakis,
a Republican, and Jim Davis, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nursing homes would accept Medicaid patients, then change the
rules in the middle of the game and dump them on the street,''
Graham said. ``These evictions have a devastating effect on senior
citizens. The death rate for people uprooted in this way is two or
three times as high as for those who receive continuous care.''
</P>
<P>
   Bilirakis said: ``This law closes a legal loophole that allows
nursing homes to evict their most vulnerable residents. It puts
patients ahead of profits.''
</P>
<P>
   The nursing home industry supported the bill. But Linda Keegan,
vice president of the American Health Care Association, which
represents nursing homes, said, ``We will see more and more nursing
homes opt out of Medicaid because of the inadequacy of Medicaid
payments,'' which are set by the states.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid generally pays nursing homes less than the rates paid
by Medicare, private insurance and families who pay entirely with
their own money.
</P>
<P>
   Toby Edelman, a lawyer at the National Senior Citizens Law
Center, praised the bill signed Thursday. But she said Congress
should pass a comprehensive bill to prevent nursing homes from
discriminating against Medicaid beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Few nursing homes withdraw entirely from Medicaid,'' she said,
``but many limit their participation by certifying only a small
number of beds for Medicaid. They discriminate against Medicaid
beneficiaries by denying them admission. And if a person is
admitted as a private patient and later becomes eligible for
Medicaid, the person may be told that `no Medicaid beds are
available.'''
</P>
<P>
   Whether a nursing home may enforce such restrictions has been a
question in several lawsuits around the country. States have taken
different positions on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The new law would not require nursing homes to accept Medicaid
patients. But if a nursing home participates in Medicaid and
decides to withdraw, it may not evict those Medicaid patients it
already has. And it would have to inform new patients, at the time
of admission, that it did not accept Medicaid payments.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence of the inadequacy of nursing home rates, Bruce
Yarwood, legislative counsel for the American Health Care
Association, said that ``69 percent of nursing home residents rely
on Medicaid for their care, but Medicaid accounts for only 48
percent of nursing home revenue.''

THE DIZZYING REALM OF ASIAN ART  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Del., N.J. )   By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Asia'' doesn't exist and it never has. It isn't a
place or culture; it's a geopolitical fiction, a patchwork of
people, climates and languages stitched together lightly, and only
here and there, by the bright thread of Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
   Yet something called ``Asian art'' has taken New York by subtle
force in the last few years, sweeping aside cultural and political
distinctions. Its presence is especially evident during these early
spring days, in what has come to be known in the art world as Asia
Week.
</P>
<P>
   Asian auctions have been in progress at Christie's and
Sotheby's. The International Asian Art Fair has arrived _ with a
tinkle of cymbals and a rustle of big money _ at the Seventh
Regiment Armory. Asian work of every size, shape and function can
be found in galleries from the Upper East Side to Chinatown.
</P>
<P>
   All this hoopla is new. Just a few years ago, a graduate student
could visit Sotheby's Asian previews and puzzle undisturbed for
hours over Sanskrit inscriptions and the tantalizing odds and ends.
Now the odds and ends have been replaced by the ``important''
property, and a buzz of acquisitiveness is in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Why Asian art now? There are many reasons. Buyers, institutional
and private, are realizing that they can pick up a drop-dead
masterpiece from India, Tibet or China for a small fraction of what
a third-rate Italian Renaissance painting costs, not to mention a
goodish Picasso.
</P>
<P>
   Although Asian art is still widely considered a specialist's
realm, it is becoming clear that the scholar, the dealer and the
casual shopper are all, at some level, neophytes. Asian art is not
a field; it is a universe. If you are deeply conversant with one
facet of it, you are likely to be in the dark about another. In the
face of its endless beauties and challenges, everyone gets a chance
to be star-struck and enthralled.
</P>
<P>
   The International Asian Art Fair
</P>
<P>
   Being enthralled is a lot of what a visit to the International
Asian Art Fair is about. In its fourth year, it remains the
hands-down best art fair in New York. Many of the premier European
and U.S. dealers are present. The quality of the work is high, the
variety wide. The show feels good: the pleasure principle is at
work, but so is the intellectual excitement of seeing things for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The art of India, for example, may start to find the audience it
deserves. Visitors will be stopped in their tracks by the carving
of an 11th-century temple dancer, her hair a mass of twisting vines
and blossoms, at Doris Wiener. The South Indian bronze figure of
Kali, with her avid face and tiny fangs, at Chinese Porcelain Co.
along with the Gandharan head of a young man with cushiony lips at
Spink are also likely to cause a pileup.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also quieter rarities: an exquisite Gupta period
bronze Jain figure at John Eskenazi, for example, and a set of
pages from a 12th-century palm-leaf manuscript, with iconic
paintings and the most beautiful script you've ever seen, at the
booth of Sam Fogg, a London dealer who is one of this year's prize
new participants.
</P>
<P>
   Ancient China is represent by a Northern Qi limestone
bodhisattva at R.H. Ellsworth, as slender and upright as a sapling;
by a lustrous gilt Buddha, hands held above head, at A.&AMP;J.
Speelman, and by a pair of Tang period tomb doors etched with
figures at the booth of the Brussels dealer Gisele Croes.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars' utensils are on view in cool, clean installations at
Nicholas Grindley and China 2000 Fine Art. The latter gallery adds
contemporary work by the Chinese-American artist Arlan Huang to its
forward-looking mix. New work also finds a voice at Art Forum
Singapore, another first-time participant, and at Michael Goedhuis,
in calligraphic paintings by the Beijing artist Gu Gan.
</P>
<P>
   As a kind of preview to the exhibition of 19th- and early
20th-century Meiji period Japanese art set to open at the First USA
Riverfront Arts Center in Wilmington, Del., next month, the London
dealer Malcolm Fairley has brought examples of enameled vases that
are the Asian equivalent of high Victoriana. You may never have
seen much of this work before, and you may not be wild about it if
you have, but it is one more piece to add to the fascinating mosaic
that is the Asian Art Fair.
</P>
<P>
   Eskenazi at Pace Wildenstein
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the European dealers visiting New York are at the
armory. Giuseppe Eskenazi, who specializes in the art of ancient
China and is in from London, has set up shop in the Pace
Wildenstein premises on 57th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Eskenazi is at the top of the field, and anyone who saw his
first New York show in 1997 may still feel a bit lightheaded at the
memory. This year's selection of bronzes and ceramics is pretty
wonderful, too.
</P>
<P>
   Among the larger pieces is a bronze bell from the Shang period
(circa 1400 to 1000 B.C.), set upright, like a downward-tapering
vase, its surface studded with nipple-like nobs and incised with
animal-mask meander patterns. Imposing in a different way is a pair
of unglazed earthenware guardian figures from the Tang dynasty (7th
to 10th century A.D.), the ferocity of their faces softened by
their hands-on-hips disco poses and their dainty armor, all sashes
and ruffs and incised chrysanthemums
</P>
<P>
   Smaller pieces should not be overlooked. One is a bronze Shang
tiger plaque inlaid with wafer-thin chips of turquoise (the coiled
hemp twine that holds the turquoise in place is still visible);
another, a crouching male clay figure in a pill-box hat, seems to
bow in good-natured, deferential welcome.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   J.J. Lally &AMP; Company
</P>
<P>
   Several New York galleries have rustled up special displays for
Asia Week. China 2000 and M.D. Flacks have furniture, Weisbrod
Chinese Art a melange of jades, E &AMP; J Frankel a selection of board
games from the Tang dynasty to Made-in-Hong Kong modern. Opening
Friday at Taipei Gallery in midtown Manhattan is a survey of
contemporary ceramics from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Outstanding is the exhibition at J.J. Lally &AMP; Co. Oriental Art
of jades, bronzes and ceramics in the Fuller Building on 57th
Street. One of its highlights is a minute phoenix pendant from the
Warring States period (475 to 221 B.C.), a frozen burst of
unfurling energy. Another is the tiny image of a mythical beast
known as a bixie, which looks like a cross between a toad and a pug
and is cut from a brown-and-green stone.
</P>
<P>
   Rossi &AMP; Rossi at Sotheby's
</P>
<P>
   Downstairs from Lally, the London gallery Rossi &AMP; Rossi, in
collaboration with Sotheby's, has installed ``Sacred Symbols: The
Ritual Art of Tibet,'' a spectacular gathering of objects, from
ceremonial implements to theater costumes to a priest's umbrella
made from peacock-feather filament wrapped around silk thread.
</P>
<P>
   One room is devoted to the psycho-symbolic dynamism of tantric
imagery and includes, among other treasures, an ebony ritual dagger
standing on point in its base, its surface alive with slithering
snakes and protectively repellent faces.
</P>
<P>
   In Tibetan art, the sacred and secular are impossible to
separate.
</P>
<P>
   Two gilt bronze kneeling deers look like fantastic garden
sculptures; in fact, they originally flanked a Buddhist Wheel of
the Law atop a temple. The same wheel appears in a silk embroidered
altar cloth of immense visual panache. A lama's glazed lacquer
summer hat exudes a haute couture flair. So does a pair of
his-and-hers silk and leather gloves with long, fabric fingernails;
they were meant to be worn by dancers portraying skeletons animated
by tantric bliss.
</P>
<P>
   If a New York museum had a permanent display of this material,
some of it unfamiliar even to experts, people would flock to see it
(as they should be doing to the stunning Tibetan collection at the
Newark Museum, a quick ride under the Hudson River on the PATH
train). As it is, ``Sacred Symbols'' runs only through next week.
</P>
<P>
   It leaves behind an excellent catalog by Robert Thurman and
David Weldon, a useful addition to the growing literature on the
art of Tibet, which has been one of the stronger sales fields in
the Asian market recently, and accounts for two awesome items at
this week's auctions: a large gilt bronze 14th- to 15th-century
guardian figure at Christie's and a 36-armed Tibeto-Chinese figure
of the deity Yamantaka at Sotheby's. Japan Society Gallery
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who assumes from the Eskenazi and Rossi &AMP; Rossi shows
that Europe has a corner on Asian riches need only visit
``Crosscurrents: Masterpieces of East Asian Art From New York
Private Collections'' at Japan Society to learn otherwise. Here the
world-class strength of New York collecting in this material is
confirmed once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   Organized with the Brooklyn Museum of Art by Amy G. Poster and
supplemented by a fine book, the show is a revelation. It opens,
appropriately, with a Japanese image: a heart-lifting 13th-century
wood carving of the bodhisattva Jizo, protector of travelers and
children. On loan from the collection of Dr. and Mrs. Robert
Dickes, he holds the wish-granting gem of wisdom in his hand and
closes his eyes in reverie.
</P>
<P>
   But on this occasion, Japan Society opens its arms to art from
across East Asia, tracing influences that connected cultures, yet
left them distinctive. Buddhism is one such link, embodied in the
Jizo figure, in a magnificent Korean hanging scroll, dated 1565,
from the Mary and Jackson Burke Foundation, and in a marble carving
of a seated Chinese lohan, or disciple of the Buddha, an emblem of
alert introspection, from the Robert Rosenkrantz Collection.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds are also found in tea connoisseurship and the literati
arts of painting and calligraphy. The tea ceremony is celebrated
with an installation of utensils from China, Korea and Japan owned
by Peggy and Richard Danziger; calligraphy in a set of rubbings
from the Chunhua Pavilion copybook, which preserves the work of the
fourth-century fathers of the Chinese calligraphic tradition. On
loan from the Robert Hatfield Ellsworth Collection, these volumes,
stamped with generations of imperial seals, are historical
documents beyond price.
</P>
<P>
   They certainly give a dramatic sense of an impressive base that
a new generation of American collectors is building on. And the
show points to promising directions that the Japan Society Gallery
is taking under its new director, Alexandra Munroe, who is putting
a treasured if sometimes reticent institution back on the art-world
map. Kaikodo
</P>
<P>
   A handful of other locations are firmly on that map. Kaikodo, a
gallery established three years ago by the Japanese-based art
historians Mary Ann and Howard Rogers, boasts one of the most
beautiful commercial art spaces in the city, and it is filled with
intriguing works for a show titled ``In the Company of Spirits.''
</P>
<P>
   Among them is a solid selection of classical Chinese painting,
not so often seen in bulk since Christie's and Sotheby's moved
their primary sales of this material to Hong Kong. Among the
standouts at Kaikodo are a delicate Southern Song fan painting,
pure distilled nostalgia, and an amusing 18th-century scroll of
cavorting frogs dressed as Shinto priests.
</P>
<P>
   As at Japan Society, Kaikodo's selection is ``Asian'' in the
cross-cultural sense, with a flair-mouthed Japanese Neolithic jar,
a Vietnamese pot and a snazzy little tiger-striped Chinese dish
keeping company. But the piece de resistance, concealed from
immediate view behind a screen, is a pair of furious-looking Tang
tomb guardians of glazed earthenware with rays of spiritual power
shooting straight up out of their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Kaikodo produces substantial catalogs with essays by leading art
historians that make a valuable contribution to Asian studies. (The
current catalog includes an article on Chinese erotica by James
Cahill and an interesting first-hand account of two decades of
auctions of Chinese art by Arnold Chang.)

KOSOVO HOLDS SPECIAL PLACE IN SERBIAN HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With its rugged hills and poor villages, Kosovo
appears an unlikely place for Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
to make his stand against NATO.
</P>
<P>
   But to Serbian nationalists, a bitter history spanning 600 years
has raised Kosovo's symbolic importance to that of Jerusalem for
Christians and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo lies at the heart of who we are as a people,'' said
Jelena Budjevac, spokeswoman for the Serbian Unity Congress, a
Washington-based lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, one of two states that make up
the Balkan nation of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million residents are ethnic
Albanians, who are predominantly Muslim. Serbians are mostly
Orthodox Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Budjevac said every Serbian child grows up hearing the story of
the Battle of Kosovo Polje, or the ``Fields of Blackbirds.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1389, a powerful army of Ottoman Turks, intent on spreading
Islam to Europe, was pushing its way through southern Europe. But
on June 28, the Turks were met by Serbian Prince Lazar, a
Christian, and his much smaller army.
</P>
<P>
   Lazar and his men were defeated, although they inflicted immense
losses on the Ottomans. After the battle, Lazar was taken prisoner
and beheaded, and his men were executed. The Serbian defeat opened
the way for an Ottoman advance into Europe, an incursion that
lasted another 300 years until it was checked at the gates of
Vienna, Austria.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat in Kosovo became a central myth for Serbian
nationalists over then next five centuries, said Charles King, a
history professor at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   For the Serbs, the Battle of Kosovo came to symbolize the choice
of death rather than compromise with an enemy, and the emotional
call to ``avenge Kosovo'' resonated during the Serbs' long struggle
for independence from the Ottoman Empire, King said.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of revolts, Serbia finally won autonomy from the
Ottomans in 1830 and was placed under the protection of Russia's
Slavic rulers. In 1878, Serbia was granted complete independence.
</P>
<P>
   But throughout this time Kosovo remained a part of the Ottoman
Empire, and the province's Albanian population increased and
eventually dominated the area as many Serbs migrated to other parts
of the Balkan region. The Ottomans and Albanians also
systematically destroyed dozens of Serbian churches and
monasteries.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1914, as World War I engulfed Europe and the Ottoman
Empire, Serbia seized Kosovo, and its remaining Serbian residents
welcomed the troops as liberators.
</P>
<P>
   Following the war, the Balkan region's many nations and ethnic
groups, including Serbia and Kosovo, were cobbled together by the
victorious Allies to form what would become Yugoslavia. The
nationalities lived in a state of mutual hostility and sporadic
fighting until Nazi Germany and fascist Italy invaded during World
War II, brutally suppressing the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Following the war, Serbia and Kosovo became part of communist
Yugoslavia under the leadership of Josip Broz Tito, whose
strong-arm tactics kept the ancient ethnic hatreds at bay.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Tito granted Kosovo partial autonomy, a formula that
worked until Tito's death in 1980 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   But as Yugoslavia started to unravel in the late 1980s,
Milosevic _ then the leader of Serbia _ dismantled the province's
freedom. That sparked a growing rebel movement, leading Milosevic
last year to send in police and army units to brutally crush the
ethnic Albanian independence movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fight to keep Kosovo a part of Serbia has been going on
for centuries, and that is something the American people should
know as they send their planes against us,'' Budjevac said.

   China Institute in America
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, and immensely important, is the contribution of China
Institute, a few blocks away, which every season mounts
small-scale, closely focused exhibitions of a kind rarely seen in
museums, but are the lifeblood of art-historical research and a
connoisseur's delight.
</P>
<P>
   Its current offering, ``A Literati Life in the 20th Century:
Wang Fang Yu, Artist, Scholar, Connoisseur,'' is a scholarly show
within a show. It is dedicated to the life and work of Wang Fang Yu
(1913-1997), a Chinese-born linguist who come to the United States
in 1945 and gained a reputation as a pre-eminent calligrapher.
</P>
<P>
   In the venerable literati tradition, he was also an art
historian. He rediscovered the ouevre of the Qing painter Bada
Shanren, and championed the work of the modern painters Qi Baishi
and Zhang Daqian. When he died, Wang was planning an exhibition
that would compare the work of these artists, tracing a pedigree in
which he included himself. The China Institute show, organized by
H. Christopher Luce, goes a long way toward fulfilling his goal,
and touches on issues of imitation and forgery that have made
Chinese painting a commercial and academic minefield. Asia Society
</P>
<P>
   Like China Institute, Asia Society often concentrates on
in-depth investigations of specific topics. Such is the case with
``Bamboo Masterworks: Japanese Baskets From the Lloyd Cotsen
Collection.'' In this selection, organized by Mary Hunt Kahlenberg,
an art usually relegated to the category of craft is revealed to be
an astonishingly versatile sculptural medium in which light, space
and planar complexity play a dynamic role.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan Museum of Art
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Museum, usually blockbuster country, also finds
room for pocket-size exhibitions, and one of them is a selection of
Indian drawings from the late 16th century to the early 19th
century, organized by Steven Kossak in the Irving Galleries for the
Arts of South and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Whether done in Mughal ateliers or Rajput courts, the rough
sketches and half-finished paintings demonstrate the painstaking
process that underlies the art of the Indian miniature. Few of the
drawings are complete in themselves, as in a head of Krishna from
around 1800. With his eyes shaped like lotus petals and his nose,
ears and fashionable turban studded with jewels, he is both a
cartoon for a mural and a polished image that could not be improved
upon.
</P>
<P>
   The Fashion Institute of Technology
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with even a so-so appetite for jewels and fashion should
head straight downtown to the Fashion Institute of Technology where
the smashing ``China Chic: East Meets West'' will rattle any
remaining illusions about the sacrosanct, timeless character of
Asian culture.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's director, Valerie Steele, has assembled a
scintillating collection of Chinese and Chinese-inspired clothes.
It ranges from imperial Qing robes to a slinky 1934 Anna May Wong
gown (on loan from the apparently bottomless holdings of the
Brooklyn Museum). From the 1990s comes a Vivienne Tam Buddha dress,
Donna Karan's version of a Maoist worker's suit and Christian
Lacroix's take on the classic slit-skirt qi pao, itself a mix of
Chinese, Manchu and Western styles. Add an entertaining catalog and
you have a definite don't-miss list candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Arts of Pacific Asia Show
</P>
<P>
   Not far from the institute, the semiannual Arts of Pacific Asia
Show is in the 69th Regiment Armory. A downtown, down-market
version of the Asian Art Fair, the show is geared primarily to the
cash-and-carry transaction: it is light on big-time masterworks,
but dense with objects that might serve as decorative accessories
for the home.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty to look at, particularly in the area of East
Asian export wares, fabrics (some beauties) and small Tibetan
objects (at Moke Mokotoff Gallery, for example). Viewers needing an
additional fix of Chinese chic should check out the booth of the
London textile dealer Linda Wriggleworth. Contemporary Chinese art
is well-represented at Ethan Cohen Fine Arts, where work by Wenda
Gu, Xu Bing and Lin Tian-miao, all of whom were in Asia's Society's
recent ``Inside/Out'' exhibition, can be found.
</P>
<P>
   Tibet House Cultural Center
</P>
<P>
   Farther west is the new headquarters of Tibet House, with a
pretty shrine room and a spacious gallery. On exhibit are 20 modern
embroidered thangkas produced in the Nechung Monastery, now in
Dharamsala, India.
</P>
<P>
   In Dharamsala, the Dalai Lama, who has tacitly encouraged the
collecting of ancient Tibetan art in the West as a means of
preserving the culture, is trying to keep a tradition of religious
art alive. The hangings at Tibet House, in silk and brocade
applique, adhere to long-established forms and techniques. And it
is interesting to remember that the glorious Tibetan fabric works
at Rossi &AMP; Rossi and the Art Fair were once as spanking new as
these.
</P>
<P>
   Museum of Chinese in the Americas
</P>
<P>
   Finally, what better place to end Asia Week than at the Museum
of Chinese in the Americas in Chinatown? The museum, under the
directorship of Fay Chew Matsuda, has an evocative permanent
installation, set in a lantern-shaped design by the architect
Billie Tsien, in which artifacts of Chinese life in New York
decades ago _ shop signs, irons, hope chests, passports, religious
objects _ sit side by side.
</P>
<P>
   The special exhibition on view, ``A Good Place to Land One's
Feet: Brooklyn's New Chinese Community,'' is documentary in
character. But the museum often highlights work by Chinese-American
artists, including Arlan Huang, who is at the International Asian
Art Fair. Chinatown is a vibrant Asian art fair in itself.
</P>
<P>
   In the Buddhist way of thinking, all things are interdependent,
and that is certainly true of art. The objects that fill the
windows of Chinatown's shops _ secular and religious, vivacious,
seductive, hilariously over the top _ have direct connections to
much of the high-priced fare on Park Avenue. Who is to say that the
art in Chinatown is less valuable or beautiful? Who could not be
grateful that it is in New York on permanent display?

A FEELING WE'RE NOT IN SPRINGFIELD ... 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lisa Simpson would be charmed by ``Futurama,'' but her brother
Bart might reach for the clicker to see what else was on. That's
just a guess. For a better bead on Bart's preferences, you'd have
to ask a certified expert, like Matt Groening.
</P>
<P>
   He, of course, invented Bart, Lisa and their ubiquitous family.
Now, nine years (several generations in television terms) after
``The Simpsons'' became a national institution, Groening has put
his imprimatur on a second animated Fox series, ``Futurama,'' a
look at life in the year 3000.
</P>
<P>
   You can have your own look on Sunday night, when the new show is
introduced right after ``The Simpsons.'' (It gets one more booster
shot on the following Sunday before moving into its slot on
Tuesdays, starting on April 6.) In Sunday's pilot episode, the only
sample of the series provided for review, you'll meet Fry, a
slacker of the current era who delivers pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Making a delivery to a Manhattan cryogenics lab on New Year's
Eve 1999, he is accidentally frozen. When he thaws out exactly
1,000 years later, this mope doesn't seem to mind being in another
millennium: ``I had nothing to live for in my old life.''
</P>
<P>
   He is quickly befriended by an assertive alien named Leela, who
is comely despite having one eye (``I don't have good depth
perception''), and by a hard-drinking robot named Bender. He bends
things.
</P>
<P>
   Is it unfair to use ``The Simpsons'' as a yardstick to measure
the new show? Old Sophocles probably lamented: ``Come on, guys,
don't compare it to `Antigone.' Just tell me how you like the new
one, about the king and his mama.'' But the temptation is
irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance you'll see a similarity in the way the
characters are rendered on ``Futurama'' and ``The Simpsons.'' They
each have a pair of those trademark googly Groening eyes. (All
except Leela, of course.) And as Fry keeps getting bonked on the
head by malfunctioning high-tech doors of tomorrow, you may expect
to hear him groan a Homeresque ``Doh!'' But you won't. Because
you're not in Springfield anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Visually, the world of ``Futurama'' is much richer than that of
the Simpsons. Unlike their two-dimensional landscape, this one has
depth and a palette of richly subtle colors. The look is more
inviting and the animation more sophisticated, as in the scenes of
Fry's trip across town in the subway's successor, a giant pneumatic
tube.
</P>
<P>
   But the writing, from the conception of the characters forward,
lacks the bite of its predecessor. A root of the Simpsons' appeal
is that under their crayon-colored faces are people far more real
than those on any other current sitcom. They're lifted (with a bit
of inspired exaggeration) right out of real life. The characters in
``Futurama'' are right out of a hundred movies and television
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Fry and Leela are a couple of misfits hurled (but not too
roughly) by fate from adventure to adventure with their comical
sidekick. And while there is more wit in five minutes of
``Futurama'' than in five months' worth of most network series,
this feels like a good-natured, loving homage to the adventure
genre, from Flash Gordon to ``Speed.'' D'ja hear that, Bart?
Loving, for crying out loud.
</P>
<P>
   Is this the work of the same guy? Well, yes and no. Groening,
who makes a Hitchcockian cameo appearance on Sunday, ``developed''
the series and wrote the pilot with David X. Cohen, a veteran of
``The Simpsons'' and ``Beavis and Butt-head.'' But an animated show
like this is the work of many hands and minds.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Futurama'' credits list 13 people besides Groening and
Cohen whose titles include the word producer. This team clearly had
its own set of goals.
</P>
<P>
   It also had its own set of voices. Fry's comes from Billy West,
a hard-working cartoon actor who has played both members of some
famous pairs: Bugs and Elmer, Ren and Stimpy. His Fry has the sound
of a generic Saturday-morning good guy. His co-star has one of the
most familiar voices on television. She is Katey Sagal, who was Peg
Bundy on ``Married ... With Children.'' While her Leela is far
smarter and more sensitive, you may find it hard not to see Peg in
your mind's eye (with or without depth perception).
</P>
<P>
   Does ``Futurama'' work? The answer is, you should excuse the
expression, in the future. If those 15 producers and their
countless associates can bolster their good intentions with some
more comic fire, this richly drawn show could become, if not a
cultural watershed, at least a weekly habit. &QL;

BOLIVIAN DRIVERS INVOKE A SPECIAL SAFETY FEATURE: DIVINE
INTERVENTION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COPACABANA, Bolivia _ They drive from all over Bolivia, Peru and
even northern Argentina to this remote town on the shore of Lake
Titicaca _ taxi drivers, truck drivers and other motorists seeking
a priest's blessings for protection against drunken drivers,
landslides, bad brakes and broken axles.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning and afternoon, but particularly on Sundays,
Copacabana's central plaza becomes a jammed parking lot of
rattletrap buses and minivans splotched with mud from long, arduous
journeys through the Andean highlands.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers drape their side-view mirrors and bumpers with
colorful ribbons and bushels of pink and white gladiolus. They
sprinkle their hoods with the petals of white roses. Then they give
their tires a spritz of Bolivian champagne, beer or, for those on a
budget, mineral water.
</P>
<P>
   The pilgrims don't drive home until one of six Franciscan
priests sprinkles holy water on their dressed-up vehicles and says
a prayer asking for divine intervention against everything from
accidents to faulty directions and gas shortages.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is better than car insurance,'' said Mario Kempy Avelo,
23, who drove his new minivan from La Paz as part of his
preparations in starting a taxi business. ``I can't afford any
accidents, so I came as an act of faith.''
</P>
<P>
   No one keeps exact statistics, but Bolivian experts on folklore
say the number of motorists who make the pilgrimage to this town
12,000 feet above sea level every year easily reaches into the tens
of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of the pilgrimage makes it the most important
source of income for this town of 5,000 people. Banks stay open on
Sundays to accommodate travelers. Indian women selling miniatures
of the Virgin Mary, flowers and other paraphernalia for the vehicle
blessings do a brisk business.
</P>
<P>
   The makeshift grave sites that mark virtually every twist and
turn on Andean roads, often from head-on collisions between crowded
buses and impatient drivers trying to pass, offer ample motivation
for many to make the drive here as a preventive measure. Meanwhile,
drunk driving is also a big problem in the cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere you look there are fender-benders, landslides and
worse,'' said Antonia Canaviri de Soliz, 30, who drove three hours
through a driving rain early one morning with her husband from La
Paz to christen their new taxi cab. ``But when you believe, the
Virgin remains by your side and protects you.''
</P>
<P>
   The custom of driving to Copacabana as a religious rite began in
the 1950s, when a sweeping government land redistribution program
put money in the pockets of the rural masses and created a new
class of drivers. But the ritual has its roots much further in the
past, with the ancient Aymara and Inca Indians, who made
pilgrimages to Copacabana a central part of their lives long before
the Spanish conquistadors arrived here.
</P>
<P>
   Copacabana's holiness originated from its proximity to where the
ancient Andean Indians believed the universe was created: on the
Island of the Sun, a short boat ride from the town's rocky beach.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians came to Copacabana from throughout South America's
central highlands _ journeys that sometimes lasted months _ to
sacrifice white llamas and vicunas to their gods, especially to
Pachamama, the Earth Mother, to whom they relied for the fertility
of their soil. They also had a custom, still called the Ch'alla
(pronounced CHAH-yah), of sprinkling sugary and alcoholic beverages
on their possessions for good luck, and burying llama fetuses under
their houses for divine protection.
</P>
<P>
   When the conquistadors arrived in the mid-16th century, the
Spaniards first tried to ban the Indian rituals as unsavory
paganism, and they covered Indian idols in the center of Copacabana
with a huge Moorish-style cathedral graced by tile domes that still
glisten in the sun. The Indians were largely won over to
Catholicism in the 1580s, after Francisco Tito Yupanqui, a grandson
of an Incan emperor, said he saw an apparition of the Virgin and
carved her likeness.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Virgin of Candelaria, which is today lodged above
the Copacabana cathedral's altar, remains one of the holiest relics
in all of South America _ and, naturally, a must visit for all the
drivers who come here for divine guidance and protection.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the Virgin's almost immediate popularity in colonial
times, the Spanish were forced to accept a mixing of Indian
religion and Christianity, in part to suppress rebelliousness,
leaving customs that exist to this day. Bolivians still bury the
fetuses of llamas under their homes, and sprinkle alcoholic
beverages on each corner of their house foundations for good luck.
David Mendoza Salazar, a sociologist who works on government
culture programs, said those rituals and the customary drive to
Copacabana for auto blessings complete with alcohol and flowers
``shows that the Aymara traditions still live on in Bolivia.'' He
added, ``Obviously the customs do not take the exact form they did
in precolonial times, but the essence continues.''
</P>
<P>
   The drivers and priests here said they recognized the ancient
origins of their vehicle blessings. But they left no doubt that
their religious faith was unalloyed Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect the Indian past and traditions,'' said Mario Lara,
26, who made the six-hour drive from the Bolivian city of
Cochabamba to christen his newly bought used 1990 Toyota Corolla.
``But that's not why I am here. I'm here for the Virgin and her
protection.''

NASCAR'S OTHER RACE IS FOR MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By PATRICK ZIER   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASCAR has become a money game. To win big in Winston Cup, you
need big bucks.
</P>
<P>
   So far this season, all five races have been won by drivers from
two multi-car teams.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon, who probably has more financial resources to draw
on than anyone in the sport, has won twice for Rick Hendrick.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Burton also became a two-time winner Sunday in the
rain-shortened race at Darlington, S.C., and his teammate, Mark
Martin, has a win as well.
</P>
<P>
   Burton and Martin are the top cars in Jack Roush's five-car
stable, and while they do not have the money available to Gordon,
they are not far behind.
</P>
<P>
   Various estimates place the amount spent on Gordon's car at
around $50 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   And the cost to major sponsors looking to associate themselves
with name drivers has been rising steadily.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt Jr., who has yet to drive a Winston Cup race, has
been signed by Budweiser for a reported $10 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   That figure now seems to be the going rate for a primary sponsor
on a top car.
</P>
<P>
   The huge financial discrepancy between NASCAR's top teams and
those struggling to keep up is a source of concern in the garage,
but Bill France, NASCAR's president, does not seem worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the law of supply and demand,'' France said. ``We can't
regulate how much a company is willing to put into a car.
</P>
<P>
   France said that if a company's value has increased in recent
years, so should its willingness to spend more to sponsor a car.
``It's true the numbers have gone up considerably of late, but the
cost of a loaf of bread has increased, too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While that may be true, as sponsorship dollars shoot up, fewer
and fewer companies have the ability to support a Winston Cup
operation.
</P>
<P>
   And sponsors, no matter how much they're paying, still expect
their cars to compete with Gordon and Martin and Burton.
</P>
<P>
   They want exposure, and when they don't get it, they often drop
out.
</P>
<P>
   Budweiser, for example, is leaving Hendrick and driver Wally
Dallenbach to go with the young Earnhardt because it is
dissatisfied with the performance of its car in Hendrick's
operation, where it consistently runs a poor third to Gordon and
Terry Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing is happening at Roush Racing, where Jack Roush is
already looking for new sources of income for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of Martin and Burton, Roush's other three cars are
essentially not competitive and their sponsors are getting uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a company is putting millions into a car, they don't want
to hear that you'll be competitive in three years,'' France said.
``They want to see that car run up front now.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we try to do through the rules is keep everything as
equal as we can so a team getting $10 million doesn't have that
much of an advantage over somebody getting less,'' France said.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the best teams may have an advantage, I don't think the
gap between the cars up front and those running in back is that
much,'' France said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't one huge drop. You don't go from cars getting $10
million to cars with virtually nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes down in increments. Somebody's getting $10 million,
somebody else is getting $8 million, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's remained pretty competitive,'' France said. ``If
you look at what's happening, the cars are all pretty close.''
</P>
<P>
   While that may be true in terms of qualifying, where the cars
often do run very close to the same speed from front to back, it
doesn't hold up once the racing starts.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the Gordons and Martins and a couple others move in to
take charge.
</P>
<P>
   That's because while everyone understands the basics of putting
a fast car on the track, it's the ability to fine tune, to adjust,
that usually makes the difference in the race. The top teams have a
decided edge there because they are better able to pay attention to
detail.
</P>
<P>
   And they are better able to pay attention to detail because they
have bigger budgets which allows them to come to the track better
prepared.
</P>
<P>
   In Winston Cup, money doesn't talk. It roars.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   The weather in the Southeast and Middle Atlantic region will
begin to sour Friday as low pressure develops along the Carolina
Coast. A chilly, moist flow from the ocean will ascend the east
slopes of the Smokies and the southern Blue Ridge mountains causing
rain to change to wet snow, especially above 2,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   A cold rain will dampen southern Virginia and much of North
Carolina with showers expected farther south into sections of
Georgia and South Carolina. Sleet may mix with rain along the
Piedmont plateau. Clouds and drizzle will persist in parts of
eastern Tennessee. A cold front will push slowly through Florida,
preceded by some showers.
</P>
<P>
   Expansive high pressure stretching from Ontario to northeast
Texas will bring mainly sunny skies and seasonable temperatures. It
will be a very cool morning in the lower Mississippi Valley and a
rather mild afternoon in the northern Plains. Gusty winds from the
south will transport warm air from Dakotas into Canada, quickening
the snow melt.

   Damp conditions are likely in the Rio Grande Valley and southern
Rockies as moisture is drawn inland from the Gulf of Mexico.
Showers will fall mainly in west Texas and eastern New Mexico. A
cold front moving into the northern Rockies will trigger a few
showers. Onshore winds in western Washington will cause some rain.
</P>
<P>
   The disturbance that brought rain to southern California
Thursday will move into northern Baja taking most of the damp
weather into Mexico. Some clouds will linger over the deserts of
the Southwest. &QL;

<P>
   Focus: Dry Spell &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thursday marked the sixteenth consecutive day without
precipitation at La Crosse, Wis. Though there have been longer dry
spells in town history, the current streak is unusual because of
the time of year it is occurring.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, early spring is a time when jet stream winds, which
energize and direct wet low pressure systems, typically blow with
great gusto over the northern-tier states, giving the upper Middle
West regular doses of precipitation. But for the last two weeks or
so, the jet stream has detoured north and south around a high
pressure system stalled over the region.

PENETRATING THE MYSTERY OF A MOTHER'S SILENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rodger Kamenetz's mother refused to speak to her children and
husband in the last stages of the cancer that, after long and
brutal suffering, killed her. As Kamenetz describes it in this
hypnotic, cryptically lyrical memoir, her decision to remain mute
had a mysterious and deeply disturbing power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our game was to guess at the meaning of her silence,''
Kamenetz writes, ``to weigh this nonspeech and feel its contours.
Because she was dying, her silence had an artistic quality. We
felt, as we often do before a tombstone, or a poem, that it must
mean something more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Terra Infirma,'' Kamenetz's meditation on his mother, her
stubborn willfulness and the inspiring yet destructive power of her
love, has many reflective passages like that one. His book in this
sense is no ``Mommie Dearest,'' no mere expose of the harm a
demanding and unreasonable parent can do. It is not a medical
history about a patient and her family facing awful choices either,
though such a history is included.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terra Infirma'' is not a narrative in the standard sense of a
chronological ordering of events. It is inclined to circle its main
subject in a poetic meandering through the meaning and the mystery
of a particular mother's character and the way it imprints itself
on her son.
</P>
<P>
   Kamenetz's slender volume is an impressively intelligent,
maturely perceptive and learned meandering, and it has made for a
strange and moving book.
</P>
<P>
   Kamenetz, who teaches literature at Louisiana State University
and has published three collections of poetry, gained a good deal
of attention with his previous book, ``The Jew in the Lotus.''
Inspired by a famous dialogue between the Dalai Lama and a group of
Jewish religious leaders, the book examines the spiritual
commonality of Buddhism and Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   His new book, though far more personal, has much of the verbal
flair and intellectual range of the earlier work even if Kamenetz's
refusal to spare us dreadful scenes and searing memories also makes
it at times painful to read.
</P>
<P>
   Early on he reflects that no story could be ``more sentimental
than the death of a boy's mother.'' In fact, Kamenetz brings to his
subject unsparing psychological insight and a quality of
naturalistic observation that is the opposite of sentimental.
</P>
<P>
   The first main subject that he explores is the enigma of his
mother's past. Neither he nor his four brothers and sisters knew
the basics of her biography, which, until one magical night when
his mortally sick mother finally told her story, had remained a
dark secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my life, I'd felt my mother's sadness as a song without
lyrics,'' Kamenetz writes. ``The sadness was all that her secrecy
would allow; the lyrics _ the actual facts, were denied us.'' When,
finally, the facts of his mother's life are revealed, they open a
pungent and melancholy history, including the insanity of a mother,
the brutality of a father and incidents of abandonment that chased
each other from one generation to another.
</P>
<P>
   These facts enable Kamenetz for the first time to perceive the
deep roots of his mother's desperate possessiveness. They also lead
him to the conclusion that his mother's story was ``a tragedy, even
a classical tragedy _ complete with tragic flaw and a heroine who
did not know herself.''
</P>
<P>
   It is his mother's poverty of self-awareness that is the central
element in Kamenetz's book, which is a near-obsessive effort to
invest every detail of his life with the very quality that was
missing in his mother's.
</P>
<P>
   He writes a succinct, selective autobiography in which he
describes his necessary but cruel repudiation of his mother as a
way to establish his identity. In a chapter called ``On Mourning,''
he provides a bittersweet, guilt-edged description of his struggle
with the Jewish rituals surrounding the death of a parent.
</P>
<P>
   He visits the old synagogue in East Baltimore where his
grandfather used to pray and finds there an eccentric dying Jewish
community. There is the man who wears two pairs of glasses, one
over the other, and the rabbi who is also a steelworker and who
punctuates his recitation of the prayers with an occasional,
irrelevant exclamation: ``BEH!''
</P>
<P>
   Kamenetz makes a modest donation and asks in exchange that a
special prayer be said for his mother, a way of compensating for
his failure to fulfill the filial responsibility of uttering the
Kaddish, the prayer for the dead.
</P>
<P>
   The experience, as always for Kamenetz, is the occasion for a
reflection, this one mingling sarcasm with a dose of reverence for
the tradition: ``We say in the Kaddish, `God is Great,' for the
sake of our dead, but to impose a limit on their influence. God is
great, we pray _ and you are just dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, Kamenetz is tough-minded and tender. He is sensitive
with a quirky, original intelligence and a dry, urbane,
self-deprecatory wit. He strives eloquently and interestingly
throughout his book to make connections between his mother's jagged
character and the meaningful elements in his life.
</P>
<P>
   Kamenetz's chapter on his mother's strange refusal to talk to
her family in her last days is called ``On the Meaning of No,'' and
it ranges from his daughter's learning to talk to the inscription
on Guillaume Apollinaire's tombstone in Paris (``My heart like an
upside-down flame'').
</P>
<P>
   But Kamenetz always returns to his theme. It turns out that
while his mother was not talking to him, she was discussing matters
with her rabbi. ``Why didn't my mother speak to us?'' Kamenetz
asks. He provides no clear answer, but does recall that she had
tempers and tantrums so terrible that they made Kamenetz and his
siblings tremble with fear.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, he suggests, she ``knew we were too fragile for
anything she might have to say.'' When the rabbi asks Kamenetz and
his siblings how he should describe their mother in his eulogy,
Kamenetz's answer could be a inscription on her grave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell them,'' I said, ``she was fierce.''  &QL;

 &HT;    B-2: ALL DRESSED UP, FINALLY SOMEWHERE TO GO
 &HT;    With B2-BOX-0326; KOSOVO-STRIKES-0326.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The B-2 stealth bomber, after two decades of
development, another decade of political wrangling, and a cost of
$2.1 billion a piece, still has not satisfied its critics despite a
near-perfect combat debut against Soviet-built air defenses in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The two B-2 bombers who joined the NATO air strikes against
Yugoslavia Wednesday night returned safely to Whiteman Air Force
Base in Missouri -- after logging 31 hours in the air -- prompting
proponents to suggest that the controversial aircraft has finally
answered its critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This plane did everything it advertised and then some,'' said
Brig. Gen. Leroy Barnidge, commander of the 509th Bomb Wing at
Whiteman, the B-2's only operational base.
</P>
<P>
   But Bruce Cuthbertson, a spokesman for Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio,
the House Budget Committee chairman who tried to kill the bomber
program, said the mission against Yugoslavia ``looked like make
work'' for the B-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony is a plane that was developed to unleash nuclear
weapons on the Soviet Union makes its debut in a conventional
attack on Yugoslavia,'' Cuthbertson added. ``The plane should never
have been built in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon told reporters Thursday that
the B-2 pilots were ``thrilled to be involved'' in the attack on
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the plane was included in the initial air strikes
not only because of its satellite-guided ordnance but also because
of its effectiveness in harsh weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advantage of the B-2 bomber is that it is an all-weather
plane . . . and therefore it was successful in dropping its
ordnance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, one of the biggest embarrassments to the Air Force
during the development of the B-2 was its sensitivity to weather.
The General Accounting Office (GAO), a congressional watchdog
agency, reported in 1997 that the bomber had ``significant
maintenance problems,'' mainly because of the sensitivity of the
plane's special coatings, which are supposed to make it invisible
to enemy radar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exposure to water or moisture can damage some of the
low-observable enhancing surfaces on the aircraft,'' the GAO report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, the Air Force cancelled plans to deploy B-2's to
Europe, where it would have required special environmentally
controlled shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Conceived in 1981 as the Reagan administration set out to topple
the ``evil empire'' of the Soviet Union, the B-2 was the subject of
an intense lobbying campaign by its prime contractor, Northrop
Grumman Corp. Its popularity in Congress rested in part on the fact
that 383 congressional districts across 46 states were home to
subcontractors.
</P>
<P>
   But the escalating price of the bomber -- the total cost for a
fleet of 21 is expected to be $44 billion -- gave pause to some
members of Congress. Back when he was a senator from Maine, for
example, William Cohen suggested that sending the B-2 into battle
would be like dispatching ``a Rolls Royce to pick up groceries.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Cohen, now secretary of defense, said the B-2 had
performed ``according to its capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Bacon's comments the next day raised questions about
the extent to which the B-2's were challenged in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon acknowledged that no surface-to-air missiles were fired by
Yugoslavian forces at the attacking NATO war planes. ``We don't
know why that was,'' he said. When it was suggested that the
anti-aircraft firepower was being hoarded for the intensified
assault Thursday, he replied, ``That is a possibility but we can't
speculate on that at this stage.''
</P>
<P>
   More B-2's reportedly joined the renewed air assault in
Yugoslavia on Thursday.

 &HT;    NO LOVE LOST BETWEEN NATO COMMANDER, MILOSEVIC
 &HT;    With CLARK-BIOBOX-0326; KOSOVO-STRIKES-0326.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In August of 1995, U.S. diplomats on a peace
mission to the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo were forced to travel
the perilous mud road over Mt. Igman after Serbs laying siege to
the city refused to grant them the courtesy of safe passage.
</P>
<P>
   A French military vehicle carrying part of the delegation slid
off the edge of the rain-slicked pass, tumbled more than 200 feet
into a ravine and exploded, killing three American diplomats and a
French soldier.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling in another vehicle as part of the delegation, U.S.
Army Gen. Wesley Clark watched in horror, scrambled down the
rock-strewn hillside and jumped onto the smoldering armored
personnel carrier to begin helping four badly wounded survivors.
</P>
<P>
   He would never forget, though, the charred and broken corpses of
the four who didn't make it, missionaries of peace, casualties of
war.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Clark stood before the cameras at NATO headquarters
in Brussels, ramrod straight and packed tight as a clenched fist
into his heavily-decorated uniform, and laid out his plans for the
Serbs who have turned their guns this time on the civilians of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no sanctuary for them,'' vowed Clark, who, as the
supreme allied commander in Europe, now oversees the NATO air
strikes on Yugoslavia, the most potent aerial assault on European
soil since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to systematically and progressively attack,
disrupt, degrade, devastate,'' he said. ``We are going to destroy
these forces.''
</P>
<P>
   A West Point graduate, first in his class, Rhodes scholar and
Vietnam veteran, Clark, 54, is the consummate professional officer.
He is exemplary of the finest military minds of his generation, a
man schooled, trained and disciplined to plan with precision and
execute to the last detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's bright, ambitious, willing to take some risks, incredibly
hard-working and very knowledgable,'' said former undersecretary of
Defense, Paul Wolfowitz, now dean of the School of Advanced
International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. ``I have a lot
more confidence in the whole operation than I would if he weren't
there.''
</P>
<P>
   On one point, though, there should be no mistake. Clark holds no
special place in his heart for Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic,
president of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is terribly failing the people of that very important
state,'' Clark testified last week before the House Armed Services
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, President Milosevic continues to rely
primarily, it seems, on the use of force in dealing with the crises
that he's created in Yugoslavia,'' said Clark. ``And, in doing so,
he both strengthens his control among the remaining loyal Serbs and
hardens the lines of fractionation that have always existed in the
Balkan region.''
</P>
<P>
   A baby-boomer who grew up in Little Rock, Ark., and received his
master's degree in philosophy, politics and economics from
Britain's Oxford University the same year that Bill Clinton began
attending the school, Clark and his wife, Gertrude, have one son,
Wesley, who lives in California.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who spoke directly to Clinton on Thursday, is said to
remain close to the president.
</P>
<P>
   He's certainly been close to Clinton's chief Balkan diplomat,
Richard Holbrooke, who was seated near Clark on the ill-fated 1995
passage over Mt. Igman.
</P>
<P>
   During the peace talks at the Wright Patterson Air Force Base
outside of Dayton, Ohio the following November, Clark was the
military compliment to Holbrooke's diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's task at Dayton was as simple as it was difficult: to
present Milosevic with what amounted to an inch-thick plan of NATO
occupation for Bosnia, and stand there until the Serb leader signed
it unchanged. Or, as Clark later described it, ``without dotting an
'i' or crossing a 't.'''
</P>
<P>
   That took three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Again in Kosovo, it's been Milosevic's refusal to sign on to a
plan for admitting NATO peacekeepers that has stalled diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been NATO air strikes, which entered their second
punishing day on Thursday, under Clark's command.

 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What is this thing called love? Cole Porter's famous
question resonates throughout ``Closer,'' Patrick Marber's bleak,
chic study of the laws of attraction in contemporary London. But
the answers, such as they are, aren't anything you would set to a
lilting melody.
</P>
<P>
   This stark four-character work, which opened last night at the
Music Box Theater under Marber's direction, is more like an
up-tempo funeral march than a wistful ballad. As one of its
characters notes grimly, ``Everything our parents told us was good
for us will kill us _ sun, milk, meat _ love.'' Marber, as you may
have gathered, is a dramatist to make Racine, the classic
chronicler of fatal passion, seem like an optimist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Closer'' is the latest in a series of anti-romantic comedies
from England about the joylessness of sex, works that include David
Hare's ``Blue Room'' and Mark Ravenhill's ``Shopping and . . .'' By
now you probably know the formula, which has also become a
commonplace in hip American movies like ``The Company of Men'' and
``Happiness'': Boy meets girl, boy gets (that's a euphemism) girl,
and everybody loses all around. Love, it turns out, does mean
having to say you're sorry, not to mention ``ouch!,'' again and
again.
</P>
<P>
   Marber's play is a step up from ``The Blue Room,'' which had the
emotional temperature of a frozen cod. There's an invigorating
anger about ``Closer,'' an enraged sense of helplessness beneath
its cynicism. Marber has written some gleaming, sharp-edged
dialogue, and as a dramatist he's a meticulous architect, somewhat
in the manner of Yasmina Reza (of the abidingly popular ``Art''),
with every scene and symbol clicking neatly into place.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there's an oddly distanced quality about ``Closer,'' or at
least this incarnation of it, that turns its careful fuguelike
structure and echoing metaphors against it. Friends of mine who saw
it in London, where it was produced at the Royal National Theater
before transferring for a healthy West End run, describe it as a
lacerating experience.
</P>
<P>
   That definitely is not the case here, even though the show has
the same director and design team as in London and features a
first-class cast led by Natasha Richardson. You get the play's
point, no question about that; but you don't feel the pain.
</P>
<P>
   Without that visceral connection between the characters and the
audience, ``Closer'' starts to seem like a thematic
connect-the-dots game, or an algebraic equation for the pathology
of desire.
</P>
<P>
   Practically every element in ``Closer'' comes stamped with a
seal of Significance. Start with the professions of the four
characters. There's Alice (Anna Friel), a self-described waif who
works as a performer in strip clubs; Dan (Rupert Graves), an
unsuccessful novelist and a writer of newspaper obituaries; Larry
(Ciaran Hinds), the oldest of the quartet, a dermatologist, and
Anna (Ms. Richardson), a photographer who specializes, she says, in
portraits of strangers.
</P>
<P>
   There you have flesh and the way of all flesh, represented by
the men. (``Our flesh is ferocious, our bodies will kill us, our
bones will outlive us,'' says Larry.) The catalytic gloss of
fantasy and image is provided by the women's work.
</P>
<P>
   That work says everything about how love operates in ``Closer'':
its basis in superficial perception and its essential loneliness.
As the four characters keep switching partners in a shifting,
internecine quadrangle, none of them can really account for their
obsessions with another, except with chimerical reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``You give us imagery,'' says a drunken Larry about women to
Alice. ``And we do with it what we will.'' Alice in turn sums up
men with this observation: ``They love the way we make them feel,
but not `us.' They love dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   The arbitrariness of love and its willful self-delusions aren't
new ideas, of course. Marber can give them a chilling contemporary
spin, however, most notably in a devastatingly witty scene in which
Dan and Larry have sex on the Internet, with Dan pretending to be
Anna. Their typed-out exchange is projected onto a large blue
screen, and Dan's typographical rendering of orgasm is priceless.
That's the essence of ``Closer'' right there: the primal,
all-too-conventional fantasies of two men, one a manipulator and
the other a dupe, bouncing off each other in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Mortimer's grimly sterile setting picks up on, rather
heavily, the work's central concepts. The wall of a London memorial
park, with plaques commemorating ordinary people who died saving
others, is always in view, a signpost to the graves that await us
all.
</P>
<P>
   There are also recurrent images of women behind glass, from the
immense portrait Anna takes of Alice for a gallery exhibition to
the life-size girl doll in a Victorian museum. The club in which
Alice dances is another variation on this theme, since the
customers are never allowed to touch the performers, prompting
Larry to scream, ``What do you have to do get a bit of intimacy
around here?''
</P>
<P>
   This is not subtle stuff. But because ``Closer'' is so tightly
wound, and because Marber's dialogue has such rhythmic insistence,
you could imagine the play hypnotizing you under the right
circumstances. Here, unfortunately, the actors themselves seem to
be presented under glass, and while each of them has moments, they
only rarely shake off their status as exhibits A, B, C and D.
</P>
<P>
   This is partly because Marber's clinical staging often finds the
performers speaking in glacial profile with considerable distance
between them. It also has much to do with the casting, particularly
that of Ms. Richardson, who must serve as the work's emotional
ballast. This splendid actress, who won a Tony last year for
``Cabaret,'' is unfailingly graceful, and she has never been more
luminous than here.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the rub. Anna is meant to be someone who has been
run through the sexual mill one time too many, bruised and wary but
still pathetically hopeful. Ms. Richardson registers as less of a
wounded survivor than a strong, untarnishable transcender of the
sordidness around her.
</P>
<P>
   She gives some exquisite line readings, for example when Anna is
baited into savagery during a sexual interrogation by Larry, and
she has a delicate comic timing. Yet you never despair over Anna's
future, as you did with Ms. Richardson's Sally Bowles in
``Cabaret,'' and that is a crucial lack.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Ms. Friel gives a deft and often touching
performance, filled with responsive shadings. But she comes across
a bit too well bred for her loose-cannon character, who is both the
toughest and most vulnerable of the four and the one who lives
closest to the edge.
</P>
<P>
   This, after all, is a woman who is said to have urinated on the
carpet to capture a lover's attention, and it's hard to imagine Ms.
Friel's Alice ever doing such a thing. The performance generates
the character's pathos but not her dangerousness.
</P>
<P>
   The male characters, like those in Neil LaBute's similarly
themed movies, are less rewarding roles. They're jerks, eternal
adolescents reflexively given to cruelty. Hinds, the only holdover
from the original London cast, and Graves play them unshirkingly,
however. Graves, whose Dan is bad faith with a trendy haircut,
turns in the evening's most fully integrated performance.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, for ``Closer'' to scorch as it should, you must feel
that these people are capable of seriously damaging one another.
The play begins with the vision of a bleeding wound on Alice's leg,
and much is made of scar imagery throughout.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite the many excoriating exchanges among the
characters, you only fitfully believe in their capacity to be hurt,
and for the most part you don't care whether they are or not.
``Closer'' is all too close to Alice's description of Anna's
portraits: ``a bunch of sad strangers photographed beautifully.''

 &HT;    NO LOVE LOST BETWEEN NATO COMMANDER, MILOSEVIC
 &HT;    With CLARK-BIOBOX-0326; KOSOVO-STRIKES-0326.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In August of 1995, U.S. diplomats on a peace
mission to the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo were forced to travel
the perilous mud road over Mt. Igman after Serbs laying siege to
the city refused to grant them the courtesy of safe passage.
</P>
<P>
   A French military vehicle carrying part of the delegation slid
off the edge of the rain-slicked pass, tumbled more than 200 feet
into a ravine and exploded, killing three American diplomats and a
French soldier.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling in another vehicle as part of the delegation, U.S.
Army Gen. Wesley Clark watched in horror, scrambled down the
rock-strewn hillside and jumped onto the smoldering armored
personnel carrier to begin helping four badly wounded survivors.
</P>
<P>
   He would never forget, though, the charred and broken corpses of
the four who didn't make it, missionaries of peace, casualties of
war.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Clark stood before the cameras at NATO headquarters
in Brussels, ramrod straight and packed tight as a clenched fist
into his heavily-decorated uniform, and laid out his plans for the
Serbs who have turned their guns this time on the civilians of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no sanctuary for them,'' vowed Clark, who, as the
supreme allied commander in Europe, now oversees the NATO air
strikes on Yugoslavia, the most potent aerial assault on European
soil since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to systematically and progressively attack,
disrupt, degrade, devastate,'' he said. ``We are going to destroy
these forces.''
</P>
<P>
   A West Point graduate, first in his class, Rhodes scholar and
Vietnam veteran, Clark, 54, is the consummate professional officer.
He is exemplary of the finest military minds of his generation, a
man schooled, trained and disciplined to plan with precision and
execute to the last detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's bright, ambitious, willing to take some risks, incredibly
hard-working and very knowledgable,'' said former undersecretary of
Defense, Paul Wolfowitz, now dean of the School of Advanced
International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. ``I have a lot
more confidence in the whole operation than I would if he weren't
there.''
</P>
<P>
   On one point, though, there should be no mistake. Clark holds no
special place in his heart for Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic,
president of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is terribly failing the people of that very important
state,'' Clark testified last week before the House Armed Services
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, President Milosevic continues to rely
primarily, it seems, on the use of force in dealing with the crises
that he's created in Yugoslavia,'' said Clark. ``And, in doing so,
he both strengthens his control among the remaining loyal Serbs and
hardens the lines of fractionation that have always existed in the
Balkan region.''
</P>
<P>
   A baby-boomer who grew up in Little Rock, Ark., and received his
master's degree in philosophy, politics and economics from
Britain's Oxford University the same year that Bill Clinton began
attending the school, Clark and his wife, Gertrude, have one son,
Wesley, who lives in California.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who spoke directly to Clinton on Thursday, is said to
remain close to the president.
</P>
<P>
   He's certainly been close to Clinton's chief Balkan diplomat,
Richard Holbrooke, who was seated near Clark on the ill-fated 1995
passage over Mt. Igman.
</P>
<P>
   During the peace talks at the Wright Patterson Air Force Base
outside of Dayton, Ohio the following November, Clark was the
military compliment to Holbrooke's diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's task at Dayton was as simple as it was difficult: to
present Milosevic with what amounted to an inch-thick plan of NATO
occupation for Bosnia, and stand there until the Serb leader signed
it unchanged. Or, as Clark later described it, ``without dotting an
'i' or crossing a 't.'''
</P>
<P>
   That took three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Again in Kosovo, it's been Milosevic's refusal to sign on to a
plan for admitting NATO peacekeepers that has stalled diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been NATO air strikes, which entered their second
punishing day on Thursday, under Clark's command.

   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ Giving vent to their rage over NATO bombings
of their neighboring country, thousands of sympathizers with Serbia
marched on the U.S. Embassy here on Thursday, throwing rocks,
setting embassy cars on fire and seeking to burn down the compound
with firebombs.
</P>
<P>
   There were also demonstrations and smashed windows outside the
British and German embassies. The riots were the most glaring sign
yet of the mounting tension in the surrounding Balkan states in the
wake of NATO's military action against President Slobodan Milosevic
of Yugoslavia. They were not the only one. Macedonia, the only
republic to emerge relatively unscathed from the breakup of
Yugoslavia, is a poor country with simmering ethnic rivalries of
its own.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski warned against
rising anti-NATO and anti-American sentiment, as the Western
alliance's air war against neighboring Yugoslavia continued for a
second day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two biggest problems the country is facing at the moment
are the inflow of refugees from Kosovo and the emergence of
anti-NATO and anti-American feelings among the Macedonian public,''
Georgievski said, according to the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of 10,000 NATO ground troops, once poised to help
keep a negotiated peace in Kosovo and now waiting edgily for some
sort of military or political denouement in Serbia, has raised
Macedonia's temperature.
</P>
<P>
   So has the arrival of more than 20,000 ethnic Albanian refugees
from Kosovo. Sheltered by friends and relatives in the large ethnic
Albanian community of Macedonia, they are nonetheless viewed with
alarm by some Macedonians of different ethnic origin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are already too many of them, and we are so few,''
complained Aleksandar Ivanovik, a Serbian Macedonian who works as a
casino security guard. ``This is all an attempt by Albanians to
swallow Macedonia into some greater Albanian state.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians make up roughly one quarter of Macedonia's 2
million people, and their political leaders share power with the
Slav majority in a coalition government formed late last year.
Serbs make up a sliver of the Slav population here.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators seemed most preoccupied on Thursday with defying a
NATO show of force they view as humiliating. Brandishing signs that
read, ``Clinton Equals Hitler'' and ``Serbia, we are with you,''
protesters stood across the street from the U.S. Embassy, throwing
rocks and jeering at the sight of embassy employees, who prudently
left the building by mid-afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   An elderly matron, in a formal floral suit and elaborately
coiffed hair, stood among young people and grimly hurled an egg at
a passing humanitarian aid vehicle, screaming ``Fascists!'' A
handful of Macedonian police officers, assigned to guard the
embassy, stood impassively in front of the gate as rocks were
lobbed over their heads at office windows.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Macedonian riot police lined up Thursday
evening in front of the Hotel Alexander Palace to try to prevent
hundreds of demonstrators from attacking the jeeps of European and
American monitors, who took over the hotel earlier this week after
peace talks for Kosovo broke down and the monitors were evacuated
from the southern Serbian province, which is just a 45 minute drive
away.
</P>
<P>
   When the crowd there moved toward the embassy, the riot police
followed, lining up in front of the gates to prevent further damage
after a guard house was set afire, and eventually using tear gas to
disperse the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, who were morose after watching their peace efforts in
Kosovo go down in flames, silently watched the demonstrators from
their hotel windows.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, a small crowd of demonstrators threw rocks
at a small unit of Italian NATO troops stationed a few miles from
the Kosovo border, lightly wounding one Italian soldier and pelting
the ambulance that came to take him away. ``It was most
unpleasant,'' said Lt. Col. Giuseppenicola Tota, the commander of
800 troops from the Garibaldi Brigade, which are stationed in
Macedonia along with 4,000 British, 2,800 German and 2,500 French
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   He said he believed most Macedonians were more relieved than
upset by the presence of NATO ground troops, which send small units
of armored personnel carriers on patrol along the roads _ in effect
taking the place of several hundred U.N. peacekeepers deployed here
since 1993 but disbanded this month after China vetoed the U.N.
force because impoverished Macedonia, apparently anxious for an
attached bounty of aid, established diplomatic ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Tota said he was aware of a darkening mood. ``We are on alert
because there is a possibility that Serbian forces could make
reprisals against us,'' he explained. ``But we do not want to give
Macedonians any more feeling of malaise.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While the center of Skopje was overflowing with heated emotions,
the border with Kosovo was eerily quiet Thursday. At Blace, the
main border crossing between Kosovo and Macedonia, only a few cars
from Kosovo crept cautiously into the checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not safe to stay, but it is now not safe to leave,''
explained a 24-year-old who arrived by car from Pristina, Kosovo's
capital, and gave his name only as Ismael. He said he took the risk
to escort his wife and help a neighbor take his wife, mother, and
two children into Macedonia. Since the bombing began, he said,
Serbs in Kosovo have unleashed terror in ethnic Albanian
neighborhoods of Pristina, breaking windows, beating people, and
burning houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't attack NATO, so they are attacking us,'' he
explained. He said that despite the danger, Kosovars are afraid to
flee because paramilitary groups have set up their own make-shift
checkpoints near the border and are harassing would-be refugees. He
said he had to pay a $60 bribe to a Serbian paramilitary officer to
get past.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of ethnic Albanian refugees who have fled Kosovo in the
last weeks teemed at the gates of a police station in the largest
ethnic Albanian neighborhood of Skopje Thursday. Most of them
arrived at dawn and waited in vain until late afternoon, seeking to
register as refugees, which entitles them to a three-month
residency card and some food and clothing from Macedonian and
international aid organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stayed as long as we could, then we left,'' Sebahate
Ibishi, 34, who joined her mother in Macedonia last week with her
two children. She said that her eldest son, 17, stayed behind in
their village of Plesina, near Urosevac, to guard their house. Her
husband is a refugee in Germany, but she said she had no hope of
joining him. ``How can I? I have no visa, no money. I just hope we
can someday go home.''

asked at his first press conference since the awful cacophony of

one of the greatest whoppers of all time. Story moved in the ``K''

_ hoping, really _ that the launching of airstrikes will force
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to halt his killing and

whether America can achieve its aims without paying some high
costs. But by keeping channels of communication open with
Milosevic, it may still be possible to reach an agreement without
too much bloodshed. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After four decades as a composer of works that have
become increasingly complex and stylistically wide-ranging, yet
also increasingly popular for their lyricism and accessibility,
John Corigliano thought he had figured out how to keep his workload
from becoming overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Trim and young-looking at 61, Corigliano insists that he won't
accept a commission until he has asked himself a few crucial
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important is, why am I writing this work?'' he said.
``What do I want to do in it? What have I got to say that's worth
saying? And what is there new for me to discover in writing it,
either about specific technical problems or abstract musical ones?
For me, these questions are paramount.''
</P>
<P>
   Corigliano has been known to mull over commissions for close to
a year before getting the flash of inspiration that is his creative
green light. He has also turned down lucrative, high-profile offers
because a novel idea didn't come to him.
</P>
<P>
   Once he agrees to a commission, his method is no more rushed.
For example, his opera, ``The Ghosts of Versailles,'' commissioned
by the Metropolitan Opera in 1979, took 12 years to get to the
stage.
</P>
<P>
   But Corigliano says he is busier than he wants to be at the
moment, composing a vocal work for the soprano Sylvia McNair and
the New York Philharmonic and considering a ballet and a handful of
other commissions as well.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, though, his main focus has been his ``Dylan Thomas
Trilogy,'' an evening-long work that has occupied him, on and off,
for the last 40 years. He thought he had finished it in 1976. But
he has revamped it again, and Friday night at Carnegie Hall,
Leonard Slatkin is to lead the National Symphony Orchestra,
augmented by the Choral Arts Society of Washington, the baritone
Hakan Hagegard, the tenor John Aler and Anthony Costanzo, a
countertenor, in the New York premiere of the 1999 version.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I like about John's music,'' said Slatkin, who has
conducted most of Corigliano's major works of the last 20 years,
and recorded several, ``is that it's recognizably his. Within any
piece of his, within 25 seconds, you know who wrote it, and as
different as the next work is bound to be, you'll still know it's
him. It's music that has a face, and I admire that. And this
version of the trilogy is like a history of John Corigliano in a
single piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Corigliano began work on the trilogy in 1959, when he was 21 and
taking his first steps as a composer. With no commissions on the
horizon, and a new-found passion for Thomas' poetry, he wrote a
choral setting of ``Fern Hill'' as a gift for Bella Tillis, his
music teacher at Midwood High School in Brooklyn in the early
1950s, who encouraged him to compose at a time when his parents _
his father, also named John Corigliano, was concertmaster of the
New York Philharmonic _ were trying to dissuade him.
</P>
<P>
   When he composed ``Fern Hill,'' Corigliano had just graduated
from Columbia University, where he studied composition with Otto
Luening, and he was about to start on a series of jobs that would
take him through the byways of the music business. These included
radio programming at WQXR and WBAI; writing arrangements for rock
recordings at Kama Sutra and Mercury Records; working on music
programs for CBS television and directing a festival in Corfu.
</P>
<P>
   His first recognition as a composer, first prize at the Spoleto
Festival Competition in 1964 for the Violin Sonata he wrote two
years earlier, was just over the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Wadsworth, the founder of the Chamber Music Society of
Lincoln Center, knew Corigliano from Spoleto, and commissioned the
second panel of the trilogy, a tenor setting of Thomas' ``Poem in
October,'' for the society's inaugural season in 1969. By the
mid-1970s, Corigliano decided to reorchestrate his two Thomas works
and add a third, a choral setting of ``Poem on His Birthday.'' The
Cathedral Choral Society of the National Cathedral gave that
version of the trilogy its premiere in Washington in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Corigliano was happy with this configuration at the time. But
when he revisited the score in 1996, he found it unsatisfying. He
was struck by the fact that Thomas' age, when he wrote the first
two poems, corresponded to his own age when he set them to music,
while the dark concerns of ``Poem on His Birthday'' reflected some
of his personal and professional doubts in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   And he saw the possibility of making the trilogy into a
meditation on youth, age and memory. As it stood, though, it was
three stylistically disparate works, with none of the symmetry and
architectural finesse that have been among Corigliano's hallmarks
since the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Fern Hill' was written when I was much more innocent,
musically,'' Corigliano said. ``The language that I loved at the
time was the American language of Copland, Barber and Bernstein. I
adapted it, utilized it, learned from it and then added other ways
of speaking. By the time of `Poem in October,' I was using more
irregular rhythms, and a harmonic language that had stretched a
bit, and in `Poem on His Birthday,' I was thinking differently
about sonority, and starting to build pieces architecturally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that `Poem on His Birthday,' with some reorchestration,
could stand as the second half of the work,'' he added. ``Now I had
to build `Fern Hill' and `Poem in October' into a logical first
half. I wanted something that would foreshadow `Poem on His
Birthday,' and would make `Fern Hill' and `Poem in October' seem
like reminiscences. So I searched and searched through Thomas'
poems for something I could use, at first with no luck. Then I
found the `Author's Prologue,' which is an amazing poem, and one of
the last things he wrote.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In its new form, the work is an oratorio of sorts. Hagegard, as
Thomas' spirit, sings the ``Author's Prologue'' _ which Corigliano
has split into two sections, each serving as a prelude to one of
the early works _ as well as ``Poem on His Birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's partly an actor's piece and partly a singer's piece''
Hagegard said of his role. ``There is a lot of music in the poetry
itself. When Thomas recited it, he did it in an almost chanting
kind of way. You can hear that in his recordings. And although we
aren't doing it this way, this time, I could see this piece
semi-staged, with the baritone sitting at a desk in a sweater as a
stage version of Thomas.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The deepening progression of the solo vocal lines, from the
countertenor of ``Fern Hill'' to the tenor of ``Poem in October''
and the baritone of ``Poem on His Birthday,'' suggests the
progression of age, as does the change in Corigliano's style, from
the unclouded Americana of ``Fern Hill'' through the complexities
of the ``Author's Prologue.''
</P>
<P>
   But style is largely an abstraction to Corigliano.
</P>
<P>
   ``Style is something in my music that I am not aware of,'' he
said. ``I recognize that it's there. People have pointed out to me
certain interval relationships, spacings and superimpositions I
have used in several works, but I haven't done it consciously.
Often, when people talk about style, they mean techniques. In the
Baroque era, there were common techniques that make Bach sound
similar to Handel, but there were also differences in personal
language that make Bach and Handel sound different. Style is more
like the way you sign your name. You scribble it without thinking,
but a handwriting expert can prove whether it's your signature or a
forgery.''
</P>
<P>
   But listen to a few of Corigliano's works, and a sense of his
style quickly emerges. It includes a fondness for extremes, notable
in concertos. Fast movements often push both the soloists'
technique and the ensemble's energy level to the edge, yet his slow
movements are meltingly lyrical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ghosts of Versailles,'' too, balances hummable melodies
against the manic extroversion of supersonic patter arias,
recurring chase themes and an exploding statue.
</P>
<P>
   It is also eclectic music that touches on influences from Arabic
wind music, Renaissance styles and allusions to Mozart and
Beethoven, to 12-tone rows, Minimalist techniques and waves of
broad-boned Romanticism. And theatricality is a central trait.
</P>
<P>
   When James Galway asked for a flute concerto, Corigliano
supplied ``The Pied Piper Fantasy,'' a work in which the flutist,
costumed as the Pied Piper, leads a chorus of children off the
stage while the orchestra makes the sounds of scampering rats.
</P>
<P>
   Corigliano's working methods are exacting. First he writes prose
descriptions of the imagery and ideas he hopes to convey. He then
draws diagrams that look like annotated EKG's, with wavy lines
representing melodic shapes, proportions and structures, and
sometimes colors, representing shifts in instrumental timbre. When
he finally begins writing the music, he discards dozens of themes
for every one he keeps.
</P>
<P>
   He has a sense of humor under pressure. A few years ago, when he
was juggling a cello work for Yo-Yo Ma and a guitar concerto for
Sharon Isbin, and was late with both, he faxed Ms. Isbin a page
with the guitar chord symbols used in popular sheet music _ C, G,
B7 _ and a note implying that this was the first movement. The
actual work, ``Troubadours,'' was decidedly more demanding.
</P>
<P>
   These pieces have won Corigliano an enthusiastic following
evident in the performance history of some of his recent works.
``The Ghosts of Versailles'' has run two seasons at the Met, and
has been staged at the Lyric Opera of Chicago. It has its European
premiere in Hannover, Germany, next month.
</P>
<P>
   His concertos are performed frequently, and have been recorded
several times each, and the Symphony No. 1, which has had more than
100 performances in the United States and Europe, as well as two
recordings, won the Grawermeyer Award, one of most prestigious
American composition prizes, in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Corigliano has his detractors, however. When his Symphony had
its premiere in 1990, some reviewers found its topicality to be
pandering, and compared the work to poster art.
</P>
<P>
   Others have been suspicious of Corigliano's eclecticism and
accessibility. Corigliano says he has not read a review, positive
or negative, since 1991, but he notes that younger composers,
including some of his students at Lehman College and the Juilliard
School, share his interest in having their music understood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this whole attitude is changing,'' he said, ``because
its roots are in a dogmatic, modernist view of art that is dying in
the United States and much of Europe. I think people are beginning
to realize that it's simple-minded to say that if something is
accessible, it's pandering or easy. I work hard on these pieces. It
takes me two years to write works that people will listen to for 40
minutes, but a lot of that work is clarifying my ideas so that
people want to hear the music again. The fact is, it's not all on
the surface, and if listeners are going to hear the complexities in
these pieces, they're going to have to hear them more than once.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it has always been. Look at Beethoven. His
music is visceral; he can get any school kid to love him. But that
doesn't mean that this child understands him. He understands part
of him, the first layer of the music, and as he continues to
listen, he hears more and more. I want to have that first layer in
my music, too, but I also want the second, third, fourth and fifth.
I don't think it's fair to expect the audience to jump in at Layer
32.
</P>
<P>
   ``I compose to satisfy emotional needs and intellectual
curiosities that I have, and yes, I want the audience to come along
while I explore them. It's strange to me that anyone should think
of that as odd.'' &QL;

<P>
   ``As a convicted felon, Mr. Waters is prohibited from possession
of firearms or ammunition,'' Carruth said.
</P>
<P>
   Waters has a record that includes convictions for murder, theft,
battery and forgery.
</P>
<P>
   The 119 bullets found by authorities included 49 rounds of 9-mm
hollow-tip bullets of which 13 were loaded into a pistol ammunition
magazine for a Browning High Power pistol, according to court
papers.
</P>
<P>
   The Wednesday raid was staged to occur simultaneously with
federal agents questioning people in Chicago, Michigan and Fort
Worth, Texas, about the O'Hair case.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair and her two grown children have been missing since 1995,
but there has been no indication to date that they are dead. Waters
is a former office manager for the O'Hairs.
</P>
<P>
   Waters' lawyer, Patrick Ganne of Austin, said federal officials
told him that his client was being implicated by others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in touch with the assistant U.S. Attorney, and he
said a bunch of people are rolling over on him and implicating him
in the murder of the O'Hair family,'' Ganne said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said you can get the death penalty for solicitation to
commit murder. He said he'd better get right with God and tell his
side of the story,'' Ganne said.
</P>
<P>
   Carruth declined to comment on his conversations with Ganne.
</P>
<P>
   Waters, who has been the object of a federal investigation for
months, has not been named as a suspect in the O'Hair case.
</P>
<P>
   The search of his car and apartment by a dozen agents from both
state and federal forces began early Wednesday and did not end
until late in the day, when Waters was taken out a back entrance of
the apartment complex in handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Waters was present during the search. He was very
cooperative,'' FBI spokesman Darren Holmes said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair came to prominence three decades ago in the federal court
battles that removed prayer and Bible reading from public schools.
Until she vanished, O'Hair ran a tightly knit cluster of atheist
organizations in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   But in late September 1995, O'Hair, her son Jon Garth Murray and
daughter Robin Murray O'Hair all disappeared after spending a month
in San Antonio on a mysterious errand.
</P>
<P>
   Gold coins valued at $500,000 vanished at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Theories about their disappearance have ranged from a
self-imposed foreign exile to kidnapping, robbery and murder.

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The series of coordinated police actions Wednesday are the first
public signs that leads may be developing in one of the century's
most baffling celebrity disappearances.
</P>
<P>
   And Waters appears to be key.
</P>
<P>
   Waters quit working for the O'Hairs in 1994 and a year later he
pleaded guilty to stealing $54,000 from atheist accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Although Waters was charged Wednesday with an offense not
connected to the O'Hair case, he has been the focus of police
interest for months.
</P>
<P>
   Waters has consistently denied any knowledge of the O'Hair
disappearance. He has also denied knowing anything about the
gruesome fate of Danny Fry, an old friend from Florida who came to
Austin in the summer of 1995 to work on a big money deal with
Waters.
</P>
<P>
   Fry's nude, beheaded body was found Oct. 2, 1995, near Dallas,
three days after the O'Hairs vanished in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The corpse was discovered less than 48 hours after Fry made a
final call home from Waters's apartment in Austin, telephone
records show.
</P>
<P>
   But the corpse remained unidentified until earlier this year
when DNA testing solved the mystery. That case is being
investigated by the Dallas County Sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   At the Thursday hearing in federal court, Carruth urged that
Waters not be released.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a lengthy criminal record including several crimes of
violence. If he is released on bond, he will be a danger to others
in the community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ordered Waters held pending a bond hearing to be held
within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, Ganne asked the judge to unseal the search
warrant affidavit that supported the raid on Waters' apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to see it so we can make some intelligent decisions,''
he told the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Carruth objected.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are other matters contained in the warrant that the
government does not want to disclose at this time, and probably
will not until time of trial,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing ended, Ganne told reporters that the
ammunition found Wednesday did not belong to Waters. ``It belonged
to his former girlfriend. She left it when she moved out,'' Ganne
said.

   AVIANO, Italy _ Security was high and the bars and restaurants
normally frequented by NATO troops were swept clean Thursday night
around this northern Italian air base that is the launching pad for
many of the NATO aircraft striking Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The day was calm, and low clouds hung over the base, blocking
the view of the ring of Alpine peaks to the north. But beginning
just before nightfall, and lasting for more than an hour, a steady
stream of NATO planes lumbered, whistled and roared off the
runways, heading east into the cloudy skies.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 6 p.m. here, a large American AWACs
radar-and-command plane took off; at about 6:15, with night falling
fast, eight B-2 stealth aircraft, whistling quietly, climbed into
the air, followed at intervals of about 30 seconds by dozens of
other NATO planes, including F-15s, F-16s, F-18s and EA-6B
Prowlers, jets that seek out and destroy air defenses. Shortly
after 7 p.m., under skies turned black, 14 F-16s took off within 15
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In about 90 minutes, more than 60 planes _ or half the American,
Canadian and Spanish aircraft now based at Aviano _ took to the
air.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots were not made available to talk to reporters, but members
of flight crews who service the planes were.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night it seemed everybody worked some,'' said Tech. Sgt.
Rosie Muniz, member of a support crew servicing an F-16 of the Air
Force's 510th Squadron, known as the Buzzards, that flew over
Yugoslavia Wednesday night. ``The tempo was higher than normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the raids took place at night, aircraft were refurbished
during daylight hours for Thursday night's raids.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Airman Jeremiah Sullivan, 23, of Nebraska, responsible
for armaments within the same support crew, said the goal was to
bring back the pilot and the plane safely. The F-16 returned with
its pilot and without a scratch, he said, so he had little work.
</P>
<P>
   The F-16 was parked in a Quonset hut-like hangar out at the edge
of the tarmac, past rows upon rows of F-16s, F-18s, and other
aircraft, all heavily armed with missiles and bombs, waiting for
the night's raids.
</P>
<P>
   Empty streets and depopulated bars and pizzerias in and around
Aviano suggested that the servicemen and women were under orders
not to leave the base or had little time to do so because of the
heavy strain on aircraft and flight and maintenance crews. The
California Beer Bar, a favorite hangout, was closed, and the
Western House bar and pizzeria was empty but for four American
servicemen who hunched over a table soccer game, but refused to
talk with a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Along the road that leads under the flight path, hundreds of
curious Italians gathered to watch the departing aircraft, many
with binoculars or telescopes. Mirko Franzo, a 24-year-old house
painter, said he came often after work to watch the planes, but the
raids over Yugoslavia and the increased flights attracted him
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Security is much tighter tonight than it was Wednesday,'' he
said. On Sunday, he added, a group of local pacifists marched to
protest the presence here of the NATO aircraft, and security
officials hung green mesh on the chain link fence surrounding the
base to prevent outsiders' peering in.

THAT CAREFREE ANNA AND HER ROYAL CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE KING AND I &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An animated film with the voices of Miranda Richardson,
Christiane Noll, Martin Vidnovic, Ian Richardson, Darrell Hammond,
others &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Richard Rich &QL;
</P>
<P>
   G 100 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With an aggressive sea serpent about to make kindling of their
storm-tossed ship, the resourceful Anna rallies herself and the
crew with a jaunty chorus of ``I Whistle a Happy Tune.'' On shore
she'll need that resolve and then some.
</P>
<P>
   Rich's film, based on the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, is
drawn from the real-life 19th-century adventures of Anna Leonowens
by way of a novel (``Anna and the King of Siam'') adapted from her
memoirs. Among other modifications, the King doesn't die.
</P>
<P>
   Anna, of course, is still on her way to teach his children. Her
employer is a self-assured fellow who embraces science, exchanges
high-fives with his black leopard and obstinately clings to
traditions that restrict his people. But the children are appealing
enough to keep Anna on the job, even though the king confines her
and his brood to the palace.
</P>
<P>
   All is not suppression, however, and soon teacher and pupils are
getting along famously. Even the king lightens up slyly if stiffly.
Still, the old ways persist and the situation isn't helped by a
scheming prime minister who seeks to discredit the king and take
the throne himself. This leads to a chase and some action
sequences, with the king acquitting himself dashingly in his
hot-air balloon. Shall we dance? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE Some cartoon pratfalls. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-5 The film supplies goofy sidekicks and works hard to
stay lively, but this isn't the most accessible story for very
young children. ``Hello, Young Lovers'' and palace politics aren't
exactly in their field of interest at this point and that could
make for a long sit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 6-7 For many of them, too, the story will prove slow
going. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 8-11 There will exceptions, of course, but it's hard to
imagine boys flocking to this tale. Girls should find it
appealing. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE DEEP END OF THE OCEAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Pfeiffer, Treat Williams, Whoopi Goldberg, Ryan
Merriman, Cory Buck, Jonathan Jackson &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Ulu Grosbard &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 108 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While she steps to a hotel registration desk for a moment, Beth
Cappadora (Ms. Pfeiffer) leaves her 3-year-old son, Ben, in the
care of her 7-year-old, Vincent. When she returns, Ben is gone,
nowhere to be found, vanished. The police are summoned. ``Five
hours ...,'' someone says. At that point it is feared that harm has
come to a child who may have just wandered off.
</P>
<P>
   For Beth and her husband, Pat (Williams), those hours become
nine years. With two other children, she carries on with her
parenting as best she can and continues her career as a
professional photographer. But her anguish keeps her in a continual
state of distraction that affects her marriage and taints her
relationship with Vincent (Jackson), who has grown into a troubled
and resentful teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day the doorbell rings and there stands a boy looking
for lawn-mowing jobs. Beth immediately recognizes Ben. He is now
named Sam (Merriman) and lives but two blocks away. At this point
Grosbard's film becomes a bit of a thriller as the who, what and
how get sorted out. After that it is a case of a family trying to
adjust to a miracle that soon becomes a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Sam is a mature, well-adjusted child with an adoptive father he
loves and doesn't want to leave. Vincent &UR;  &LR; has grave problems with
his mother and newfound brother. Pat carries on about being one
happy family again, though he knows better. Beth sees the realities
and takes action. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX There are some references. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY A fair amount. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 9 This isn't a movie that would appeal to young
children, nor is it appropriate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 10-14 The film may not hold any immediate attraction for
older children either, but at least it has a brain in its head and
deals with an interesting situation. This is one of those movies
that would hold many (not all) young viewers if they gave it a
chance, especially its highly credible performance by Ms.
Pfeiffer. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ANALYZE THIS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Robert De Niro, Billy Crystal, Lisa Kudrow, Joe Viterelli, Chazz
Palminteri &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Harold Ramis &QL;
</P>
<P>
   R 110 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the mob kingpin Paul Vitti (De Niro) says that he's ``not
thrilled with the level of service here, Doc,'' it gets the
attention of the psychiatrist Ben Sobel (Crystal). Change the first
two letters in Vitti and you get Gotti, which is the kind of
thought that immediately occurs to everybody in this movie.
</P>
<P>
   Vitti has come to Sobel with this little problem here: a
constriction in his chest, a shortness of breath. (Later they get
to the weeping jags and sexual dysfunction.) One doctor has already
been roughed up for suggesting that the trouble is not a heart
attack but intense and admittedly not altogether macho feelings of
anxiety that on occasion give way to total panic.
</P>
<P>
   That is not good news for Vitti, who has a pivotal gangland
confrontation coming up. ``I deal with animals, Doc,'' he says.
``They're very cunning and they smell weakness.'' He puts his life
expectancy at two weeks. Sobel tries to bow out. When Vitti won't
let him, Sobel feels obliged to administer treatment, which means
being on call whenever Vitti has the slightest manifestation.
</P>
<P>
   Vitti learns the ways of therapy. ``I pay you to tell you
something and you say it right back to me,'' he complains. He
dreams about black snow and weeps a lot, one time for 45 minutes
straight at the sight of puppies on television. A therapeutic
session in Miami results in a double homicide. Later Sobel is
forced to shoot his own way out of a hit attempt when Vitti lies
sobbing on the ground curled up in the fetal position.
</P>
<P>
   It all has to do with repressed feelings for his father. Told
about Oedipus, Vitti is afraid to call his mother. But gradually he
opens up to Sobel, begins to recognize his deeper self and regroups
to deal with his colleagues. If only he can stop crying. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE There is much gunfire and other kinds of assault, but
most of it is perpetrated in the spirit of comedy. While people get
hurt, nothing is very graphic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX Vitti has difficulty in bed with his mistress. ``Would you
stop talking? I'm trying to do this here,'' he tells her. At other
times, there are sexual references. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY No one is more prolific with expletives than a mobster
under duress. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 12-14 The R rating is primarily for language, though it
could be argued that the violence and sex approach that level. In
sum, however, the film is often hilarious and has fine
performances. Parents might allow that the positive elements
outweigh the negative ones. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 15 AND UP There really shouldn't be any objection.

HIGH-VOLTAGE BENEFITS OF IMPROVED BATTERIES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most primitive and troublesome components under a
car's hood, the battery, is due for an update, auto company
executives say. As a result, there could be a cascade of new
technologies that would make cars more fuel efficient and less
likely to turn up dead on cold winter mornings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For as long as cars have had batteries, they have stored
electricity with a chemical reaction involving lead and acid.
Although 6-volt systems were once common, automotive electrical
systems were standardized at 12 volts in 1955. Thus, the design now
in use has outlived such mainstays as carburetors, bias-ply tires
and leaded gasoline. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Engineers want to redesign the electrical system partly because
they would like to run more parts of a standard car on electricity,
even if the basic energy source is still a gasoline-driven engine.
</P>
<P>
   Two candidates for conversion to electricity are power-steering
units and some components of transmissions. Both now typically
operate on hydraulic power, which in turn is produced by a pump
driven by belts that run off the drive shaft.
</P>
<P>
   Electric pumps can produce hydraulic pressure more efficiently
in applications where the need for pressure is sporadic. And in
some applications, engineers think they can dispense with
hydraulics altogether and do the job with electricity.
</P>
<P>
   But 12-volt motors that pump hydraulic fluid or move mechanical
components like steering systems are relatively big and
inefficient. Further, the cables that move electricity around at 12
volts are thick and heavy, and the heavier the cable the more
energy is lost within the cable itself.
</P>
<P>
   With higher voltage, engineers could use thinner cables, saving
weight and energy.
</P>
<P>
   At 12 volts, ``we end up adding so many pounds of wire,'' said
Robert Stempel, an advocate of the change. Stempel, the former
chairman of General Motors Corp., is now chairman of Energy
Conversion Devices Inc. of Troy, Mich., which pioneered nickel
metal-hydride batteries, the kind used in cellular phones and
laptop computers. ``Isn't it time to raise voltage?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The standard car battery is known in the industry as an SLI
battery, for starting, lighting and ignition. By adding cells,
lead-acid SLIs could be made to run at any voltage. But these
batteries are bulky already and would quickly become more so as
their voltage was increased.
</P>
<P>
   Stempel hopes to sell nickel metal-hydride batteries with more
than one pair of terminals, each pair giving off a different
voltage _ for example, 12 volts out of one pair, to run the radio,
and 42 out of the other pair, for the power steering. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are other reasons, experts at auto manufacturers say, to
move into more modern SLI batteries, like the ones that have
marched through a range of other consumer products like portable
tape players, cellular phones and laptop computers. Nickel
metal-hydride is a leading contender, but the answer might be
lithium ion, which is also in commercial use in portable electronic
devices. Or it could be some battery technologies that do not yet
exist in other products.
</P>
<P>
   Laptop and phone batteries store more energy per pound and
withstand deep discharges better. In contrast, the standard
automotive lead-acid battery is irreparably damaged by just a few
full discharges _ as when the driver leaves the lights on. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And at extremely low temperatures, nickel metal-hydride loses
less of its ability to deliver current than lead-acid does, its
backers say. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That is a consumer benefit that potential purchasers would have
to be convinced was worth the extra cost. But automakers might be
more likely to change the electrical system for a more direct
reason, better fuel economy, particularly in Japan and Europe. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mark Verbrugge, a General Motors technology specialist now on
loan to the U.S. Advanced Battery Consortium, a research group
financed by the federal government and the auto companies, said
that continuously variable transmissions _ which are under
development by many leading car companies and offered in the United
States on the Honda Civic HX _ would be good candidates for
controls operated by an electric or electro-hydraulic source.
</P>
<P>
   This type of transmission does not use conventional gears, but
belts and pulleys, which could be manipulated by electric-powered
controls, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Steering systems are also a candidate for change. Auto designers
would have new flexibility if the power steering did not have to be
connected to the drive shaft by a belt, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Verbrugge said that these innovations might turn up first in
Japanese models, where fuel economy was more important. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lead-acid has a significant advantage, though: its cost. The
business is so competitive that profits are measured in pennies per
battery, industry executives say. In a new car, the lead-acid
battery costs the auto company only about $25, said John Wallace,
director of environmental vehicles at Ford. A nickel metal-hydride
battery would cost more than $100 extra, he said, and at that price
it would be hard to justify. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Battery storage capacity is often measured in kilowatt hours.
One kilowatt hour is the amount of electricity needed to keep ten
100-watt bulbs lit for an hour; it sells at retail for about 8
cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your laptop battery costs thousands of dollars per
kilowatt-hour of capacity,'' Wallace said. ``An electric vehicle
battery of today costs maybe $1,000 a kilowatt hour. Your SLI
battery costs 50 bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Stempel, though, predicted that prices would fall with mass
production. And if automakers choose SLI batteries using nickel
metal-hydride for even a small part of their production, he said,
the demand would drive output high enough to allow automation and
other cost-cutting technologies. That, he said, could make a
beefed-up battery in a gasoline car a stepping stone to a purely
electric car that would be more affordable than those now on the
market.

ANALYSIS: FROM THE RUSSIANS, HARSH WORDS BUT NOT DEEDS

<P>
   MOSCOW _ As Yugoslavia's ambassador to Russia, the elder brother
of Yugoslav President Slobodon Milosevic has done his best to drum
up support for Yugoslavia in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, Borislav Milosevic does not have much to show
for his efforts.
</P>
<P>
   While Russian officials have railed against the Western alliance
in terms that recall the most tense days of the Cold War, and an
unruly mob protested at the U.S. Embassy here on Thursday, the
Kremlin has been careful not to match its angry rhetoric with
deeds. With the director of the International Monetary Fund set to
visit Moscow over the weekend to continue negotiations for a loan
the Russian government desperately wants, the Kremlin seems to have
calculated that this is no time to escalate its quarrel with the
West.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin signaled as much on Thursday when he
said that his aides had devised ``extreme measures'' to respond to
NATO's attacks but would keep them in reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are above that,'' Yeltsin said. ``On the moral level, we
are superior to the Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   For a nation that waged a bitter and indiscriminate war in
Chechnya, a separatist region in southern Russia, the talk about
moral superiority seemed decidedly out of place. But it is not easy
for the Kremlin to explain its relative impotence to the public.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO began its second day of airstrikes, chauvinism and
indigination were the primary weapons of Russia's public relations
offensive. Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov lambasted the
bombing attacks as an American attempt to bully the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The true aims are obvious,'' Ivanov declared at a press
conference on Thursday. ``To impose on the world the political,
military, and economic dictate of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin, the chief of Russian General Staff, then
gave a skewed military briefing, noting incorrectly that two NATO
combat planes had been shot down and suggesting that NATO ground
forces were poised to invade the Balkan nation, a plan the alliance
denies.
</P>
<P>
   But in its deeds, Russia has been far more measured. It recalled
its ambassador to NATO and announced it would not attend a NATO
celebration next month in Washington, both symbolic steps. Prime
Minister Yevgeni Primakov said on Thursday that the ratification of
the START-2 treaty would be deferred, but not necessarily killed.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's political and military weakness is one reason for its
temperate response. Not even Belgrade takes Moscow's appeals
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   So is Russia's economic neediness, a fact driven home this week
by the continued slide of the ruble, which fell to 26 rubles to the
dollar Thursday from 22 last week.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to assuage Russia, the United States encouraged the IMF
director to go to Moscow. Russia is seeking to receive a large
enough loan from the fund to offset the $4.8 billion it owes the
fund this year.
</P>
<P>
   So this is no time for the Kremlin to test the West's patience.
</P>
<P>
   At Yugoslavia's embassy, the gap between Russia's admonishments
and actions seemed clear. Borislav Milosevic, a dapper diplomat who
said he had not talked to his brother since the NATO strikes began,
thanked Moscow for its moral support.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Kremlin's public statements, thousands of
Russians have called to offer their services, including one Russian
army unit, according to an aide to the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   Ragtag groups of volunteers, however, are unlikely to be of
great help to the Serbian military, and Borislav Milosevic said
there were no plans to actually transport them to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But Yugoslavia is not receiving as much backing as it might.
Yugoslavia and Russia, for example, have a military agreement under
which Moscow services Soviet-era military equipment _ an accord
that has been shelved because of the U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia says that Russia should no longer feel legally bound
by the sanctions. The Communists and Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov have
urged the Kremlin to ignore the sanctions, but Primakov says Russia
will continue to abide by them, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   At his embassy, Borislav Milosevic sought to put the best face
on the situation. ``The Russian response,'' he said hopefully, ``is
a process.''

   KOSOVO-RDP (Washington) _ NATO launched an aerial bombardment on
Yugoslavia for a second night, firing on Serb targets from ships in
the Adriatic. Western leaders had promised a second night of

   QUITO, Ecuador _ A leftist member of Congress here is
assassinated just a few yards from the Capitol building, and
Colombians with ties to that country's right-wing death squads are
arrested for the crime. A wealthy Venezuelan businessman is
kidnapped in Caracas and ends up in the hands a left-wing Colombian
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   For more than three decades, Colombia has endured a conflict in
which both sides regard civilians as targets. But the scope of the
strife seems to be widening.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clearly becoming a major and much wider regional
problem, spilling over Colombia's borders,'' said Michael Shifter,
a senior fellow at the policy analysis group Inter-American
Dialogue in Washington. ``As the Colombian situation deteriorates
and it becomes clear that it cannot be resolved simply by the
Colombians, that may bring neighboring countries together to work
out a coordinated, sustained response.''
</P>
<P>
   Since at least 1996, units of the Peasant Self-Defense Forces,
Colombia's main right-wing paramilitary group have made forays into
Panama, attacking villages and killing civilians in the remote
Darien province,
</P>
<P>
   But the assassination of Jaime Hurtado, a leader of an
Ecuadorean Marxist-Leninist party called the Popular Democratic
Movement, on a busy downtown street here Feb. 17 marked a new level
of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Hurtado, a native of Esmeraldas, a port town that has long been
a center of contraband trade with Colombia, was gunned down with
two associates as he left Congress. Several Colombians living here
were quickly arrested.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview this month with the Bogota newspaper El Tiempo,
Carlos Castano, the main paramilitary leader, stopped short of
taking responsibility for Hurtado's death. He attributed the
killing to ``an international military support front'' sympathetic
to his group, and said it was justified because Hurtado was ``the
biggest supplier of arms'' to the main guerrilla group, the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Castano threatened to extend the conflict into
Venezuela, Colombia's eastern neighbor and traditional rival. He
accused Venezuela's new populist president, Hugo Chavez, of
``throwing open his arms to the guerrillas'' since taking office in
February, and said that while it was acceptable for Chavez to offer
Venezuelan territory as a site for peace talks, ``he cannot convert
his country into a refuge for guerrillas.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez ``is going to have a problem, because we are going to
apply hot pursuit there, and there are going to be
confrontations,'' Castano warned. ``If in Caracas they are going to
offer refuge to the big chiefs so they can plan their violent
offensives against our country from over there, then our
self-defense will extend to Caracas.''
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, the Venezuelan government responded emphatically:
If Castano's forces try to cross the border, they will be ``taught
a lesson,'' said Interior Minister Luis Miquilena warned.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, left-wing guerrillas also seem to have expanded
their theater of action. In a case that shocked Venezuelans, a
prominent Caracas businessman was recently kidnapped by local
criminals and ``sold'' to Colombia's second-largest guerrilla
group, the National Liberation Army, which returned him to his
family after being paid a ransom of several million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, a former army paratrooper who led a violent,
unsuccessful coup attempt in 1992, has declared himself neutral in
the Colombian conflict. But Colombian President Andres Pastrana
canceled a meeting with Chavez on their border two weeks ago after
Chavez suggested that the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia
now controlled enough territory to be formally recognized as a
``belligerent'' force under international law.
</P>
<P>
   When Chavez was elected in December, the Revolutionary Armed
Forces welcomed him, calling the vote ``a victory for the people''
over a corrupt ``party machine.'' In an interview with Reuters at
that time, Joaquin Gomez, a senior guerrilla commander, described
Chavez's rise to power as ``a moral stimulus to all those patriotic
soldiers in both Colombia and the rest of Latin America.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Chavez has provided a safe haven for the National
Liberation Army's No. 2 leader, Antonio Garcia, in Maracaibo. It is
not known if the guerrilla group agreed to cease its operations in
Venezuela in return for asylum, but rebel leaders did hold two
rounds of inconclusive peace talks with Colombian officials in
Caracas in February.
</P>
<P>
   The deepening tensions have also contributed to a worsening of
relations between Colombia and Peru. In a speech to the
Inter-American Defense College in Washington in February, President
Alberto Fujimori of Peru reproached his Colombian counterpart for
beginning peace talks with the rebels, saying he ``finds the
dialogue to be incomprehensible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are observing with deep concern the growth of the old and
illegal armed groups in the neighboring sister republic of
Colombia,'' Fujimori told his audience, United States and Latin
American military and civilian officials. ``This alarming situation
worries us because it can cease to be a national problem and become
a threat to regional security.''
</P>
<P>
   In the speech, later criticized by Colombian officials, Fujimori
noted: ``There is also a well-known ideological and practical link
between the Colombian guerrillas and Peruvian terrorist
organizations. It is a reality that these groups violate the
sovereignty of neighboring countries and encourage the
internationalization of the armed struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Military officials say Fujimori recently sent troops to the
border.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Brazil and Colombia have been trying to
negotiate a border cooperation agreement, and are to meet next
month to discuss problems along their remote and lightly defended
frontier. A Brazilian official involved in the talks said his
government is concerned about ``guaranteeing our territory''
against incursions by guerrillas and drug traffickers, who are
often one and the same.
</P>
<P>
   To Hurtado's surviving associates here, all of these recent
developments suggest that his assassination was, in the words of
Ciro Guzman, the party's national director, ``a crime of state.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Ecuadorean and U.S. officials have denied any role in the
killing, but Guzman maintains that strategic interests lie behind
the assassination.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to justify the formation of a multinational army of
Ecuadorean, Peruvian and Brazilian forces to fight a regional war
in support of the Colombian army,'' Guzman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such an army would have the full backing of the United States,
but it would pulverize the Colombian people and convert Colombia
into a new Vietnam.''

THE OSCARS: AND THE WHINER IS... 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Academy Awards night _ Hollywood's annual orgy of
puffery and preening _ I find an extravagant bore.
Self-congratulation, no matter how it's fancied-up in feathers,
sequins and rented jewelry, does not play well as entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   What I (ital)do(end ital) enjoy is the whining one hears
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   This year's award for best whiners went to the moguls at
Dreamworks, producers of ``Saving Private Ryan.'' Fox
Entertainment, maker of ``A Thin Red Line,'' took the honors as
best supporting whiner.
</P>
<P>
   The target of their wounded complaints was Harvey Weinstein,
boss at Miramax, whom they accused of an unwholesome lust for
Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   (But I seem to recall that we saw them sitting there, too,
dressed to the nines, faces alight with vanity and expectation.)
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein, they implied, had bought his prizes with extravagant
promotional campaigns for ``Life Is Beautiful'' and ``Shakespeare
in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Do we detect, here, the faint flavor of sour grapes?
</P>
<P>
   I'm not, thank heaven, a professional motion picture critic,
condemned to spend my life watching the torrent of stuff the movie
industry churns out, much of it trivial.
</P>
<P>
   But in the course of a year we do spend a good number of
evenings at what I still like to call the picture show. A lot of
those are wasted evenings. A glorious few are not _ and it is the
hope of one of those, like the one good golf shot in a duffer's
round, that keeps us coming back.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, I saw all four of the pictures mentioned above,
and my wife saw three of them, passing up ``Private Ryan'' because
of the violence it contained.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely because of that violence, the beginning of the movie
was riveting _ depicting with uncommon power the horrific agony of
combat. After that, though, there was only the most insubstantial
of stories to tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Thin Red Line'' was, to my mind, a tedious dog. Not a single
scene of it can be recalled.
</P>
<P>
   These, mind you, are only an amateur's opinions. The views of
the industry savants who touted both movies, especially ``Ryan,''
as front-runners in the Oscar sweepstakes no doubt carry greater
weight.
</P>
<P>
   But then we often disagree with the experts. They gave short
shrift to ``Analyze This,'' which we found wonderfully
entertaining. By contrast, an Irish picture called ``The General,''
proclaimed a wonder, seemed plodding and unoriginal.
</P>
<P>
   The response of ordinary movie-goers may not be very important,
but it must count for something. And my (ital)guess(end ital),
while it can't be proved, is that the public would say the awards
for the year's best actor and best picture were dead on the mark.
</P>
<P>
   The nights we were there, the audiences for Roberto Benigni's
miraculous ``Life Is Beautiful'' and for ``Shakespeare in Love''
remained in their seats until the last line of credits had scrolled
across the screen.
</P>
<P>
   And when finally they left the theater, they wore expressions
that suggested they'd been more than just entertained. They'd been
touched to their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Or isn't that what movies are supposed to do?

a baby will be born _ is a form of gambling that, technically, is
illegal in Missouri and Kansas. You could be charged with a
misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, though, law enforcement officials admit that office
pools aren't likely to land you in deep water.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson County, Kan., District Attorney Paul Morrison says that
when something of value is wagered on games of chance (such as
betting on sports events over which you have no control), that's
against the law. Ditto, says the chief deputy prosecuting attorney
of Jackson County, Mo., David Baker.
</P>
<P>
   The only forms of gambling that are legal in Kansas are
pari-mutuel wagering and lotteries sanctioned by the state. In
Missouri, only licensed gambling, such as games of chance on the
riverboats and the state lotteries, is legal.
</P>
<P>
   So if you put cash in a March Madness betting pool, you broke
the law.
</P>
<P>
   The odds, though, are heavily against your getting in trouble _
unless you're a bookie who skims profits off the top. Frankly,
prosecutors said, law enforcement priorities are elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   More than 500 U.S. human-resource professionals, surveyed by the
Society for Human Resource Management, gave insight into the
prevalence of gambling on their job sites _ ranging from 58 percent
who had workplace Super Bowl bets down to 2 percent who had
employees participating in fantasy basketball leagues.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to NCAA basketball tournament pools, they cited
other common forms of workplace wagering, including football season
pools, group lottery purchases, golf tournament pools, and fantasy
baseball and football leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-three percent of the human-resource respondents said their
organizations had no written policies about workplace gambling.
Eleven percent said their organizations had policies that were not
written but ``understood.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the 34 percent of organizations that had written policies,
more than half of them prohibited workplace wagering. About
one-fifth ``permitted but discouraged'' it. Sixteen percent of the
written policies actually permitted on-site gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, human-resource people weren't too worried about
gambling on the job. For one thing, they didn't see a productivity
loss because of wasted time. For another, few bosses want to be
hard-nosed meanies and steal a few moments of fun from employees.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Morrison nor Baker could remember a workplace gambling
case hitting their offices. But if some righteous individual chose
to file a complaint because of money changing hands illegally,
they'd have to look into it.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone worried about the potential consequences could do what
Morrison counsels for his office staff: Bet for pride, not money.
If no cash changes hands, there's no crime.

SENATOR RESPONDS TO GOVERNOR'S COMMUTATION OF A DEATH SENTENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan's decision to spare the
life of a condemned killer has prompted Sen. John Ashcroft to
propose a change in a possible constitutional amendment on victims'
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft, facing a challenge from Carnahan in Senate elections
next year, said Wednesday that relatives of victims have a right to
be notified if a governor decides to commute a death sentence. Two
months ago at the request of Pope John Paul II, Carnahan spared the
life of Darrell Mease, who had killed three persons.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft related the story of Mease to the Senate Judiciary
Committee, on which he serves, without mentioning Carnahan by name.
Later, he denied that his proposal had political underpinnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proposing this because this is the way to help victims of
crimes relieve the distress of being ignored in the criminal
justice system,'' Ashcroft said.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan campaign spokesman Roy Temple saw it differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's dragging crime victims and their families into his
political gamesmanship,'' Temple said. ``It's pretty pathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft brought up the Mease case during a committee discussion
of a broader constitutional amendment on victims' rights. Ashcroft
proposed changing the amendment to ensure that relatives are
consulted before a commutation.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft said relatives of a couple and their paraplegic
grandson whom Mease shot to death ``did not get a phone call, even
a letter'' about Carnahan's decision to let Mease spend his life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just wrong, and it violates our basic sense of decency,
fairness and compassion,'' Ashcroft told the committee.
</P>
<P>
   But Chris Sifford, the governor's press secretary, said
Carnahan's office did contact some of the victim's relatives in the
hours before the governor signed the document to commute Mease's
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to inform as many family members as we could, but we
didn't reach all of them, due to human error,'' he said. The
Department of Corrections did not have adequate information on how
to contact relatives, Sifford said.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan has said he is comfortable with the Mease decision and
made it because he was very moved that the pope paused in his visit
to St. Louis to seek mercy for one individual.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor didn't make a politically calculated decision,''
Temple said. ``He did it based on the set of circumstances he was
faced with.''
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, a spokesman for the Missouri Republican Party
said, Ashcroft is not being political by using the case to make an
argument for greater victims' rights in death sentence
commutations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing political about the murder of a paraplegic
teen-ager,'' Daryl Duwe said. ``That's what the death penalty law
was written for.''
</P>
<P>
   Duwe said Carnahan could have told the pope, ``We have a law and
my job is to uphold the law.'' Carnahan has signed off on 26
executions during his six years in office.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft portrayed himself to the Senate committee as a
supporter of victims' rights when he was Missouri governor for
eight years. In his final year as governor in 1992, he said,
Missouri voters enacted a constitutional amendment on victims'
rights.
</P>
<P>
   But the lead sponsor of a resolution that put that issue on the
ballot said Wednesday he didn't recall that Ashcroft did anything
to help the measure pass. The resolution did not require or get
Ashcroft's signature to get on the ballot. He could have signed it
but did not, said Sen. Harold Caskey, a Butler Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a victims' rights group that promoted it,'' Caskey
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sifford said Carnahan has the better record on victims' rights.
Carnahan proposed and helped pass a 1994 victims' rights bill that
required victims to be given more information about the sentencing,
pardoning or commuting of sentences of criminals, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft told the Senate committee that the proposed federal
amendment allows victims to be heard at every critical stage from
trial to imprisonment, ``but it denies victims any rights when a
governor considers overturning a sentence with a stroke of his
pen.''
</P>
<P>
   He said later, ``This amendment can be improved by understanding
the pain that crime victims can suffer when they are not consulted
or informed or are not participants in a process that gets involved
in the executive branch.''
</P>
<P>
   Victim rights is not the only crime-related issue Ashcroft has
focused on in recent months. He pushed legislation earlier this
year that directed more money to Missouri to fight the
methamphetamine problem and he plans to hold a public forum in
Kansas City Tuesday to discuss meth legislation.
</P>
<P>
   He also sponsored a bill this month that would crack down on
those who use juveniles to commit crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft had considered a bid for president but decided to focus
instead on getting re-elected after Carnahan declared last November
that he was running for the seat Ashcroft won in 1994.

 POLL TRACKS MISSOURIANS' RESPONSES On CONCEALED-WEAPONS ISSUE  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIT WAGAR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ With less than two weeks to go, the campaign
to legalize concealed weapons in Missouri appears to be too close
to call, a statewide poll by The Kansas City Star showed.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, conducted last week, found that 42 percent of voters
surveyed opposed Proposition B, which would allow Missourians to
carry a concealed gun for the first time in 124 years. Thirty-nine
percent supported it.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers were well within the poll's margin of error of
plus or minus 4 points, making the race a statistical toss up.
</P>
<P>
   The overall findings, however, masked wide variations in the
proposition's appeal between African-Americans and whites, men and
women and voters in rural and urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   While whites were evenly split _ 41 percent for the measure vs.
40 percent against _ African-Americans opposed the proposition by a
ratio of nearly 4 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Men were nearly twice as likely as women to support the measure.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City and St. Louis, solid majorities planned to vote
against it. The measure would pass in rural areas 43 to 37 percent,
but that support also was within the poll's error margin.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition B, by far the biggest issue on the April 6 ballot,
would allow Missouri residents to get a permit to carry concealed
guns after passing a background check and taking 12 hours of
firearms training. Permits could be denied to people convicted of
felonies, habitual drunks and the mentally incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters argue that the proposal would reduce crime and return
a fundamental privilege to law-abiding adults. Opponents say it
would increase the number of accidental shootings and cause minor
arguments to escalate into gunplay.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found, however, that substantial numbers of potential
voters question whether concealed weapons play a role in reducing
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Even among people who support concealed weapons, one in four
said they don't. Close to half of the gun owners _ 45 percent _
opposed the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly eight in 10 of the respondents had no plans to apply for
a concealed-carry permit. And fewer than half of those who would
get a permit ever expect to use their gun for protection.
</P>
<P>
   Among African-Americans surveyed, four in six opposed concealed
guns while just one in six supported them.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Rosenfeld, a criminology professor at the University of
Missouri-St. Louis, said those results were less a racial
difference than a reflection of the black community's experience
with guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those numbers reflect the hard-won experience of black people,
who face a significantly higher risk of gun violence than whites,''
Rosenfeld said. ``With no experience, it's easy to suppose that
with lots of guns, there is less violence. But people who deal with
it know that it's hard to support that myth.''
</P>
<P>
   Missouri crime statistics support Rosenfeld's observation.
African-Americans make up just 11 percent of Missouri's 5.4 million
people. But they made up 62 percent of the murder victims in 1997,
the latest statistics available.
</P>
<P>
   That experience with gun violence may help explain a paradox.
African-Americans don't support the concealed weapons law, but they
would be much more likely than whites to seek a permit if the
proposition becomes law. More than a third of the African-Americans
surveyed said they intended to apply for a permit compared with one
in five whites.
</P>
<P>
   While gun ownership rates were similar for African-Americans and
whites, their reasons for owning guns were very different. Among
whites, nearly half owned guns for hunting; less than one in four
owned guns for protection.
</P>
<P>
   Among African-Americans, 25 percent owned guns to hunt; 55
percent owned guns for protection.
</P>
<P>
   More than eight in 10 African-Americans also rejected the
argument that more guns means less crime. About 57 percent of
whites said guns fail to reduce crime.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfeld said urban violence also helps explain the sharp
division in attitudes between the state's two major cities and the
rest of the state.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City and St. Louis, 57 percent of those polled opposed
Proposition B. Only one in three Kansas City voters supported it.
In St. Louis, support was only one in five.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Missouri, where half the people surveyed own guns,
supported the proposal by a slim margin.
</P>
<P>
   In rural areas, Rosenfeld said, people see a low incidence of
crime and a high degree of gun ownership and conclude that a
concealed-gun law would be a good idea. Realities of urban life, in
which handguns are an integral part of gang activity, drug dealing
and other crime, put guns in a different light, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Star's poll surveyed 600 registered voters from
March 14 to 17. Calls were random except for controls to obtain an
accurate sampling by gender, county and age to match Missouri's
population.
</P>
<P>
   The poll is accurate with a 95 percent degree of confidence with
a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points on each
figure. Therefore, when comparing two figures _ such as the total
supporting and the total opposing proposition B _ each figure could
be off by up to 4 points, creating as much as an 8-point difference
from the poll results.

FARM PARITY EFFORT RAISES CRITICISMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY L. THOMAS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) In 1977, Eugene Schroder co-founded the American
Agriculture Movement, a group that later made headlines when
thousands of farmers drove their tractors to Washington, D.C., to
protest farm conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The movement fizzled in the 1980s after years of unsuccessful
attempts to change agriculture policy and help farmers get higher
prices for their products.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Colorado rancher and veterinarian is back. Schroder
will be in northeast Kansas Thursday night to garner support for
what he says is a new grass-roots effort to resolve the current
farm crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Schroder said the campaign _ called The Parity Group _ began
about three weeks ago and has rapidly gained momentum. A March 4
meeting in Hereford, Texas, attracted 500 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are literally thousands of people working on this,''
Schroder said. ``There are meetings taking place every day all
across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   But those who monitor right-wing groups say the campaign raises
concerns. They say that Schroder's former organization was
influenced by the paramilitary Posse Comitatus group and that he is
taking advantage of the depressed farm economy to create a
political movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eugene Schroder has come up with a dozen schemes over the last
20 years, all of which he has said would help the farmer,'' said
Devin Burghart of the Center for New Community, an Illinois-based
group that monitors right-wing activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of them ever helped the farmer, and most of them pointed
farmers away from dealing with the real economics of agriculture
and toward cockamamie conspiracy theories.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroder, 51, said the concerns are unfounded and denies
involvement with any anti-government group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know what that group (Posse Comitatus) ever did
or what it stood for,'' Schroder said. ``I'm not a radical. I'm
just a farmer and a rancher and a veterinarian. I think I've
perceived some fundamental issues that are important, dealing
strictly with matters of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers are expecting at least 200 to attend tonight's
meeting in Seneca.
</P>
<P>
   According to press reports, some American Agriculture Movement
members _ including Schroder _ attended a three-day ``survival
school'' in Weskan, Kan., in 1982. One of the instructors was a
well-known Posse Comitatus leader.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Kansas Attorney General Bob Stephan released a report
indicating that the school taught sessions on knife fighting,
guerrilla warfare, bomb-making and hand-to-hand combat.
</P>
<P>
   Schroder says he doesn't remember whether he attended the
training session.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, critics say, Schroder has become a proponent of
common-law courts _ those created by groups that deny the
legitimacy of the traditional court system. In June 1995, he helped
organize a National Common Law Grand Jury in Wichita that attracted
600 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I was there,'' Schroder said. ``It was just an assembly
of people working on some of these matters that we felt needed to
be reviewed.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroder also has attended events in the Kansas City area. He
was a featured speaker at the Mid-America Constitution Conference
in 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1998. The conferences were attended by
hundreds of ``patriots'' who believe the government has overstepped
its constitutional bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Schroder and his followers are focusing their latest campaign on
a series of extraordinary measures passed by Congress decades ago
to deal with the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   One of the measures, the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933,
delegated authority to the executive branch to establish parity
between farm prices and the price of goods and services purchased
by farmers.
</P>
<P>
   According to Schroder's theory, the president still retains the
powers delegated under those emergency measures, and through an
executive order could restore agriculture commodity prices to a
fair and equitable level.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the effort, Schroder and others are circulating a
``Notice and Demand'' petition that they plan to serve President
Clinton, Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman and Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   If no action is taken, Schroder said, ``we're going to attempt
to organize the largest class-action lawsuit against this
government that maybe it has ever seen.''

RULING OPENS DOOR TO LAWSUITS AGAINST HMO DOCTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CAHER  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The family of a young father who died after he
was allegedly given the run-around by a health maintenance
organization and its affiliated physician can sue the doctor for
malpractice, New York's highest court ruled Thursday in a
ground-breaking decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals unanimously overturned a lower court and
held that the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act
(ERISA) does not shield the HMO doctor from liability.
</P>
<P>
   That means the family of Glenn Nealy, a 37-year-old Bronx man
who died of a heart attack in 1992 and left behind a wife and two
small children, can take their case to court.
</P>
<P>
   Nealy's family contends that Dr. Ralph Yung failed to take
timely action to treat the patient. However, the family was blocked
by ERISA _ until Thursday _ from suing Yung.
</P>
<P>
   ERISA, which was enacted in 1974, is a federal statute that
governs the administration of all employee benefit plans, including
health plans. It effectively blocks state court lawsuits _ such as
medical malpractice lawsuits _ against HMOs. Thursday's ruling
punctures at least part of the ERISA shield.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye, writing for the court, held that
since Yung's alleged conduct was not purely administrative, he is
not immunized by ERISA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is opening the door a little bit for the next line
of cases,'' said Bhalinder L. Rikhye, the lawyer who represents the
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Marc S. Oxman, the lawyer for the Nealy family, said that while
the court did not completely remove the ERISA shield, it indicated
it may be ``moving in that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would speculate they are sending a clear message to the
Legislature to get off their (rear ends) and pass a patient's bill
of rights,'' Oxman said.
</P>
<P>
   Records show Yung, a participating provider of US Healthcare,
examined Nealy, who had a history of heart disease, in April 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Yung, according to court records, recommended Nealy see a
specialist, but did not immediately handle the referral
requirements of the HMO. Consequently, the lawsuit alleges, Nealy's
treatment was delayed several days.
</P>
<P>
   Yung contends any delay in treatment was Nealy's own fault, and
alleges the patient was concerned with having to pay a deductible.
Nealy died of a heart attack on May 18, 1992, the day before he was
scheduled to see a specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Until Thursday, it appeared that the facts of the case would
never be decided by a jury. A mid-level appellate court, citing
ERISA, said the Nealy family was barred from suing Yung. The Court
of Appeals, however, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye said the fact that Yung, as a primary care physician
associated with US Healthcare, was required to complete and submit
referral documents ``does not transform Dr. Yung into an ERISA plan
administrator.'' Consequently, he will have to answer the
allegations in court, Kaye said.
</P>
<P>
   The case attracted substantial attention from both the legal and
medical communities. Both the New York attorney general, Eliot
Spitzer, and the federal Department of Labor had urged the court to
overturn the lower ruling.

TEXAS OFFICIALS NAB RINGLEADER OF ALLEGED SCAM 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A Houston man has been arrested in an alleged
insurance fraud scheme netting more than $10 million in settlements
for faked injuries and staged car wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Ferdman, 40, was in custody Thursday as the alleged
mastermind and ringleader of a scam that authorities say involved
cooperative lawyers and chiropractors in Houston, Austin and El
Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Arrest warrants also were issued for five others, although law
enforcement officials estimate that more than 30 people across
Texas participated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The integrity of the legal profession, the insurance process
and the medical profession are issues in which the public has an
abiding interest,'' said Travis County District Attorney Ronnie
Earl, whose public integrity unit led the yearlong investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have here is an effort to defraud insurance companies
that ends up victimizing not just the insurance company but ethical
honest lawyers, the medical profession and the rate paying
public,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Ferdman, who Houston officials said is charged with soliciting a
bribe, is accused of paying others to gather accident reports from
police in order to refer accident victims to lawyers involved in
the scam. The lawyers then sent the clients to chiropractors who
prescribed lengthy and often unnecessary treatments and then sought
settlements from insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston on Wednesday, police armed with warrants conducted
searches of Ferdman's residence, and the business offices of
attorneys Mickey Altman, Donna McCarty and Lloyd Dunn. A search
also was conducted at the business office of Jack El Cubano Store,
a furniture and clothing outlet, which is suspected of laundering
millions of dollars from the scam.
</P>
<P>
   The five others named in the scheme include two employees of
Uptown Austin Rehabilitation Center: manager Victor Hugo Cuevas,
31, and clinic driver Juan Del Toro, 32. The others are Eric
Arriola and Raul Cucvas, of Austin, and Armando Casillas of El
Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Pena, president of the Texas Bar Association, said
lawyers involved in the scheme could face disbarment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This situation, if proven to be true, is disgusting to Texas
lawyers because it adds to the deterioration of the public's trust
and confidence in the legal profession,'' he said.

POOR STILL NOT USING BANKS FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS

 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Marilyn Vasquez quickly dismisses the notion that she
would be better off using a bank. Local check cashers ``don't ask
for so much ID,'' says Ms. Vasquez, 20, a resident of the Bronx.
``Banks are too much hassle.''
</P>
<P>
   She is not alone. Many people, especially in low-income
neighborhoods, do not use banks citing inconvenience, high fees or
a lack of branches nearby. But there is another reason: Banks often
do not tell people that anyone can open a basic low-fee checking
account.
</P>
<P>
   More than one in eight families nationwide have no bank account,
according to government estimates. And while New York and New
Jersey have broad-reaching ``lifeline'' laws requiring banks to
offer low-cost accounts to anybody, few poor people take advantage
of them. And similar laws in other states _ including Illinois,
Massachusetts, Minnesota, Rhode Island and Vermont _ are even more
limited.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, recent attempts to require low-cost accounts
nationwide have been killed in the Republican-controlled Congress.
This month, the House Banking Committee voted along party lines to
exclude lifeline banking from a bill repealing the Glass-Steagall
Act's barriers between the banking, securities and insurance
industries. The Treasury Department, meanwhile, is working on a
partial solution that would not require new legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The middling success of low-cost checking in New York and
elsewhere illustrates the difficulty of bringing the nation's poor
into the banking mainstream. The banks' reluctance to promote the
accounts has played a large role, but even those who say the laws
are worthwhile cite other factors.
</P>
<P>
   Often, low-income people do not have enough identification to
satisfy a bank, leaving no option but check cashers that charge
fees. And some people face judgments, collections or other legal
problems and do not want a financial record or simply have no money
left after paying for basic needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this naive notion that if we could just have
low-cost checking accounts, everyone would put money in the bank,''
said John P. Caskey, a Swarthmore College economics professor and
an expert on the financial habits of the poor. ``Clearly that
hasn't happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Such laws have ``certainly had some incremental, positive
effect,'' he said, but ``the overall effect has been quite small.''
</P>
<P>
   Studies by consumer advocates have found that the poor can spend
four times as much at check-cashing outlets as they would for basic
accounts. But since New York enacted one of the toughest laws in
the nation four years ago requiring banks to offer basic services
to anyone for $3 a month, surprisingly few people have opened such
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The New York state law says the most that banks can demand to
open an account is $25 and must keep the account open as long as a
customer maintains a 1 cent minimum balance. It allows at least
eight free withdrawals a month using checks or cash machines.
</P>
<P>
   For regular accounts, many large banks charge $9 or more a
month, plus other fees, unless the customer carries at least a
$1,500 balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really sort of the hidden steal in banking in New York,''
said Russ Haven, legislative counsel at the New York Public
Interest Research Group, a nonprofit research and advocacy
organization. ``Unfortunately, most consumers don't have any
idea.''
</P>
<P>
   In a study last year, his group found that a third of bank
employees did not mention low-cost options when customers asked
about checking accounts. The group found that 4 of 10 banks posting
information about account options did not include low-cost
accounts, as required by state law. And calls to banks showed they
frequently emphasized higher-fee accounts and were often slow to
mention _ and occasionally denied altogether _ that they offered
low-cost accounts.
</P>
<P>
   For certain, both New York and New Jersey have seen benefits.
Regulators in New Jersey estimate that 700,000 residents now have
low-cost accounts.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer advocates and researchers say the laws often have
not helped many people they were designed for. Even New Jersey
officials, who call their program a success, say the primary users
are college students. They say they plan to push for more marketing
in poorer areas.
</P>
<P>
   A report published in a Federal Reserve Bank of New York journal
last summer found that the laws had a limited impact bringing the
working poor into banks and would not work better unless consumers
were better informed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The banks are nightmares,'' said Bertha Lewis, head organizer
for the Brooklyn chapter of the Association of Community
Organizations for Reform Now. Commonly known as Acorn, the national
group is pushing for improved lending in poor areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You call branches,'' Ms. Lewis said, ``and they don't know
what you're talking about. There's no incentive for these banks to
do this. This is the quietest law you never heard about.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Bankers say they comply with the law and defend their record of
serving poor areas. Chase Manhattan says it has about 235,000
customers enrolled in low-cost accounts in New Jersey, New York and
Connecticut. About half of them live in low- or moderate-income
neighborhoods _ the bank cannot say how many are actually
low-income _ and many of the rest are college students.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet Financial Group says it has about 50,000 lifeline
customers in New York City and Long Island. Citibank, the banking
arm of Citigroup, declined to give a number.
</P>
<P>
   Michael P. Smith, the president of the New York Bankers
Association, called the program a success, but he added that it
``was never designed to be a cure-all.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Treasury officials are putting final touches on a
plan they hope will give more than 6 million recipients of federal
benefits without accounts the option of having checks deposited
directly into a new type of account at banks, credit unions and
savings associations.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, industry representatives say most banks offer some
form of basic account. But the most attractive accounts are
vanishing quickly: In 1997, just 3 percent of banks offered free
checking, a sharp drop from the 14 percent that offered it two
years earlier, according to the Federal Reserve. In New York, only
one bank in 77 offered it.
</P>
<P>
   Mandatory low-cost banking grew out of fears that rising fees,
as well as branch closings that often follow bank mergers, would
erode poor people's access to the banking system.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the number of banks, savings banks, savings and
loans and credit union branches has dropped 4 percent the last
decade, according to Sheshunoff Information Services Inc., a
research firm in Austin, Tex. In the same period, check-cashing
outlets tripled to 7,000, according to industry estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the number of check-cashing stores has risen 11 percent
in New York the last four years. And from 1994 to 1997, the value
of checks cashed by outlets in New Jersey rose by one-fifth, to $3
billion.
</P>
<P>
   But even with more check cashers, New York regulators have
proposed raising the cap on fees to 1.4 percent of the amount of
the check from 1.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups say the increase will harm many poor people. But
state banking regulators, relying in part on a report commissioned
by the industry that argues that operating profit margins at
check-cashing outlets had dropped to 18 percent in 1996 after
holding steady at 22.5 percent from 1988 to 1993, say the increase
is warranted.
</P>
<P>
   Dollar Financial Group, which operates more than 400
check-cashing outlets in the United States and Canada, estimates
that only 30 percent of its customers have bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   It says it provides an advantage important to many low-income
people. ``These customers rely on their current income to cover
immediate living expenses,'' the company explains in its annual
report, ``and cannot afford the delays inherent in waiting for
checks to clear.''
</P>
<P>
   But even many people who might be willing to put up with delays
often have little choice. In the poorest urban areas, entire ZIP
codes have no banks. In parts of the South Bronx, for example, no
banks exist ``for 15 blocks in any direction,'' said Matthew Lee,
executive director of Inner City Press-Community on the Move, which
has challenged big bank mergers.
</P>
<P>
   And even where there are banks, customers at check-cashing
outlets often do not know they have a lower-cost option. ``There
are a lot of people working around here under the impression you
can't get'' an account without high fees, said Denise Gunn,
standing outside a check-cashing store on 149th Street near Third
Avenue in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Haven, the New York public-interest lawyer, said bounced-check
fees, always a concern for those with low balances scare some
people off. That factor will grow, he said, if state regulators
approve a proposal to eliminate the $15 cap on such fees at
state-chartered banks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some people want to keep their financial lives
private because they face debt collectors or child-support
judgments or are earning income off-the-books.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan C. Lafayette, a Democratic Assemblyman whose Queens
district includes a large immigrant population, adds that a number
of immigrants rely on check cashers because they are unfamiliar
with banks.
</P>
<P>
   Some low-income residents find it impossible to produce enough
identification to open accounts. In contrast, a study by the
Consumer Federation of America found that only 8 percent of
check-cashing stores required more than one form of ID.
</P>
<P>
   Banks say they do inform customers about low-fee checking and
have taken steps to preserve low-cost services in poorer areas.
Chase says it loses millions of dollars a year offering low-cost
accounts, which by agreement with New York officials cost $4 a
month, not $3, but allow 10 withdrawals monthly.
</P>
<P>
   New York banking regulators say they do not keep statistics on
low-cost accounts. Evaluations in 1996 and 1997 ``indicated that
some bank personnel may not have been fully familiar'' with their
low-cost accounts, officials found. Last year, they said, a
majority of the banks evaluated were complying fully.
</P>
<P>
   Some groups are trying alternatives. Professor Caskey of
Swarthmore points to an experiment in Los Angeles, where Washington
Mutual, a large savings association, and Strategic Actions for a
Just Economy, a community group, will begin a pilot program this
year with about 1,000 welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   They will have checks deposited directly into accounts with no
minimum balance or monthly fees and which will allow five free
money orders a month.
</P>
<P>
   Many participants are already more comfortable with money
orders, the group says, and since money orders are prepaid, there
is no risk of bouncing checks. The organization will also issue
identification cards, using food stamp cards, apartment leases,
utility bills and other documents for verification.
</P>
<P>
   Other advocates have their own ideas about how to improve
low-cost checking, including making disclosure mandatory when bank
employees discuss account options with customers. But with the
powerful American Bankers Association and Republicans in Congress
opposed to national low-cost banking laws, the Treasury Department
may wind up playing the biggest role.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a conversion from paper checks to electronically
transferred benefit payments _ expected to save $100 million
annually _ Treasury officials hope that by summer banks will offer
new limited accounts for millions. Donald Hammond, the Treasury
Department's fiscal Assistant Secretary, said the department is
``very committed to using this transition to try to bring people
into the banking mainstream.''

NASD BOARD EASES PROCEDURE TO HALT STOCK TRADING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the ``anything.com'' stocks continue to gyrate on the NASDAQ
stock market, the market's governing board in Washington approved a
rule Thursday that would allow officials to halt trading in a
company's stock in response to market news or rumors, even if they
cannot immediately reach the company's executives.
</P>
<P>
   The rule change and other steps designed to rein in excesses
among day traders and cut the fees that individuals pay for
real-time stock quotations, were endorsed by the board of the
National Association of Securities Dealers, which operates both the
NASDAQ market and the American Stock Exchange. The Securities and
Exchange Commission must still approve the proposed rules, which
would apply only to NASDAQ.
</P>
<P>
   The action on trading halts, while significant for investors who
might be blindsided by rumor-driven trading, did not go nearly as
far as most NASDAQ market makers had hoped. Indeed, a far more
sweeping proposal was withdrawn without a vote, an NASD spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   That proposal, which had the support of NASD chairman Frank
Zarb, would have allowed NASDAQ to halt trading at times of extreme
volatility in individual stocks _ a step that had been strongly
resisted by institutional investors who fear that it would allow
NASDAQ market makers, the professional trading firms that buy from
sellers and sell to buyers to insure a liquid market, to pull back
from trading just when they were most needed to maintain orderly
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to continue to look at ways to address the issue
of volatility,'' said NASD chief administrative officer Michael
Jones. ``Trading halts alone are not the way, in and of themselves,
to deal with the issue, but volatility is something we're going to
continue to be aggressively looking at.''
</P>
<P>
   The NASD board also voted to seek comment from its members and
the public on a proposal that would affect day traders, investors
who seek to profit from the daily movements in stock prices. The
proposal, which if approved would affect the AMEX as well as
NASDAQ, would require brokers to clearly advise customers about the
risks of day trading and the dangers of trading with money that is
borrowed or is essential to the investor's economic security.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the disclosure statement proposed by the board
warns customers against trading with money that represents
``retirement savings, student loans, second mortgages, emergency
funds, funds set aside for purposes such as education or home
ownership, or funds required for current income.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would also require brokers to consider an
investor's financial circumstances and investment experience and
``make a threshold determination'' that day trading is an
appropriate strategy for that investor before opening an account.
</P>
<P>
   The board also approved a one-year pilot program that would
respond to the demands of online brokers by cutting the price that
NASDAQ charges investors for real-time stock quotations.
Individuals now pay either a penny for each quote or a flat monthly
fee of $4; the pilot project would cut both fees in half. Market
data supplied by the New York Stock Exchange and the nation's other
stock exchanges are more expensive and would not be affected by the
NASD's steps Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On the more technical front, the board adopted rules, subject to
SEC approval, designed to clear some of the trading bottlenecks
that have arisen in the feverish realm of Internet stocks. Those
bottlenecks occur when market makers are posting ``buy'' prices
that are slightly higher than the ``sell'' prices, a reversal of
the normal price relationships on NASDAQ. Such reversals
temporarily block trading in the affected stocks.

 &HT;    Telling the story of pain can be healing in Kosovo crisis, Tutu
says
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Archbishop Desmond Tutu came to Capitol Hill on
Thursday to deliver a five-volume report on the atrocities and
crimes committed in South Africa under white rule.
</P>
<P>
   But Tutu, now a visiting professor of theology at Emory
University, used the opportunity to discuss the crisis in Kosovo
and to tell an audience of more than 70 congressmen how to heal
wounds created by ethnic and racial divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Tutu said that Serbian nationalists seeking to ``cleanse''
Kosovo of its ethnic majority Albanian population should learn from
the struggle in South Africa, where a white minority ruled over a
black majority until 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``God has not made a mistake in putting them together,'' said
Tutu, referring to Serbian nationalists and ethnic Albanians. ``God
hopes they will be able to learn they can live together. We are
going to have to learn to live together.''
</P>
<P>
   Tutu spoke at a forum sponsored by public policy group John
Quincy Adams Society and the Faith &AMP; Politics Institute, a
nondenominational organization co-chaired by Rep. John Lewis
(D-Ga.) and Rep. Amo Houghton (R-N.Y.). Over the last year, Faith &AMP;
Politics has worked on opening a dialogue about race relations in
America.
</P>
<P>
   Tutu urged Congress to encourage victims of racial prejudice in
America to tell their stories just as victims in South Africa told
their stories of persecution to the South African Truth and
Reconciliation Commission, which he headed.
</P>
<P>
   Tutu told the story of a young black woman in South Africa whose
father had been butchered by whites. Police kept the man's hand in
a jar as a warning to other blacks seeking equality under white
rule.
</P>
<P>
   After she told her story to the commission, Tutu asked her if
she could forgive the perpetrators who took her father from her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said she would like to forgive, she just wanted to know
who to forgive,'' Tutu said. ``We can all learn so much by
forgiving.''
</P>
<P>
   A white woman told the commission about how a hand grenade set
off by a revolutionary group had badly maimed and disfigured her.
Tutu said the woman wanted to meet the person responsible for the
grenade attack so she could forgive him and so that he could
forgive her.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is pain sitting in the pit of tummies of
African-Americans and Native Americans, stories that have not been
told,'' Tutu said. ``You will never in this country have racial
peace until you give people a chance ... to tell their pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, a leader in the civil rights movement, said he found
Tutu's speech deeply moving. One of the ``most beautiful things''
during the civil rights movement was the way it brought people of
all races together for a united cause. Tutu's speech was a reminder
of what is possible when stories of persecution are aired, Lewis
said.

   Within hours of secretly transmitting fluorescent green
``nightscope'' camera images of the first NATO air strikes on
Kosovo on Wednesday night, CNN correspondent Brent Sadler and his
three crew members heard their hotel room door being broken down at
3 a.m. In came a man brandishing a rifle and a flashlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was curtains,'' Sadler said Thursday by telephone
from Skopje, Macedonia, where he and about 50 other Western
journalists fled after the Serbian government ordered all members
of the press from NATO countries to leave.
</P>
<P>
   That intruder and another an hour later merely ripped out wires
and rummaged through files. But the next morning, as Sadler and his
crew began to load their armored car to leave, a gang of six or
seven armed men accosted them, slapping a CNN producer, Alessio
Vinci, across the face and poking a Kalashnikov rifle under
Sadler's nose. The assailants then began smashing the crew's
equipment and set it and the car on fire as crowds of Serbian
passersby cheered, and frightened fellow journalists watched from
the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler said police officers and Yugoslav army soldiers restored
order and escorted a caravan of about 15 armored cars carrying
Western journalists from Pristina to the Macedonian border.
</P>
<P>
   While the atmosphere in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo
province, was reportedly more tense than elsewhere in the country,
other journalists also faced harassment. In Belgrade, two
Americans, Mark Phillips of CBS News and Peter Finn of the
Washington Post, were taken from their rooms at the Hyatt Hotel in
the middle of the night, held at a police station for 11 hours,
then driven to the Croatian border and released.
</P>
<P>
   An expulsion order issued by Serbian Information Minister
Alexander Vucic said: ``Journalists of foreign public media from
the countries that took part or allowed their territories to be
used in NATO aggression on our country will be expelled.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were reports of conflicts within the Yugoslav
government about whether to enforce the order, with some officials
arguing that showing the impact of the air strikes would create
sympathy for the nation.
</P>
<P>
   While most journalists left Yugoslavia on Thursday, NBC News
said that its two correspondents, Jim Maceda and Ron Allen, and
their crews had decided to stay in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips of CBS News had no choice. By telephone from Zagreb on
Thursday, he said he had heard a knock on his door around 3:30 a.m.
and had peered through the peephole to see a hotel clerk, who said,
in English, ``Room service.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said `I didn't order room service,' and a gruff voice next
to the clerk said, `State security police _ open up,' '' Phillips
said. Told to pack, he asked where he was going and was told, ``No
questions; this is war.''
</P>
<P>
   In the hotel lobby, while the officers went upstairs to get
Finn, Phillips said he managed to get a message to his producer in
another room, before being taken to a local police station. There,
Phillips said, he and Finn were questioned separately.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked what I had written, whom I had spoken to, and they
asked who we were working with in terms of local people,
translators and such, which was very worrying,'' Phillips said. ``I
danced a very awkward line, saying I only knew the guy's first
name, he'd been hired by someone else in our group _ giving them
enough to keep them from getting angrier, but at the same time not
incriminating anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, the three ``inquisitors'' got ``angrier and
angrier,'' and one said to Phillips: ``Why is it that someone like
me who loves American rock music and wears jeans and Nikes feels so
furious at the U.S. for this barbarous and uncivilized act?''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, air raid sirens sounded, Phillips said, and he
thought, ``I'm toast.'' But after about 11 hours at the police
station, he said, they were put into a Serbian militia vehicle with
barred windows and driven to the border.
</P>
<P>
   Because Phillips' producer had gotten word to London about his
detainment, a CBS News employee was dispatched from Zagreb to the
border crossing, and met the three journalists there about 20
minutes after they were released, he said.

BRAZILIAN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS START BORROWING AGAIN  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SIMON ROMERO    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Testing an international aversion to
Brazilian debtors after the mid-January devaluation of the nation's
currency, a handful of Brazilian companies have resumed borrowing
in dollars on global debt markets.
</P>
<P>
   The trickle of new debt issues is being led by financial
institutions like Banco Bradesco SA, one of Brazil's largest, which
is selling $100 million to $200 million of notes that mature in one
year. The issue had been suspended since the currency, the real,
was devalued at the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian unit of Citibank is selling $75 million to $100
million worth of six-month commercial paper. About half a dozen
other banks are considering similar issues in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The renewed appetite for Brazilian debt reflects a less critical
view of this country's markets in recent days. Consumer price
increases have shown signs of slowing, and fears of a Russia-style
moratorium on domestic debt have subsided.
</P>
<P>
   The currency has strengthened here to 1.80 to the dollar, its
strongest since Feb. 4. Stocks have rallied, with the benchmark
Bovespa index surging 26 percent in the last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like we could wait no longer to pursue the sale,''
said Jose Guilherme Lembi de Faria, executive international
director at Bradesco. The bank, which plans to use the proceeds for
lending to agricultural clients, agreed to pay 11.5 percent to
11.75 percent interest on the notes _ roughly a percentage point
more than it would have before the devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Lembi de Faria pointed out that is still much cheaper than
borrowing in domestic markets, where interest rates are hovering
above 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in a symbolic gesture that shows that officials recognize
the improved sentiment toward Brazil's markets, the central bank
shaved three percentage points off its overnight lending rate on
Wednesday, to 42 percent, the first such reduction in five months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I confess our maneuvering room is limited and we can't joke
around,'' said Arminio Fraga, the central bank president, on a
popular Brazilian talk show, ``Jo Soares Onze e Meia,'' and adding,
``But today, I am optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   The reduction was seen by some investors as the beginning of a
downward trend in interest rates, which could allow a recession
economy to resume growth later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that are eager to follow banks into foreign borrowing
markets are now awaiting further moves from Fraga and from the
Finance Ministry. So far, only one nonfinancial company, Vale do
Rio Doce, a large mining conglomerate, has succeeded in selling
dollar-denominated debt: a $50 million placement earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is made more pressing with $2.2 billion of foreign
currency-denominated debt issued by Brazilian companies coming due
through the end of April, according to figures from Anbid, an
association of investment banks.
</P>
<P>
   If some of this debt is not refinanced in the form of new bonds
or notes, the currency could come under renewed pressure and its
movement upward could be reversed.
</P>
<P>
   As Brazil makes slow progress in gaining financial credibility,
other Latin American nations have taken advantage of improved
sentiment toward developing countries and have issued bonds with
relative ease.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico Thursday sold $1 billion of six-year bonds on
international markets, and on Wednesday Argentina sold about $270
million of nine-year bonds. Argentina, whose currency, the peso, is
kept in parity with the dollar, has shown greater resilience to the
wide changes in capital flows that have shaken Brazil. So far this
year, Argentina has raised roughly $2.8 billion in bond sales, more
than any other Latin American country.

 &HT;    A fish in hot water
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The most popular item on the menu at Fishbone _
Buckhead's vast, new seafood emporium _ is Patagonian toothfish.
</P>
<P>
   Over at the Atlanta Fish Market, chef Chris McDonald says his
customers can't get enough Patagonian toothfish. ``People like the
texture of it. We do it steamed, grilled, any way they want it. We
serve it Hong Kong style with sherry soy broth.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one ever uses this name in America, even though it
is the only market name recognized by the Food and Drug
Administration. Here, unlike the rest of the world, we have a
user-friendly name: Chilean sea bass.
</P>
<P>
   The fish of the moment is sweet, buttery, snowy white and
difficult to overcook. With its high oil content, it feels
luxurious in the mouth. With its lack of pinbones and large flakes,
it feels safe.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder we are in love with this succulent, mysterious fish
that 20 years ago thrived undiscovered in deep Antarctic waters.
</P>
<P>
   And no surprise that it is quickly becoming so overfished that
observers predict the species, obtained from fisheries throughout
the Antarctic region, may become commercially extinct in as few as
three years.
</P>
<P>
   Just as surely as Paul Prudhomme's blackening pan decimated the
Gulf redfish population, this fish is a victim of its own
popularity. And we don't have a steady supply of Chilean sea bass
swimming around in breeding tanks like farm-raised catfish or
salmon.
</P>
<P>
   In January, ministers from 24 member nations of the Antarctic
Treaty met at Scott Base in Antarctica and pledged to combat the
rampant piracy and illegal overfishing of Chilean sea bass, called
``white gold'' in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going the way of the pompano, the way of the swordfish,''
says Jean-Sebastien Gros, president of Chilean Seafood Exchange, a
Florida-based importer. ``This is a worldwide diminishing
resource.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel Knox, president of Atlanta's Inland Seafood Co., claims,
``I have seen the fish, in the eight years we've been selling it,
go down from 20 to 30 pounds on the average to 10 to 12 pounds,
which leads me to believe we are overfishing the resource.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, prices have climbed nearly 50 percent, while
the catch is down by half. But demand is at an all-time high. At
Inland Seafood, a 4,800-pound shipment disappears in a matter of
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Chilean sea bass first appeared in Los Angeles in 1982,
according to importer Doug Harbison. One of his suppliers brought a
frozen fillet of a specimen caught in deep waters off Chile. ``The
Chileans didn't even know it was there,'' claims Harbison, who
looked through every up-to-date South American fish encyclopedia at
the time and found no mention of it.
</P>
<P>
   By 1984, the small amount of fresh sea bass coming into Los
Angeles began showing up as a specialty item at high-end
restaurants. Michel Richard had it on the menu from day one at
Citrus, the soon-to-be sensation he opened there in 1986. ``It was
very new, but people loved it right away. They loved the texture.''
Richard, now making waves at Citronelle in Washington, says, ``We
still sell it like crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it was the overfishing of another deep-water
species, the North Pacific black cod, that pushed Chilean sea bass
onto the world stage. The Japanese, who had been major importers,
found that Chilean sea bass had the same high fat content as black
cod (about 16 percent, mostly those beneficial omega-3 unsaturated
fats) and could be used interchangeably.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, when Chilean sea bass began emerging as a moderately
priced seafood alternative on restaurant menus throughout the
United States and was already a favorite in Japan, catch limits
were first set on the fishery near South Georgia island in the
South Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Fishers, looking elsewhere, discovered sea bass fisheries
throughout the far Southern Hemisphere. ``If you turn the globe
upside-down and draw a line around Antartica, that's where you find
Chilean sea bass,'' says Doug Harbison. South Africa, Australia,
New Zealand, France (with its islands in the South Indian Ocean)
and Argentina got into the toothfish business, and a world market
was established in Port Louis, Mauritius _ a sovereign
island-nation in the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Port Louis emerged as a market not only for legitimate
longliners, but also for poachers. ``The problem,'' says
Jean-Sebastien Gros, ``is this stuff is as liquid as bonds.''
</P>
<P>
   David Bengis of Icebrand Seafood in Maine, who imports sea bass
from South African fisheries, concurs. ``It's impossible to track
the fish that has been pirated and where it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1996-1997 season, the harvest of Chilean sea bass
peaked and it had become a familiar staple in supermarket fish
counters and moderately-priced restaurants throughout America.
Prices slumped slightly. Nonetheless, the New Zealand Ministry of
Foreign Affairs estimates that more than $300 million of it was
illegally obtained. The Washington, D.C.-based Antartica Project
estimates the tonnage of illegal sea bass that season at 100,000,
or 10 times the legal catch.
</P>
<P>
   But executive director Beth Clark says that poaching is only
half the problem. ``Even the limits they're setting are beyond that
which is sustainable. They don't even start to reproduce until
they're 10 years old. It's like what happened to orange roughy 5
years ago. Now there are hardly any in the seas, and it's not
commercially viable.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1997-1998 season, says Clark, established sea bass
fisheries began to ``crash.'' The illegal catch, according to her
estimates, decreased to 40,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
   Albatross are also threatened by Chilean sea bass fishing.
Attracted by the bait, these endangered birds are often hooked or
entangled and drowned. The Antartica Project estimates that over
200,000 birds, from more than 20 species of albatross and petrals,
have been killed by fishing boats.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, with resources plummeting around its sub-Antartic
Prince Edward and Marion Islands, South Africa began patrolling its
fisheries with naval vessels and restricting licenses to boats with
South African registry.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1999, Greenpeace estimated the worldwide illegal
trade in Chilean sea bass to exceed $500 million, or more than 90
percent of the total trade.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a chase between a Greenpeace vessel and a sea bass
poacher ended after 16 days and 2,700 nautical miles-chase across
the Southern Ocean to Mauritius, discovering 170 metric tons of
Chilean sea bass, worth more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Prices are now at a 9-year high, but demand shows no sign of
abating. Says Jean-Sebastein Gros, ``Except for high-grade tuna and
black cod, there's not another fish that has a higher value in the
world market today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' says Gros, ``I see it becoming more and more of a
scarce resource enjoyed only by those who can afford top dollar.

LEGISLATORS LIKELY TO PASS SALES-TAX PROPOSAL, TEXAS LAWMAKER SAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With Texas' economy thriving, lawmakers are
likely to approve temporary sales-tax exemptions for school
supplies and back-to-school clothing and permanent exemptions for
diapers and over-the-counter medicines, a ranking House member said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Small businesses also will benefit from the state's rosy revenue
picture, though a proposal to end taxation of Internet services may
be doomed, said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rene
Oliveira, D-Brownsville. A tax credit for research and development
is also proving elusive, he said.
</P>
<P>
   His committee, which is awarding at least $500 million in tax
breaks, is mulling 259 proposals, many of which would lower tax
rates and authorize tax credits or exemptions. Lawmakers are
deciding which cuts to submit to the full House in mid-April, and
consensus is building to make sales-tax and small-business
franchise tax relief the top priorities, Oliveira said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be bound by $500 million We still have to
hear some testimony on some of these bills, but I think it will be
significantly more,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough balancing act because we want to pass tax cuts
that help the poor and middle class and working men and women. At
the same time, we want to try to have some economic development
incentives,'' Oliveira said.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate-approved bill that Oliveira is sponsoring, Senate Bill
5, would reward companies that conduct research and development and
allow job-creation tax credits for high unemployment areas. But
Oliveira said other tax breaks with wider appeal could take
precedence, especially since long-term tax breaks could prove
problematic if the economy deteriorates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The R&AMP;D tax credit is really a challenge,'' Oliveira said,
adding that experts don't agree on its effectiveness in luring
companies to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet sales-tax exemption is deemed too costly, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's $20 million I think we could use elsewhere. I'm not going
to say it's dead, but I will say it doesn't have the priority with
me that the sales tax cuts do _ or the cuts for small business
do,'' the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
   Also taking a back seat to sales-tax breaks is the $2 billion
property-tax relief sought by Gov. George W. Bush, Oliveira
indicated, although some of the $3 billion proposed for new
school-related spending could be construed as relief for property
owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor continues to aggressively seek property-tax
relief,'' Oliveira said, but ``our choice may be between funding
for education, accountability and teacher pay raises ... versus his
$2 billion in property tax relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has acknowledged his objective is challenging. Oliveira
said ``to his credit, he's trying to find ways to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush encouraged a GOP House member to submit a bill March 12
that would make an extra $400 million available to budget-writers
by shifting surpluses from the Texas Workers' Compensation Fund to
the state's general revenue fund. But that scenario was described
as unnecessary and unlikely by senior House members.
</P>
<P>
   ``My initial reaction is we have sufficient funds ... and if
that money has come from employers for purchasing workers' comp
insurance, we either need to reduce the rates or rebate that money
back to the employers,'' said Appropriations Committee Chairman Rob
Junell, D-San Angelo.
</P>
<P>
   Junell said the House's 2000-01 spending plan, which tops $94
billion, is nearly complete. He said it's more like a nice pickup
truck than a Mercedes-Benz.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes beyond meeting the basic needs of Texans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His committee will make final adjustments next week before
sending the hefty document to the House floor for a mid-April vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to approve a more conservative budget,
forcing creation of a House-Senate negotiating committee that could
get a higher, new revenue estimate from Comptroller Carole Keeton
Rylander about May 1. With state government required by the Texas
Constitution to pay as you go, some of the low-priority tax-relief
proposals could get new life in May if Rylander finds more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have to make adjustments in the conference committee
process, we'll do that, or we'll wait for the golden goose to lay
the golden egg and see what comes out of the Comptroller's
Office,'' Oliveira said.

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ After a night of heavy explosions and
fires, this city was strangely calm early Thursday. Serbs seemed at
ease, if angry at the NATO bombing; Albanians were anxious, even
terrified of what was to come.
</P>
<P>
   Black smoke rose from buildings burning on the southwestern edge
of the city, one of the main casualties of the night. Another plume
of smoke rose from the ridge on the eastern edge of Pristina, the
Kosovo capital.
</P>
<P>
   Though Serbs said that much of the damage and fires around the
city had been caused by NATO missiles, it was the ethnic Albanians
who bore the brunt of the violence Wednesday, as Serbian forces
apparently used the NATO attacks as a pretext to go out overnight
and wreak still more havoc.
</P>
<P>
   By about 2:30 Thursday afternoon the order came that foreign
journalists belonging to all NATO countries should leave Serbia,
and about 20 men, recognized by journalists as the kind of
hard-core paramilitary Serb forces who became notorious in Bosnia
for the atrocities of ``ethnic cleansing,'' began to harass
journalists and force them leave, smashing equipment and setting
fire to an armored vehicle used by CNN.
</P>
<P>
   As the journalists departed, and with the NATO bombing already
begun, a deepening sense of fear took hold in Pristina that the
Serbs would now vent their their rage against ethnic Albanian
civilians in retaliation, a threat the Serbs themselves had issued
often in the past.
</P>
<P>
   If the first night of the bombing was any measure, they may be
good their word.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, in one of two barracks within the city untouched by
the NATO strikes, near the Serb settlement of Kosovo Polje,
soldiers lounged in the sun on the top of a tank, looking out over
the fence on to the main road.
</P>
<P>
   Barely 50 yards from them, on the other side of an intersection,
the door had been forced open to the small plant of the ethnic
Albanian newspaper, Kosova Sot, which was closed down by the
Serbian authorities eight days ago after a court decision found the
paper guilty of ``running an editorial policy that was against the
Serbian regime.''
</P>
<P>
   The roof of the building was partially smashed and burned, the
debris lying among the big printing presses. Outside in the
courtyard stacks of newspapers on pallets were still burning. Bent
and broken metal printing plates lay on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby a long, low building that had housed private businesses _
a car repair shop and a plastics production laboratory _ smoldered.
Its whitewashed brick walls and a blue sign that read ``Autoservis
Dinor'' were still standing, but its roof had collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   NATO missiles, aiming at the barracks, had missed and instead
hit the car repair shop, said Radovan Urosevac, a Serb, though the
targets of the NATO bombing lay beyond Pristina, at the airport to
the south and barracks outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were targeting the airport, and they missed it,'' said
Urosevac, a director of the Serbian Media Center in Pristina, which
is closely connected to the Serbian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They targeted the army base in Kosovo Polje and the hit the
Peugot car repair place,'' he added. ``I believe they were aiming
at a power plant and hit a surface coal pit, 15 kilometers from
Pristina.''
</P>
<P>
   While it was hard to tell what had caused the fire, it had begun
about midnight, not with an explosion but from a small pinpoint
glow, that could be seen growing rapidly into a major
conflagration. At the site, there was no crater from a missile
visible and no pieces of missile casing.

 PRISTINA: missile casing. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those were not the only fires. In Kosovo Polje, a predominantly
Serb area, two Albanian cafes had been burned down, and half a
dozen shops bore broken windows, bullet holes clearly showing in
some of them. Armed Serb civilians stood around in the street,
watching the cars and passersby.
</P>
<P>
   In downtown Pristina, glass and debris from two powerful
explosions were spread across the main street. The Guri bar and
pizzeria, and a private medical clinic, both run by ethnic
Albanians, were blown apart by bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Glass, metal blinds, and plaster had flown 10 yards across the
street from the force of the blasts. They were not the first
attacks on ethnic Albanian enterprises in the city but certainly
the most devastating materially. There were no reported casualties
since the explosions happened late at night and the buildings were
empty.
</P>
<P>
   While it is impossible to say who the culprits were, there were
numerous cars and military jeeps driving through the blacked-out
city late into the night. They crossed close to the barracks on the
south edge of the city and passed back and forth by the Defense
Ministry building on the main street.
</P>
<P>
   With the large police and army presence checking the roads and
main intersections, the complete freedom of movement enjoyed by the
bombers, would suggest they had connections with the security
forces.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian prime minister of Kosovo, Zoran Andjelkovic, invited
foreign journalists to have breakfast with him at the central
government building in Pristina, and warned that ``those staying
here they must behave in accordance with the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   After waiters dispensed fizzy drinks, Andjelkovic arrived to
make a brief statement. ``As far as NATO thinks it can establish
peace and order with rockets, the rockets will continue,'' he said.
``Those wishing to support peace in Kosovo, I wish you luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Within two hours the authorities served a notice on all foreign
journalists from NATO countries to leave Serbia. At the same time,
some 20 armed men, in heavy boots and civilian clothes, with
buzzcuts and carrying automatic weapons mounted with silencers,
invaded the lobby of the Grand Hotel in central Pristina where most
of the foreigners were based.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the group, some lean and wiry with lined faces
and the hard stares of men familiar with brutality, had been
largely responsible for harassment of foreign journalists the
previous night as the airstrikes began.
</P>
<P>
   Openly looking for trouble, they started smashing television
gear of camera crews and set fire to a television crew's armored
vehicle. Andjelkovic arrived just in time to steady the spiraling
panic, and arranged for the remaining journalists to be escorted
out. They confiscated several cars and mobile phones as well.
</P>
<P>
   Before Thursday, there were reports that two deputies to the
notorious Serbian paramilitary leader, Zeljko Raznjatovic, known as
Arkan, had entered Pristina. It was Arkan's men who took part in
some of the worst massacres of the conflict in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians here were visibly upset at the departure of the
journalists, fearing that Serb forces and paramilitary units would
then have a free hand to carry out atrocities unobserved by
Westerners.
</P>
<P>
   The journalists left in about a dozen cars for the hour-long
ride to border. Along the way, Serb army columns passed coming from
the other direction, including troop trucks and armored vehicles
with mounted machine guns, apparently moving men and equipment into
Pristina, where they would presumably avoid NATO airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   After journalists had been forced out of the city, Pristina was
reported to be quiet Thursday evening, although there were reports
that the police and armed paramilitaries had begun house-to-house
searches. Residents were bracing not only for the next wave of
bombing, but for the chaos and bloodletting that Serbian police and
civilians alike have been promising.
</P>
<P>
   As journalists departed and passed through southern Kosovo, the
border towns of Kacanik and General Jankovic, were deserted. Two
houses were on fire close to the border, but otherwise the place
was eerily quiet.

THOUGH WARY, GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO DISCUSS MICROSOFT SETTLEMENT
PROPOSAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ State and federal officials were dismissive
Thursday of Microsoft's proposal to settle its antitrust suit, but
they added that the two sides would meet for settlement talks,
probably beginning Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson admonished the
litigants to try to settle the case during the trial recess that
began Feb. 26. As a result, officials said, even though the Justice
Department and the state attorneys general who filed the suit
question whether the settlement proposal they received Wednesday is
serious, they feel compelled to show a good-faith effort.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as one senior government official put it, ``the chances
are pretty good that all we're doing is a kabuki dance for the
judge.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the two sides tried to settle the case, days
before the suit was filed last May, the talks broke down after a
day and a half. Justice Department officials called those talks off
after concluding, they said, that Microsoft's negotiators had not
been straight with them.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a three-and-one-quarter page, double-spaced document,
Microsoft is offering to show flexibility in two broad areas raised
in the lawsuit: the company's restrictive contracts with Internet
companies, and the limits computer makers face in their ability to
customize the opening screen of the Windows operating system. Under
pressure from the government, Microsoft has informally loosened its
practices in these areas, and its settlement proposal offers to
make those changes formal.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's not a lot more than that,'' said a senior official
involved with the government's case. ``It doesn't offer a lot of
specifics in the areas we think are important.''
</P>
<P>
   The 19 state attorneys general who are partners in the suit with
the federal government discussed Microsoft's proposal Thursday at a
previously scheduled meeting in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As she left the meeting, New Mexico Attorney General Patricia
Madrid said the talks would begin Tuesday. Neither Justice
Department nor Microsoft officials would confirm that or otherwise
comment on the settlement proposal in any substantive way.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said: ``Our
policy at this point is to keep discussions totally confidential.
That's the only way serious settlement negotiations can take
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's chairman Bill Gates, speaking at Georgetown
University on Thursday morning as part of a publicity tour for his
new book, made not even an oblique mention of the antitrust case,
and none of the students who asked him questions at the end of his
presentation brought it up.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Murray, a Microsoft spokesman, said: ``We have made a
serious and substantive proposal that addresses the areas of
concern identified by the government.''
</P>
<P>
   State and federal officials say they believe no settlement will
be effective unless it restructures the company in some way. The
state Attorneys General favor forcing Microsoft to license the
source code for Windows to other companies _ instantly creating
competition in the operating system market.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has not decided which sort of remedy it
favors. Options include the forced licensing idea and breaking up
the company, among other ideas. But one government official said
the Microsoft proposal ``doesn't discuss source code or anything
structural.''
</P>
<P>
   As they consider Microsoft's proposal, officials from the
federal government and the states say that ``conduct remedies'' of
the sort Microsoft is proposing have not worked in the past. With a
conduct remedy, Microsoft would remain intact, but the company's
ability to engage in specific illegal conduct would be limited
through contract restrictions or other means.

CAL RIPKEN SR., 63, BASEBALL VETERAN WHO MANAGED HIS SONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)   (bl)  
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cal Ripken Sr., a gruff, single-minded baseball person and the
only one to manage two sons on the same major league team, died
Thursday at Johns Hopkins Oncology Center in Baltimore. He was 63.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken, who lived in Aberdeen, Md., had been treated for lung
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   With the Baltimore Orioles in 1987, Ripken managed his sons Cal
Jr., a shortstop, and Billy, a second baseman. When the manager
took Cal Jr. out of the lineup late in a game that season, it ended
the son's streak of 8,243 consecutive innings played over five and
a half years, believed to be a major league record. In 1995, Cal
Jr. broke perhaps the most cherished record in baseball, Lou
Gehrig's streak of 2,130 consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken Sr. was wiry, blunt, quick-tempered and given to
salty language. He chain-smoked nonfilter cigarettes and had a
voice that, one observer wrote, ``sounded like the bucket of a
backhoe scraping a boulder.''
</P>
<P>
   He spent 36 years in the Baltimore Orioles' organization _ as a
minor league catcher, a minor league manager, a major league coach,
a scout and a major league manager.
</P>
<P>
   John Steadman, a sports columnist for The Sun in Baltimore,
called Ripken ``the toughest of old Orioles'' and added:
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a throwback to another era who sacrificed personal
opportunities to labor in the vineyards and do more for the Orioles
than they could ever do for him. He brought discipline, a
no-nonsense instructional ethic and a working wisdom that prepared
players for the demanding major league examinations that awaited.
He asked no plaudits; he derived satisfaction from the results of
his coaching and personal example.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Orioles finished last in the American League East
under Earl Weaver in 1986, they promoted Ripken, their third-base
coach, to manager. His 1987 team finished with a 67-95 record, and
when it lost its first six games in 1988, he was dismissed in favor
of Frank Robinson. That team went on to lose its first 21 games, a
major league record for the start of a season.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Jr. understood his father's strengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's at his best when he's in charge,'' the son said. ``Some
men were made to follow and some to lead. My dad's a leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Remembering an incident when he was 16, Cal Jr. viewed his
father as an inspiration for his consecutive-game streak, which he
ended last season at 2,632 games.
</P>
<P>
   The father had been hit on the head with a crank that flew off a
tractor hooked up to a snowplow, but he resumed plowing rather than
head for a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get the feeling that things are a little low, that I
need a little motivation to work on my hitting, I visualize the
tractor-crank story,'' Cal Jr. once said. ```That pushes me.''
</P>
<P>
   While he was managing Cal Jr. and Billy, Cal Sr. said: ``We just
happen to be in the same business at the same place. Maybe years
from now, I'll smile about all this. But for now they're just a
second baseman and a shortstop on this ball club.''
</P>
<P>
   The father returned to uniform in 1989 as the Orioles'
third-base coach, only to be dropped after the 1992 season. He was
unhappy about losing his jobs as manager and then coach, and during
a training-camp visit in 1996, when someone asked whether he wanted
to come back, he replied acidly, ``I didn't have any desire to
leave in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Edwin Ripken Sr. was born and raised in Aberdeen. In
1957, he signed a minor league contract with the Orioles and
started playing for $150 a month for Phoenix in the Class C
Arizona-Mexican League. He endured bush-league hardships, playing
in Cananea, Mexico, in a grassless bullring in 120-degree
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   After a shoulder injury ended his catching career, he managed
Oriole teams in outposts in Leesburg, Fla.; Appleton, Wis.;
Aberdeen, S.D.; Kennewick-Richland-Pasco, Wash.; Miami; Elmira,
N.Y.; Rochester; Dallas and Asheville, N.C. His players included
Jim Palmer, Eddie Murray, Mark Belanger and Lou Piniella.
</P>
<P>
   After Ripken left the Oriole organization for good, he played
golf, threw horseshoes in a tournament-caliber pit in his backyard
and tended to his tomato plants. For one week every summer, he ran
the Cal Ripken Baseball School in Emmitsburg, Md.
</P>
<P>
   His survivors include his wife, Violet; three sons, Cal Jr. of
Reisterstown, Md.; Fred of Havre de Grace, Md., and Billy of
Fallston, Md.; a daughter, Ellen Heathcott of Bel Air, Md., and six
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   In his final years, Ripken said he missed baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are two things I always say you have to do in
baseball,'' he said, ``and that's adjust and readjust. You have to
do the same thing in life. You have to accept things for what they
are.''

SEX WITH SUBORDINATE COSTS ISRAEL ARMY GENERAL A PROMOTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Israeli Supreme Court ruled Thursday that an
army general disciplined for having sex with a female subordinate
three years ago could not be promoted.
</P>
<P>
   The decision barred the officer, Brig. Gen. Nir Galili, 43, from
becoming a major general and corps commander in the Israeli ground
forces, overruling the defense minister and army chief of staff,
who had approved the promotion.
</P>
<P>
   No replacement was immediately named, although Israel Radio
reported that one possible candidate was Brig. Gen. Effi Fein, who
has risen through the ranks despite his involvement in a beating
incident during the Palestinian uprising.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Galili was the first in which the court intervened
to block a promotion in the army, and it exposed ambivalent
attitudes in the military toward the problem of sexual harassment
in its ranks.
</P>
<P>
   While the army follows an active policy of punishing sexual
harassment, the promotion of Galili suggested a more lenient
approach at the army's highest levels.
</P>
<P>
   The general's appointment had been challenged by a 23-year-old
former soldier whose name has not been made public. She petitioned
the Supreme Court against the promotion on the ground that the
general, who is married and has three children, had improperly used
his authority to have sex with her when she was in the service
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Following a disciplinary hearing after the incident, Galili was
reprimanded and his promotion was delayed for three years. The
army's advocate-general said at the time that the general had
improperly exploited his ``status, position and rank'' to engage in
conduct unbecoming an officer.
</P>
<P>
   After the three years elapsed, Galili's promotion was approved.
The army chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, told the Supreme
Court in an affidavit that although he condemned the general's
behavior and upheld a strict code of conduct in the army, he
considered Galili to be the best candidate for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the supreme duty of doing everything in my power to
insure the army's victory, should a war be imposed,'' he said.
``Therefore the finest commanders must be on the battle front.''
The promotion was supported by Defense Minister Moshe Arens.
</P>
<P>
   Galili made no public comment after Thursday's ruling. An army
spokesman issued a terse response: ``The army will honor the
decision of the Supreme Court.''
</P>
<P>
   Women's advocacy groups and several politicians from the left
and the right applauded the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``A professionally outstanding soldier who has a low moral level
is not an outstanding soldier,'' said Haia Jamshy, director of the
Israel Women's Network. ``There's something of a conspiracy of
silence about these matters in the army, so I hope this ruling will
have a deterrent effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Transport Minister Shaul Yahalom, a member of the National
Religious Party, said it was ``unfortunate that such ethical
decisions, which are so important for the morals of the army, are
imposed by the court rather than by the internal policies of the
chief of staff and defense minister.''
</P>
<P>
   Ran Cohen, a lawmaker from the leftist Meretz party, said the
court had issued a ``courageous and moral'' ruling that had ``saved
the defense minister, the chief of staff and the army from the
disgrace of their own decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman who had challenged the general in court told a radio
reporter: ``I'm just happy it's over. Now I can move on.''

   KIEVO, Yugoslavia _ Even after the air raid sirens wailed, Sara,
nearly 5, refused to go down to the basement shelter until the
``Ninja Turtles'' program was over.
</P>
<P>
   Then the night sky turned orange over this southern suburb of
Belgrade, and on a hill just a mile or so away, where a radar
antenna sits, a NATO missile or bomb exploded. Sara's father, Mile,
ran to his balcony, a little stupidly, he admits.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a big cloud of dust and a huge pressure of the
air,'' he said. ``I told Sara, `Where are our Ninja turtles to help
us now?' and then we went to the shelter.''
</P>
<P>
   Mile, his wife, Biljana, Sara and her brother, Nemanja, 6, slept
in a tiny concrete storage area in their basement. There were more
explosions to the south and near Zarkova, where there are aircraft
plants and technical compounds, and Sara was very frightened, her
mother said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She huddled in the corner, and she said, `I don't want to die,
Mommy.' We calmed her by saying it was just explosions in the stone
quarry nearby, and she said, `I was afraid they were Americans.'''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, hot and sunny, was Biljana's 32nd birthday.
``The Americans arranged these fireworks for you,'' her husband
said.
</P>
<P>
   Her face crumpled, but she stifled tears and managed a wan
smile. ``I'm the guilty one, then,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Who is guilty, really, she was asked. President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia? The ethnic Albanians? The Americans?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is plenty of guilt to go around,'' she said. ``No one
need feel left out.''
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor called up to the balcony and asked in English,
``Where are you from?'' A colleague said, truthfully, ``Austria.''
</P>
<P>
   The neighbor said bitterly, ``Well, you're still neutral, at
least so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbian anger at the West, and especially the United States, is
both media-fed and genuine. Ordinary Serbs like Mile, 37, who works
in an electrical-engineering plant, are both stupefied that the
bombs are falling and outraged that the world is treating them
``like savages,'' he said, ``just because we want to keep our
country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't try to take territory away from any other country,''
Mile said, getting angrier. ``America is intervening 100 percent on
the side of the Albanians in Kosovo. It is supporting separatism
and terrorism and trying to take away our state. Who gives them the
right to bomb anybody they want?''
</P>
<P>
   Biljana patted him on the hand, and he reverted, almost
instantaneously, to being the genial Serbian host, offering Turkish
coffee and homemade plum brandy, colored golden by the wooden cross
embedded in the bottle. ``We call this our Tomahawk,'' he said
cheerily. ``It's a precision-guided weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he darkened once more. ``We'll be in the shelter again
tonight,'' he said. ``And how many more nights? And what will be
the end? We enter the 21st century in this country with bombs
falling on us, as if we are the last and most savage place on the
earth. We used to have a good life here. Is it just Milosevic, or
is it someone else?''
</P>
<P>
   Their friend, Alexander, lives close by in Zarkova, also a
target of NATO. A missile hit near a heating plant less than a mile
from his apartment building, shaking the chandelier and the
furniture like an earthquake, he said.
</P>
<P>
   His family and his sister, who lives in the same building, went
down to the shelters. ``The whole situation in my family changed
immediately,'' he said. ``All the foreigners, the Americans and the
English, all look like enemies now. Before the bombings, my father
didn't know what to think. Now he says, `Don't talk to these
foreigners; don't work with them; their money is dirty.'''
</P>
<P>
   He shook his head. ``It's like they've bombed an opinion into
our brains, and it will only help Milosevic. I don't like him, but
this bombing unifies all the Serbs against the world.''
</P>
<P>
   It is strange, he said, and primitive when war begins. ``Now
Clinton and all the Americans are all the same in this moment: they
are criminals. It's not just because the television said so. People
are afraid. They didn't expect this to happen. They just didn't
think it could happen.''
</P>

<P>
   Thursday morning, when the air raid sirens wailed again in
Belgrade, his wife finally managed to get through to him on his
cell phone, to tell him to take shelter. ``I am empty,'' he said.
``My wife and my mother are full of sedatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Miles away, in the elegant center of old Belgrade, in an
exquisite apartment stuffed with every modern convenience, Slavko
Curuvija waits for the police to come. He is the publisher of the
independent newspaper Dnevni Telegraf and the newsmagazine
Evropljanin and has been sentenced to five months in jail after
refusing to pay enormous fines under a new media law, passed in
October.
</P>
<P>
   His appeal is pending, suspended by the declaration of war
Yugoslavia issued on Wednesday night. His wife, Branka Prpa, is a
well-known historian at the Institute for Modern Serbian History.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will go to jail for five months, and after this bombing,
who will care?'' she asked. ``The West can't help him _ that's
another effect of this bombing. Milosevic can act like a dictator
and lock us all up, and who will care for us? I agree the West
should care for the human rights of ethnic Albanians, but do they
also care for mine?''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia is a European nation a millennium old, she said.
``You can't rub it out with an eraser and pretend it's some nation
without culture, without reason, without civilization, that we are
all savages, because of a Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   The West is degrading itself by using Milosevic's own tactics of
force and diktat against him, she said. ``You cannot use evil
against evil or you become the same. I only hope Serbia can survive
this one man and the madness he's done in this moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Curuvija, said it is impossible now for any
democrat or dissident to raise up their heads in this war fever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs feel under a collective guilty verdict, and the
democratic forces are pushed into their mouse holes because of this
permanent state of emergency,'' he said. ``In this moment, you
cannot say you want to change something, or bring Serbia closer to
the West, which is bombing your country _ it makes you a traitor.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to his soft yellow sweatshirt, with a Gant logo and
its red-white-and-blue colors, on his chest. ``I'd be afraid now to
wear this outside in the street,'' he said. ``There are a lot of
crazy people right now.'' He rubbed his hands over his beard and
straightened his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this helps Milosevic,'' he said. ``Everything Western is
terrible right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Another air raid siren sounded. When it died away, Ms. Prpa, his
wife, said softly, as the sunlight hit polished wood: ``The worst
of all is to feel you have no future. What kind of future do we
have?''

COMMENTARY: WHILE WE WERE SLEEPING 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By   THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI _ Visiting Shanghai is always a useful reminder of how
frozen perceptions of China are in America today, and how far
reality has moved here. To listen to some of the talk in Congress,
one would think that nothing has changed in China since Tiananmen
Square. To talk to Chinese is to understand that a ``New Deal'' has
been forged in the past decade between the Chinese Communist Party
and the Chinese people. It is a messy, cynical, pragmatic deal, but
it is the central political reality of China today, and it explains
why America is winning here, not losing.
</P>
<P>
   While Tiananmen marked the end of the student-led democracy
movement in China, it also marked the end of the Chinese Communist
dictatorship as we knew it. While China's leaders may have feigned
indifference to the outside world, it's clear now that they
realized that they almost lost it all in 1989, and that they needed
a new bargain with their people in order to survive.
</P>
<P>
   That new deal is as follows: We the Communist Party will remove
ourselves from people's lives as never before. You can work where
you want, live where you want, wear what you want, study abroad if
you want, get from the Internet most of what you want and start a
business if you want. In return, the Party will insist on only two
things _ that you dare not challenge its authority and that you
have only one child.
</P>
<P>
   This new deal, and the flourishing of personal freedoms it
delivered, helps explain some of the internal stability of the past
decade. In 1989, many Chinese who took to the streets at Tiananmen,
or passively supported it, came from homes with a bare light bulb
swinging from the ceiling, no TV, no phone, one Mao outfit and no
prospects to improve their lives. That is not the case today.
</P>
<P>
   I participated in a seminar at Shanghai's Fudan University, and
was particularly struck by one professor who said: ``We need a
country in the world, like America, that has a dream to be perfect.
And when America is telling China that it is violating basic human
rights, we should admit that we have human rights problems. But
today's China is better than yesterday's China. We have a way to
improve. We feel our lives are better today, and we are not
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The combination of rising incomes, rising opportunities and
greater personal freedom has enabled the Communist Party to rule
not only by repression, but with the passive assent of China's
silent majority. The party has bought itself some time.
</P>
<P>
   But how much?
</P>
<P>
   That will depend in part on the government's ability to keep
incomes and opportunities rising. If it stumbles it is going to
have to share power sooner. But it will also depend on a new factor
_ the information revolution that is sweeping China. At the
university and elite levels the Internet is now pervasive, and at
the mass level there has been an entertainment revolution in the
past two years, with the spread of cheap video compact-disk
players. Virtually every Hollywood film has been pirated here and
they are now being viewed everywhere in China. As a result, the gap
between the Communist Party and the rest of China is now growing
wider and wider. The party is frozen and the country is running
away from it.
</P>
<P>
   Graham Earnshaw, who runs a booming Shanghai business designing
Web pages, has been in China for more than 20 years. He remarked to
me: ``I was recently out visiting the Hope Group, which is a major
grain company and the largest private company in China. I was
meeting with the chairman and there were two other people sitting
there. I asked him about the company's relationship with the
Communist Party. He pointed to the two guys sitting there and said,
``They are both Communist Party members, and my aim is to make them
millionaires in two years.' ''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how the political transition is going to happen
here. But I do know that everything from American contract law to
accounting standards to cultural messages is now winning here more
each day. We should keep hammering China on human rights and
international norms. The Chinese leadership needs to hear that. But
what is driving change here is the educational, commercial,
entertainment and Internet interactions between millions of Chinese
and the outside world, and that must never be aborted.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, the Communist Party tried to privatize Russian
society and it failed. In China _ if we are lucky _ the Chinese
people will privatize the Communist Party.

JURY BEGINS DELIBERATIONS ON MURDER CHARGES AGAINST KEVORKIAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. _ It has been a strikingly short murder trial,
one in which the defense called no witnesses and presented no
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   After only half a day of testimony by prosecution witnesses and
a couple of hours of closing arguments, the jury began deliberating
Thursday on charges of murder against Jack Kevorkian, who is
accused of killing Thomas Youk, a 52-year-old man who was suffering
from Lou Gehrig's disease. After five hours of deliberation the
jury adjourned until Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian, a 70-year-old pathologist who insisted on being his
own lawyer, fumbled most of his legal gambits. Judge Jessica
Cooper, of the Oakland County Circuit Court, repeatedly disallowed
his questions and arguments.
</P>
<P>
   And Thursday, she denied his request to call his only witnesses,
Youk's wife and brother, saying their testimony was not legally
relevant because it would shed light only on their feelings, not
Kevorkian's actions or intent.
</P>
<P>
   But in a theatrical closing argument, Kevorkian tried to
compensate for his legal difficulties by appealing to the jury's
emotions, launching a defense of euthanasia, and trying to convince
the jury that the law prohibiting euthanasia is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``He calls it a murder, a crime, a killing,'' said Kevorkian,
gesturing to the prosecutor, John Skrzynski. ``I call it medical
science. Tom Youk didn't come to me saying `I want to die, kill
me.' He said `Please help me.' There was medical affliction.
Medical service is exempt from certain laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian's actions in the death of Youk, of Waterford Township,
Mich., are captured on a videotape that shows him injecting Youk
with lethal chemicals. The doctor was charged with first-degree
murder after the tape became public in November, when he brought it
to the CBS news program ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper told the jury of seven women and five men that they
should consider whether Kevorkian's actions met the standards of
first degree murder, which requires premeditation, second degree
murder, which does not, or involuntary manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian, whose medical license was revoked in Michigan, is
also charged with distributing a controlled substance.
</P>
<P>
   The judge told the jury that euthanasia was not at issue and the
notion that Youk consented to his death was not a legally
acceptable defense. Their job, she said, was to follow the criminal
statutes, not to try to change the law. But in his closing,
Kevorkian, who claims to have helped more than 130 people commit
suicide, still raised those points.
</P>
<P>
   Vehemently chopping one hand into the palm of the other,
Kevorkian said the method he used to end Youk's life was designed
``to end his torture finally and definitively.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to put him to sleep and have him reawake in the
same condition he was before,'' he said. ``That wasn't the aim. The
aim was a final solution to incurable agony.''
</P>
<P>
   Youk, he said, ``didn't want to die. Nobody does. But sometimes
we're forced into situations where you've got to die, somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   Skrzynski, the prosecutor, painted a different picture, saying
that Kevorkian ``came like a medical hit man in the night with his
bag of poison.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial, he said, is ``not about assisted suicide. It's not
about the right to die. It's about Jack Kevorkian's right to
kill.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Jack Kevorkian murdered Thomas Youk. He killed
Thomas Youk and he does not have the right to kill.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kevorkian likened his cause to cases in which unfair laws were
ultimately changed, for example when women could not vote, or
drinking was illegal. He also invoked the civil rights struggle of
Rosa Parks and the Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain things that words on paper can never make a
crime,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just look at me,'' he said. ``Honestly now, honestly. Do you
see a criminal? Do you see a murderer? Do you see what's called a
killer? If you do than you must convict. And then take the harsh
judgment of history or the harsher judgment of your children and
grandchildren if they ever come to need that precious choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Skrzynski used historical images of his own, alluding to the
Nazi claims that the killing of Jews and other minorities was a
form of euthanasia.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor showed a moment in the videotape in which Youk
moaned just before he was injected, and he questioned whether Youk
had asked Kevorkian to stop at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nobody watching him doing this,'' Skrzynski said, ``He
chooses whose suffering is worth it. ... He's not accountable to
anyone. And when he asks you to give him that power, because he is
surely asking you to forget the law and give him that power, it
will be an unaccountable power.''

EXPERTS AGREE: IT'S HARD TO FIGURE OUT WHAT MILOSEVIC WILL DO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Also see: KOSOVO-NATO and KOSOVO-DAMAGE) 
 
By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic faced NATO
military pounding in Bosnia in 1995, it took slightly more than two
weeks of bombing before he had enough and a truce was reached that
laid the groundwork for the Dayton, Ohio, peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   The question this time for the United States and its military
allies is whether the stubborn but ultimately pragmatic dictator
will follow the same pattern in Kosovo as he did during the
previous Balkan conflict.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether the U.S. goal includes trying to force
Milosevic to accept the peace accord reached earlier this year with
the Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   In justifying the airstrikes to the American people, President
Clinton has cited the need to weaken Milosevic's military
capability and prevent him from continuing ethnic massacres, not
forcing him to accept the peace agreement that includes stationing
NATO ground troops in the troubled province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Thursday that the
agreement reached at Rambouillet, France, is still on the table
``and remains the best hope for a peaceful future in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts are not in agreement over whether history will repeat
itself and Milosevic will back down.
</P>
<P>
   Some who believe Milosevic will capitulate say he is behaving
perfectly in character right now, playing to nationalist
sentiments, but only as long as it does not risk his power base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic is a master of brinkmanship, ''said David Phillips,
director of the internal conflict resolution program at Columbia
University's School of International and Public Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said the dictator is conforming to a ``pattern whereby
he confronts the international community seeking maximum
concessions and backs down at the last moment. He is smart and
stubborn and will hold out as long as it is politically expedient
to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   One expert said that Milosevic has a history of exaggerating his
public support and ability to take on his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tendency on his part to overstate his power and his
influence,'' said Donald Abenheim, a visiting fellow at Stanford
University's Hoover Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Abenheim said that while Milosevic ``is certainly willing to use
terror and war, he is able to pull back when necessary.'' He added
``one would hope that what happened in 1995 is predictive of the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   After the 17-day offensive in September of 1995 Milosevic and
Bosnian Serb leaders worked out an agreement, signed that November
in Dayton, which led to NATO peace forces being placed in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars of the region say that it is misleading to look to
Bosnia for a sense of how Milosevic will act today.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that the situation in Bosnia was quite different,
with Milosevic having far less a personal and political stake in
that bordering country than in Kosovo, a part of Yugoslavia that
has deep cultural and historical significance for the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1995 bombing is no guidepost to predict his behavior,''
said Ivo H. Daalder, a visiting fellow at the Brookings
Institution. Daalder said that in Bosnia, Milosevic was more
amenable to a peace settlement but was initially thwarted by more
radical Bosnian Serb leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, he said, Milosevic had an incentive to reach a
settlement in 1995 so that economic sanctions that were weakening
public support at home would be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Daalder and others argued, the NATO bombing may have
galvanized public support for Milosevic, who is viewed as standing
up to what many Serbs view as an assault on their country and an
attempt to meddle in a local dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo has long held an emotional tug on the Serbs as the site
where their forefathers lost a bloody battle with the Ottoman
empire armies in 1389.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even more than in Bosnia, Yugoslavs feel themselves in the
right insofar as they are trying to put down a rebellion in their
own country,'' said Charles King, a professor at Georgetown
University, who added that he believed that Milosevic was in this
latest fight ``for the long term.''
</P>
<P>
   Daalder believes that Milosevic can hold out much longer this
time and will only be forced to deal with NATO if he faces
significant erosion in public support or serious challenges from
his own military.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now bombing is increasing rather than decreasing the support
for him. But the moment that changes, this guy will do whatever he
needs to do to remain in power,'' Daalder said.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, who rose to power in Yugoslav's Communist regime in
the 1980s, has long played to nationalist tendencies in his bid to
consolidate power. Observers say, however, he has increasingly
isolated himself, relying heavily on the advice of his wife, who
wields considerable clout in the government.
</P>
<P>
   He also has suppressed the independent press and fired
dissenters in his government. And his critics have accused him of
tacitly supporting the ethnic massacres in Bosnia, Croatia and
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ain't a nice guy,'' said Hoover's Abenheim.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips was harsher in his assessment, noting that both of
Milosevic's parents had committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a long history of dementia,'' he said.

Serbs seemed at ease, if angry at the NATO bombing; Albanians were
anxious, even terrified of what was to come. By Carlotta Gall.

ADVERTISING: INNOVATIVE CAMPAIGNS BY PROCTER &AMP; GAMBLE? WONDERS
NEVER CEASE. 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the hoariest of advertising devices, the
man-on-the-street interview, is being overhauled for a new
generation of consumers by one of the most traditional of
advertisers, Procter &AMP; Gamble Co.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of campaigns, P&AMP;G, the household products giant, has
been reinventing the tried-and-true tactic of sending out a
pitchman and a camera crew to capture actual consumers reacting
spontaneously to product demonstrations. The ads _ for detergents,
shampoos and antiperspirants _ update the device in a fresh and
frisky way, adding a contemporary appearance and a tone infused
with tongue-in-cheek humor.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, about the only tongue to be found in cheek in Procter
campaigns would have been as part of an oral-hygiene display to
prove the efficacy of a new mouthwash or toothpaste. That's because
the company has long prided itself on selling not the sizzle but
the steak, in the form of straightforward ads that asserted claims
of superior performance (``whiter whites'') by playing up product
benefits like technological improvements and so-called secret
ingredients (chlorinol and GL-70, to name but two).
</P>
<P>
   But decades of bombardment by such prosaic campaigns have
produced consumers remarkably resistant to the rational hard sell.
So even a staid, conventional marketer like P&AMP;G realizes that
creativity, in the form of emotion or entertainment, has become a
not-so-secret weapon against consumer boredom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for something distinctive,'' said Rob Matteucci,
vice president and general manager for North American hair care
brands at Procter in Cincinnati. ``This is very distinctive from
other campaigns and for P&AMP;G advertising in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumer reaction was so like `Wow, this is really cool,''' he
added. ``I've been in this business for 21 years and you don't get
that kind of positive, spontaneous reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his brands, Pert Plus shampoo, is indicative of the
trend. A television, print and Internet campaign features a
character named Sink Boy who pursues women in Miami Beach, New
Orleans and Las Vegas, offering to demonstrate the product by
washing their hair in a sink he shleps through the streets on a
hand cart.
</P>
<P>
   A key component of the spiel by Sink Boy, a glib actor named
Michael Collins, is his eliciting admissions from the women he
interviews of how much they dislike products like Pert Plus _
``2-in-1'' combinations of shampoo and conditioner _ for the
residues they leave that make hair limp and heavy-feeling. He then
describes how Pert Plus has been reformulated _ ``It's like
revolutionarily redesigned,'' in Collins' breezy argot _ and urges
them to give the brand another chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not often you see an advertiser, much less P&AMP;G,
acknowledging how terrible the product was,'' said Bob Garfield, ad
reviewer for the trade publication Advertising Age. ``I think the
campaign is spectacular.''
</P>
<P>
   Matteucci said he agreed that the approach was ``highly
unusual,'' adding: ``People hear `New and improved' all the time.
But in this case, because we were brutally honest and up-front,
people tried the product.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pert Plus campaign was developed with funds allocated by
Procter for marketing approaches deemed to be offbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``P&AMP;G has become a more experimental organization, trying new
stuff,'' said Kent Middleton, senior vice president and creative
director at Leo Burnett Co. in Chicago, the Pert Plus agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought the personality of the brand could be enhanced and
the advertising could break through with a dash of irreverence, the
sheer joy of a guy trying to wash people's hair on the street,'' he
added. ``It's a fun thing to do, and it's more fun to see consumers
are responding to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The new and improved version of man-on-the-street began in 1993
with a campaign for Daz, a detergent sold by Procter in Britain, in
which a cheeky interviewer surprises customers by visiting them at
home and wooing them to take part in a judging of laundry
cleanliness called the Daz Doorstep Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a saying here in England, `There's naught stranger
than folk,''' said Annabelle Manwaring, European creative director
for P&AMP;G at Leo Burnett London.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose is not to be the whiteness police, as it were,''
she added, ``but for us to show how confident Daz users are, the
confidence to show your whites to the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The success of the campaign _ which has included commercials
showing the interviewer chased by a ferocious dog and rejected by
consumers who don't use Daz _ led P&AMP;G to export the device to sell
detergent brands in Europe and Latin America. Then the idea turned
up in the United States, in campaigns for Gain detergent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a reinvention of the genre, which gives it new life,''
said Gerry Miller, an executive vice president and managing
creative director at Burnett in Chicago, which is sending an
interviewer in a helicopter to drop bottles of Gain onto the
audience at a muddy rock concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fun is our difference,'' Miller said. ``We zig when they
zag.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the man-on-the-street has crossed the street, so to speak,
expanding into categories beyond detergents. For Sure Clear Dry
antiperspirant, an interviewer named Jon Melichar sweet-talks
passers-by into touching and applying the product as they are
filmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antiperspirant is a low-interest category that people don't
think about much,'' said Dave Cohen, senior vice president and
group creative director at Grey Advertising in New York, the Sure
agency. ``And Sure is an old brand and tired in a way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you made it seem real, seem fun,'' he added, ``it was
more relevant to them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still selling a promise,'' Cohen said. ``When someone
says, `Wow, this even feels dry on my finger' _ bam! You've got
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sign Procter is really opening up,'' he added,
``realizing you don't have to do everything the traditional way.''
</P>
<P>
   In one way the campaigns are still traditional: the interviewer
wielding the microphone is always a man, though almost always the
consumers being interviewed are women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still hard in our culture to find a woman who can strike
the right balance,'' said Barbara Lippert, ad critic for the trade
publication Adweek, ``a woman with an edge who can also be sincere
about shine and bounce.''
</P>
<P>
   Matteucci at Procter said that what matters more than sex is
``the personalities'' of the interviewers, adding that ``the real
heroines are the women'' being interviewed in the commercials.
</P>
<P>
   As for whether P&AMP;G has too many men out on the street for too
many products, he said: ``So far we are quite comfortable we are
not overusing this in any way. If a technique gets overused, the
consumer would say, `What's different about this?' We don't see
anywhere near that with man-on-the-street.''
</P>
<P>
   Garfield of Advertising Age was a tad skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giuliani got rid of the squeegee guys,'' he said, referring to
New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's efforts to remove
panhandling car-window washers from the city's streets. ``Let's see
what he would do about the deodorant peddlers.''

COMMENTARY: ON KILLING SERBS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By A.M. ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For awhile, some days or weeks, Americans will put
aside their puzzlement about President Clinton's decision to go to
war against Yugoslavia because of Kosovo. They will support the war
because ``our troops are out there'' and because only a person
whose soul has died can stand the pictures of refugees and bodies
without wanting to stop the carnage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then, if the air bombardment goes on, it will occur to them that
down there on the ground getting killed are people called Serbs who
never raised a finger against us, were once our allies and long to
be allies again. That might lead them to say, how in heaven do we
stop killing these people? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The man who can help us do that is Slobodan Milosevic. And right
now the only way he can do that is to agree to surrender in the
civil war with the Kosovars by allowing them to secede after three
years from Serbia.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That would make him a traitor not only to himself but to the
Serbs. They think of Kosovo not as the property of the Albanian
Muslim majority there, but as the spiritual, historic and religious
center of all Serbia, particularly the 69 percent Christian
population. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I do not get emotional about the history of Kosovo. I am not a
Serb. Serbs do. They lost a great battle to Turkey there in 1389.
As a reporter in Eastern Europe I learned that to Serbs the loss
was not the end but the beginning of their hopes for national
resurrection and so a holy place. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Serbs are as likely to give up Kosovo willingly because the
Albanians want it as Israelis are to give up Jerusalem because the
Arabs want it.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NATO is supposed to be for defense of its members. But it now
attacks non-member Serbia, after a pompous declaration from its
Spanish head, because Serbia is led by a louse. Daydream: My old
Serb friend Milovan Djilas stands in Geneva and orders the Spanish
to get out of rebellious Basque territory. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The attack may bring about Serbian surrender on Kosovo, but not
for long. Serbs' passion for another rebirth will rise again. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They will target the NATO occupation force, particularly the
U.S. contingent, with guns and hate. Can we live with that? It was
not guns but the hate of virtually the entire population that drove
us quickly out of Somalia.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton talks about ``credibility.'' In Kosovo we are
supposed to be fighting for human rights. But he inflicted an
ever-bleeding wound on America _ destroying any American human
rights policy faintly worthy of the name. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has a dictator's essential quality. He is ever ready
to kill his own people to maintain and keep power. In that he is no
different from Saddam Hussein, or Moammar Gadhafi, or Iran's ruling
ayatollahs, or the Sudanese leaders who murder and enslave
countrymen, particularly Christians and animists _ or the
murderers' bench known as the Chinese Politburo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton let Saddam destroy the U.N. commission that was all
that stood between Iraq and weapons of mass destruction. The U.S.
is about to ``punish'' Libya for its role in the destruction of Pan
Am 103 _ by trying two of Colonel Gadhafi's Libyan officers. He
disallows court questions about his own part in the bombing! &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Politburo? With his own hand, and in his own act of betrayal
of the Politburo's vast gulags of prisoners in China and Tibet,
Clinton ``de-linked'' human rights from trade _ do as you wish, as
long as you trade with us.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the cases of China, Libya, the Sudan and the ayatollahs,
military action was not asked for by us human rights folk _ just
the use of economic pressure against the dictators, and against
those allies who double-cross us and the prisoners by snapping up
the trade we lost.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton solemnly tells Americans that we may lose men and women
in Kosovo. But he was not willing to lose any trade with China.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When other Americans say the war against Yugoslavia is moral, I
am moved to think hard. When Clinton talks about it I am moved to
nausea.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And don't tell me there are no solutions. First tell the
Kosovars they can have autonomy but that we are not going to kill
Serbs and Americans for Kosovo's independence.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then, at last, give utmost political and financial support to
all those Serbs who will not give up Kosovo as part of their
heritage, but would give up Slobodan Milosevic tomorrow if we
helped them _ early tomorrow.

   LOS ANGELES _ The NATO attacks prompted a range of wary, often
ambivalent reaction here Thursday, with few voices offering
unqualified support for the allies and many Californians expressing
deep doubt about both tactics and goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a complicated region,'' said Daniel Palladino, 39, a
television writer who was plowing through a stack of newspapers
this morning at the Farmer's Market, in the heart of Los Angeles.
``God knows, even the names of the countries keep changing. I know
more about it than a lot of people, I think, and I still have
ambivalent feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're told atrocities are happening, and I'm sure that they
are,'' he added. ``But what is the goal? It just isn't that clear
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Ka'imi Lee, 40, a flight attendant for Hawaiian Airlines who
traveled last summer through Croatia and Slovenia, two former
Yugoslav republics, also professed mixed feelings as he pored over
newspaper accounts at a nearby table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the whole issue of going into another country and using
the moral high ground,'' he said. ``It's a conflict between two
sides there. In recent years, with all the attention to the
Holocaust, these issues are more compelling, because you don't want
history to repeat itself. But it's always a tough issue. At what
point is it worth giving lives to save lives?''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Petar Jovanovic of St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Church in
San Gabriel, Calif., who has been in this country since 1977 and is
an American citizen, expressed no ambivalence whatever.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will find not one person of Serbian background who will
say that this bombing is necessary,'' he said in a telephone
interview. ``You cannot make a peace agreement with an ultimatum
from one side. The Serbian people will never agree with an
independent Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``If the Americans go in, it will be a big problem.
The Serbians will not be pacified easily like in Bosnia. This
degrades America in the eyes of oppressed people around the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Beulah Boyd, a retired nurse shopping at the Farmer's Market,
said: ``I think it's a bad idea. Many innocent people are involved
and it sort of seems like Vietnam. We don't need to be going into
their war.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Verba, 70, a retired state worker who immigrated from
Czechoslovakia after World War II, expressed similar doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's kind of stupid,'' he said. ``I'm positive it
won't accomplish much. I wouldn't even dare to guess how it will
come out.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday afternoon, as the raids began, some 200 protestors
gathered outside the federal building in Westwood, carrying signs
like ``Where Does it Stop? World War 3'' and ``World, Shame on
You.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the protestors, the Vietnam veteran Ron Kovic, whose
story became the movie ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' called the
NATO attacks a ``terribly insensitive policy,'' and added, ``We
must set a better example.''

NATO LAUNCHES SECOND WAVE OF AIR ASSAULTS ON YUGOSLAVIA

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Yugoslavia withstood a second wave of NATO air
assaults on Thursday, with the White House vowing prolonged and
severe attacks while Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was
reported to be defiantly stepping up his military campaign around
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's escalated today,'' said Sandy Berger, President Clinton's
National Security adviser, conceding that, despite the NATO
assault, Milosevic's military forces continued their sweep, burning
ethnic Albanian villages in Kosovo and even sending ``some
shelling'' into nearby Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very disturbing to us,'' Berger said at a White House
briefing. But he declined to speculate on the motives of the
Yugoslav leader, who has rejected NATO demands that he cease
hostilities against the ethnic Albanian separatists of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As fresh salvos of missiles and bombs struck targets in
Yugoslavia, the NATO supreme commander, Gen. Wesley Clark,
resolutely vowed that the duration and severity of the military
campaign was up to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to systematically and progressively attack,
disrupt, degrade, devastate and ultimately, unless Milosevic
complies with the demands of the international community, we're
going to destroy his forces,'' Clark said at NATO headquarters in
Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   On the second straight day of NATO bombardment, cruise missiles
and guided bombs rained down on targets that Pentagon officials
described as military and air depots and factories underpinning the
yearlong assault against Kosovo, the southernmost province in the
Serbia republic, which is Milosevic's power base as Yugoslav
leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be another substantive strike; it will be severe,''
said Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon as the bombing was renewed
from an armada that includes six warships and roughly 400 bombers
and fighters. He said the latest attacks were ``principally on air
defense targets and military targets'' that are being used in the
repression of the province's ethnic Albanian majority.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen expressed satisfaction with the
effectiveness of the NATO raids, but declined to discuss any
strategic timetable. ``The Serb forces should not take any comfort
that they could be free from any sort of assault or attack from our
forces at any time during the course of the day or night,'' he said
in an interview on public television. ``It could be done at any
time.''
</P>
<P>
   With Western news workers ordered to leave Yugoslavia, there
were no detailed accounts of target destruction in the latest
bombing run. More than 40 targets were hit in the Wednesday
assault, Pentagon officials said, amid unofficial speculation that
the Thursday attack might have been even more ambitious in its
target plan.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, the Milosevic government insisted it was the
innocent victim of NATO aggression. Deputy Prime Minister Vuk
Draskovic talked of possible compromise in news interviews, but no
such talk was heard from Milosevic, Belgrade's authoritarian ruler
who has rigidly rejected calls for a cease-fire. ``Stop bombing
us,'' Draskovic contended on Britain's Sky TV, ``and we will stop
all operations against the people, the terrorists who provoked NATO
strikes against Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   In Skopje, Macedonia, near Kosovo's southeast border, thousands
of Serb sympathizers marched on the American Embassy, throwing
rocks and torching cars in protest against the NATO raids and in
support of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He must either choose peace or we will limit his ability to
make war,'' President Clinton said of the Yugoslav leader in brief
White House comments amid a busy day of military briefings. Various
administration officials carefully stressed the goal was not to
knock Milosevic from power but to force him to observe Kosovo peace
promises he made, then broke, last year.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Russian threats to lift the arms embargo on
Yugoslavia, Clinton declared, ``I think that would be a terrible
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The administration's concern over Moscow's angry denunciation of
the NATO raids was emphasized by Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright at a briefing. One of the administration's main diplomatic
goals now that airstrikes are under way, she said, was
``maintaining contacts with Russia and making clear that our
differences over Kosovo need not disrupt progress on other
fronts.''
</P>
<P>
   Warning Milosevic against widening his military campaign to the
surrounding region, Albright said plans were being made for ``a
flood of new refugees.'' She said ``Milosevic's forces in Kosovo
are today continuing their offensive against civilians, burning and
looting and attacking political leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   With Republican critics questioning whether the administration
has a strategic alternative to bombing, Berger defended the NATO
air assault, insisting that Milosevic ``will sustain the most
serious damage if he thinks he can ride out an air attack.'' Even
more, he underlined Clinton's assertion that the operation will not
see the commitment of U.S. fighting forces on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is something we do not intend to do,'' Berger declared.
</P>
<P>
   Facing news reporters, the president's security chief was asked
whether the 19-member NATO assault has now established ``a
precedent for intervening in civil wars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every situation has to be taken on its own merits,'' Berger
replied, maintaining that Milosevic presents ``a rather weak
argument'' in invoking sovereignty after his record of hostilities
in Croatia, Bosnia and Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has said many times that it depends upon whether
America's national interests are involved, as well as our values,''
Berger continued. ``Our values are involved in preventing what I
believe would be a humanitarian catastrophe. Our interests are
involved in avoiding a wider conflict in southeastern Europe, which
I think would most likely involve us at some later point with far
greater costs and at far greater risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The president has argued that the 19-member NATO alliance has a
moral obligation to deal with the Kosovo onslaught, terming it
Wednesday a ``powder keg at the heart of Europe'' that will
endanger neighboring nations unless Kosovo is stopped in his
campaign of ethnic cleansing and atrocity against the Kosovar
majority. An estimated 2,000 people have been killed in the past
year, with hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians driven from
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Looking haggard and sounding weary, Clinton brushed aside signs
that the nation is divided over U.S. participation in the NATO
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that many Americans really have not thought a lot
about this until the last two days,'' he told reporters between
military briefings. ``I also believe very strongly that it is my
responsibility to make this judgment based on what I think is in
the long-term interests of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   A CNN/Gallup/USA Today survey released Wednesday showed that 46
percent of Americans support the nation's participation in the
bombings while 43 percent oppose it. A CBS News Poll released
Thursday showed that 50 percent favor the intervention and 30
percent oppose it, but it also showed that 52 percent said that
peace in Yugoslavia was not worth the price of American lives.
About one third said peace was worth that price.
</P>
<P>
   The White House indicated Clinton's appeal for public support in
the risky military assaults would be ongoing across the NATO
action, which thus far has not been described as subject to a
specific time limit. ``I don't believe last night's address to the
nation was the last thing the president needs to say,'' said White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart.

   Clinton said he believed that a majority of the public would
support the case he laid out in his 13-minute address to the nation
Wednesday night. ``I did my very best to explain what we were doing
and why,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, Sens. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, and Joseph Lieberman,
D-Conn., unveiled legislation to authorize $25 million to train and
arm Kosovars in defense of the ethnic Albanians. Lieberman said he
hoped the airstrikes would produce peace in the Balkans. But if it
does not, he said, the arms proposal answers the question of what
might be an exit strategy from Kosovo. But McConnell conceded that,
in recently bringing up the proposal with the president and other
administration officials, the only reaction was ``stunned
silence.''
</P>
<P>
   At his security briefing, Berger rebuffed suggestions that NATO
was disunited in the raids. He said comments by Italian Prime
Minister Massimo D'Alema about the urgent need for diplomacy seemed
based on the erroneous impression that the fighting in Kosovo had
ended. ``We'll obviously point that out to him,'' Berger said,
adding: ``There are varying perspectives in any alliance, but I
believe that there is clarity and solidarity about this mission.''

   MIAMI _ As bombs fell on Yugoslavia, indifference, mostly,
drifted in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In downtown Miami, businessmen chatting in Spanish just shook
their heads when asked if they had any special feelings about the
bombing by NATO forces.
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring Coral Gables, shoppers on Miracle Mile, a
historic shopping street that resembles a small-town Main Street,
barely paused long enough to mutter, ``No se,'' or ``Dunno.''
</P>
<P>
   Lying on the beach in Boca Raton, Alma Reyes was brutally
honest. ``What's Kosovo?'' said Ms. Reyes, 25, a waitress. ``I have
no idea where it is or what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Her reaction was similar to those of others here on a beautiful
warm morning, where people in shorts and sandals found little
connection to either the cruelties that led to the bombing or the
prospect of further hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's Kosovo?'' said Todd Hunter Weiss, a shipping clerk at
Jacobson's Department Store in Boca Raton. ``I don't like to worry
about the world's problems. I'm a happier person if I stay centered
on myself.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the same further north, in Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night we kept receiving calls to the station asking us
when President Clinton was going to stop speaking to the nation,''
said Jose Salvador, a television news producer at WPEC-TV, a CBS
affiliate in West Palm Beach. ``These people wanted their show back
on and they were really annoyed. They didn't think it affected them
in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   On South Beach, the trendy tip of Miami Beach, Latin American
and European tourists on Ocean Drive had no time to talk about
Kosovo, nor did Hispanic shoppers on Biscayne Boulevard in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone dismissed the gravity of what is happening in
Kosovo. In the condominium canyons of Broward County and Palm
Beach, the Rev. George Mamangnkis, a retired Greek Orthodox priest,
had a strong opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making a mistake,'' said Mamangnkis, who served as a
priest in New Jersey before moving to Palm City. ``We are being
extremely unfair to the Serbian people. People should become more
aware of the history of the country. This country has had the same
problems since the 14th century.''
</P>
<P>
   In Delray Beach, 56-year-old Tony Prohaska had a personal
perspective on the conflict: His father was born in Montenegro, the
other republic in Yugoslavia, and he vacationed there last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It frightens me,'' he said of the bombing, which he fears
could expand into something much bigger. ``It should have been
worked out peacefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Weaver, a vacationing National Guardsman from Indiana, had
a more military perspective. ``As long as the rules of engagement
aren't overly complex, we should be involved in order to reduce
their military capabilities,'' he said. ``There's nothing wrong
with what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   On the beach in Boca Raton, Ms. Reyes said she would try to
learn more about the conflict. ``I guess I should be reading the
newspaper,'' she said. ``Now maybe I will.''

   HOUSTON _ William and Mary Ellen Myers, married Thursday
morning, decided to celebrate by taking a stroll past the Water
Wall, a towering horseshoe-shaped fountain.. They acknowledged that
they had been a bit too wrapped up in the moment to pay close
attention to the situation in Kosovo, but it does worry them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a son who's a sophomore in high school,'' said Mrs.
Myers, an elementary-school music teacher, ``and he said they
announced it at school yesterday. It caught me by surprise, and I'm
finding it hard to know what to believe. After all that's happened,
can you trust President Clinton to tell you the truth?''
</P>
<P>
   Interviews Thursday with business executives, academics,
tourists, artists and passers-by suggested that the NATO bombing
was far away from most people's minds. Many said they were not only
unsure what was at stake, but had difficulty identifying which side
was being bombed.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Djerejian, director of the James Baker Institute for
Public Policy at Rice University, said he was not surprised by the
lack of understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been explained to the American people by the
administration,'' Djerejian said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill White, a former head of the state Democratic Party, also
said it was not surprising that many people find it hard to fathom
what the United States and NATO are trying to do in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of folks don't fully realize how chaotic the world would
be without the military backbone provided by the United States,''
he said. ``So it's hard to explain sometimes the U.S. strategic
interest unless people realize that there has to be some worldwide
perception that there are boundaries that can't be crossed.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Allison, a Houston-based artist who has traveled extensively
in the Balkans during the last decade, said it is important that
NATO ``do something and step in to stop Milosevic'' _ President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, he has ``torn feelings'' because he knows that
both ordinary Serbs and ethnic Albanians are at the mercy of armed
leaders who do not always tell them the truth. ``I'm sorry for
conscripts in the Serbian army going to attack places where they
used to go on vacation,'' he said. ``It's as if I were a conscript
in the army of Texas and had to attack Galveston.''
</P>
<P>
   One Houston resident with little doubt of where he stood was
Terry Minton, an accountant. ``I've been trying to follow it pretty
closely, and personally I think it was the appropriate thing to
do,'' he said. ``Ethnic aggression is just wrong and I think this
is the only way we're going to make the Serbs stop doing it. This
is the only language Slobodan Milosevic understands.''

 &HT;    Delta agrees to sell 119 Boeing 727s
 &HT;    By Christopher Seward
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines has signed a deal to sell 119 of its
Boeing 727s to Pratt &AMP; Whitney, the company that makes the engines
that power the planes.
</P>
<P>
   The deal comes as Delta begins taking delivery today of the
first of its new widebody Boeing 777s, the biggest plane in its
fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The narrower-bodied 727 will be replaced primarily by a new
version of the 737, a workhorse now being produced in updated
models.
</P>
<P>
   The deal announced Thursday with Pratt &AMP; Whitney provides the
carrier with a substantial cash flow as it retires its 727 fleet,
and the transaction will add to earnings, said Warren C. Jenson,
Delta's executive vice president and chief financial officer. Delta
also will sell Pratt &AMP; Whitney 39 spare engines.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement enables Delta to maintain our current schedule
for 727 retirements without concern for future fluctuations in the
used aircraft market,'' Jenson said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's stock climbed $2.12 1/2, or 3 percent, to close at
$68.68 3/4 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While the Atlanta-based carrier didn't assign a value to the
deal, used Boeing 727s range in value from $4 million to $6
million, Bryant Lynch, manager of commercial aircraft appraisals at
Virginia-based AvSolutions Inc., told Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   Delta has 125 of the 727s, more than any other passenger
carrier. About 20 of the planes will be retired this year, and the
remainder through 2005. The few remaining planes will be used for
spare parts, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Delta and other airlines that fly the 727 face significantly
higher operating costs over the long run if they keep it in their
fleets. The 727 has three engines and requires three pilots, while
the new 737s have two engines and require only two pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Aviation Administration rules have resulted in more
frequent mandatory inspections for some 727s. Last month the FAA
ordered inspections of 1,000 aging Boeing 727s for skin joint
fatigue cracks, a problem first noticed at Delta. The carrier said
100 of its 727s fall under the inspection order.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt &AMP; Whitney will convert the 727s to freighters and market
them with the help of Republic Financial Corp., an aircraft
equipment leasing firm in Denver. Pratt will refurbish the engines
at its Columbus maintenance center.

 &HT;    Florida-based rival purchases Norrell
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Norrell Corp., the Atlanta-based temporary employment
service founded by former gubernatorial candidate Guy Millner, has
been acquired by a rival, Interim Services Inc. of Fort Lauderdale,
Fla., in a stock deal worth $553 million.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition, announced Thursday, creates the nation's
third-largest temporary staffing firm. Worldwide, the combined
companies weigh in at No. 7, with $4 billion in revenue. The top
two U.S. firms are Manpower Inc. and Kelly Services.
</P>
<P>
   Norrell shareholders will get 0.9 shares of Interim stock for
each Norrell share on a tax-deferred basis. Interim assumes about
$55 million in Norrell debt. The deal, the latest in the rapidly
consolidating industry, is expected to be completed in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combined companies will have enhanced capabilities to
serve clients on a global basis with the widest range of services
available in the industry,'' said Norrell Chairman and Chief
Executive Doug Miller. Miller, who will likely leave once the
transition is complete, and Ray Marcy, chief executive officer of
Interim, are longtime acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   Millner, Norrell's single largest shareholder with 9.5 million
shares, will receive about 11 percent of Interim stock and a seat
on its board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a great deal of confidence in Interim management,''
Millner said. ``Ray Marcy has done an outstanding job in building
quite a leadership position in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Millner said he has no intention of leaving the Atlanta area.
</P>
<P>
   ``This merger will not change at all where we live,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Millner lost races for governor in 1994 and 1998 and also lost a
bid for the U.S. Senate in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm cured of politics. I look back with no regrets about my
political efforts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He relinquished an active role in Norrell several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear if Norrell will retain its name or if there will
be layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Interim spokeswoman Liza Palermo said the merger is about
``market expansion and revenue growth, not consolidation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not be eliminating headquarters,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the deal was a good strategic fit, with
complementary product lines for both companies. Interim inherits
Norrell's $300 million outsourcing unit and call center service,
two businesses it didn't have. The merger significantly enhances
Interim's technology, accounting and commercial staffing
operations. In turn, the Norrell name _ strong among Fortune 50
firms such as Coca-Cola, United Parcel Service and IBM _ will now
extend to European markets, where Interim is well-known.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts expressed concern about the merger, particularly
because Norrell has gone from an industry leader to a laggard in
the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a well-articulated strategy in terms of
integrating the two companies,'' said Peter Vozzo, a research
analyst at Interstate/Johnson Lane in Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   ``Revenues have fallen in commercial staffing, and its IT
(information technology) staffing seems to have slowed down,''
Vozzo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Norrell has been a puzzle to analysts for the last year. They
expected it to perform better. They haven't done exactly what they
were supposed to do in terms of earnings,'' said Peter Yessne,
editor of Staffing Industry Report in Los Altos, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a company that could have continued on by themselves.
But they apparently see this as a way to maximize their value.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the industry, the stocks of both companies have
fallen sharply. Companies are spending less time and money on
temporary workers because they are so focused on Y2K problems. At
the same time, the temporary staffing industry has a difficult time
finding workers because of the low unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
   That, coupled with poor earnings estimates, has put the brakes
on the industry's near-decade-long growth. Much of the industry is
consolidating as a way to control costs in such areas as
information technology, where it is becoming more expensive to be a
major player.
</P>
<P>
   Norrell's shares closed at $13.43 1/4 Thursday, up 81 1/4 cents.
The stock is down 8 percent from the beginning of the year and well
below its 52-week high of $24.75 in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Interim Services closed Thursday at $16, down $1.81 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Norrell has wrestled with several poorly performing units.
</P>
<P>
   Vozzo said Norrell focused on its larger light-industry clients
at the expense of its midsize clients. A Norrell spokesman tied the
problems to internal and external factors: Several large clients
cut back on work, and Norrell went through a fairly significant
restructuring that involved splitting its sales and services
functions, said spokesman Gene Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we've working our way out of that,'' Stevenson
said, citing the company's recent five-year, multimillion-dollar
agreement with Coca-Cola to provide staffing services for the
company's Atlanta headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Millner defended the company's performance, particularly its IT
division.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the whole staffing segment, they're all down.
It has nothing to do with the growth in the marketplace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There were more than 400 mergers and acquisitions in the
industry last year, according to the National Association of
Temporary and Staffing Services, an Alexandria, Va., trade group.
In August, the Dutch parent of Atlanta-based Randstad Staffing
Services bought part of Accustaff for $850 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect that as the industry continues to evolve and mature,
we'll see significant consolidation and activities,'' said Richard
Wahlquist, NATSS executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 7,000 companies in the industry providing people
and services ranging from clerical help to light assembly work to
information technology and even chief executives.

   LONDONDERRY, N.H. _ From its antique apple orchards to its high
school principal's office, this New England hamlet showed not a
drop of jubilation Thursday over the NATO attacks on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Trepidation, rather, seemed to reign, even among the festive
Hula Hoops and bells at Cindy Parente's Kindermusik class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know, why are we there?'' asked Jennifer Croot, 32,
who was helping her daughter, Emily, through her paces. ``Why are
we always the big brother? I know the answer: We are the No. 1
power in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But she was clearly not happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope there's a peaceful solution quickly,'' Ms. Parente
said. ``I don't want to believe the atrocities I'm reading about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see an end to it,'' Terry Akashian worried aloud as
she kept an eye on her daughter, Hailey.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere as well a willingness to accept the need to intervene
to defend ethnic Albanians in Kosovo seemed to mingle with deep
discomfort that such global interventions seemed to be becoming a
habit, and seemed always to be dominated by American force and
will.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should we be there?'' asked Bill Etter, a special education
instructor at Londonderry High School. ``I don't know. The idea
we're constantly called upon to do the dirty work of the rest of
the world becomes a major problem as a moral issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Hanna, a technology teacher, commented similarly: ``I think
that we're probably one of the only countries in the position to do
that. But I don't think that necessarily makes it right that we're
always the financial and military back behind everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Etter said he was concerned that Russia might use the bombing as
an excuse to return to a more aggressive role in the world arena.
``It's a golden opportunity to get back into things,'' he said.
``It's very scary.''
</P>
<P>
   But at Mack's Apples, a 400-acre spread that has been a farm
since 1732, the farm manager, Mike Cross, noted, as he had heard
President Clinton say Wednesday night, that the alternatives are
scary, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president seems to be afraid that if they don't do
something, this will spread and turn into a major European war,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The president could be right, Cross said, but he questioned
whether bombing Yugoslavia would force President Slobodan Milosevic
to back down. ``That seems to be the big question today,'' he said.
``Is this guy going to stop, or will it be like Iran and Iraq,
where these guys just don't care? I don't imagine the Serbs are
going to stop _ not after one night's bombing, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The other big question, he said, was whether the United States
and other countries would decide they must send in ground troops as
the only way to impose their will. So far, NATO leaders seem to be
actively avoiding answering that question, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, like a handful of others, Cross sounded torn:
uncomfortable with the global policeman role and yet, he said,
``Cleaning out villages, killing the men and making the women and
children refugees _ that seems like a pretty terrible thing to let
anybody get away with.''

   WASHINGTON _ Yugoslavia withstood a second wave of NATO air
assaults on Thursday, with the White House vowing prolonged and
severe attacks while Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was
reported to be defiantly stepping up his military campaign around
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's escalated today,'' said Sandy Berger, President Clinton's
National Security adviser, conceding that, despite the NATO
assault, Milosevic's military forces continued their sweep, burning
ethnic Albanian villages in Kosovo and even sending ``some
shelling'' into nearby Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very disturbing to us,'' Berger said at a White House
briefing. But he declined to speculate on the motives of the
Yugoslav leader, who has rejected NATO demands that he cease
hostilities against the ethnic Albanian separatists of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As fresh salvos of missiles and bombs struck targets in
Yugoslavia, the NATO supreme commander, Gen. Wesley Clark,
resolutely vowed that the duration and severity of the military
campaign was up to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to systematically and progressively attack,
disrupt, degrade, devastate and ultimately, unless Milosevic
complies with the demands of the international community, we're
going to destroy his forces,'' Clark said at NATO headquarters in
Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   On the second straight day of NATO bombardment, cruise missiles
and guided bombs rained down on targets that Pentagon officials
described as military and air depots and factories underpinning the
yearlong assault against Kosovo, the southernmost province in the
Serbia republic, which is Milosevic's power base as Yugoslav
leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be another substantive strike; it will be severe,''
said Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon as the bombing was renewed
from an armada that includes six warships and roughly 400 bombers
and fighters. He said the latest attacks were ``principally on air
defense targets and military targets'' that are being used in the
repression of the province's ethnic Albanian majority.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen expressed satisfaction with the
effectiveness of the NATO raids, but declined to discuss any
strategic timetable. ``The Serb forces should not take any comfort
that they could be free from any sort of assault or attack from our
forces at any time during the course of the day or night,'' he said
in an interview on public television. ``It could be done at any
time.''
</P>
<P>
   With Western news workers ordered to leave Yugoslavia, there
were no detailed accounts of target destruction in the latest
bombing run. More than 40 targets were hit in the Wednesday
assault, Pentagon officials said, amid unofficial speculation that
the Thursday attack might have been even more ambitious in its
target plan.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, the Milosevic government insisted it was the
innocent victim of NATO aggression. Deputy Prime Minister Vuk
Draskovic talked of possible compromise in news interviews, but no
such talk was heard from Milosevic, Belgrade's authoritarian ruler
who has rigidly rejected calls for a cease-fire. ``Stop bombing
us,'' Draskovic contended on Britain's Sky TV, ``and we will stop
all operations against the people, the terrorists who provoked NATO
strikes against Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   In Skopje, Macedonia, near Kosovo's southeast border, thousands
of Serb sympathizers marched on the American Embassy, throwing
rocks and torching cars in protest against the NATO raids and in
support of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He must either choose peace or we will limit his ability to
make war,'' President Clinton said of the Yugoslav leader in brief
White House comments amid a busy day of military briefings. Various
administration officials carefully stressed the goal was not to
knock Milosevic from power but to force him to observe Kosovo peace
promises he made, then broke, last year.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Russian threats to lift the arms embargo on
Yugoslavia, Clinton declared, ``I think that would be a terrible
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The administration's concern over Moscow's angry denunciation of
the NATO raids was emphasized by Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright at a briefing. One of the administration's main diplomatic
goals now that airstrikes are under way, she said, was
``maintaining contacts with Russia and making clear that our
differences over Kosovo need not disrupt progress on other
fronts.''
</P>
<P>
   Warning Milosevic against widening his military campaign to the
surrounding region, Albright said plans were being made for ``a
flood of new refugees.'' She said ``Milosevic's forces in Kosovo
are today continuing their offensive against civilians, burning and
looting and attacking political leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   With Republican critics questioning whether the administration
has a strategic alternative to bombing, Berger defended the NATO
air assault, insisting that Milosevic ``will sustain the most
serious damage if he thinks he can ride out an air attack.'' Even
more, he underlined Clinton's assertion that the operation will not
see the commitment of U.S. fighting forces on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is something we do not intend to do,'' Berger declared.
</P>
<P>
   Facing news reporters, the president's security chief was asked
whether the 19-member NATO assault has now established ``a
precedent for intervening in civil wars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every situation has to be taken on its own merits,'' Berger
replied, maintaining that Milosevic presents ``a rather weak
argument'' in invoking sovereignty after his record of hostilities
in Croatia, Bosnia and Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has said many times that it depends upon whether
America's national interests are involved, as well as our values,''
Berger continued. ``Our values are involved in preventing what I
believe would be a humanitarian catastrophe. Our interests are
involved in avoiding a wider conflict in southeastern Europe, which
I think would most likely involve us at some later point with far
greater costs and at far greater risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The president has argued that the 19-member NATO alliance has a
moral obligation to deal with the Kosovo onslaught, terming it
Wednesday a ``powder keg at the heart of Europe'' that will
endanger neighboring nations unless Kosovo is stopped in his
campaign of ethnic cleansing and atrocity against the Kosovar
majority. An estimated 2,000 people have been killed in the past
year, with hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians driven from
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Looking haggard and sounding weary, Clinton brushed aside signs
that the nation is divided over U.S. participation in the NATO
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that many Americans really have not thought a lot
about this until the last two days,'' he told reporters between
military briefings. ``I also believe very strongly that it is my
responsibility to make this judgment based on what I think is in
the long-term interests of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   A CNN/Gallup/USA Today survey released Wednesday showed that 46
percent of Americans support the nation's participation in the
bombings while 43 percent oppose it. A CBS News Poll released
Thursday showed that 50 percent favor the intervention and 30
percent oppose it, but it also showed that 52 percent said that
peace in Yugoslavia was not worth the price of American lives.
About one third said peace was worth that price.
</P>
<P>
   The White House indicated Clinton's appeal for public support in
the risky military assaults would be ongoing across the NATO
action, which thus far has not been described as subject to a
specific time limit. ``I don't believe last night's address to the
nation was the last thing the president needs to say,'' said White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he believed that a majority of the public would
support the case he laid out in his 13-minute address to the nation
Wednesday night. ``I did my very best to explain what we were doing
and why,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, Sens. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, and Joseph Lieberman,
D-Conn., unveiled legislation to authorize $25 million to train and
arm Kosovars in defense of the ethnic Albanians. Lieberman said he
hoped the airstrikes would produce peace in the Balkans. But if it
does not, he said, the arms proposal answers the question of what
might be an exit strategy from Kosovo. But McConnell conceded that,
in recently bringing up the proposal with the president and other
administration officials, the only reaction was ``stunned
silence.''
</P>
<P>
   At his security briefing, Berger rebuffed suggestions that NATO
was disunited in the raids. He said comments by Italian Prime
Minister Massimo D'Alema about the urgent need for diplomacy seemed
based on the erroneous impression that the fighting in Kosovo had
ended. ``We'll obviously point that out to him,'' Berger said,
adding: ``There are varying perspectives in any alliance, but I
believe that there is clarity and solidarity about this mission.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Many New Yorkers seemed to be debating with
themselves Thursday when trying to express their feelings about the
NATO strikes on Yugoslavia _ flipping quickly from pro to con to
simply puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have very mixed feelings,'' said Bill Burrows, as he and his
three daughters lingered in the lobby of the Times Square Disney
Store. ``I don't think we should stand by idly. But there have been
massive human rights violations everywhere _ Tibet, Rwanda,
Tiananmen Square.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They say we need a stable Europe for our national security,''
he added. ``But I'm not sure why a stable Africa or stable Asia
isn't just as important for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Rarback, 53 and retired, was working on a crossword puzzle
in an Upper West Side coffee shop Thursday afternoon. ``That war's
been going on 1,000 years,'' he said. ``I guess our position is
that our national security is threatened. And there are the
humanitarian considerations _ people being tortured, a lot of
people dying. Maybe, here, it's a moral imperative.''
</P>
<P>
   But he fought in Vietnam for a year, which colored his feelings
about war indelibly. ``War is horrible,'' he said. ``We're going in
to help people, but people are going to get killed. And I don't
even know which side is which.''
</P>
<P>
   Some said they were too uninformed to assess the attacks, while
others said they had not really given the bombings much thought,
and felt troubled by that. ``I'm disturbed,'' said Reevan Trupin,
who teaches English to immigrants. ``These wars seem like such
nonchalant things. The Serbs are the bad guys _ killing innocent
Muslims, right? But if you look back, they were fighting Hitler,
right? It's very complex.''
</P>
<P>
   It is tempting to ignore the complexities and try to view the
situation in black and white, said Jackie Wildau, a theatrical
consultant and producer, who had stopped for a coffee break.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the Vietnam picture and the Hitler picture,'' she
said. ``We're tossed between the two _ one or the other, right or
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Verdery, a retired U. N. official, walking home on upper
Broadway, said: ``I have some doubt they can solve this thing by
bombing. I bet they'll have to put troops in on the ground. But we
should have done this earlier.''

BUSH SAYS HIS PRAYERS ARE WITH U.S. PERSONNEL

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush on Thursday said his prayers
are with the U.S. military personnel participating in the Kosovo
intervention, but Bush said he has doubts about America's role in
the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate question is: Will this military action lead to
the goal of ending the conflict and bringing peace and stability to
the region? I fervently hope so, although I share the concerns and
misgivings of many Texans and Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was the last of the potential Republican presidential
contenders to weigh in on the Kosovo crisis this week.
</P>
<P>
   As a state governor, he has had little exposure to Balkan
conflict policy. Before making his statements Thursday, Bush
consulted with his presidential exploratory committee policy
adviser Josh Bolten and foreign policy adviser Condoleezza Rice.
</P>
<P>
   As the airstrikes against Yugoslavian forces entered their
second day, Bush said President Clinton had no choice but to go
through with the military action once he had threatened force, and
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic had refused to back down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mistake would have been to make threats and then not
follow through,'' Bush said. ``Once the president of the United
States makes a threat, he must or she must follow through.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's father as president initiated the Persian Gulf War to
drive Iraq out of Kuwait. President Bush conducted that war by
saying the nation must have a clearly defined goal.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush said the nation needs to ask that same kind of
question about the defense of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``My worry is the worry of a lot of people I've heard from in
Texas, and that is, will the airstrikes achieve the president's
stated mission of bringing Milosevic back to the peace table,''
Bush said. ``And if not, what next?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, Bush spent part of Thursday's meeting with about
30 politicians from around the nation who were interested in his
race for president. The group included former Massachusetts Gov.
William Weld, said Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Arshinkoff, GOP chairman of Summit County, Ohio, came out
of the meeting sold on Bush as someone conservative enough to
satisfy all Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face facts, guys, moderates in Texas are more
conservative than most people across the country,'' Arshinkoff
said. ``For George Bush, who is a conservative, to be called
anything but a conservative is ridiculous.''

HOUSE PASSES GOP BUDGET PLAN; CLASH WITH CLINTON LIKELY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House passed the Republican budget plan
Thursday night, driving toward a big tax cut and a showdown later
this year with the Clinton administration over the nation's
priorities in an emerging era of fiscal plenty.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also worked into the night on a nearly identical
measure, and was all but certain to pass it, uniting Republicans in
the two chambers as they prepare for months of budget battles with
the White House and set out an agenda they hope to carry into the
2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Voting largely along party lines, the House adopted a budget
guideline that calls for a tax cut of nearly $800 billion over the
next 10 years, an increase in Pentagon spending and more money for
education. The final vote in the House was 221-208.
</P>
<P>
   But to remain within strict spending limits that both parties
have vowed to honor, the Republican plan would require deep cuts in
most other programs, prompting sharp criticism from Democrats and
leaving even some Republicans uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   In presenting their competing visions of how to divide up the
expected fiscal windfall in coming years, the two parties generally
agreed on setting aside the bulk of projected surpluses for Social
Security, which will come under increasing financial strain as the
baby boom generation ages and retires.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign of the enduring sensitivity of Social Security as
a political issue, they battled furiously over whose approach
walled off more money for the retirement system and did more to
reduce the national debt. And Democrats attacked Republicans for
putting tax cuts ahead of dealing with the looming problems in
Medicare, which will start running short of money in less than a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making a budget means making choices,'' said House Speaker
Dennis Hastert. The Republican budget, he said, ``makes the right
choices for the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Thursday night, President Clinton called the
Republican plan a series of missed opportunities at a time when the
country is facing the welcome prospect of years of federal budget
surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It fails to lock in debt reduction, fails to extend the
solvency of Social Security and Medicare, and fails to protect key
investments for the American people, from Head Start to clean water
and law enforcement,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The budget resolution passed Thursday night does not become law
but serves as the blueprint for the tax and spending bills Congress
will take up in the coming months. While it gives the Republicans a
chance to emphasize what they see as their core values _ fiscal
austerity, tax cuts and smaller government _ it leaves until later
in the year the question of how to implement the spending
reductions.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the appropriations committees that set spending
levels for specific programs say it will be politically difficult
if not impossible to pass spending bills requiring sweeping
cutbacks in the State Department, the environment, the FBI, Head
Start and NASA, among other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, much of the debate in both chambers Thursday involved
pleas from members of both parties for additional spending for
farmers, veterans and other powerful constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican budget plan does not specify what types of tax
cuts Congress should enact, leaving that decision to the
tax-writing committees in the House and Senate. The budget plan
allows for a tax cut of $15 billion next year, an amount that would
increase rapidly in subsequent years as the non-Social Security
surplus grows.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leadership has backed off its pledge earlier this
year to cut income tax rates by 10 percent. Instead, Republicans
are now looking at packages that could include some rate
reductions; reductions in the so-called marriage penalty that leads
many two-income couples to pay more in taxes than if they were
single; a cut in inheritance taxes, and a reduction in capital
gains taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, where tax legislation must originate, said he would not
draw up his tax bill until this summer and had not yet decided on
its composition.
</P>
<P>
   There are relatively minor differences in the House and Senate
versions of the budget resolution. Republican aides said they
expected the differences to be worked out quickly when Congress
returns after a two-week recess in April and for the final version
of the measure to win quick approval in both chambers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest changes contained in the budget plan is a vow
to end the longstanding practice of using Social Security surpluses
to pay for spending or tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan would require that all surpluses generated
by Social Security _ $1.8 trillion over the next decade under the
assumptions used by Congress _ be used only to reduce the national
debt or to help pay for an overhaul of Social Security, including
the establishment of private investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said their plan would do more for Social Security
than Clinton's proposal, which in the first few years would allow
some of the retirement system's money to be used for spending but
would make up for it in later years. Using the Congressional Budget
Office's assumptions about the size of the surplus, the
administration's plan would wall off $1.52 trillion over 10 years
for Social Security, $275 billion less than the Republican plan.
</P>
<P>
   But White House officials argued that their plan set aside more
for Social Security and Medicare combined over the same period.
Using the budget office's assumptions, the administration's plan
would reserve $370 billion for Medicare _ bringing the total for
Social Security and Medicare over 10 years to nearly $1.9 trillion
_ while the Republican plan does not have any money explicitly set
aside for Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   In a clear sign of how reluctant lawmakers are to be seen as
dipping into Social Security money, the House rejected Clinton's
budget proposal by 426-2 because it allowed some of the Social
Security surplus to be spent over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   The House also rejected two other alternative budget proposals.
One was backed by the House Democratic leadership and the other by
a group of fiscally conservative Democrats.

BIRD-MAGIC DISTORTED IN REAR-VIEW MIRROR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ (begin ital)``The fans have poured into Salt Lake
City in record numbers and they're infected with basketball
fever.... Those who believe in Magic and those who appreciate the
beauty of a rare Bird have come to see basketball's best and
witness the crowning of a new basketball champion.... All the
superlatives have been used and all have been warranted.''(end
ital) &QL; 
_ NBC's Bryant Gumbel, during the opening of the Michigan
State-Indiana State NCAA Final telecast on March 26, 1979.
</P>
<P>
   It remains the highest-rated basketball telecast in TV history _
college or pro _ with a 24.1, seen in a then-record 18 million
homes. More than one of every three TV sets turned on at the time
were on this game.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not Super Bowl-type numbers, yet 20 years later people
still talk about Michigan State and Magic Johnson's NCAA Tournament
final against Indiana State and Larry Bird as if it were yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Although several televised hoopfests since then have had bigger
audiences _ simply because of the fact more people own more TV sets
than in '79 _ the rating shows that a higher percentage of people
then were drawn to it. And in these days of the cable-influenced
fragmented TV medium, it would take something highly unusual to
even equal it.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so it was a great matchup. A great game? Hardly. So is
revisionist history making it bigger than it really was?
</P>
<P>
   Trying to put this into context, two documentaries air this
weekend by two channels _ ESPN Classic and Fox Sports Net _ that
weren't even thought about when the event took place.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, ESPN Classic has a two-hour program at 6 p.m. featuring
much of the original broadcast from opening tip to postgame
interviews, augmented with interviews of both players, Boston Globe
writer Bob Ryan, Indiana State coach Bill Hodges, Michigan State
coach Jud Heathcote and Michigan State All-American Greg Kelser.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way Classic's ``The Story of the Game'' series
works, there's no narration to this documentary. The viewer has the
pleasure of watching it all unfold. That in itself makes this look
back so enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   But then there are quotes like these from Hodges: ``The two
became so intertwined by the electronic media that it evolved into
a showdown.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the only electronic media that really cared was
NBC, which did the weekly NCAA games and most of the tournament
after the first round _ not at all as CBS does now. Remember, most
of the media attention came from newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, on the eve of what could be Michigan State's first
visit to the NCAA Final since that game, Fox Sports Net Films has
an hour-long documentary at 9 p.m. (repeats Monday at 4 p.m. and
Tuesday at 9 p.m.) with the help of Black Canyon Productions and
Magic Johnson Entertainment called ``Magic vs. Bird: The Game That
Changed The Game.''
</P>
<P>
   The producers say this is the first time Johnson and Bird have
sat down together to look back on the game, with Chris Myers,
infected not so much with basketball fever but a case of
laryngitis, painfully croaking out the questions.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox piece brings in play-by-play man Dick Enberg and game
host Bryant Gumbel for their reflections as well.
</P>
<P>
   As for Gumbel's pre-Musburger-esque opening, he replies in the
documentary:
</P>
<P>
   ``Did we hype it? Yeah we hyped it. Did we have cause to? Yes.
When you have exceptional talent you're bringing to the floor, it's
not hype. It comes to a loftier end. It's called promotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is what Bryant's brother, Greg, will be doing for CBS on
Monday night.

and Joe Morgan to Cuba for Sunday morning's special broadcast of
the Baltimore Orioles' somewhat controversial exhibition game
against the Cuban national team _ the first time in 40 years a
major-league team has entered Fidel Castro's domain.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, Hall of Fame play-by-play man Vin Scully
will be doing what could be the Dodgers' last televised game from
Vero Beach, Fla., when the team faces the Atlanta Braves. The
Dodgers are talking of moving to Arizona next season after decades
in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   A connection between these two events: The last team to play in
Cuba was the Dodgers who, in 1959, briefly left Vero Beach because
of several days of rain in Florida and, without much attention,
hopped over to continue spring training. The Dodgers were the only
team with its own plane and owner Walter O'Malley decided it needed
the work. He flew his men to Havana, then went back to Tampa and
brought over the Cincinnati Reds as travel companions.
</P>
<P>
   Scully, who doesn't recall if he did a broadcast of that
Dodgers-Reds game or not, remembers the trip:
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really no big deal. Those were `Ozzie and Harriet'
times and I think we were all somewhat naive about Castro. In fact,
you could buy souvenir revolutionary hats and the fake beards and
glasses and have your picture taken dressed as Castro. It was all a
big lark.''
</P>
<P>
   The only scary thing Scully recalls about the trip was seeing
some soldiers with girls come into the national hotel in Havana
carrying their rifles with them as they went into the bar to start
drinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was our signal to get out of there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another interesting sidelight Scully recalls was running into a
Cuban gentleman checking into the hotel. The Cuban, to Scully's
surprise, spoke fluent English. Scully found out the man happened
to be in his 1949 graduating class at Fordham University _ and was
now working for Castro as an expert on military law.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read about the Orioles going over there, I thought, and
maybe I'm still naive, that baseball can help open some doors that
have been locked for quite some time,'' said Scully. ``But this
seems to have brought out a lot of feelings from people that we
don't quite understand. There's a lot of bitterness from people
here who lost everything there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, this will become a plus and not a minus. I do know
if I was sent there today to do a game, I'd go because it's my
job.'' &QL;

   WHAT SMOKES  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ The NHL's expansion Atlanta Thrashers hired sports-talk radio
host Scott Ferrall as its play-by-play radio announcer. He's never
done play-by-play, let alone speak in a decipherable tone of voice.
``I'll be the most bizarre announcer in the league,'' said Ferrall,
who will continue to do his sports-talk show for Westwood One
that's picked up locally on KXTA-AM (1150). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ NBC's NBA ratings. Charles Barkley can bark all he wants about
not wanting to see the Lakers on the network again, but there's no
question why it's done. NBC reports the Lakers' game against
Orlando last Sunday did a 5.1 rating and 14 share in an overnight
survey of 44 markets _ a 50 percent improvement over marks of a
regional telecast a year ago (a double OT game between Utah and New
York.) Sunday, the Lakers make their seventh NBC appearance in
eight weeks when they face the Knicks at 3:30 p.m. _ prime-time on
the East Coast. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ David Letterman to Don King , who made a surprise appearance
on ``Late Show'' Monday night: ``What are you doing here? Don't you
have a fight to fix?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Irv Kaze. Starts his eighth year at KIEV-AM (870) doing his
sports interview show. That's somethin'. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHAT CHOKES  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Just when you get comfortable with a late-night guilty
pleasure like ``Strongest Man'' competition, sumo wrestling or
Asian women billiards before the sports news, ESPN frets about the
competition. Saying it's doing it as a service to West Coast
viewers _ and trying not to lose any more of us to Fox Sports News
in the 10 p.m. hour _ ESPN will in effect start a two-hour
``SportsCenter'' at 10 p.m. beginning April 6. If you can handle
it, Rich Eisen and Stuart Scott anchor both hours. The 11
p.m.-to-midnight segment will continue to be repeated at 2 a.m.
Since Fox Sports News' growth, ESPN has added 16 hours a week of
``SportsCenter'' shows in the past two years. This better be worth
it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Dan Patrick was the guest _ not the host _ of ESPN's ``Up
Close'' on Monday. And Gary Miller actually gave what the show felt
was legit reasons for the booking. Next week: Chris Berman comes on
to talk about his childhood vaccinations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Anyone else hear the interview Lee ``Hacksaw'' Hamilton
</P>
<P>
   (not his real name) did with a Montreal broadcaster as part of
the ``Tour Around Spring Training Camps'' bit Wednesday on XTRA-AM
(690)? Twice during the interview, the broadcaster said he was
looking forward to the start of spring training in a couple of
weeks to see how the team resolves some of its question marks.
'Saw, of course, then thanked the guy ``for joining us tonight.''
He then should have thanked his producer again for not erasing the
tape.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Call it the mystery of the missing missiles.
</P>
<P>
   After two nights of raiding Yugoslavia's air defenses with
bombers and cruise missiles, NATO military commanders are facing an
ominous question. Yugoslavia has fired one, only one, of its most
fearsome anti-aircraft weapons: the lethal SAM systems inherited
from the Soviet Union. And NATO's generals don't know whether they
should worry or breathe a sigh of relief.
</P>
<P>
   Was it because the generals overrated the vaunted Yugoslav
defenses or underrated them? One thing was clear on Thursday: For a
second day, NATO warplanes and cruise missiles bombarded Yugoslav
defenses in nighttime raids. And for a second day, Belgrade barely
put up a fight. (The one missile fired, a mobile SA-6, missed.)
</P>
<P>
   From Washington to Brussels, Belgium, commanders were puzzling
over why Yugoslavia's menacing missiles were largely silent. ``We
don't know why,'' said Pentagon Kenneth Bacon, who confirmed that
NATO forces had shot down at least three MIG fighters that,
surprisingly, were sent up instead of missiles to challenge the
attack on Wednesday. On Thursday, the MIGs were grounded
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Some air force generals boasted that Yugoslavia's vaunted
Soviet-era defenses were overrated, and that the aerial assault had
blinded radars that guide the streaking missiles to their targets.
But other analysts said President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia
was waiting, hoping to lull NATO air forces into complacency and,
ultimately, a trap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't surprise me that he may be trying to protect his
SAMs,'' said Robert Osterthaler, a retired air force general and
former Pentagon official who dealt with Bosnia. ``His objective may
be to bring down one or two aircraft. That would create some real
problems for us to have Western pilots paraded through the streets
of Belgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many military and diplomatic analysts said Milosevic may
be trying to buy time by hiding his mobile missiles in forests,
hoping a prolonged air campaign splits the NATO coalition or that
Moscow intervenes with a diplomatic overture to rescue its longtime
Slavic ally.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's waiting to see what the Russians do,'' said Gen. George
Joulwan, a former supreme allied commander. ``He's trying to wait
it out.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO commanders are taking no chances with Yugoslavia's
formidable arsenal of Soviet-era SA-2, SA-3 and SA-6 missiles. Wave
after wave of NATO radar-evading warplanes, satellite-guided bombs
or unmanned cruise missiles pounded Yugoslav air defenses,
communications towers and military barracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of respect for the Serb air defense
capabilities,'' Gen. Wesley Clark, the supreme allied commander,
told reporters Thursday. ``It's a country that has long prepared
itself for war.''
</P>
<P>
   But some air force officers here said that NATO commanders were
overly consumed with caution, and missed an opportunity to send
low-flying, tank-killing U.S. A-10 or British Jaguar jets to attack
the Yugoslav armored forces that are assaulting villages in Kosovo,
sending a torrent of refugees fleeing the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``They restricted the target base over there,'' said one senior
officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``We could have gone
in this afternoon and started going after fielded forces, but we're
not going full out, as we should be.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Yet U.S. and NATO officials insist that if Milosevic does not
stop his army's rampage, the coalition will bomb Yugoslavia into
oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   Invoking unusually personal language that American commanders
have reserved for President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, Clark warned:
``President Milosevic and his military leaders should understand
that there is no sanctuary for them, their military forces, their
command-and-control elements, because they're part of the mechanism
of the Serb military and security forces and the repression.''
</P>
<P>
   But an air war of attrition may be a luxury NATO cannot afford.
After only two days of bombing, there are signs the 19-member
alliance is showing cracks. Greece and Italy suggested on Thursday
that the time might be ripe to reopen peace negotiations, and a mob
rioted outside the U.S. embassy in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Yugoslavia withstands a sustained bombing, then there will
be an erosion of support among the allies, but we not there yet,''
said one senior Western diplomat here.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is likely all a part of Milosevic's calculation.
The Yugoslav army reiterated its defiance on Thursday after a night
of airstrikes, saying the ``high morale of the units was
preserved.'' Milosevic congratulated the Yugoslav military commands
for their ``brave resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   But a crucial unanswered question here and in European capitals
is, how long will Milosevic's military commanders stand by him in
the face of escalating NATO strikes?
</P>
<P>
   ``Increasingly, as the military's capacity is degraded, there
will be possibility of military mutinies,'' said Janusz Bugajski,
the director of East European studies at the Center for Strategic
and International Studies here.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few months ago, Milosevic replaced the chief of staff of
the Yugoslav army and his secret service chief. Last week, he
replaced his military security chief with an army loyalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though evil, Milosevic is a survivalist,'' Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn., said in an interview, repeating the analysis a
senior Pentagon official gave senators Thursday in a closed
briefing.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point he's got to consider the devastation that NATO
will do to his county and that will topple him,'' Lieberman said,
reprising the Pentagon's assessment. ``And for that reason, he'll
sue for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   But Milosevic has confounded the West before, and Clark warned
of a long haul: ``We're going to grind away at him until we
accomplish the military objectives or until our political leaders
tell us to halt.''

   AVIANO AIR BASE, Italy _ Vowing ''no sanctuary'' for Serb
military forces, NATO commander Gen. Wesley Clark launched a second
punishing night of air strikes deep into Yugoslavia late Thursday,
pounding radar stations, air fields, barracks and other military
targets with scores of cruise missiles and guided bombs.
</P>
<P>
   In the southern province of Kosovo, thousands of Serb troops and
police backed by hundreds of tanks pressed their own offensive on
the ground, rolling up villages and torching homes in an unchecked
rampage that put untallied hordes of ethnic Albanians to a panicked
flight for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict spilled over Yugoslavia's boundaries, as U.S.
officials said Serb artillery was fired across the border into
Albania and angry ethnic Serbs protested the NATO bombings by
attacking the American Embassy in neighboring Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO out of Yugoslavia,'' some 2,000 protesters chanted.
Others pelted the embassy compound with stones and Molotov
cocktails, smashing windows and burning three cars, before riot
police dispersed them with tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to foment more such attacks elsewhere, Serbian Deputy
Prime Minister Vojislav Seselj called on Serbs worldwide to
''strike at American interests as best they can,'' prompting
heightened security at federal buildings in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton vowed to continue the U.S.-led NATO strikes,
however, until Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, president of
Yugoslavia, halts his bloody offensive in Kosovo and agrees to an
international peace plan, or until allied bombs crush his ability
to wage war.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Milosevic and his military leaders should understand
that there is no sanctuary for them,'' Clark, the U.S. Army general
who is the supreme allied commander for Europe, told reporters at
NATO headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to systematically and progressively attack,
disrupt, degrade, devastate,'' Serb military forces, Clark said.
Unless Milosevic capitulates, he added, ``we are going to destroy
these forces and their facilities and support.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, more than 60 warplanes -- including F-117A Stealth
fighters, F-16 Fighting Falcons and F-15 Eagles -- took off from
here in northwestern Italy, as U.S. Navy ships in the Adriatic Sea
launched at least 20 Tomahawk cruise missiles at Serb military
targets in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon was encouraged by preliminary assessments of the
opening night of raids on Wednesday. Some 40 targets were hit,
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said, and at least three
Soviet-built MiG-29 fighters, the best the Yugoslav air force has,
were shot down: two by U.S. pilots in F-15s; the other by a Dutch
pilots flying a U.S.-built F-16.
</P>
<P>
   Maintenance crews here at Aviano spent Thursday surveying the
aircraft, rearming them for the evening's sorties and scrawling
their own messages on the side of laser-guided bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have no fear,'' read one, ``B-flight is here!!!''
</P>
<P>
   But a weapons specialist, Senior Airman Perry McCiver, 30, of
San Diego, Calif., said he prayed as U.S. planes roared off toward
the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prayed for our pilots. I prayed for the Kosovars,'' said
McCiver. ``I prayed for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   His appeals seemed well-placed.
</P>
<P>
   Serb troops spent the day extending their year-long offensive in
Kosovo, where attacks on ethnic Albanians over the past year have
left more than 2,000 dead and another quarter of a million
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's escalated today,'' National Security Adviser Samuel
Berger told reporters at the White House, referring to Milosevic.
``There have been some further burning of villages, further sweep
operations, some shelling into Albania, and it's obviously very
disturbing to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger and Clark both affirmed that U.S. information on the
ground situation in Kosovo was limited by the absence of 1,400
international monitors who left Kosovo over the weekend, as NATO
air strikes loomed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another layer of information was stripped away on Thursday,
when Yugoslavia expelled all journalists from NATO countries and
severed diplomatic relations with the United States, France,
Germany and Britain, the lead nations in the continuing air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo's provincial capital, Pristina, a CNN television news
crew was jumped by a half-dozen armed thugs, who smashed equipment,
set fire to one of their cars, slapped producer Alessio Vinci
across the face and jammed an assault rifle under the nose of
correspondent Brent Sadler.
</P>
<P>
   Serb troops arrived, established order and escorted a caravan
carrying remaining Western journalists to the Macedonia border.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon asserted that the escalation of Serb attacks on the
ground could result in increasingly aggressive air strikes
targeting the troops carrying out the repression in Kosovo and
their supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are focusing on the very forces that are being used, and
assembled for use, against the Kosovar Albanians,'' Bacon told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the 2.2 million people in
Kosovo, a province in southern Serbia, one of two states that,
along with Montenegro, that make up Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic stripped Kosovo of broad political autonomy in 1989,
and ethnic tensions gradually rose. A year ago, Albanian rebels
favoring independence began guerilla attacks against Serb security
forces, which responded with a brutal crackdown targeting villages
and civilians they identified as ``terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   In the face of the escalating violence Thursday, Berger stressed
that NATO military support for the Kosovars remained confined to
air strikes. There is no plan to send ground troops into Kosovo
from the United States or any other NATO country, Berger said,
unless a peace agreement is reached between Serbs and Kosovar
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the United States pushed ahead with the largest air
campaign to hit Europe since World War II, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright insisted that Milosevic could end the onslaught
with a phone call and a will to embrace peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diplomatic channels remain open,'' said Albright, noting that
U.S. envoy Christopher Hill was standing by at the U.S. Embassy in
Macedonia. ``They know his number.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from reaching out for peace, however, Milosevic remained
defiant.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no indication that there is any change at all in
Milosevic's position,'' Albright told reporters at the State
Department. ``He has not gotten the message yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Extending a potential face-saving opportunity to Milosevic,
Berger opened the possibility of renewed negotiations with
Milosevic over the terms of an internationally-backed peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   The accord, signed last week in France by representatives of the
Kosovar Albanians but so far rejected by Milosevic, calls for
sending a NATO peacekeeping force of 28,000 troops, 4,000 of them
American, into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   While the administration has insisted that it would not end the
bombing campaign unless Milosevic agrees to the NATO peacekeeping
force, Berger appeared to suggest that other aspects of the peace
treaty might be open to discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any changes that would be made would have to be accepted by
the Kosovars,'' Berger told reporters at the White House. ``If
there were proposed changes in the agreement, that would be
something that the Kosovars would have to accept.''
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said war and diplomacy should be backed with
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed the Serbia Democratization Act, which would
strengthen existing economic sanctions against the Milosevic
regime, boost humanitarian aid for his victims and promote
democratic opposition to replace his government.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for Mr. Milosevic's future, I don't care one way or the
other if he lives out his days in sunny Cyprus or if he will agree
to step aside and make way for democracy in Serbia,'' Helms said in
a speech on the Senate floor. ``The important thing is that he be
removed from power, whether voluntarily or not, and now.''

THE RANGERS' DREARY SEASON IS BRIGHTENED BY NEDVED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ In a disappointing season, with playoff
hopes fading, it is easy to overlook improvements and positive
changes on a team like the New York Rangers. Although they are in
danger of missing the tournament for the second consecutive season,
their biggest upgrade has been the addition of Petr Nedved, who
scored his 20th goal in a 2-1 victory over the Florida Panthers on
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Nedved's game-winner was a classic of his style: a rising wrist
shot from the right-wing circle, on the power play, that beat
goalie Sean Burke high on the glove side the way an arrow from a
bow might find a spot on a target.
</P>
<P>
   ``One heck of a shot,'' said Rangers coach John Muckler. ``He
threaded the eye of a needle.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Rangers' last 19 games, their front-line center has 10
goals and 10 assists. He plays more minutes than any other forward,
he takes hits in heavy traffic to make plays, and he seems to get
better with extra work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Petr's having a lot of fun,'' Muckler said. ``He's
really enjoying himself. He likes to play a lot. He thrives on it.
He's our face-off guy in our end zone. He takes every important
face-off. He's on the power play. He kills penalties. He's doing it
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Nedved also assisted when Adam Graves scored the first goal of
the victory, which moved the Rangers 1 point ahead of the Panthers
for ninth place. Going into Thursday night's games, the Rangers are
still 5 points behind Boston, which holds the eighth and final
playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Panthers, Nedved won 24 of 28 draws. ``I don't think
I've won that many in any game before,'' Nedved said, seeming
surprised at his success. ``It was one of those nights.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Muckler's assertion about his enjoyment level, Nedved
agreed. ``For sure,'' he said. ``The key, personally, for me is
when I have fun, most of the time, I play well and I'm having fun
and I'm playing lots.''
</P>
<P>
   Nedved, who also has 27 assists, missed last season in a
contract dispute with Pittsburgh, playing in Europe and in the
minor leagues. He came to the Rangers in a trade with the Penguins
along with defenseman Chris Tamer, who has earned a regular role on
the blue line.
</P>
<P>
   Also coming to the Rangers was Sean Pronger, who is no longer
with the team. In exchange, the Rangers sent Aleksei Kovalev, Harry
York and a substantial sum of money. Kovalev has 19 goals and 28
assists. It appears to be a trade that has helped both teams.
</P>
<P>
   SLAP SHOTS:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Rangers stayed in Florida for a day off Thursday with no
practice. They will travel to Philadelphia on Friday and practice
there in preparation for Saturday afternoon's game with the Flyers,
the last of a three-game road trip.
</P>
<P>
   _ John Muckler was amused that defenseman Rumun Ndur jousted
with Florida's Peter Worrell while play continued in Wednesday's
victory. ``Rumun's into the game,'' Muckler said. ``Standing at
center ice, he wants to start a fight with a three-on-two going the
other way.'' Had the Panthers scored, the coach might not have been
as amused.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season, after 72 games, the Rangers were 22-33-17 for 61
points. This season, they are 30-32-10 for 70 points.
</P>
<P>
   _ Defenseman Brian Leetch, showing signs of fatigue, has not
scored in 20 games and has 3 goals in his last 46 games and 9 for
the season.

   AVIANO AIR BASE, Italy _ Vowing ''no sanctuary'' for Serb
military forces, NATO commander Gen. Wesley Clark launched a second
punishing night of air strikes deep into Yugoslavia late Thursday,
pounding radar stations, air fields, barracks and other military
targets with scores of cruise missiles and guided bombs.
</P>
<P>
   In the southern province of Kosovo, thousands of Serb troops and
police backed by hundreds of tanks pressed their own offensive on
the ground, rolling up villages and torching homes in an unchecked
rampage that put untallied hordes of ethnic Albanians to a panicked
flight for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict spilled over Yugoslavia's boundaries, as U.S.
officials said Serb artillery was fired across the border into
Albania and angry ethnic Serbs protested the NATO bombings by
attacking the American Embassy in neighboring Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO out of Yugoslavia,'' some 2,000 protesters chanted.
Others pelted the embassy compound with stones and Molotov
cocktails, smashing windows and burning three cars, before riot
police dispersed them with tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to foment more such attacks elsewhere, Serbian Deputy
Prime Minister Vojislav Seselj called on Serbs worldwide to
''strike at American interests as best they can,'' prompting
heightened security at federal buildings in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton vowed to continue the U.S.-led NATO strikes,
however, until Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, president of
Yugoslavia, halts his bloody offensive in Kosovo and agrees to an
international peace plan, or until allied bombs crush his ability
to wage war.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Milosevic and his military leaders should understand
that there is no sanctuary for them,'' Clark, the U.S. Army general
who is the supreme allied commander for Europe, told reporters at
NATO headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to systematically and progressively attack,
disrupt, degrade, devastate,'' Serb military forces, Clark said.
Unless Milosevic capitulates, he added, ``we are going to destroy
these forces and their facilities and support.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, more than 60 warplanes -- including F-117A Stealth
fighters, F-16 Fighting Falcons and F-15 Eagles -- took off from
here in northwestern Italy, as U.S. Navy ships in the Adriatic Sea
launched at least 20 Tomahawk cruise missiles at Serb military
targets in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon was encouraged by preliminary assessments of the
opening night of raids on Wednesday. Some 40 targets were hit,
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said, and at least three
Soviet-built MiG-29 fighters, the best the Yugoslav air force has,
were shot down: two by U.S. pilots in F-15s; the other by a Dutch
pilots flying a U.S.-built F-16.
</P>
<P>
   Maintenance crews here at Aviano spent Thursday surveying the
aircraft, rearming them for the evening's sorties and scrawling
their own messages on the side of laser-guided bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have no fear,'' read one, ``B-flight is here!!!''
</P>
<P>
   But a weapons specialist, Senior Airman Perry McCiver, 30, of
San Diego, Calif., said he prayed as U.S. planes roared off toward
the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prayed for our pilots. I prayed for the Kosovars,'' said
McCiver. ``I prayed for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   His appeals seemed well-placed.
</P>
<P>
   Serb troops spent the day extending their year-long offensive in
Kosovo, where attacks on ethnic Albanians over the past year have
left more than 2,000 dead and another quarter of a million
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's escalated today,'' National Security Adviser Samuel
Berger told reporters at the White House, referring to Milosevic.
``There have been some further burning of villages, further sweep
operations, some shelling into Albania, and it's obviously very
disturbing to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger and Clark both affirmed that U.S. information on the
ground situation in Kosovo was limited by the absence of 1,400
international monitors who left Kosovo over the weekend, as NATO
air strikes loomed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another layer of information was stripped away on Thursday,
when Yugoslavia expelled all journalists from NATO countries and
severed diplomatic relations with the United States, France,
Germany and Britain, the lead nations in the continuing air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo's provincial capital, Pristina, a CNN television news
crew was jumped by a half-dozen armed thugs, who smashed equipment,
set fire to one of their cars, slapped producer Alessio Vinci
across the face and jammed an assault rifle under the nose of
correspondent Brent Sadler.
</P>
<P>
   Serb troops arrived, established order and escorted a caravan
carrying remaining Western journalists to the Macedonia border.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon asserted that the escalation of Serb attacks on the
ground could result in increasingly aggressive air strikes
targeting the troops carrying out the repression in Kosovo and
their supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are focusing on the very forces that are being used, and
assembled for use, against the Kosovar Albanians,'' Bacon told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the 2.2 million people in
Kosovo, a province in southern Serbia, one of two states that,
along with Montenegro, that make up Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic stripped Kosovo of broad political autonomy in 1989,
and ethnic tensions gradually rose. A year ago, Albanian rebels
favoring independence began guerilla attacks against Serb security
forces, which responded with a brutal crackdown targeting villages
and civilians they identified as ``terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   In the face of the escalating violence Thursday, Berger stressed
that NATO military support for the Kosovars remained confined to
air strikes. There is no plan to send ground troops into Kosovo
from the United States or any other NATO country, Berger said,
unless a peace agreement is reached between Serbs and Kosovar
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the United States pushed ahead with the largest air
campaign to hit Europe since World War II, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright insisted that Milosevic could end the onslaught
with a phone call and a will to embrace peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diplomatic channels remain open,'' said Albright, noting that
U.S. envoy Christopher Hill was standing by at the U.S. Embassy in
Macedonia. ``They know his number.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from reaching out for peace, however, Milosevic remained
defiant.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no indication that there is any change at all in
Milosevic's position,'' Albright told reporters at the State
Department. ``He has not gotten the message yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Extending a potential face-saving opportunity to Milosevic,
Berger opened the possibility of renewed negotiations with
Milosevic over the terms of an internationally-backed peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   The accord, signed last week in France by representatives of the
Kosovar Albanians but so far rejected by Milosevic, calls for
sending a NATO peacekeeping force of 28,000 troops, 4,000 of them
American, into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   While the administration has insisted that it would not end the
bombing campaign unless Milosevic agrees to the NATO peacekeeping
force, Berger appeared to suggest that other aspects of the peace
treaty might be open to discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any changes that would be made would have to be accepted by
the Kosovars,'' Berger told reporters at the White House. ``If
there were proposed changes in the agreement, that would be
something that the Kosovars would have to accept.''
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said war and diplomacy should be backed with
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed the Serbia Democratization Act, which would
strengthen existing economic sanctions against the Milosevic
regime, boost humanitarian aid for his victims and promote
democratic opposition to replace his government.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for Mr. Milosevic's future, I don't care one way or the
other if he lives out his days in sunny Cyprus or if he will agree
to step aside and make way for democracy in Serbia,'' Helms said in
a speech on the Senate floor. ``The important thing is that he be
removed from power, whether voluntarily or not, and now.''

SCIENTISTS TELL OF CAPTURING IMAGES OF GAMMA-RAY BURSTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mich.)   (rk) 
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thousands of times more energetic than ordinary exploding stars,
their visible light as bright as a million galaxies, gamma-ray
bursts are the most violent events in the universe, and radiation
from one of these events reaches the vicinity of Earth at a rate of
about one a day.
</P>
<P>
   Yet not until last January were astronomers able to capture the
first images in visible light of a gamma-ray burst in progress.
Now, the first results from the observations are being reported in
the journals Science and Nature and are being described in
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The findings include surprises and new clues, but still no
solution to one of the most vexing mysteries in astrophysics: What
is causing the cataclysmic events that produce these explosive
flashes?
</P>
<P>
   ``For most phenomena, quasars, supernovas or black holes, maybe
we have some notion of what they are,'' said Carl W. Akerlof, a
University of Michigan astrophysicist and an author of one of the
reports in Nature. ``A gamma-ray burst is the most mysterious thing
about which we still have so little information.''
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers recently learned that these bursts originated at
extragalactic distances, but they were surprised by how far away
was the source of this burst. In Friday's issue of Science, a team
led by Michael Andersen of the Nordic Optical Telescope in the
Canary Islands reported that an analysis of the visible light
showed that its source had a ``red shift'' of at least 1.6, the
equivalent to a distance of some nine billion light-years, or
two-thirds of the way across the universe.
</P>
<P>
   The farther away a cosmic object is, the greater its light is
shifted toward the red end of the spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were stunned,'' George Djorgovski, an astrophysicist at the
California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, said in a
statement. ``This was much further than we expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything that distant and also that luminous must be the result
of an explosion of unimaginable power. Other Caltech astronomers
said the event of Jan. 23, designated GRB 990123, was 10 times more
luminous than the brightest gamma-ray burst seen so far.
</P>
<P>
   This seemed to confirm earlier descriptions of the bursts as the
biggest explosion ever seen, second only to the Big Bang at the
theorized birth of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   This made it even harder to conceive of an explosion that would
have such power. ``If the gamma rays were emitted equally in all
directions,'' Djorgovski said of the events, ``their energy would
correspond to 10,000 times the energy emitted by our sun over its
entire lifetime so far, which is about five billion years. Yet the
burst lasted only a few tens of seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Gamma-ray bursts have been known for three decades, but only in
recent years have spacecraft sensitive to gamma radiation been
studying them closely. Gamma rays do not penetrate Earth's
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   A systematic hunt for them began in 1991 with the launching of
the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory by the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the Italian-Dutch satellite BeppoSAX made it
possible to pinpoint the position of the bursts so that other
telescopes could quickly join in the observations.
</P>
<P>
   The power estimates of the bursts have until now been based on
an assumption that the energy is being emitted in equal intensity
in all directions, but some of the new findings cast doubt on that
assumption.
</P>
<P>
   Two observing teams, one led by Shrinivas Kulkarni of Caltech
and the other by Alberto Castro-Firado of the National Institute of
Astrophysics in Madrid, found evidence that the energy from the
burst was not being uniformly distributed but concentrated in a
beam. If correct, this would reduce power estimates of the bursts
to more imaginable, but still mind-boggling levels.
</P>
<P>
   Another team, led by Jens Hjorth of the University of
Copenhagen, reported observations suggesting that the radiation
burst had not passed through the magnetic field that would have
been associated with a fireball sending out energy in all
directions. They took this as possibly indirect evidence of beamed
radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Akerlof of Michigan said that observations of the active
nuclei of some galaxies showed that nature does things like
beaming. The observations have revealed jets of high-energy matter
being ejected from the events. But scientists said it was too soon
to tell.
</P>
<P>
   As for what causes the bursts, the new findings have not changed
the possible explanations. One is that the bursts are the
consequence of a sudden collapse of a massive star into a rapidly
spinning black hole, which is a center of exceedingly powerful
gravity. Other possibilities include a collision between two
neutron stars orbiting each other or a collision of a neutron star
and a black hole. Neutron stars are the extremely dense remnants of
exploded stars.

 &HT;    Florida nears school vouchers
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Some parents love it. Many teachers hate it.
Academics can't seem to agree on whether or not it works.
</P>
<P>
   But Florida's Republican-dominated government is poised to adopt
the nation's first statewide program of school vouchers, which
would allow parents to use tax dollars to send their children to
private schools.
</P>
<P>
   In a mostly partisan vote, the Florida House approved a limited
voucher program Thursday in a 71-49 vote. Seven Republicans voted
against the plan, and six Democrats voted for it. The proposal
still must be considered by the Senate, where resistance is
expected to be stronger. However, Republicans also dominate the
Senate, 25-15.
</P>
<P>
   The voucher proposal, which would apply only to students at a
few underperforming schools at first, has sparked a whirlwind of
debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This levels the playing field,'' said state Rep. Alex Diaz de
la Portilla (R-Miami), who is shepherding Gov. Jeb Bush's bill
through the Legislature's lower chamber. ``It gives inner-city kids
_ African-American and Hispanic kids _ the opportunity for the same
education that privileged children from the suburbs get.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, say critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``School vouchers are wrong, wrong, wrong,'' said Democratic
Rep. Lois Frankel of West Palm Beach. ``They propose taking kids
from the poorest-performing schools in the state and washing our
hands of them. We're basically giving up on those kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has made vouchers _ which he calls ``opportunity
scholarships'' _ the top priority of his young administration.
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, only the cities of Milwaukee and Cleveland
have adopted voucher programs, although support for vouchers has
appeared in a number of states, including Mississippi, Louisiana
and Texas, where Bush's brother, George W. Bush, is governor. In
Texas, a Senate committee on Wednesday endorsed a bill that would
create a voucher pilot program.
</P>
<P>
   A number of private foundations have also set up voucher
scholarship programs that allow kids from poor backgrounds in
cities such as New York and Miami to attend pricey private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Bush made vouchers a centerpiece of his campaign last fall, even
though polls run by his opponents in the state teachers union
showed a majority of Floridians are wary of letting public money
fund private classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   David Clark, spokesman for Florida Teaching Profession, a
National Education Association affiliate, argues that the program
will draw revenues out of already underfunded public schools.
</P>
<P>
   But Diaz de la Portilla counters, ``We're not taking money away
from the public schools. What we're doing is issuing them a
challenge: If you educate these children adequately, we will not
have any children leaving with opportunity scholarships.'' In its
first year, the program would apply only to four Florida schools
that are classified as ``failing'' under the state's current school
evaluation system. But that system is being tightened next year,
and officials say 169 schools would soon be rated as ``failing'' if
they don't make significant improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Students at the failing schools would be able to withdraw,
taking an estimated $4,000 in tax dollars with them to any school
they choose.
</P>
<P>
   Critics point out that the program as currently proposed has
almost no checks in place to assure parents that the private
schools they might choose are any better than the failing public
schools they want their children to escape. Bush's plan is opposed
by the leading Florida teachers group, the state PTA, the NAACP and
several other groups, including People for the American Way and the
American Civil Liberties Union, both of which have vowed to
challenge it in court.
</P>
<P>
   In Milwaukee, the first major school district in the country to
experiment with vouchers, the program has been in place for nearly
a decade. After starting with a handful of students, it has
mushroomed into a $28 million endeavor with 6,200 students getting
vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Follow-up studies on the students shifting from public to
private schools have been inconclusive, with some studies claiming
significant improvement but others showing little.
</P>
<P>
   There have also been unforeseen consequences. Originally aimed
at helping low-income children who couldn't afford to escape bad
schools, the program is now paying tuition for 2,250 students who
were already enrolled in private schools. Those problems _ along
with questions about the constitutionality of giving public money
to private schools with religious affiliations _ convince critics
that vouchers are a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his allies, however, remain convinced the program will
be a lifesaver for ambitious kids stuck in bad schools, as well as
a powerful incentive for bad schools to improve.
</P>
<P>
   Bush points out that the scholarships are only one part of a
massive education reform initiative he is proposing, which includes
tougher standards for kids, schools and teachers, a longer
mandatory school year and some $600 million in new state spending
on schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to be exciting,'' Bush told reporters as he
unveiled his plan earlier this year. ``The education debate, if
it's done with civility, offers the chance for this state to lead
the nation.

 &HT;    Diggin' his inner `Ed'
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Sucking a cigarette, scrunched into an executive
chair with his bootie-clad feet propped on a conference table,
Matthew McConaughey looks to be fighting the Hollywood glamour
thang with East Texas gusto. Smoke wafts in the air, mingling with
the decorum he's thrown to the wind.
</P>
<P>
   McConaughey, who grew up in Longview, doesn't rise to shake
hands with two strangers who enter the room, and he speaks in such
a guttural mumble that a tape recorder only picks up a fraction of
his words. The actor has just landed in Austin via Los Angeles, so
his weathered leather coat, Longhorns T-shirt and pajama-like pants
are excused. (But what's with the booties?)
</P>
<P>
   None of this matters much. McConaughey's celebrity assets shine
through the civilian smoke screen. He can't erase the clean
symmetry of his matinee idol mug, can't diminish the klieg-light
pearlies (that will take a few more smokes). His dimples are doing
their dimply thing, and are his cough drop-blue eyes really
twinkling?
</P>
<P>
   McConaughey, 29, was in Austin on March 17 for the Texas
premiere of ``EDtv'' at the Paramount Theatre as part of the South
by Southwest Film Festival. He plays Ed in the Ron Howard comedy, a
fresh and funny probe of our ravenous celebrity culture and the
pitfalls of fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ron did something really special with it,'' McConaughey says.
``It's fun and you get a little message about calling yourself on
your own B.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Superficial similarities to last year's ``The Truman Show''
abound, but ``EDtv'' orbits a more accessible, less portentous
universe. It's a mainstream romp in which an East Texan named Ed
gets his own TV show that requires cameras to follow his every move
24 hours a day. Unlike Truman in ``The Truman Show,'' Ed is a
willing participant in the mass exposure. He relishes it _ for a
while.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Texas graduate, who got his break in 1993 in
Richard Linklater's ``Dazed and Confused,'' resides in Austin when
not working on far-flung projects. He took a break from the Italian
shoot of the World War II submarine drama ``U-571'' to be in the
United States for ``EDtv'' premieres in L.A. and Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more than glad to be in Austin, man,'' he says. ``I love
it here. I love the people. I sleep well at night. There's a
wonderful pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a place where you can find people who hang on to the
right things and traditions, yet they're modern and progressive
enough to take on new things that work. They allow you to come in
and be whoever you want to be, as long as you're on the good guys'
side. There's a lot of leverage with that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``EDtv,'' McConaughey plays up his rural, party-boy roots,
grinning energetically and loafing in a minimum-wage job to pay for
the night's Budweiser ration. Ed, he says, is a welcome respite
from heavy roles like the righteous lawyer in ``Amistad'' and the
theologian in ``Contact.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a time for everything,'' he says. ``I was ready to go
to a weekend character. This is the lighter side of things. You
know, my research was my Friday and Saturday nights with my
friends, having a good time, and all of a sudden laughing at
something and writing down what we laughed at and going, `What if
that's Ed's sense of humor?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed and I are both optimists and we both love life. That was
the spirit I got to bring to Ed.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard wasn't quite convinced of McConaughey's capacity for
comedy until his teen-age daughter, who's googly about Matthew,
urged him to watch ``Dazed and Confused.'' He was sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of what I thought was appealing about Matthew, and where
a lot of the charisma was coming from, was his sort of loose,
natural, earthy charm and sense of humor,'' says Howard, who also
was in Austin for the ``EDtv'' premiere. ``He's not a comic, but I
didn't want this to be a vehicle for a stand-up comedian.''
</P>
<P>
   McConaughey and Howard saw parallels between Ed's overnight rise
to fame and the actor's meteoric boost following his role in ``A
Time to Kill.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened so fast,'' McConaughey recalls. ``I didn't meet
strangers after that. Everybody tried to put their two cents in.
You get advice for what you oughta do and say because you're on the
cover of a magazine. Everybody seems to know you, but you don't
know them. Any time you get that thing called fame, it's a crazy
situation _ wonderful, frustrating, wow, and what the hell is going
on? There's no way to prepare for it.''
</P>
<P>
   McConaughey is enjoying his lap on the fast track. And he's
expanding. Like several young stars, from Sandra Bullock to Alicia
Silverstone, the actor has parlayed his position into a production
company _ j.k. livin', which is short for ``just keep livin','' a
line he says in ``Dazed and Confused.''
</P>
<P>
   The company executive-produced S.R. Bindler's hit documentary
``Hands on a Hard Body'' and is developing projects for Warner
Bros. and Howard's Imagine Entertainment. McConaughey has also
written, produced, directed and stars in the 20-minute comic short
``The Rebel,'' which he hopes will play at film festivals.
</P>
<P>
   His ambition has led McConaughey to roles that some have deemed
outsized for the young performer. Though critics lauded his serious
portrayal as a lawyer in ``A Time to Kill,'' he took critical hits
for his turns in ``Amistad'' and ``Contact.'' Those stung, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would I rather do those films and get wonderful reviews across
the board? Sure I would. But I understand now that you can't please
everybody. There were certain people who agreed with what I did
with the parts and I'm more interested in what they're thinking
than the ones who disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it doesn't last that long. I don't think about it for more
than 10 seconds. I think about it and go, `Is there something I can
get from it?' Sometimes people give good, constructive criticism
and I can go, `That's a good point. I could have done that better.'
I try to take that in. You can't please all the people all the
time. You can only keep going and please yourself. And I'm pleased
with myself.''

 &HT;    `Mod Squad' flunks the retro test
 &HT;    By Alison Macor
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The first shot in ``The Mod Squad'' is a title
card explaining the definition of the word ``mod.''
</P>
<P>
   It is never a good sign when an action movie feels the need to
stake out its semantic territory.
</P>
<P>
   Capitalizing on the cyclical nature of fashion and trends,
director Scott Silver (``Johns'') attempts to upgrade the old
television series ``The Mod Squad'' for a '90s audience. Silver
assembles three of the hottest young actors working today, puts
them in a movie with a strong supporting cast and punishes them all
with horrendous dialogue and the most mundane of action plots.
</P>
<P>
   For five years in the late '60s and early '70s, the Aaron
Spelling-produced series brought us hip dialogue, trendy fashions
and Peggy Lipton. Part of what made the hour-long drama so
watchable was its visual style and youthful vibe. ``The Mod Squad''
introduced millions of suburban kids like myself to the underbelly
of Los Angeles (sanitized for television) through its three
principals who worked as an undercover unit for the LAPD in
exchange for clean criminal records.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie version, Silver keeps the basic premise and
constructs a flimsy storyline that attempts to flesh out the
individual characters while solving a case that involves police
corruption and drug trafficking. As narratives go, this script
isn't the worst ever written. But lines such as ``For starters,
we've got to find that guy with the leather pants'' don't lend a
whole lot of legitimacy to the movie or the characters who speak
the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Claire Danes plays Julie, the role originated by the enigmatic
Lipton. Danes, like her co-star Omar Epps (``Scream 2''), does her
best to infuse some life into the character. Mimicking Lipton's
low-key delivery, Danes brings a touch more humor and compassion to
the role. As Linc, the partner of few words originally played by
Clarence Williams III (who makes a cameo), Epps isn't given a whole
lot to do. As characters, however, he and Danes definitely
represent the cool members of the trio.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is Giovanni Ribisi, who plays their partner Pete
Cochran. Ribisi wins the Dustin Hoffman ``I'm Still in Character
From My Last Film'' award for his ability to channel his mentally
challenged character from ``The Other Sister.'' Perhaps we're
supposed to think that Pete hasn't kicked his drug habit quite yet,
but the effect is disconcerting and inexplicably comic.
</P>
<P>
   On a brighter note, cinematographer Ellen Kuras (``I Shot Andy
Warhol,'' ``Unzipped'') re-creates the visual flourishes common to
'70s television shows, right down to the obligatory slow-motion
shot of the trio rounding a street corner. With film stock and
postproduction visual effects, Kuras captures well the grainy,
hard-edged look of the original program.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Silver's ``The Mod Squad'' is not stylish enough
to be retro nor reflexive enough to work as camp. What we're left
with is a hollow, 90-minute advertisement for the film's
alternative-rock soundtrack and trendy wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting too old for this (expletive),'' Julie says toward
the end of the film, and her comment is meant to be ironic. But the
truth is, we're all a little too old for it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. _ Putting a coda on the Cold War, a flatbed
truck prepared to rumble Thursday night from this ``atomic city,''
the birthplace of nuclear weapons, carrying an inaugural shipment
for the world's first deep underground nuclear waste depository.
</P>
<P>
   After $2 billion and 25 years of environmental studies,
political protests and legal challenges, the depository outside
Carlsbad, 256 miles southeast of here, is to receive its first
waste shipment on Friday morning. On Monday, a federal judge in
Washington allowed the plant to receive this first shipment of
nuclear waste, although a state permit is still pending for later
shipments of waste mixed with hazardous chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Transported in huge stainless steel containers, the barrels of
plutonium waste are to be placed in chambers carved from an ancient
salt bed, nearly half a mile below ground. Geologists say the thick
deposit of salt has been stable for 250 million years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won the Cold War by building nuclear weapons, but we have
not cleaned up the legacy of the Cold War and its waste,'' Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson, a former congressman from northern New
Mexico, said Thursday. ``The opening of this facility is a step to
meeting this obligation.''
</P>
<P>
   The underground dump, which was ready to take shipments a decade
ago, has been designed to receive nuclear waste and radioactively
contaminated materials from 23 military sites across the nation.
Today, 61 million people, or about a quarter of the nation's
population, live within 50 miles of a military nuclear waste
storage site. After a decade of depositing waste at Carlsbad, in
what is called the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, the number of
people living near sites with military nuclear waste would be
reduced to 4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a cleanup job around the country that is being held up
by an absence of a disposal site,'' Mary Anne Sullivan, the Energy
Department's general counsel, said Thursday from Washington.
Defending the department's decision to move Thursday, she said,
``It costs us $300,000 a day to maintain that facility ready to
operate.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 35 years, barring successful court challenges,
almost 40,000 truckloads of waste will be taken to the plant from
across the country. The underground maze of 55 man-made storage
chambers at Carlsbad has the capacity to store 6 million cubic feet
of waste, roughly half of the military's projected needs.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Energy Department has authorized the plant to
receive waste from the Los Alamos National Laboratory, the Idaho
National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, and the Rocky
Flats, a former nuclear trigger factory near Denver. At Rocky
Flats, the pace of cleanup so outstripped storage space that the
Energy Department proposed earlier this month that reinforced tents
be erected on Colorado's eastern plains to temporarily house waste
barrels.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Carlsbad nuclear storage site was proposed in
1974, New Mexico has been split between opponents and proponents.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say it is a folly to lock up dangerous waste simply
because the technology does not exist today to render it harmless.
They say the $2 billion spent on the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant,
or WIPP, has become a justification for following through with it.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally in Santa Fe Thursday, protesters waved anti-WIPP
signs as they waited for the truck, which was expected to travel
under heavy police escort down a highway bypass especially
constructed last year for nuclear waste removal. Opponents argue
that the waste should not be trucked around the country, but stored
in local, above-ground facilities that would allow for retrieval of
nuclear waste at later dates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may find in 50 years, if the technologies are developed,
that this waste is a resource,'' said Joni Arends, a director of a
Santa Fe group, Concerned Citizens for Nuclear Safety. Referring to
the salt caverns in Carlsbad, she said, ``Once the barrels
collapse, it is too hazardous for anyone to go down there and get
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Largely contaminated with plutonium, the waste for the most part
consists of protective clothing, laboratory tools and equipment,
and soils and sludges from earlier disposal efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also say that accidents are bound to happen as nuclear
convoys from as far away as California and Ohio converge on
Carlsbad, a small city of 27,000 in the Chihuahua Desert.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Department officials reply that the shipments will take
place at night, when traffic is light, and will be tracked by
satellite. Underscoring their promise to move waste only when
weather permits, they said that fog on roads forced them to delay
the first shipment, which had been planned for early Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   By moving the waste from surface storage sites around big
cities, the Energy Department eases nuclear nightmare scenarios _
an earthquake in Los Angeles, or a plane crash in Denver. At
Carlsbad, the waste will be stored almost half a mile below a site
that has only 113,000 people living within 50 miles.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Energy Department, the transport containers for
the waste barrels have passed a series of grueling tests: dropping
30 feet onto a concrete pad, being submitted to jet fuel flames at
temperatures greater than 1,475 degrees Fahrenheit, and falling on
a steel spike to test puncture resistance.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But vowing to continue to fight the waste plant in court,
plaintiffs have a hearing scheduled on May 3 before the Circuit
Court of Appeals in Washington, arguing that the state can only
grant a permit to a new disposal site if it is empty. Although the
plant was ready to take waste a decade ago, critics say the Energy
Department is jumping the gun this week because the New Mexico
Environment Department is still evaluating the application for an
operating permit.
</P>
<P>
   ``WIPP is a hazardous waste facility, and a hazardous waste
facility cannot operate without a permit,'' said Don Hancock, a
lawyer for one plaintiff, the Southwest Research and Information
Center. ``The DOE is breaking the law. Because they are operating
without a permit, we expect that the courts are going to require
them to ship the waste from WIPP back to Los Alamos.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the state Environment Department, the major
oversight agency for the waste plant, are angry that the federal
government decided to go ahead with disposal without waiting for
the final permit, which is expected to be issued this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to caution DOE that these pre-permit shipments are
probably not in the best interest as they are risking years and
probably hundreds of thousands of dollars in litigation,'' Nathan
Wade, the department's spokesman, said Thursday, referring to legal
challenges by citizens groups.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gary Johnson of New Mexico, a Republican and a political
rival of Richardson, noted in a statement on Wednesday that ``New
Mexico has been under unbelievable pressure to simply step aside
and let DOE open WIPP.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the ``nuclear West,'' politicians are fighting to
keep nuclear waste repositories out of their backyards.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in Utah, Gov. Michael Leavitt signed legislation that
stripped state liability protection from power companies that want
to store high-level radioactive waste in a commercial disposal
facility on an Indian reservation 50 miles west of Salt Lake City.
Earlier, the governor seized control of all roads leading to the
site.
</P>
<P>
   In Nevada Wednesday, Gov. Kenny Guinn joined other politicians
from the state in opposing a repository for nuclear power plant
waste at Yucca Mountain. In a statement before the Energy and
Natural Resources Committee of the U.S. Senate, Guinn said that,
from 1976 to 1996, there had been more than 620 significant
earthquakes within a 50-mile radius of the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   In New Mexico, perhaps in recognition of the finality of the
Energy Department's action, Johnson tried to make the best of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never before has a deep geologic repository for the disposal
of radioactive wastes commenced operations anywhere in the world,''
the governor said. ``Now that the court has ruled, the light is
finally green to go.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   About a dozen historians and Balkan specialists consulted
Thursday said that President Clinton's use of history in justifying
the decision to bomb Serbia to the American people was imprecise
and misleading.
</P>
<P>
   The scholars, most of whom said they approved of the decision
itself, were unhappy with the speech's allusions to World Wars I
and II, the most destructive conflicts of modern history, to
explain what is, after all, limited U.S. military involvement in a
limited conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have trouble equating Bosnia or Kosovo with World War I and
II,'' said Bruce Russett, a professor of international relations at
Yale University. ``He is overstating the stakes. World War II
brings to mind the landing at Normandy. He clearly doesn't want to
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Many specialists were also struck by Clinton's assertion in his
Wednesday speech that, earlier in this decade, ``many people
believed nothing could be done to end the bloodshed in Bosnia.''
They said the president and his aides were among those people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed,'' remarked Raymond Tanter, professor of
political science at the University of Michigan. ``President
Clinton was of the mind that because of ancient hatreds it was not
possible to do much about the situation in Bosnia. He now has moved
away from that position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an irony that the president doesn't include himself in
the camp of those who were part of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanter and others acknowledged, however, that the task of
explaining U.S. military involvement in Serbia was unenviably
complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton has a very difficult job in persuading the
American people that this is a necessary risk to take,'' said Fritz
Stern, professor emeritus of history and former provost of Columbia
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been honest in saying that it is a risk. And he has
been defending it in part by historical explanation to a public
that is increasingly unhistorical. I don't criticize him for that.
But as the past itself has shown, any effort at facile historical
analogy may do us more harm than good.''
</P>
<P>
   The president began his speech by asserting that the United
States was acting ``to protect thousands of innocent people in
Kosovo from a mounting military offensive,'' to which no expert
queried had any objection.
</P>
<P>
   Their uneasiness set in when he added that the United States
needed ``to defuse a powder keg at the heart of Europe that has
exploded twice before in this century with catastrophic results.''
</P>
<P>
   The feeling was compounded when Clinton said of Kosovo, ``All
the ingredients for a major war are there,'' and added: ``Sarajevo,
the capital of neighboring Bosnia, is where World War I began.
World War II and the Holocaust engulfed this region.''
</P>
<P>
   The historians said that there was nothing factually inaccurate
in those words but that they found their implications troubling.
Clinton seemed to be suggesting, they said, that, when left alone,
the Balkans explode. Yet, historically, it has been foreign
involvement that has escalated conflicts in this region.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situations really don't seem analogous to me,'' remarked
John Lewis Gaddis, a historian at Yale, comparing the current
conflict in Kosovo and the two World Wars. ``In both of the earlier
situations, the problems were created by involvement of great
powers _ Austria-Hungary and Nazi Germany. This time it is not
violence from a great power but from a small power that fears
becoming smaller. And by taking this step we have alienated a great
power _ Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the problem is that we are talking about a very
limited military response,'' he said. ``To draw a link with the
origins of two world wars is a great oversimplification of
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernd Fischer, a professor of history at Indiana University,
Fort Wayne, said he was also troubled that in describing the recent
deterioration of the situation in Kosovo, Clinton did not mention
the formation early last year of the Kosovo Liberation Army. That
is the ethnic Albanian guerrilla group that has carried out attacks
against the forces led by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president spoke only about peaceful resistance by the
Kosovars, but some elements of Kosovo gave up the notion of
peaceful resistance, and Slobodan Milosevic's serious acts of
repression began in conjunction with the work of the KLA,'' Fischer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Ullman, a professor of international affairs at
Princeton, said Clinton had explained U.S. military involvement to
the public in two ways. First, the president said the conflict in
Kosovo was in danger of spreading dangerously into a wider war, an
argument Ullman did not find very convincing. Second, Clinton spoke
of American moral revulsion, which Ullman accepted but acknowledged
to be the more difficult point to make to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans might reasonably say that, deplorable though the
Serb behavior in Kosovo has been, we can't go around the world
fixing these situations, and so the Albanians have to make peace
with the Serbs any way they can,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nonetheless, I wish the president had emphasized the need to
stop the repression. In 1999, we have come far enough to regard
that sort of behavior as reprehensible, and the sending of Western
armed forces to protect the abused people of Kosovo is an
appropriate response.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of the scholars speculated as to why Clinton had agreed
to use military force now, whereas in previous conflicts in the
region he had hesitated. Some thought him more comfortable with the
military now; others suggested that he had finally accepted that
there could be no other approach with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   David Phillips, a professor of preventive diplomacy at Columbia,
said that he believed Clinton simply had seen the situation for
what it was, a moral outrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The policy today is motivated by a clear sense of right and
wrong,'' he said. ``Early in the administration, there was not the
same level of experience navigating complicated foreign policy
interests. Today, at the end of the second administration, the
moral compass prevails.''

taking a sip. A simple remark would double them over in laughter,
tears rolling down their cheeks. It might be comical if it weren't
so serious. Bradford believes she was exposed to toxic fumes,
damaging her health and her cognitive abilities.

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ After a night of heavy explosions and
fires, this city was strangely calm early Thursday. Serbs seemed at
ease, if angry at the NATO bombing; Albanians were anxious, even
terrified of what was to come.
</P>
<P>
   Black smoke rose from buildings burning on the southwestern edge
of the city, one of the main casualties of the night. Another plume
of smoke rose from the ridge on the eastern edge of Pristina, the
Kosovo capital.
</P>
<P>
   Though Serbs said that much of the damage and fires around the
city had been caused by NATO missiles, it was the ethnic Albanians
who bore the brunt of the violence Wednesday, as Serbian forces
apparently used the NATO attacks as a pretext to go out overnight
and wreak still more havoc.
</P>
<P>
   By about 2:30 Thursday afternoon the order came that foreign
journalists belonging to all NATO countries should leave Serbia,
and about 20 men, recognized by journalists as the kind of
hard-core paramilitary Serb forces who became notorious in Bosnia
for the atrocities of ``ethnic cleansing,'' began to harass
journalists and force them leave, smashing equipment and setting
fire to an armored vehicle used by CNN.
</P>
<P>
   As the journalists departed, and with the NATO bombing already
begun, a deepening sense of fear took hold in Pristina that the
Serbs would now vent their their rage against ethnic Albanian
civilians in retaliation, a threat the Serbs themselves had issued
often in the past.
</P>
<P>
   If the first night of the bombing was any measure, they may be
good their word.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, in one of two barracks within the city untouched by
the NATO strikes, near the Serb settlement of Kosovo Polje,
soldiers lounged in the sun on the top of a tank, looking out over
the fence on to the main road.
</P>
<P>
   Barely 50 yards from them, on the other side of an intersection,
the door had been forced open to the small plant of the ethnic
Albanian newspaper, Kosova Sot, which was closed down by the
Serbian authorities eight days ago after a court decision found the
paper guilty of ``running an editorial policy that was against the
Serbian regime.''
</P>
<P>
   The roof of the building was partially smashed and burned, the
debris lying among the big printing presses. Outside in the
courtyard stacks of newspapers on pallets were still burning. Bent
and broken metal printing plates lay on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby a long, low building that had housed private businesses _
a car repair shop and a plastics production laboratory _ smoldered.
Its whitewashed brick walls and a blue sign that read ``Autoservis
Dinor'' were still standing, but its roof had collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   NATO missiles, aiming at the barracks, had missed and instead
hit the car repair shop, said Radovan Urosevac, a Serb, though the
targets of the NATO bombing lay beyond Pristina, at the airport to
the south and barracks outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were targeting the airport, and they missed it,'' said
Urosevac, a director of the Serbian Media Center in Pristina, which
is closely connected to the Serbian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They targeted the army base in Kosovo Polje and the hit the
Peugot car repair place,'' he added. ``I believe they were aiming
at a power plant and hit a surface coal pit, 15 kilometers from
Pristina.''
</P>
<P>
   While it was hard to tell what had caused the fire, it had begun
about midnight, not with an explosion but from a small pinpoint
glow, that could be seen growing rapidly into a major
conflagration. At the site, there was no crater from a missile
visible and no pieces of missile casing.

 PRISTINA: missile casing. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those were not the only fires. In Kosovo Polje, a predominantly
Serb area, two Albanian cafes had been burned down, and half a
dozen shops bore broken windows, bullet holes clearly showing in
some of them. Armed Serb civilians stood around in the street,
watching the cars and passersby.
</P>
<P>
   In downtown Pristina, glass and debris from two powerful
explosions were spread across the main street. The Guri bar and
pizzeria, and a private medical clinic, both run by ethnic
Albanians, were blown apart by bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Glass, metal blinds, and plaster had flown 10 yards across the
street from the force of the blasts. They were not the first
attacks on ethnic Albanian enterprises in the city but certainly
the most devastating materially. There were no reported casualties
since the explosions happened late at night and the buildings were
empty.
</P>
<P>
   While it is impossible to say who the culprits were, there were
numerous cars and military jeeps driving through the blacked-out
city late into the night. They crossed close to the barracks on the
south edge of the city and passed back and forth by the Defense
Ministry building on the main street.
</P>
<P>
   With the large police and army presence checking the roads and
main intersections, the complete freedom of movement enjoyed by the
bombers, would suggest they had connections with the security
forces.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian prime minister of Kosovo, Zoran Andjelkovic, invited
foreign journalists to have breakfast with him at the central
government building in Pristina, and warned that ``those staying
here they must behave in accordance with the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   After waiters dispensed fizzy drinks, Andjelkovic arrived to
make a brief statement. ``As far as NATO thinks it can establish
peace and order with rockets, the rockets will continue,'' he said.
``Those wishing to support peace in Kosovo, I wish you luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Within two hours the authorities served a notice on all foreign
journalists from NATO countries to leave Serbia. At the same time,
some 20 armed men, in heavy boots and civilian clothes, with
buzzcuts and carrying automatic weapons mounted with silencers,
invaded the lobby of the Grand Hotel in central Pristina where most
of the foreigners were based.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the group, some lean and wiry with lined faces
and the hard stares of men familiar with brutality, had been
largely responsible for harassment of foreign journalists the
previous night as the airstrikes began.
</P>
<P>
   Openly looking for trouble, they started smashing television
gear of camera crews and set fire to a television crew's armored
vehicle. Andjelkovic arrived just in time to steady the spiraling
panic, and arranged for the remaining journalists to be escorted
out. They confiscated several cars and mobile phones as well.
</P>
<P>
   Before Thursday, there were reports that two deputies to the
notorious Serbian paramilitary leader, Zeljko Raznjatovic, known as
Arkan, had entered Pristina. It was Arkan's men who took part in
some of the worst massacres of the conflict in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians here were visibly upset at the departure of the
journalists, fearing that Serb forces and paramilitary units would
then have a free hand to carry out atrocities unobserved by
Westerners.
</P>
<P>
   The journalists left in about a dozen cars for the hour-long
ride to border. Along the way, Serb army columns passed coming from
the other direction, including troop trucks and armored vehicles
with mounted machine guns, apparently moving men and equipment into
Pristina, where they would presumably avoid NATO airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   After journalists had been forced out of the city, Pristina was
reported to be quiet Thursday evening, although there were reports
that the police and armed paramilitaries had begun house-to-house
searches. Residents were bracing not only for the next wave of
bombing, but for the chaos and bloodletting that Serbian police and
civilians alike have been promising.
</P>
<P>
   As journalists departed and passed through southern Kosovo, the
border towns of Kacanik and General Jankovic, were deserted. Two
houses were on fire close to the border, but otherwise the place
was eerily quiet.

BIRDIE TEBBETTS, 86, PLAIN SPEAKER WITH 53-YEAR BASEBALL CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Vt., N.H., Ohio, Mass., Mich., Fla.)   (bl)  
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   George ``Birdie'' Tebbetts, a bright, pragmatic baseball man
whose major league career encompassed 14 years as a catcher, 11 as
a manager and 28 as a scout, died March 24 in Sunrise
Rehabilitation Center in Bradenton, Fla. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Tebbetts played for the Detroit Tigers (1936-47, minus three
years in the Army), the Boston Red Sox (1947-50) and the Cleveland
Indians (1951-52). In 1,162 games, Tebbetts, a right-handed batter,
hit .270 and made four All-Star teams.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't afraid to speak his mind. During the 1950 season,
Tebbetts said that some of his Red Sox teammates were ``moronic
malcontents'' and ``juvenile delinquents.'' After that season, he
was traded.
</P>
<P>
   He scouted for the Cincinnati Reds and filed such no-nonsense
reports as this on a promising pitcher: ``Major league stuff and a
great arm. Screwy in the head. Eliminate head and I recommend him.
Get good surgeon.''
</P>
<P>
   Reds general manager Gabe Paul liked Tebbetts' directness so
much that he made him the manager. As manager of the Reds
(1954-58), the Milwaukee Braves (1961-62) and the Cleveland Indians
(1963-66), Tebbetts compiled a 749-705 record. A heart attack in
1965 hastened the end of his managing career, and from 1968 to 1994
he scouted for several major league teams.
</P>
<P>
   He regarded himself as an ordinary player and manager who worked
hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``There ought to be a second-string or Junior Hall of Fame for
guys like me,'' he once said. ``I had a lifetime average of .270
and I'm proud of it. I poured my life's blood into it. I clawed and
scrambled and fought and hustled to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole world is wrapped up in baseball,'' he said, ``and
that means I must live the loneliest of lives. I can't discuss my
problems with my friends or the newspapermen or the players or the
coaches or my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, the former Mary Hartnett, understood. One winter night
during his days as a manager, the usually talkative Tebbetts was
silent as he stared into the glowing fireplace of his home in
Nashua, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   ``What inning are you playing now, dear?'' his wife said.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, the Tebbetts family moved to Anna Maria,
Fla., near Bradenton.
</P>
<P>
   Tebbetts is survived by three daughters, Susan Mitchell of
Jacksonville, Fla.; Betty Deluca of Peachtree City, Ga., and
Patricia Kirton of Port Orange, Fla.; a son, George Jr. of
Bradenton, Fla.; five grandchildren and a sister, Kathryn Tebbetts,
of Nashua, N.H. His wife died in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   George Robert Tebbetts was born Nov. 10, 1912, in Burlington,
Vt. He was raised in Nashua, N.H., and he acquired his nickname as
a boy when an aunt said of his high-pitched voice, ``He chirps like
a bird.'' He graduated from Providence College in 1934 with a
degree in philosophy, an unusual start for one of baseball's most
abrasive bench hecklers.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, he dismissed the theory that catching was
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the physical part of catching is what it's
cracked up to be,'' he said. ``I think it's an easy job. The only
thing about it is you sweat more than anybody else. Most catchers
catch because they can't play anyplace else. They don't have much
to complain about. They've got to be happy. There are too many
catchers who are not good catchers who are showboating too much so
that they can keep their job.''
</P>
<P>
   He also offered his version of what makes a baseball manager
successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my players like me,'' he said, ``it's an accident of
personality. I happen to like my players and I treat them like men.
If a manager doesn't have confidence in his ballplayers, even when
they're going badly, they're not going to have confidence in
themselves. And when a ballplayer's confidence is gone, you haven't
got a ballplayer. If you want to be a good manager, get good
ballplayers.''

RUSSIANS ATTACKS US EMBASSY AS ANTI-WESTERN FEELING HEATS UP
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In a day of growing tensions and anti-American
sentiment, angry demonstrators hurled bottles, eggs, and paint at
the US Embassy here Thursday, and Russian leaders condemned NATO
airstrikes against Yugoslavia as proof of Washington's desire for
world domination.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris N. Yeltsin and other senior officials talked
tough but, keenly aware of their country's need for financial aid
from the West, avoided making direct threats of military help for
Yugoslavia that would further isolate Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said to expect a rise in the anti-Western mood here as
young men signed up to oppose NATO forces alongside the Serbs, who
are Orthodox Slavs like most Russians. Volunteers signed up at
protests held outside the US Embassy in Moscow and US consulates in
St. Petersburg and Vladivostok.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, who on Wednesday night suspended Moscow's relations
with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Thursday called the
airstrikes ``a crude mistake of American policy.'' He indicated the
Kremlin had considered using force, but, despite pressure from the
pro-Communist majority in Parliament, had decided not to retaliate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia has a number of extreme measures in store, but we
decided not to use them so far,'' Yeltsin said in his Kremlin
office. ``Morally, we are above America.''
</P>
<P>
   Gennady Seleznyov, the Communist speaker of the State Duma, said
in Colombia that Russia would unilaterally pull out of a United
Nations embargo and begin supplying Yugoslavia with weapons, such
as advanced S-300 anti-aircraft missiles, and technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
   But Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who still hopes to win
billions of dollars in loans from the International Monetary Fund
and plans to meet IMF Executive Director Michel Camdessus in Moscow
on Sunday, was more circumspect.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Russia might lift the arms embargo, Primakov told a
television interviewer: ``I would not rule out anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have different responses at our disposal. Regarding
military potential, our country is second to no one,'' Primakov
said, in an allusion to Russia's 7,000 nuclear weapons. ``But we
aren't taking those steps.''
</P>
<P>
   He also told Russian television that Moscow would maintain ties
with the West, continue market overhaul and not seek a policy of
isolation. As proof, Russia's Foreign Ministry Thursday said Moscow
had signed bilateral agreements on energy, trade, and security with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yevgeny Maksimovich (Primakov) knows perfectly well that
cutting oneself off from the West . . . will first of all hurt
Russia,'' commented the daily Moskovsky Komsomolets.
</P>
<P>
   But commentators nonetheless said to expect a downturn in
US-Russia relations, as politicians here take advantage of
disenchantment with the West and hurt pride over the way Moscow,
once a superpower to be reckoned with, is now ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run, (the NATO bombings) will mean further changes
in the domestic political climate in Russia, a growth of
anti-Americanism and anti-Western moods,'' said analyst Yekaterina
Stepanova of the Carnegie-Moscow Center. ``This is more important
than any measures that are taken now.''
</P>
<P>
   A glimpse of what that could mean was offered outside the US
Embassy. Crowds there burned a US flag, shouted anti-American
slogans, and threw paint and beer bottles at the embassy building,
shattering several windows and covering part of the wall with
multicolored splats. Riot police kept the protesters from rushing
to the entrance of the building and detained anyone caught throwing
bottles, but, in a departure from their usual practice, let the
unsanctioned rally go on all day and into the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serbia, Serbia, Yankee go home,'' cried the crowd. ``America
is a pisspot. Russia will be victorious.''
</P>
<P>
   Riot police broke up the demonstration Thursday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   People in cars going by honked their horns and gestured their
approval to the crowd, which never got much smaller than 1,000
protesters as new protesters replaced those who had drifted away.
Soldiers in a police transport truck waved happily to the crowd, as
a riot police lieutenant grinned in approval. Some of the
demonstrators were the usual pensioners waving red flags often seen
at Moscow street protests, but many appeared to be college
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are against NATO's bombardment because we believe in
democratic ideals and a nation's right to self-determination,''
said Vitaly, a math student at Moscow State University. ``The
United States is violating that by leading the bombardment of a
sovereign state.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov voiced a similar sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever reasons American strategists offer to justify their
actions, their true aims are clear _ to impose the political,
military, and economic dictatorship of the United States,'' Ivanov
said.

MORGAN STANLEY REPORTS EXPLOSIVE EARNINGS GROWTH FOR QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Most Wall Street firms are enjoying the robust
profits that come hand-in-hand with a strong stock market, but
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter is enjoying the ride more than most.
</P>
<P>
   The securities firm blew past estimates of how much it would
earn in its fiscal first quarter, reporting that operating profits
increased half again over those for the comparable period of 1997.
That profit growth, rare for any established finance company, is
three to four times the pace that rivals Goldman, Sachs and Lehman
Brothers reported earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The profit growth helps solidify Morgan Stanley's status as the
earnings leader among securities firms, coming after a year in
which it breezed through stormy markets that caused several
competitors to post big losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are just knocking the cover off the ball,'' said Joan
Solotar, who follows Morgan Stanley at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette. ``The results appear to be strong across the board, with
records in quite a few areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Net profits from operations were $1.04 billion for the
three-month period ending Feb. 28, the firm reported. That was up
from a not-too-shabby $690 million in the the same period of 1997.
Earnings per fully diluted share increased to $1.76 from $1.10,
three times as fast as consensus estimates of Wall Street analysts.
Investors poured money in Morgan Stanley shares Thursday, pushing
the stock price up 5.59 percent to an all-time high closing price
of $103.875.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan's return on equity, one way to judge its profitability,
rose to 29 percent in the first quarter from 20 percent a year ago.
Other big Wall Street firms consider 20 percent as exceptionally
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect that anyone else will beat that number,'' Ms.
Solotar said of Morgan's return on equity figure. But she added,
``I doubt it's sustainable at that level for more than a quarter or
two.''
</P>
<P>
   Tempering analysts' enthusiasm for the performance was the sense
that a hefty chunk of Morgan's profit growth came from trading,
which, to put it mildly, does not always produce a steady earnings
stream. Record revenue from trading stocks, bonds, commodities and
foreign exchange led a 55 percent gain in operating profits at
Morgan's securities division, its largest.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's fiscal first quarter included the month of December,
when markets staged a rapid recovery from the turmoil that followed
Russia's financial collapse. That suggests that Morgan benefited
from what would appear to be a one-time rebound in securities
prices, especially bonds.
</P>
<P>
   But every other Wall Street firm had the potential to benefit
from the same rebound, and many did not ride as high on the wave.
One reason: Morgan did not panic when bond prices plunged in the
fall. Analysts said the firm had a smaller bond inventory relative
to its capital than Goldman or another top rival, Merrill Lynch &AMP;
Co. And Morgan did not sell as much of its inventory when prices
were sinking.
</P>
<P>
   So, when the bond market recovered, Morgan benefited more from
the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a hypothesis, but it has some logic to it,'' said
Robert Scott, Morgan's chief financial officer. ``It's fair to say
that our trading benefited from a much healthier environment than
we had in the quarter before.''
</P>
<P>
   He stressed, however, that trading gains were widespread _ not
just in the volatile bond market. Moreover, Morgan posted profit
growth in the final period of last year, when Goldman and Merrill
saw earnings fall, meaning that it did not suffer
disproportionately then only to recover more strongly now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can explain away the result by saying it was
just a rebound after a bad period,'' he said. ``We did better than
everyone else in the fourth quarter as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Some outside analysts agreed. ``You had a combination of lots of
good things, not just a rebound in fixed income,'' said Richard
Strauss of Goldman. ``They are being driven by great results in
investment banking as well as trading.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many other parts of Morgan's securities business posted
gains, if not as sharp as trading. Revenues from underwriting new
securities issues and advising companies on mergers and
acquisitions gained a healthy 20 percent to $957 million, a record.
Commissions earned on securities transactions for customers grew to
$655 million, up 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan's market share in those key businesses seems to be on the
rise. It ranked No. 1 in stock underwriting for the first two
months of the year, one of the most lucrative Wall Street
businesses. It also earned record fees from its merger and
acquisitions business.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's merchant banking operation contributed heavily to its
bottom line for the quarter, with investment gains of $194 million
compared with $59 million a year ago. This was largely because it
sold part of its stake in Equant NV, a data communications company.
</P>
<P>
   The other major legs of Morgan's financial stool, money
management and credit cards, posted steady gains. Net revenue from
asset management rose 23 percent, to $712 million, with profits
from that division growing at twice that pace to hit $147 million.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan's credit card business _ the firm backs the Discover card
_ grew at a slower rate, with revenue increasing 16 percent and
profits up 36 percent, in part from a one-time asset sale.

STRAWBERRY GETS A LOOK IN LEFT FIELD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore., Texas, Mich., Calif. )   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKELAND, Fla. _ Darryl Strawberry has caught hundreds of
thousands of fly balls in his lifetime, from his days at Crenshaw
High School in Los Angeles to his nights at Shea Stadium and Yankee
Stadium. Yet Thursday night, perhaps a dozen Yankees' evaluators,
including the owner George Steinbrenner, closely watched his
pursuit of every ball hit his way.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, 37, started in left field against Detroit, his first
appearance in the outfield of the spring, his first action in the
field since his treatment for colon cancer last fall. Strawberry
did not get a real chance in the first inning, moving in to pick up
a bloop hit, but the real action came when Steinbrenner and those
in the Yankee dugout screamed loudly at Durwood Merrill, the plate
umpire, drawing the ump's rebuke.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry is trying to prove he is ready to be part of the
Yankees' opening-day roster, and to that end, the interim manager,
Don Zimmer, said Strawberry already has proved he can hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can still swing the bat, there's no doubt about that,''
Zimmer said. ``He's still got power, there's no doubt about that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees already have a designated hitter, Chili Davis,
who is having a great spring, and three left fielders, in Shane
Spencer, Chad Curtis and Ricky Ledee.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry's best chance for making the Yankees, seemingly a
slim chance at that, is if he shows he can be adequate in left
field and hit better than Ledee, who has had a disappointing spring
training.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Cardenal, the Yankees' first-base and outfield coach, has
been hitting fungoes to Strawberry in the last few days. ``He
doesn't look any different than he has the last couple of years,''
Cardenal said. ``Whatever is hit to him, he's going to catch.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Strawberry looks good going after fly balls, Cardenal
said, ``and another day, he probably doesn't feel too good.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardenal is astounded that Strawberry even has a chance to come
back following his treatment last fall. ``When I saw him at the
parade after the World Series,'' Cardenal said, ``I almost cried.
To see a big dude like him, and then to see him after the surgery
moving so slowly and so thin. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, that's the same old Straw. He's amazing. To come from a
cancer operation like he has, you have to give him some credit.''
</P>
<P>
   A significant hurdle remains even if Strawberry shows he can
play the outfield. Strawberry is to be paid $2.5 million this
season, and if the Yankees add him to their roster, the majors will
assess them $833,333. Whether that keeps Strawberry off the team
remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Two Left-Handed Relievers Try Out
</P>
<P>
   Since trading Graeme Lloyd in the deal for Roger Clemens, the
Yankees have sought left-handed relievers. One arrived Thursday _
Trevor Wilson, formerly of the Anaheim Angels and San Francisco
Giants _ and another will arrive Friday, Tony Fossas. The Yankees
signed Fossas, 41, to a minor league contract, but he has no desire
to pitch in the minors. He will try out for the Yankees over the
last 10 days of spring training, and if he is good enough, the
Yankees will keep him, at a salary of $410,000.
</P>
<P>
   Fossas began spring training with the Texas Rangers but was
released Wednesday. Doug Melvin, the Rangers' general manager, told
Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, that Fossas is still
good enough to be a specialist against left-handed batters but that
the Rangers needed a reliever who could throw a couple of innings
at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, 32, threw in the bullpen Thursday for the first time,
little more than a week after the Giants cut him. Some scouts
believe Wilson has lost arm speed and can't be effective, but
Wilson said that he felt great and was excited about pitching with
the Yankees. When Wilson was released, it never occurred to him
that the Yankees might have an opening. ``It surprised me,'' Wilson
said. ``I didn't think they needed anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson has a connection with Scott Brosius, the Yankees' third
baseman: when they were high school players in Oregon, Wilson
crushed a home run off Brosius. ``A bomb,'' said Brosius, a former
pitcher for the Rex Putnam Kingsmen, who carries a distinct mental
image of the pitch he threw _ ``fastball'' _ and where it landed.
Wilson played for the Oregon City Pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   Another left-hander, Andy Pettitte, threw 32 pitches in batting
practice, the first time he has faced hitters of any kind since
straining his elbow March 7. Pettitte probably will begin the year
on the disabled list, because the Yankees will not require a fifth
starter until April 17. Until then, Roger Clemens, Orlando
Hernandez, Hideki Irabu and Roger Clemens will take all the starts,
with a liberal sprinkling of off days.

H.V. GRAHAM, 82, LED GUARD IN INTEGRATION AT UNIVERSITY OF
ALABAMA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., N.J. )   By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Henry V. Graham, the National Guard general who told Gov. George
Wallace to step aside and allow the first black students to enter a
University of Alabama building in 1963, died on Sunday at a nursing
home in Birmingham, Ala. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will always be known as the man who stood Governor Wallace
down at the school house door,'' said E. Culpepper Clark, the dean
of the School of Communications and Information Sciences at the
University of Alabama who wrote ``The School House Door:
Segregation's Last Stand at the University of Alabama'' (Oxford
University Press, 1993).
</P>
<P>
   Square-jawed, silver-haired and soft-spoken, Graham had highly
visible roles in two other episodes when the National Guard had to
provide protection or enforcement during the civil rights movement
of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, Graham escorted a group of besieged Freedom Riders from
Montgomery to the Mississippi state line. As recounted in ``Parting
the Waters,'' by Taylor Branch (Simon &AMP; Schuster 1988), Graham told
the Freedom Riders: ``This may be a hazardous journey. We have
taken every precaution to protect you. And I sincerely wish you all
a safe journey.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Graham and a group of guardsmen escorted
voting-rights marchers from Selma to Montgomery, a few weeks after
many of them had been tear-gassed and clubbed in Selma in what
became known as Bloody Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But Graham's most famous moment came on June 11, 1963, when
Wallace stood in a doorway at Foster Auditorium on the Alabama
campus in Tuscaloosa and refused to allow Nicholas Katzenbach, an
assistant U.S. attorney general, and two black students, James Hood
and Vivian Malone, to enter.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, Graham, wearing green battle attire,
approached Wallace in front of the doorway. He then stood at
attention and told him that it was his ``sad duty'' to order him to
step aside, which the governor did after making a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Both encounters that day, Clark said, had been scripted,
although Graham did not know until 45 minutes before he approached
the governor whether physical force would be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the real drama,'' Clark said. ``The Guard had even
practiced how they would have to remove him.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said that Graham was selected by the Kennedy
administration for this duty because of ``the potentially volatile
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Graham was a very cool man under fire, and he could be counted
on,'' he said. ``They passed over two men above him in rank,
largely because one of them had a relationship with Wallace and the
other they did not feel they could trust not to put a match to the
keg.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark added that Graham, who at the time sold real estate in
Birmingham, put himself at risk financially, as his very public
actions while serving as a guardsman invited retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a man of considerable courage,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a Birmingham Post Herald editorial said of Graham:
``While the state's political leaders stirred up the passions of
the mob _ either not realizing or not caring about the harm that
would result _ Graham stood true to his oath to abide by the
Constitution and the law. He carried out his duties and
responsibilities even as top elected officials avoided them.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his sons, Steven Graham, said that during the 1960s his
father rarely talked about his involvement keeping the peace during
the civil rights movement. ``In later years, though, he looked back
on it as a painful process that the region had to go through to
bring it into the 20th century,'' Steven Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   Graham was born on May 7, 1916, in Birmingham. He worked in
several jobs as a young man, including one as a bill collector for
the Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co., and another at a local bank. In the
mid-1950s he began selling real estate and started his own company,
Graham &AMP; Co., in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   His career with the National Guard started in 1934, when he was
18 years old. By the time he retired in 1970, he had attained the
rank of major general. He also served in the U. S. Army in World
War II and the Korean War, earning a Legion of Merit, the Bronze
Star with Oak Leaf Cluster and the Bronze Arrowhead for his role in
the D-Day invasion of France.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his son Steven, Graham is survived by his wife, Jane, of
Birmingham; another son, H. Michael, of Birmingham; two daughters,
Dede Elliott, of Talladega, Ala., and Ann Zauber, of South Orange,
N.J., and eight grandchildren.

dawn Thursday after the world's biggest military alliance went from
being a defensive organization to one capable of attacking a
country that defies the alliance's political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Just a week shy of its 50th anniversary, NATO's mission was
dramatically reshaped when its ships and planes launched cruise
missiles and bombs to punish Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's defiance of Western demands to end the fighting in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Literally overnight, the perception of NATO changed, too, and
the alliance's foot soldiers here were among the first to feel the
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death to NATO!'' an enraged Serbian man shouted in English
Thursday as several thousand people surrounded the US Embassy in
Skopje, hurling epithets and rocks. Their anger seemed directed at
Americans as much as at NATO. One man carried a sign that said, in
Serbian, ``NATO equals AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   What began as a crowd of a few dozen on Thursday afternoon
mushroomed to thousands by nightfall. Some tore down the
wrought-iron fence around the grounds. The Macedonian authorities
appeared to be caught off guard, calling in riot police only after
the crowd had swelled and had begun throwing rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Later, a US Embassy spokesman, Philip Reeker, described the
crowd as ``the usual embassy protest.'' A few hours later, as the
mob outside bayed for blood, Reeker said NATO troops were being
called in to rescue the embassy staff, which had huddled in the
basement during the assault.
</P>
<P>
   At least one protester got onto the grounds and, according to a
local police officer, used a Molotov cocktail to set a car on fire
in the parking lot. All the embassy's reinforced windows were
shattered.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic mix in Macedonia means that the thousands of ethnic
Albanian refugees who have streamed across the border from Kosovo
in recent days are assured a welcome from the estimated 500,000 of
their ethnic counterparts who make their homes here. But there is
also a sizable Serbian community and a deep reservoir of sympathy
for the Serbs among Macedonians, who share their Slavic identity.
That point was made loudly and forcefully Thursday by those who
trashed the US Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Serb sympathizers stoned a NATO vehicle,
causing minor injuries to two soldiers, said Major Jan Joosten, a
NATO officer.
</P>
<P>
   Joosten, who is Dutch, spent much of the last week assuring
Macedonians that NATO was not planning to use their country as a
launching pad for attacks against Serbs dug in across the border in
Kosovo. But, he added, ``We have the right of self-defense in
accordance with international law and will exercise that right if
required.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the new reality unsettled NATO soldiers, they were not
showing it as they went about the day-to-day work of soldiering,
digging in along the Macedonia-Kosovo border within shooting
distance of Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   In Petrovac, about 15 miles outside Skopje, British, French,
Italian, Dutch and, for the first time since World War II, German
soldiers prepared for a potential Serb retaliatory attack on the
NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Wayne Hennessy-Barrett, of the King's Own Border
Regiment of the British Army, downplayed suggestions that NATO's
essence had changed overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not here to invade Kosovo,'' he said, surveying a large
field near the military airstrip at Petrovac. ``We're here to
implement a peace agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Hennessy-Barrett, wearing a helmet and body armor that he said
was a standard precaution, said the local population had been
mostly friendly, and he did not expect that to change.
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed the stoning of the NATO vehicle, saying, ``We get
stoned in England. That doesn't mean anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hennessy-Barrett turned deadly serious when asked how he
felt about Serb reports of civilians being killed in the NATO
airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's distasteful,'' he said. ``It's extremely sad. We don't go
into this hype and jingoism when people are being killed. We're
soldiers, but we have wives and kids. There is nothing remotely
cool or glamorous about war. Any professional soldier will tell you
that. But we didn't start this conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Captain Nigel Francis-McGann, a British officer, rejected the
assertion that NATO's bombing amounted to offensive actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like what they say in American football, the best offense
is a good defense,'' he said of the airstrikes. ``I see what we're
doing as defensive. You can say what we're doing has killed people.
I know, and all these soldiers here know, that what we're doing is
going to save the lives of thousands of people. There are no easy
choices here.''
</P>
<P>
   As he peered out toward the border where Serb forces are dug in,
Corporal Darren Szymanski of the King's Own Border Regiment, manned
a laser range finder that can locate instantaneously any artillery
fired by the Serbs. Szymanski, 24, said the Serbs would be
foolhardy to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's highly unlikely they'll attack us, but if they
do, we're ready,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Szymanski said there was no reaction among the soldiers who
watched television with him Wednesday night as Yugoslav authorities
reported that 10 Serb civilians had been killed in the initial
bombing raids. Neither was there any great debate among the grunts
about the changing role of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been expecting it,'' he said of the airstrikes.
``Otherwise, we'd be here for no reason.''
</P>
<P>
   On the border, Yugoslav troops could be seen walking on the
ridge of a mountain, in silhouette, as the sun went down.
Presumably, they are there for a reason, too.

CLASH OF CULTURES, PRIDE AND PASSION WHEN CUBA PLAYS UNITED
STATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ The 16-year-old boy in a New York Yankees cap lingered
outside the field at the Provincial Academy of Baseball here,
watching quietly with intense eyes as older players went through
batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, Geovani Poei, has attended special baseball schools
since he was 7, and this summer he will face a grueling tryout for
a slot at the academy, another rung on the long ladder toward the
Cuban national team. He already thinks and talks like a
professional ballplayer _ he is quick, for instance, to say he was
rated the fourth-best shortstop for his age in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But if Poei embodies the government's aggressive Soviet-era
program to cultivate young talent, he is also emblematic of the
Cuban people's stubborn love for baseball, a passion that seems to
transcend politics.
</P>
<P>
   Poei said he worships major league players in the United States,
even though his only contact with professional baseball has been
through the newspapers or when he got to watch a bootleg tape of a
playoff game that a friend smuggled into the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see them with my own eyes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday he just might, for the Baltimore Orioles are coming to
Havana's Latinoamericano Stadium to play an exhibition game against
a team of Cuban all-stars.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the Cuban Revolution isolated this
nation of baseball lovers from the United States 40 years ago,
players at all levels and their fans are anticipating a game many
think will at last test Cuba's baseball prowess against some of the
best players in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long time the Cubans have been waiting for this game,''
said Rafael Borges, 70, a retired musician. ``Because we like
quality baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite decades of hostile relations between Fidel Castro's
Communist government and the United States, Sunday's exhibition
game has failed to stir up much nationalist sentiment here.
Instead, it has tapped feelings that many Cubans say run deeper
through their culture than Marxist ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Most Cubans, after all, consider baseball to be their national
sport, a game entwined in history with their struggle for
independence from Spain and the birth of their nation. Nearly
everyone here plays baseball starting at a young age, and talking
about the game is considered almost a patriotic duty.
</P>
<P>
   Through years of economic hardship and political repression, it
always has been a source of solace that the Cuban national team
dominated baseball in the Olympics and in other international
amateur tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, however, baseball has engendered other feelings
of jealousy and uncertainty as several top players have defected to
the United States to make fortunes on professional teams there _
Orlando Hernandez of the Yankees and Rey Ordonez of the Mets, for
example. And for the first time, the Cuban national team, its
strength sapped by defectors and the loss of other players who have
gone to play in Japan and elsewhere, has faltered in some recent
international competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, the game against the Orioles _ the
government has announced that the 55,000 expected to attend the
game, including some young players, will be by formal invitation
only _ has set off fierce debates among fans, who gather each
afternoon on street corners, in cafes and under the tall trees in
the Central Parque to argue over the intricacies of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   A constant theme runs through the talk: No matter how well
Cubans have fared against amateurs, the best players here have
never had a chance to compete against the professionals in the
United States, thus leaving many Cuban baseball lovers frustrated
and wondering just how good their players are.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of talent here but it's not developed or
matured,'' said Ariel Almeares, 31, a tour guide. ``The Cubans need
to compete against better teams to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   On the streets of Havana, it is not hard to see why Cubans are
among the best players in the world. Children use almost every
empty space to play the game _ empty streets, public monuments,
parking lots. Most use homemade bats and balls created from scratch
with a bit of cork or stone wrapped with medical tape. Only a few
have gloves.
</P>
<P>
   But even in the lowliest sandlot games, the level of play is
impressive. Watching a group of boys who gathered on a recent
afternoon to play a pickup game in Antonio Maceo Park, beneath a
massive monument to a revolutionary hero, nearly all the boys had
smooth, level swings and could make fluid, accurate throws on the
run. Even the younger children knew how to turn double plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in our blood,'' Alexander Fajardo, 14, said. ``It's the
national sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Very few of the stars on the top teams in Cuba, however, come up
from the streets. Soon after Castro abolished professional sports
in 1961, the Cuban government instituted a Soviet-style system of
academies for children with athletic ability intended to cultivate
Olympic athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Grade school teachers and coaches spot children with baseball
talent early and begin to channel the most talented at the age of 7
up through a series of academies where they receive intense sports
training for half the day and study regular subjects in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   By the time players finally reach the age of 22, they have
either been eliminated or they have earned a spot on what is known
as the national series, the Cuban equivalent of the major leagues.
Each province has a team on that level drawn from its geographical
area, supplied with talented athletes trained in the academies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talent develops because they have the Soviet system,''
said Roberto Gonzalez Echevarria, a Yale professor who recently
published ``Pride of Havana: A History of Cuban Baseball.'' ``It's
a kind of funnel of success that leads to the major teams and the
national team.''
</P>
<P>
   Though they are called amateurs, the players at the national
level are professionals for all intents and purposes. They receive
salaries for no-show jobs as physical therapists. The stars among
them also receive cars, nice apartments and other benefits as gifts
from a grateful state. Most important, however, they are treated
like royalty by the population.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't pay them for this,'' said Juan Brito, 46, a taxi
driver, ``but they don't work for anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   For some veterans who have reached the top of the Cuban system,
the game with the Orioles promises to be a bittersweet exercise in
what might have been if the political climate were different.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to meet with a team of this quality to test
ourselves,'' said the Industriales second-baseman, Juan Padilla,
33, who hit .322 this year. ``They have great players. But here we
also have great players.''
</P>
<P>
   The players on the Havana Industriales in recent years have seen
their colleagues defect to the United States and become
millionaires in the big leagues, while they continue to earn less
than $20 a month. Both Hernandez and Ordonez played for the
Industriales.
</P>
<P>
   German Mesa, considered the best shortstop in Cuba, was
suspended for two years after he was accused of talking with agents
in the United States about the possibility of playing for a
professional team. He was only recently reinstated, and it remains
to be seen if the government will permit him to travel abroad
again.
</P>
<P>
   An agile fielder and a consistent hitter, he has been a star on
the national team for years, consistently beating out Ordonez, who
despite his mediocre batting is making $1.65 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when asked in public if he feels any regrets, Mesa said
that he is content with his lot in Cuba. ``Everyone has to make his
own decision,'' he said before a playoff game Wednesday night. ``I
play for the love of the people, for the warmth of the Cubans.''
</P>
<P>
   That legendary spirit of the Cuban fans was very much in
evidence later that night at the semifinal playoff game between the
Industriales and Isla de la Juventud. It was the final and deciding
game of a four-of-seven-game series, and the winner would go on to
play Santiago de Cuba for the championship in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   A playoff game in Havana is like a carnival. An hour before the
game started Wednesday, fans began filling the 50,000-seat
Latinoamericano Stadium, packing its old-fashioned bleachers to the
rafters. The fans paid three pesos, less than 50 cents, to enter.
But it was a blood-roar that rose from the faded stadium when the
Industriales loaded the bases in bottom of the first inning and
rattled Isla's right-hander, Carlos Yanes.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Rojas, 39, a civil servant, watched the game with his
7-year-old son, Ricardo Jr., on his lap, because he could not
afford two seats. He held the boy up to see the game, which the
Industriales won, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Orioles are a curiosity, but this is what matters,'' he
said. ``My father brought me here the same way I am bringing him.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps nothing underlines the game's enduring power here more
than the informal gatherings of fans on the streets and in the
central park, known as hot corners or tertulias. There, the
frustration of living in a tightly controlled dictatorship, where
political speech is censured, is relieved when fans begin to argue
about baseball.
</P>
<P>
   On the hot corners, one can find Yankees fans, Braves fans,
Marlins fans, all desperate for information about their teams. Men
argue about the relative merits of Mike Mussina and Roger Clemens,
whom they have never seen pitch. They have gleaned what they can,
they said, from scratchy radio broadcasts out of Miami, and from
newspapers and bootlegged tapes of games brought in to the country
by relatives. When they can, they loiter in hotel bars to catch a
major league game on ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Some fans here also worry about what is seen as a slight decline
in the quality of baseball here since the collapse of the Soviet
Union sent the Cuban economy into a spiral. Since 1991, more than
30 top players have defected to seek fortunes in the United States,
draining the baseball program of some important talents.
</P>
<P>
   Morale among players also suffered two years ago, when, for the
first time, the national team failed to win important tournaments
in Japan and Spain, losing by humiliating scores like 11-2 and
16-6. The crisis plunged Cuban baseball into a funk and prompted a
purge of government officials who have run the sport for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, things have improved somewhat, fans said. The
government has been taking better care economically of its baseball
stars, and the new minister of sports, Humberto Rodriguez, has
reinvigorated the game, in part by demanding that the top players
requalify for their teams annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have many people here who have the talent to get to the big
leagues, but the politics won't let them get there,'' said Salvador
Aguilar, a team official for the Industriales.
</P>
<P>
   As the sun began to set in Central Park on Tuesday evening over
the statue of Jose Marti, Cuba's national hero, a towering older
man wearing a frayed shirt was defending his argument that the
Cubans would win the exhibition game. The surrounding skeptics
descended on him like wolves around a wounded buck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you the Cuban team will get at least a tie,'' he
screamed. ``You say it's the big leagues. The top. But it could be
a good game.''
</P>
<P>
   Another fan, a tall balding man, butted in, face to face with
the defender of Cuba's team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you crazy?'' he yelled. ``They are better than us. They
have better quality players. I am as Cuban as you are. I am as
Fidelista as you are. But tell me, when did Cuba ever play against
a team made up of the best players from Japan? Or from the United
States? Tell me when? When?''
</P>
<P>
   The tall man could not answer. The answer, though, will come, at
least in part, on Sunday.

DRUG INDUSTRY MONITORS FDA REVIEW OF REZULIN

<TEXT>
<P>
   The market for oral diabetes drugs will soon become more
competitive _ but just how competitive may depend on what action
regulators take on a popular diabetes pill that has been linked to
28 deaths and seven liver transplants.
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert Co., the maker of the pill, Rezulin, will defend
the drug Friday before an advisory committee for the Food and Drug
Administration. The review is being closely watched by
pharmaceutical executives, who are waiting to see if the Rezulin's
problems will put the brakes on Warner-Lambert's sizzling
performance.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA is unlikely to pull Rezulin from the market, analysts
say. But if the agency adds new cautions to its label, as expected,
that could slow a powerful force in Warner-Lambert's sales growth.
Rezulin achieved $748 million in sales in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Warner-Lambert posted a 44 percent rise in earnings _
well ahead of the industry average gain of 16 percent. Executives
of rival drug companies have been so frustrated in trying to keep
up with Warner-Lambert, that there has been speculation in the
industry that some have rescheduled the release dates of quarterly
earnings to avoid comparisons with Warner-Lambert, a company once
known primarily as the maker of Dentyne chewing gum.
</P>
<P>
   Its stock price hit a recent high of $81.25 in November, but it
has slumped in recent months, as many investors grew concerned
about the impact of Rezulin's problems. It closed Thursday at
$69.34375.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the FDA puts new restrictions on Rezulin, several
analysts believe that Warner-Lambert will have new products in the
next two or three years to make up for any decline in sales of the
popular diabetes drug. The company should be able to propel its
existing brands to new highs, they say. Sales of Lipitor,
Warner-Lambert's cholesterol-reducing agent, are projected to swell
to $6.3 billion by 2002 from $2.185 billion last year, making it
the world's best-selling drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``The patients who are on Rezulin, and who already safely
tolerate it, will more than likely stay there,'' said Neil Sweig,
an analyst with Southeast Research Partners. ``But the company does
have other compounds. Right now, the market does not fully
understand Warner-Lambert. But soon it will.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors liked Rezulin when it was introduced in 1997 because it
was a new class of drug that resensitized body tissue to insulin
instead of inhibiting the liver's production of sugar. Doctors said
both processes were generally effective but Rezulin tended to work
where it was most needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rezulin has a unique method of action,'' said Dr. Leonid
Poretsky, director of the diabetes center at the Sanford I. Weill
Medical College of Cornell University in Manhattan. ``It works
primarily in the muscle, where most of the insulin is used up.''
</P>
<P>
   In November 1997, Rezulin's label was changed to reflect the
possibility that it could cause liver damage. The label now
recommended that patients using the drug have periodic blood tests
to monitor liver enzymes. One month later, Glaxo-Wellcome PLC.
halted the sales of Rezulin's British equivalent, causing
Warner-Lambert's stock to plunge 18.5 percent in one day.
</P>
<P>
   While Rezulin was billed as a revolutionary treatment, the drug
never surpassed the Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s Glucophage, the
nation's leading oral diabetic pill. Even though Glucophage was
associated with 20 deaths during its first million uses, according
to the FDA, the pill had been used safely for many years and did
not cause liver damage. Poretsky said he used Glucophage first and
added Rezulin only when the drug did not work.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from safety questions, Rezulin is also expensive. The
average wholesale price for a daily dose of Glucophage is a scant
$1.81 compared with $4.74 for Rezulin, according to the companies.
</P>
<P>
   And new competitors are in the wings. Two treatments that are
similar to Rezulin _ Avandia, made by SmithKline Beecham PLC, and
Actos from Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. and Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd. _
are scheduled to be reviewed for approval by the FDA next month.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe that either drug could successfully challenge
Glucophage, provided that they do not cause liver toxicity.
However, Rezulin's troubles have given doctors reason for caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would consider prescribing one of the two new drugs,''
Poretsky said. ``But neither of them have a history. But you have
to remember that with any drug, including Rezulin, there are going
to be risks.''

IRWINDALE TRACK REVS UP FOR OPENING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH LAIR  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRWINDALE -- Southern California's need for speed won't be
limited to just the freeways any more.
</P>
<P>
   Irwindale Speedway, the third race track to be built in the L.A.
area in this decade, opens Saturday with three open-wheel races.
Sixty-eight other racing events have also been scheduled on the
track's one-third and half-mile asphalt ovals. Racing will be for
sportsmen -- who have very limited budgets -- and professionals,
who tour the U.S. with team sponsors and multi-million dollar
budgets. In addition, a concert series is in the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``On opening night, I know when the green flag drops, all the
people who are sitting in the stands will be happy,'' track vice
president and chief operating officer Ray Wilkings says. ``A whole
bunch of people will be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Auto racing has always been a big hit for Americans. The first
race in the U.S. was held in 1895. Shortly after the turn of the
century, racing fans flocked to Indianapolis for the Indy 500,
Daytona Beach, Fla. for racing on the beach and to various Southern
California tracks. But housing, malls and business projects
eventually led to the elimination of tracks, including five
previous Irwindale tracks since 1955: San Gabriel Valley Dragstrip
(1955-60 and 1961-63), Go-Kart Speedway (1959-78), Speedway 605
(1966-77) and Irwindale Raceway (1965-1977).
</P>
<P>
   However, the sport is making a huge comeback. Television ratings
for National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing events have
climbed steadily in the past decade as purses have eclipsed the $1
million mark.
</P>
<P>
   In the past five years, the 2-mile tri-oval California Speedway
has been built in Fontana, a half-mile dirt track has been built in
Perris, the National Hot Rod Association updated and expanded its
facilities at Fairplex Park and now, the $10 million, 6,500-seat
Irwindale project is ready. Also, the Long Beach Grand Prix, a race
for Championship Auto Racing Team cars, celebrates its 25th year of
racing on Long Beach city streets on April 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to build a race track in the L.A. area,''
Wilkings said. ``That's why there are not very many around.''
</P>
<P>
   California Speedway president Scott Atherton says there's no
real surprise to the sport's upsurge.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no player strikes, holdouts over money or drivers
always in trouble with the law,'' he said. ``I think people
appreciate that.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwindale Speedway officials say they will not be competing for
L.A.'s racing dollar with the other tracks, but for L.A.'s
entertainment dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not football, baseball, basketball, hockey or
soccer,'' Wilkings said. ``It's not any of that stuff. It's auto
racing. What we want to do is appeal to not just the race fan, but
to those who are not fans and make fans out of them. We want to
show them that this is a wonderful family-type of place and
sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who have toured the 63-acre facility -- everyone from
sanctioning body presidents, car owners, drivers and fans -- are
calling it the finest short track in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be a big hit,'' said Chino Hills racer Butch
Gilliland, who will drive in two NASCAR Winston West series events
at the track. ``It's a key marketplace for our sponsor and for
other companies, too. The Southern California market has been short
of tracks after we lost Ascot, Saugus, Ontario and Riverside.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies bought all 12Irwindale Speedway luxury suites before
construction even began. All 54 billboards were sold before the
first car took the track, too. The speedway's opening has created
jobs for ticket-sellers and takers, concession workers, parking
attendants and various track-side workers. In addition, surrounding
businesses should benefit by pre- and post-race meals, and hotel
accommodations for those from out of the area.
</P>
<P>
   Bob DeFazio, who oversaw all phases of the construction, says
that the elevator was the final piece of the track to be up and
running. It was operational last week and received its permit on
Monday. His staff was putting the final touches on the luxury
suites Friday, installing televisions, refrigerators, setting up
chairs and tables.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll add up the fan visits and local job hours in smaller,
more manageable numbers,'' Wilkings said. ``But they'll still build
up to a strong economic impact on Irwindale and its surrounding
neighbor communities.''

WITH JOURNALISTS OUSTED, AID AGENCY PROVIDES REPORTS FROM KOSOVO

<P>
   Yugoslavia's expulsion of most foreign journalists Thursday left
a Northwest-based aid agency as one of the few remaining sources of
information on conditions in war-torn Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Mercy Corps International has administered about $25 million in
aid programs in the province since 1993 with the help of dozens of
local ethnic Albanian staff, according to president and co-founder
Dan O'Neill, who is based in Redmond, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 of Mercy Corps' local staff as well as Albanian
empoyees of partner agencies remain inside Kosovo, providing some
of the only first-hand information now available to the outside
world. They are in communication with Mercy Corps' office in
neighboring Macedonia and their information is being used in press
releases posted on the agency's web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had lots of journalists coming to our office in Skopje
(Macedonia's capital),'' O'Neill said. ``I've noticed that we're
getting information that I haven't seen anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Portland-based agency issued a brief press
release reporting NATO air strikes on Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, it circulated a longer one reporting details of
killings, kidnappings, looting and burning by Serb forces in the
towns of Pristina, Prizen, Mitrovica and Pec.
</P>
<P>
   There was no independent verification of the reports from Mercy
Corps, which says its programs in Kosovo assist members of all
ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts predicted widespread Serbian retaliation against
the majority Albanian population in the event of NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Mercy Corps' sources in Kosovo reported that Serbian military
and paramilitary forces Thursday began conducting house-to-house
searches in Pristina, destroying property and beating civilians.
</P>
<P>
   They also reported:
</P>
<P>
   _ Serb civilians were leaving their homes in the city ``for
points unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Masked gunmen had reportedly kidnapped a member of the
Albanian delgation to the peace talks in France and his two sons.
</P>
<P>
   _ The water supply in Pristina was off, but electricity had been
restored. A few people were on the streets, mostly in search of
food, water and other provisions.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Mitrovica, four people, including a 12-year-old boy, his
mother and two activists, were killed in their home by army troops.
</P>
<P>
   Mercy Corps first made headlines earlier this week in a
Post-Intelligencer story about its Kosovo country director, Terry
Heselius. Heselius risked NATO bombs and Serb retaliation to help
some of the agency's local staff flee to Macedonia. He was one of
the last Americans to leave Kosovo before the beginning of air
strikes on Wednesday and his story has generated nationwide
interest, including from NBC Nightly News.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercy Corps program headed by Heselius is one of the oldest
and largest operated in Kosovo by a non-governmental organization.
O`Neill said the program has been ``temporarily suspended'' because
of the current crisis.

SERBIA OUSTS FOREIGN JOURNALISTS; SERB CIVILIANS REACT TO WAR
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE _ No one calls him by his real name, Zeljko Raznatovic.
It is his nickname, ``Arkan,'' that instills terror in those who
incur the wrath of the leader of the Tigers, a Serbian special
military force believed to have participated in some of the nastier
atrocities of the wars in Bosnia and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   So people paid attention when Arkan, surrounded by a few
thuggish-looking companions, wandered the lobby Thursday of the
Hyatt Hotel, where many foreign journalists were staying, mumbling
that he was ``in a bad mood.''
</P>
<P>
   Before dawn Thursday, several foreign reporters heard a knock on
their hotel doors, as nonuniformed police told them they had to
pack their bags quickly and leave. The journalists were taken to
the border and expelled from the country.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the Serbian Ministry of Information, citing the state of
war with NATO, ordered all journalists affiliated with news
agencies based in NATO member countries to leave Serbia. Nearly all
did.
</P>
<P>
   Vuk Draskovic, the Yugoslav deputy prime minister, insisted to
foreign media that they were welcome to stay and cover the war.
``We need you. We need you as a window'' to tell the West of the
impact of the bombings, Draskovic said.
</P>
<P>
   But the public declarations of government officials have had
little meaning in Yugoslavia, where unofficial threats can be far
more serious. Beefy locals were stationed all week in the lobbies
of major hotels, watching and listening to foreign journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Many civilians are armed, particularly the minority Serbs in
Kosovo, and there was little assurance that foreigners would be
protected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, in this country, lunatics are the biggest patriots,''
lamented a 58-year-old filmmaker, who would give only his first
name of Milan.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Western sentiment _ particularly anti-American feeling _
went into overdrive Thursday as Belgrade dealt with the aftermath
of the first wave of NATO bombings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are angry,'' said Mira Petrovic, whose children were home
alone Thursday because schools were closed. Even Petrovic's
7-year-old son is reacting, pointing his toy gun in the air and
pretending to shoot it at the enemy, Petrovic said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO ``thinks Serbs are guilty of everything _ the wars in
Croatia and Bosnia, even the economic crisis in Asia,'' said
Dragan, who would not give his last name. ``They think if they kill
all the Serbs, there will be no more problems in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade, which had greeted warnings of an imminent attack with
an almost defiant disinterest, seemed in a state of shock Thursday
at the fact that NATO had bombed, and people got hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The Information Ministry reported that 10 people were killed and
38 injured during Wednesday night's cruise missile assault.
State-run Serbian TV, whose pre-bombing programming included
patriotic music and air raid directives, showed more somber images
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The footage included people hospitalized with apparent war
wounds, but officials would not allow foreign journalists to enter
to hospitals or provide clearance to reporters who wanted to view
the damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were completely unready for it,'' said Ismina Tanaskovic.
``Until the first bomb fell, I really didn't think it would happen.
We don't understand why we are guilty. Why are they doing that to
us?''
</P>
<P>
   The streets of Belgrade were nearly deserted Thursday, and many
shops were closed. The air was filled with an aura of menace and
fear, and Serbs were not shy about singling out their intended
victims of retribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a 4-year-old daughter,'' said a worker at a large hotel
hosting many foreigners. ``If anything happens to her'' in the
bombings, ``I will shoot the first one of them,'' he said bluntly,
referring to natives of NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Serbs feel doubly hurt _ victimized by what they
see as unwarranted bombing, and betrayed by its partners from both
world wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, a lot of people in Belgrade remember the
bombing in 1941'' by the Axis, ``and the Allied bombing in 1944,''
said Milan Bozic, a Yugoslav Cabinet minister. ``A lot of Belgrade
citizens can't believe that our former allies would like to bomb us
again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather fought in the Second World War to save the
lives of American pilots,'' said Draskovic. Now, NATO ``is bombing
a sovereign state because the sovereign state committed a few
crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Milligan reported this story from Belgrade before she and
other Western journalists were ordered out of Serbia Thursday
night.

<P>
   BERLIN _ For the first time since the end of World War II,
German fighter jets have gone to war, taking part in the attack on
Yugoslavia as part of a NATO force and marking this country's
definitive emancipation from post-war pacifism.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolf Scharping, the German defense minister, said four Tornado
jets took off from their Piacenza base in northern Italy late
Wednesday and participated in the NATO mission, before returning
safely. The German Parliament has authorized up to 15 military
aircraft to take part in the airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   Indicating that the German planes had hit Yugoslav targets,
Scharping told Parliament: ``These planes have the capability to
confuse and knock out enemy radar installations. That capability
was made use of.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany reacted calmly, indicating a profound change in its
psyche since the fall of the Berlin wall. Throughout the period of
post-war reconstruction, the saying that ``only peace'' would go
out from German soil amounted to a kind of mantra. The one time
during the Cold War German troops marched in a foreign land was in
1968 when East German troops assisted in the Soviet-led invasion of
Czechoslovakia.
</P>
<P>
   The devastation, physical and moral, caused by Hitler's Reich
and the country's delicate position at the front line of the Cold
War contributed to Germany's peace-only outlook. But Europe has
changed and Germany has changed with it. ``The last victim of the
fall of the wall is German pacifism,'' columnist Stephan Speicher
wrote Thursday in the Berliner Zeitung. ``We have become what we
are: ready for war.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is ready. There have been dissenting voices and
clear tensions within the governing coalition of Social Democrat
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   Gregor Gysi, the leader of the Party of Democratic Socialism, a
growing successor party to the East German Communists, Thursday
denounced Germany's participation. ``After what has happened this
century,'' he said, ``Germany above all has no right to drop bombs
on Belgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   Gysi was referring to Hitler's flattening of Belgrade, which
began on April 6, 1941, after Serbs tore up a pact with the Nazis.
This event is etched on Serbian consciousness as if it happened
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gysi's voice appeared relatively isolated amid what the
conservative newspaper Die Welt Thursday called ``a kind of public
emptiness.''
</P>
<P>
   German equanimity was clearly reinforced Thursday by the fact
that it was a ``Red-Green'' coalition of Social Democrats and
Greens that approved the decision to participate. In effect, the
very forces that were most vocal about pacifism in the 1980s _ all
the Greens and some Social Democrats _ ended up sending Germany
back to battle for the first time since 1945.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government has not easily taken the decision that,
for the first time since World War II, there are German soldiers in
an operational mission,'' Schroeder said. But ``our fundamental
values of freedom, democracy and human rights'' were being flouted
in Kosovo, and this could not be tolerated, he added.
</P>
<P>
   His statement reflected the way the barbarity of the Bosnian
war, combined with Germany's release from the constraints and
imperatives of the Cold War, has changed the attitudes of a country
no longer content to be an economic giant and a political midget.
</P>
<P>
   Just seven years ago, at the start of the Bosnian war, Joschka
Fischer, then a Green member of Parliament, opposed any Western
military intervention or deployment of German forces in Bosnia. But
Germany eventually played a role, both in the air and on the
ground, in the U.N. peace-keeping force in Bosnia. As foreign
minister since October, Fischer has argued passionately for the
West's responsibility to stop Serbian aggression in Kosovo in the
light of the refusal of Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president,
to accept peace proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cannot be permitted that, in the middle of Europe, the
predominant population of Kosovo is collectively deprived of its
rights,'' Fischer said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Cohn-Bendit, a Green colleague of Fischer and a fellow
militant in the revolutionary struggles of the 1960s, said Bosnia
had ``simply transformed'' the way the foreign minister approached
the question of the use of force.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Still, the German participation in air raids on Yugoslavia is
potentially explosive, for it will confirm every dark Serbian
suspicion about the West. If there has been a single obsession in
Serbian policy this century, it has been to prevent what Belgrade
sees as German expansionism in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not ready to make a distinction between the bombs of
Adolf Hitler from 1941 and the bombs of NATO,'' Vuk Draskovic, the
Yugoslavia deputy prime minister, said. It was a comment that
amounted to a summary of a widespread Serbian view of the reasons
for the country's plight.
</P>
<P>
   Strong German support for Croatian independence from Yugoslavia,
and Croatia's adoption of the hymn ``Danke Deutschland'' when that
independence came in 1991, only reinforced Serbian misgivings.
</P>
<P>
   The last time NATO bombed in the Balkans _ hitting Serbian
positions around Sarajevo in the late summer of 1995 _ the action
prompted a response very similar to Draskovic's on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``By its length, this bombardment is even more brutal than the
bombardment conducted by Hitler on April 6, 1941, on Belgrade,
given the fact that Hitler's bombardment was stopped on April 8,
1941, to allow the burial of victims under Christian custom,'' Gen.
Ratko Mladic, then the commander of Serbian forces in Bosnia, wrote
to a Western general.
</P>
<P>
   With 2,500 German troops now in Bosnia, and another 3,000
stationed in Macedonia, the possibility of some Serbian reprisal
against German forces exists, especially if the NATO bombing proves
prolonged or erratic.
</P>
<P>
   This possibility has already created political tensions here.
Volker Ruehe, the former defense minister in the Christian Democrat
Government of Helmut Kohl, said that the troops in Macedonia had
been sent there as part of a peacekeeping force, and ``not to make
war.'' They should therefore be withdrawn, he argued.
</P>
<P>
   Within the coalition, the issue of Kosovo proved fraught before
the bombing began. It had much to do with the abrupt resignation
this month of the former finance minister, Oskar Lafontaine.
</P>
<P>
   Lafontaine was concerned that Germany's readiness to follow
America's Kosovo policy was reckless, according to a minister who
was present during the discussions. At one Cabinet meeting, shortly
before he quit, Lafontaine relentlessly probed Schroeder as to
where bombing would lead, what it would achieve, what its legal
basis was, and what it would cost.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when Scharping, the defense minister, asked for more
money because the preparations for Kosovo had used up the funds
earmarked for a pay rise for the military, Lafontaine refused,
officials said. At that point, Scharping threatened to resign.
</P>
<P>
   But when Schroeder sided with Scharping and ordered Lafontaine
to release the money, it was the finance minister who quit.
``Lafontaine objected to Kosovo policy in the same way as he
objected to the deployment of American Pershing II missiles on
German soil in the 1980s,'' said the minister who attended the
discussions and who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment of the missiles was, of course, successful. It
was contentious, but it helped bring the Cold War to an end. This
week, America again enlisted Germany's help in a resolute course of
action, but the outcome, for Germany and for Europe, remains
uncertain.

BLANEY BLAZES TO BUSCH SERIES POLE IN TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Simon Gonzalez 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Dave Blaney was the wrong person to talk to
about the problems some drivers were having in Turn 2 of Texas
Motor Speedway yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask someone who wrecked,'' Blaney said.
</P>
<P>
   Blaney didn't wreck. Far from it. While six Busch Grand National
drivers got too close to the edge during practice and found the
wall, Blaney had no problems with the reconfigured surface.
</P>
<P>
   He drove his No. 93 Amoco Pontiac to the pole for tomorrow's BGN
Coca-Cola 300, with a one-lap speed of 183.082 mph. That shattered
the previous qualifying record of 180.054 set by Jeff Green before
the inaugural race in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``My car really likes this track,'' said Blaney, who is on the
pole for the third time in his 25-race BGN career and the second
time this season. ``The key to today was no mistakes. We put good
corners together in practice and knew if we could put a whole lap
together it would be close.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Martin joined Blaney in the front row with a speed of
181.592 mph. Adam Petty, son of Winston Cup regular Kyle Petty and
grandson of NASCAR legend Richard Petty, and defending Cup champion
Jeff Gordon are in the second row.
</P>
<P>
   Points leader Matt Kenseth qualified fifth, while defending
champion Dale Earnhardt Jr. was 12th.
</P>
<P>
   Blaney had one of the fastest cars in practice, and was fourth
on the speed charts after the afternoon session. That gave him
reason to think he could put it on the pole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have any problems with my car,'' he said. ``I knew
what we had, and I just had to make it a little better than our
practice time.''
</P>
<P>
   Petty, a Busch Series rookie, was the 10th of the 61 entries to
make a qualifying run and gave Grandpa a thrill when he went to the
top of the scoring tower.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pretty excited,'' Adam Petty said. ``It was pretty neat
for him to see me No. 1 on the tower there for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   That held up until Martin, the 29th driver out, bumped him.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared as though Martin would add a pole to his TMS resume
that includes a Busch victory in '97 and the Cup triumph last year,
but Blaney blew everyone away with his record-setting lap.
</P>
<P>
   Like Petty earlier in the day, Blaney made his record run on new
tires. Most of the drivers opted to qualify on scuffs, tires that
were warmed up with a few laps during practice, but crew chief Gil
Martin decided not to follow the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody went out there with scuffed tires, and we made our
best run on stickers,'' Martin said. ``We ran stickers in the
afternoon before the qualifying run and he said the car stayed
right up under him and was good and tight. We'd already run faster
than what most of the guys, so we felt pretty good about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Blaney is in the same car he used for the Yellow Freight 300 at
Atlanta Motor Speedway two weeks ago. He won the pole then, and
finished second in the race.

LOOKS LIKE FOX HAS HIT A HOMER WITH GROENING'S `FUTURAMA' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trying to reinvent the freshness, the irreverence and the
nose-thumbing smart-aleckness of ``The Simpsons'' is probably a
dumb idea. But if Fox is willing to pay the money, Matt Groening is
happy to take it.
</P>
<P>
   And if the number of laugh-out-loud moments in his new
``Futurama'' is a good way to measure success, Groening, who needs
more money like Bart Simpson needs more attitude, may be laughing
all the way to the banquette where TV execs do lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we shouldn't be too surprised. Laying claim to essentially
the same well-written provenance as ``The Simpsons,'' ``Futurama''
is smart but not pointy-headed, satirical but not annoying. It's
the hallmark of Groening and his people: sly, subversive humor
delivered with such who-me? guiltlessness that it's hard not to
like.
</P>
<P>
   For a couple of Sunday nights before moving to Tuesdays,
``Futurama'' takes us into the beyond with a 25-year-old pizza
runner named Fry, who accidentally freezes himself after making a
delivery to a New York cryogenics lab in 1999. Thawed out 10
centuries later, Fry finds himself in New New York, the old New
York having been destroyed a couple of times while he was on ice.
Upon emerging from the freezer, Fry encounters Leela, a foxy
one-eyed alien with depth-perception problems. Later, he meets
Bender, a robot who drinks too much, smokes cigars and isn't above
the occasional act of petty theft.
</P>
<P>
   After finding the only blood relative he has on Earth, a
great-to-the-40th-power-(give or take)-nephew named Prof. Hubert
Farnsworth, Fry and his only friends in the world decide to sign on
with the professor's moonlighting business, Planet Express Corp.,
which delivers packages to all five quadrants of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Fry is a delivery boy. But it's amazing how a new
millennium puts a fresh coat of rationalization on the numbingly
familiar.
</P>
<P>
   One minor complaint about ``Futurama'': Billy West, perhaps best
known as the voice of both Ren and Stimpy, makes Fry sound a little
like an older Bart Simpson, which doesn't quite work here. Maybe
it's because Fry is supposed to be a dim bulb, certainly as dim as
Homer Simpson. But it's hard to see Fry as a dull knife when he
sounds like Bart, who's actually sharper than most of the cutlery
in Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   The voice of Katey Sagal (``Married ... With Children''), on the
other hand, is ideal for Leela: smoky, sexy, confident without
being cocky. And John DiMaggio gives Bender a great combo of
high-tech/low-brow sass.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, viewers can look forward to meeting these
additional characters:

 &HT;    Duke's Krzyzewski at top of his game
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Less than two minutes remained in what
would become Duke's 85-64 win over Temple in Sunday's NCAA East
Regional championship game. With victory and a spot in the Final
Four assured, coach Mike Krzyzewski stood and applauded his team.
Krzyzewski then cleared the bench, giving each player a hug as he
came off the floor. He also delivered a message:
</P>
<P>
   ``Enjoy this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a minor gesture, really, but one that spoke volumes about
the man and his personal journey from triumph to tragedy and back
to triumph again during the decade of the '90s. It was a painful
process, both physically and emotionally. There were moments of
self-doubt. But today, on the eve of his eighth Final Four
appearance as a coach, Krzyzewski will tell you that he's a better
man for having made the trip. He finally has learned to enjoy the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy,'' said Krzyzewski, who is a youthful 52. ``I'm very
comfortable with who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a basketball world, then Krzyzewski is the king of
it. The evidence is compelling:
</P>
<P>
   _ He brings the nation's No. 1 team (36-1) into Saturday's Final
Four game with Michigan State. The top eight players at Duke are
five sophomores, a junior, a freshman and one senior. Krzyzewski
already has signed three McDonald's All-Americans for next year.
</P>
<P>
   _ He has won two national championships, 1991-92, and if this
team gives him No. 3, Krzyzewski would become only the fourth coach
in NCAA history to win three or more titles. The others are John
Wooden (10), Adolph Rupp (4) and Bob Knight (3).
</P>
<P>
   _ With a win Saturday over Michigan State, Krzyzewski would pass
UCLA's Wooden and move into second place in all-time NCAA
Tournament wins with 48. Only former North Carolina coach Dean
Smith has more (65). But the numbers, as impressive as they are,
don't tell the complete story of a man who was at the top of his
profession, was forced to give it up, and then came back better
than ever as a different man and a different coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love coaching again,'' said Krzyzewski, acknowledging that
there was a time when his job was not a labor of love.
</P>
<P>
   After winning a second consecutive national championship in
1992, no coach in any sport was hotter than Krzyzewski. The Blue
Devils had been to six Final Fours in seven years, an unprecedented
achievement since the NCAA Tournament was expanded to 64 teams in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   But the former Army point guard, the product of working-class
parents in Chicago, had built a basketball machine at Duke and
never allowed himself to enjoy it. Instead, he was keeping a
frantic pace in an effort just to maintain it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got in such a whirlwind and didn't know how to get out,''
Krzyzewski's wife, Micki, told The Charlotte Observer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Krzyzewski almost won his third national championship
in four years, but Scotty Thurman of Arkansas hit a rainbow 3-point
shot with 51 seconds remaining, and the Razorbacks won 76-72 in
Charlotte. Still, Krzyzewski kept pushing himself.
</P>
<P>
   Nature finally stepped in on Oct. 21, 1994, when Krzyzewski, who
had been living with back pain for months, was forced to have
surgery to repair a herniated disc. Doctors told him to take
several weeks off and rest. He ignored them, holding a staff
meeting at his house two days after he left the hospital. Soon he
was back in the office.
</P>
<P>
   With Grant Hill having graduated to the NBA, the Duke team of
1995 was not as talented as in years past. But Krzyzewski, refusing
to slow down, coached the Blue Devils to a 9-3 record in the
opening weeks of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Then he hit the wall. Two days after a loss to Clemson at home,
Krzyzewski returned to Duke Hospital for a series of tests. Doctors
determined that he was physically exhausted and prescribed complete
rest.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't get a chance to ignore the doctors again. Duke
athletics director Tom Butters and president Nan Keohane
intervened, telling Krzyzewski that he had to take the rest of the
year off. Krzyzewski could only watch while Duke went 4-15 in its
remaining games under interim coach Pete Gaudet.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, I really didn't know what was going to
happen,'' Krzyzewski said. ``I thought we could get it back. But
honestly, I wasn't sure.''
</P>
<P>
   When Krzyzewski returned for the 1996 season, it was with a
stronger body, a rested mind, and a healthy dose of perspective.
Krzyzewski remembered the words of the late Jim Valvano, who had
become his friend during Valvano's unsuccessful fight with cancer
in 1993. Valvano told him to take time to enjoy his three
daughters, who were growing up quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Then in October 1996, just as preseason practice was under way,
Krzyzewski lost his mother, Emily, to cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Krzyzewski came back to lead Duke into the NCAA Tournament that
season, but he would never be the same. Oh, he still blisters the
officials when he thinks they deserve it. And he can still chew his
team out for what he perceives to be a lack of effort, as he did at
halftime of last week's East Regional semifinal against Southwest
Missouri State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach is still as passionate about the game as he's ever
been,'' said senior guard Trajan Langdon, the only player who has
been with Krzyzewski the past five years. ``He just takes time to
enjoy other things.''

 &HT;    Crum reply on eligibility
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Earlier this month, a district court
ruled that the NCAA's freshman eligibility requirements
discriminated against blacks. Since then, the NCAA has claimed that
schools will be thrown into ``chaos'' if they have to recruit
without a uniform standard.
</P>
<P>
   Louisville basketball coach Denny Crum isn't buying it. He
believes the old eligibility rules don't have to be replaced by
anything at all.
</P>
<P>
   Minimum eligibility requirements were created in 1986 in
response to some schools bringing in athletes who were poor
students and allowing them to take easy courses to stay eligible.
Four years later, those athletes were out of eligibility and
nowhere near a degree.
</P>
<P>
   Crum believes the satisfactory-progress rule, adopted in 1988,
eliminated the need for eligibility requirements. It sets
guidelines for progress toward a degree. If an athlete doesn't meet
that standard at any given point in his or her college career, he
or she is ineligible for athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a kid's not making progress toward his degree, he's not
going to be eligible to play anyway,'' said Crum, incoming
president of the National Association of Basketball Coaches,
holding its annual convention at the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Let's get less physical
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made about the scoring in college basketball,
which is down about 13 points a game over the last eight years. One
coach's answer: Cut out the physical play.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at some of those old classic games, guys could
actually get open for shots without getting beat up along the
way,'' Kansas coach Roy Williams said. ``Today, it's like
hand-to-hand combat out there.''
</P>
<P>
   But Williams, chairman of the NABC rules committee, doesn't hold
out a lot of hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've let it come so far, it's hard to see how we can go back
to the old way of playing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dooley arrives today
</P>
<P>
   Georgia athletics director Vince Dooley will be arriving in St.
Petersburg today as he continues to search for a new basketball
coach. Dooley's list includes former St. John's coach Fran
Fraschilla, Evansville's Jim Crews, Delaware's Mike Brey,
Appalachian State's Buzz Peterson and former Georgia assistant
Jerry Waters, who said Thursday that he plans to meet with Dooley
as early as today. Dooley and UGA president Michael Adams hope to
meet with as many of them as possible during their stay.

 &HT;    Barmore: White-McCarty worthy of award
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ When Stephanie White-McCarty lit up Louisiana
Tech for 21 points and seven rebounds in Purdue's 71-65 win on Dec.
19, her performance so impressed Tech coach Leon Barmore that he
voted for her for the Women's Basketball Coaches Association's
player of the year award.
</P>
<P>
   He was the only coach to buck the Chamique Holdsclaw bandwagon,
but Thursday Barmore maintained that the top-ranked Boilermakers
senior point guard has been more valuable to her team. And not just
because they're meeting again in a Final Four tipoff at 9:30
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect that she took a team of less talent than say, a
Tennessee,'' Barmore said. White-McCarty ``has them knocking on the
door of a national championship, and I think it's due to her
ability to run a ballclub and her ability to think on the court.
What got her my vote was the reality that she got the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiresome twin talk
</P>
<P>
   It's inevitable that Georgia's Andy Landers would be asked about
twins Kelly and Coco Miller, but even he got a little weary during
a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my third set of twins,'' he said. ``I'm getting kind
of numb to it, really. I'm going to burst your bubble, because we
have really worked hard at treating them as individuals and
coaching them per their needs and the way we think they need to be
coached.''
</P>
<P>
   The other sets of twins are Camille and Miriam Lowe, who played
between 1990 and 1993, and Bernadette and Juliette Locke, who
played for him at Roane State Junior College in Tennessee.
Bernadette Locke also played for Landers his first two years at
Georgia
</P>
<P>
   Miller, Edwards honored
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's Kelly Miller was named to the 1999 Kodak All-America
team on Thursday, and former winner Teresa Edwards was chosen to
the Kodak silver anniversary team.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is one of four sophomores on this season's 10-player
team, joining Tamika Catchings and Semeka Randall of Tennessee and
UConn's Svetlana Abrosimova.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's Chamique Holdsclaw's selection made her just the
second four-time All-American, with Cheryl Miller of Southern Cal.
Also chosen were Becky Hammon of Colorado State, Maylana Martin of
UCLA, Michele VanGorp of Duke, White-McCarty of Purdue and
Louisiana Tech's Amanda Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards was a Kodak All-American in 1985 and 1986.

 &HT;    Consistency carries Buckeyes
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ They sit in the same seats during every team
meeting and on every team bus ride. They get their right ankle
taped first _ always. They run onto the court for warm-ups in the
same order every time: Scoonie Penn first, Ken Johnson last. Penn
always takes the first shot in shoot-arounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're pretty superstitious,'' senior co-captain Jason
Singleton said. ``I think it just makes us feel a little more
comfortable to have our pre-game rituals.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes know it's their play that's responsible for Ohio
State reaching the Final Four. Nonetheless, they don't want to
change the little things that have accompanied their success.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Penn brought a boom box to a holiday tournament in
Puerto Rico in December and the Bucks won all three of games there.
He left the boom box home when the team traveled to the Big Ten
tournament in Chicago and OSU lost in the second game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put two and two together and we figured we better bring it
to our tournament games,'' Singleton said.
</P>
<P>
   OSU coach Jim O'Brien said there was talk that he and the
players would shave their heads if the team made the Final Four. To
his relief, the players have decided such a drastic change might
disturb their karma.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want to change anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   How about 1:15 a.m., coach?
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien likes numerous things about this Buckeye squad and has
spoken frequently about how enjoyable it has been to coach this
group. He recalled a discussion about team curfew two days before a
game in Knoxville, Tenn., last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked them what time they thought should be in,'' O'Brien
said. ``Somebody said, kidding around, '4 (a.m.)?' And I said,
Nooo. Next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said what about 1? And Jason says, '1:15. We were thinking
about 1:15.' I said that's OK with me.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I like about them. They don't take advantage.
Maybe I've missed a lot of stuff but I don't sense that they've
taken advantage. They're fun to be around.''
</P>
<P>
   18 losses, but they were close
</P>
<P>
   UConn coach Jim Calhoun said observers shouldn't make too much
of the 18 straight losses O'Brien suffered to the Huskies while a
coach at Boston College. Many of the games were decided by just a
few points or were lost at the buzzer or in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a quirkiness to it,'' Calhoun said of O'Brien's losing
streak. ``And it just seems like every single time he's been good,
we've been very good. And when he's been very good, we've been
excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn says he'll be back
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Scoonie Penn says he will return for his senior
season instead of making himself available for the NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking next year about coming back here and playing at
Ohio State,'' Penn said on Tuesday. ``The NBA has been a dream of
mine. But right now, I have no thoughts about leaving college
basketball at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would change his mind if he were told he'd be taken
in the first round, he said, ``I don't believe everything I hear.''

DODGERS EXPAND SEARCH FOR LEFTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ The Dodgers need a lefty in the bullpen and so
far the candidates in camp haven't knocked off anyone's socks. They
haven't even untied anyone's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Sothe Dodgers are dipping into their minor-league camp in search
of a capable left-handed reliever.
</P>
<P>
   On a day in which lefty Pedro Borbon had his best, and longest,
outing of the spring, general manager Kevin Malone said 26-year-old
minor leaguer Jeff Williams would pitch today in relief for the
Dodgers against the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Williams split time between Double-A San Antonio and Triple-A
Albuquerque last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm anxious. I want to see him myself,'' Malone said during
the Dodgers' 8-5 win against the Houston Astros. ``We've had good
reports out of minor-league camp. We're possibly adding another
name to the mix.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' need to find a capable left-hander is getting more
immediate as opening day closes in. Williams' audition demonstrates
that. The Aussie, who pitched at Southeastern Louisiana University,
has appeared in 51 games _ all starts _ in his two years as a
professional. Last year he was 8-8 with a 4.98 ERA in Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   But Malone also said there's another reason for looking at
Williams. If 21-year-old Onan Masaoka makes the club, the Dodgers
need to know if they have reinforcements at the minor-league level
if he fails.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to know what we have,'' Malone said. ``Most of us are
new here in the organization. You have to look at everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Davey Johnson has been concerned about the role,
although he was encouraged by Borbon's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the best he's thrown,'' Johnson said of Borbon's two
hitless innings. ``To me, he moved right into the hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time Borbon threw more than one inning, but his
fastball topped out at 87 mph, under the 89 to 91 mph range he was
at before 1996 elbow surgery. Johnson said he plans on using Borbon
more in the next week to test his arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I go out I get more confidence in my arm,'' said
Borbon (0-0, 2.25 ERA). ``I know if I'm healthy I'm going to play
in the big leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley to catch? Todd Hundley is expected to catch his first
game of the spring today as the Dodgers host the Baltimore Orioles,
although that could change.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have been slow to allow Hundley _ who has been
scratched several times from the lineup this spring _ test his
surgically repaired elbow in game situations.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson wouldn't commit on the prospect of Hundley catching
today but did say when that time arrives, Hundley would start
slowly by catching three or four innings. Johnson said he may bat
Hundley second to get him two at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the key isn't his arm or elbow,'' Malone said.
``It's his legs, making sure he can squat and run.''
</P>
<P>
   Balks, walks and chalk: Dodgers officials said they wouldn't
have any interest in signing right-hander Hideo Nomo, outrighted to
the minor leagues by the Mets, if he were a free agent. . . .
Malone strengthened his stance on the status of reliever Antonio
Osuna, who's recovering from elbow surgery last September. ``We're
probably looking at him starting the year on the disabled list,''
Malone said. . . . Gary Sheffield went 0 for 3 as his average
dropped to .095, but he isn't concerned. ``Once I get my balance,
I'm a lot quicker at the plate. I'm close,'' the left fielder said.

   AVIANO AIR BASE, Italy _ Vowing ''no sanctuary'' for Serb
military forces, NATO commander Gen. Wesley Clark launched a second
punishing night of air strikes deep into Yugoslavia late Thursday,
pounding radar stations, air fields, barracks and other military
targets with scores of cruise missiles and guided bombs.
</P>
<P>
   In the southern province of Kosovo, thousands of Serb troops and
police backed by hundreds of tanks pressed their own offensive on
the ground, rolling up villages and torching homes in an unchecked
rampage that put untallied hordes of ethnic Albanians to a panicked
flight for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict spilled over Yugoslavia's boundaries, as U.S.
officials said Serb artillery was fired across the border into
Albania and angry ethnic Serbs protested the NATO bombings by
attacking the American Embassy in neighboring Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO out of Yugoslavia,'' some 2,000 protesters chanted.
Others pelted the embassy compound with stones and Molotov
cocktails, smashing windows and burning three cars, before riot
police dispersed them with tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to foment more such attacks elsewhere, Serbian Deputy
Prime Minister Vojislav Seselj called on Serbs worldwide to
''strike at American interests as best they can,'' prompting
heightened security at federal buildings in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton vowed to continue the U.S.-ed NATO strikes,
however, until Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, president of
Yugoslavia, halts his bloody offensive in Kosovo and agrees to an
international peace plan, or until allied bombs crush his ability
to wage war.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Milosevic and his military leaders should understand
that there is no sanctuary for them,'' Clark, the U.S. Army general
who is the supreme allied commander for Europe, told reporters at
NATO headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to systematically and progressively attack,
disrupt, degrade, devastate,'' Serb military forces, Clark said.
Unless Milosevic capitulates, he added, ``we are going to destroy
these forces and their facilities and support.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, more than 60 warplanes -- including F-117A Stealth
fighters, F-16 Fighting Falcons and F-15 Eagles -- took off from
here in northwestern Italy, as U.S. Navy ships in the Adriatic Sea
launched at least 20 Tomahawk cruise missiles at Serb military
targets in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after dark, explosions ripped across Yugoslavia, from
its southern reaches of Montenegro, where local news media reported
strikes on at least six locations -- an army base, an airport and
radar facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Explosions also rocked a northern suburb of Belgrade, site of an
army base near an airport, as air raid sirens blared and a wartime
blackout cast an eerie atmosphere across the Yugoslav capital for
the second night in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon was encouraged by preliminary assessments of the
opening night of raids on Wednesday. Some 40 targets were hit,
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said, and at least three
Soviet-built MiG-29 fighters, the best the Yugoslav air force has,
were shot down: two by U.S. pilots in F-15s; the other by a Dutch
pilots flying a U.S.-built F-16.
</P>
<P>
   Maintenance crews here at Aviano spent Thursday surveying the
aircraft, rearming them for the evening's sorties and scrawling
their own messages on the side of laser-guided bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have no fear,'' read one, ``B-flight is here!!!''
</P>
<P>
   But a weapons specialist, Senior Airman Perry McCiver, 30, of
San Diego, Calif., said he prayed as U.S. planes roared off toward
the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prayed for our pilots. I prayed for the Kosovars,'' said
McCiver. ``I prayed for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   His appeals seemed well-placed.
</P>
<P>
   Serb troops spent the day extending their year-long offensive in
Kosovo, where attacks on ethnic Albanians over the past year have
left more than 2,000 dead and another quarter of a million
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's escalated today,'' National Security Adviser Samuel
Berger told reporters at the White House, referring to Milosevic.
``There have been some further burning of villages, further sweep
operations, some shelling into Albania, and it's obviously very
disturbing to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger and Clark both affirmed that U.S. information on the
ground situation in Kosovo was limited by the absence of 1,400
international monitors who left Kosovo over the weekend, as NATO
air strikes loomed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another layer of information was stripped away on Thursday,
when Yugoslavia expelled all journalists from NATO countries and
severed diplomatic relations with the United States, France,
Germany and Britain, the lead nations in the continuing air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo's provincial capital, Pristina, a CNN television news
crew was jumped by a half-dozen armed thugs, who smashed equipment,
set fire to one of their cars, slapped producer Alessio Vinci
across the face and jammed an assault rifle under the nose of
correspondent Brent Sadler.
</P>
<P>
   Serb troops arrived, established order and escorted a caravan
carrying remaining Western journalists to the Macedonia border.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon asserted that the escalation of Serb attacks on the
ground could result in increasingly aggressive air strikes
targeting the troops carrying out the repression in Kosovo and
their supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are focusing on the very forces that are being used, and
assembled for use, against the Kosovar Albanians,'' Bacon told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the 2.2 million people in
Kosovo, a province in southern Serbia, one of two states that,
along with Montenegro, that make up Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic stripped Kosovo of broad political autonomy in 1989,
and ethnic tensions gradually rose. A year ago, Albanian rebels
favoring independence began guerilla attacks against Serb security
forces, which responded with a brutal crackdown targeting villages
and civilians they identified as ``terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   In the face of the escalating violence Thursday, Berger stressed
that NATO military support for the Kosovars remained confined to
air strikes. There is no plan to send ground troops into Kosovo
from the United States or any other NATO country, Berger said,
unless a peace agreement is reached between Serbs and Kosovar
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the United States pushed ahead with the largest air
campaign to hit Europe since World War II, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright insisted that Milosevic could end the onslaught
with a phone call and a will to embrace peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diplomatic channels remain open,'' said Albright, noting that
U.S. envoy Christopher Hill was standing by at the U.S. Embassy in
Macedonia. ``They know his number.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from reaching out for peace, however, Milosevic remained
defiant.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no indication that there is any change at all in
Milosevic's position,'' Albright told reporters at the State
Department. ``He has not gotten the message yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Extending a potential face-saving opportunity to Milosevic,
Berger opened the possibility of renewed negotiations with
Milosevic over the terms of an internationally-backed peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   The accord, signed last week in France by representatives of the
Kosovar Albanians but so far rejected by Milosevic, calls for
sending a NATO peacekeeping force of 28,000 troops, 4,000 of them
American, into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   While the administration has insisted that it would not end the
bombing campaign unless Milosevic agrees to the NATO peacekeeping
force, Berger appeared to suggest that other aspects of the peace
treaty might be open to discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any changes that would be made would have to be accepted by
the Kosovars,'' Berger told reporters at the White House. ``If
there were proposed changes in the agreement, that would be
something that the Kosovars would have to accept.''
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said war and diplomacy should be backed with
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed the Serbia Democratization Act, which would
strengthen existing economic sanctions against the Milosevic
regime, boost humanitarian aid for his victims and promote
democratic opposition to replace his government.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for Mr. Milosevic's future, I don't care one way or the
other if he lives out his days in sunny Cyprus or if he will agree
to step aside and make way for democracy in Serbia,'' Helms said in
a speech on the Senate floor. ``The important thing is that he be
removed from power, whether voluntarily or not, and now.''

 &HT;    Penn, El-Amin keep teams focused on the court of emotion
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Mention the Ohio State-Connecticut
match-up in Saturday's Final Four, and the talk immediately turns
to the guard play.
</P>
<P>
   Can the Buckeyes stop two-time Big East Player of the Year
Richard ``Rip'' Hamilton? Can the Huskies take OSU's leader,
Scoonie Penn, out of his game? Will Ricky Moore, the
oft-overshadowed Husky guard, continue to be the defensive stopper
UConn needs? Will Michael Redd, snubbed by Big Ten media and
coaches as an All-Conference first team selection, show that he is
one of the conference's and nation's best guards?
</P>
<P>
   Guard play, coaches say, has become increasingly important in
college basketball. With the diminishing number of true, dominant
centers in the game and the use of three-guard lineups like UConn
and Ohio State employ, backcourt players wield more influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very simply, the people who have the ball in their hands the
most end up turning the game,'' UConn coach Jim Calhoun said.
</P>
<P>
   Penn has done that frequently this season. His ability to shoot
the 3-pointer as well dish out a clutch assist has proven
invaluable to the Buckeyes.
</P>
<P>
   But the Huskies have their own dangerous point man in Khalid
El-Amin. At 5-10, 205 pounds, he is often jeered by opponents' fans
who call him the ``Pillsbury Doughboy'' and wave empty Domino's
pizza boxes at him.
</P>
<P>
   Like OSU's Penn, El-Amin is the emotional leader of his team.
Even if he's not scoring a lot of points, as was the case in the
regional final against Gonzaga when he shot 0-for-12 from the
field, his energy and leadership still fuels the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's our energizer,'' Calhoun said. ``He makes us go not only
physically but psychologically. He really truly is the guy who the
other kids turn to for energy, direction and sometimes for
courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State coach Jim O'Brien said it's the same way with Penn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's uncanny how similar these point guards are,'' he said.
``It's interesting how Hamilton is the leading scorer but Khalid is
the leader. It's the same with us. Michael is our leading scorer
(19.7 points per game), but Scoonie makes us go.

 &HT;    Lady Dogs must avoid Final Four fouls
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Duke did a major favor to virtually everyone
in women's basketball by knocking off Tennessee behind one of the
strongest frontlines in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   That height advantage might cause the Georgia Lady Bulldogs
major problems here tonight in the first game of the women's Final
Four semifinals (7 p.m., ESPN).
</P>
<P>
   Duke's physical front line is anchored by 6-foot-6 center
Michele VanGorp, who played a critical role in dethroning the Lady
Volunteers. The Lady Bulldogs have improved their post defense, but
their chances to reach Sunday's championship game might depend on
how well they can avoid foul problems.
</P>
<P>
   VanGorp, who had 13 points and seven rebounds against Tennessee
and leads the team with a 16.9 scoring average, complements a solid
guard trio of Nicole Erickson and Hilary Howard and Georgia
Schweitzer.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's starting inside combination of Tawana McDonald and
Angie Ball struggled with foul difficulties against both Clemson
and Iowa State last week in the regionals.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia coach Andy Landers saidhis team has been able to adapt
defensively to an array of postseason foes, but Duke presents a
special challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have inside people that Duke has, there's the
potential to have fouls,'' Landers said.

   AVIANO AIR BASE, Italy _ Vowing ''no sanctuary'' for Serb
military forces, NATO commander Gen. Wesley Clark launched a second
punishing night of air strikes deep into Yugoslavia late Thursday,
pounding radar stations, air fields, barracks and other military
targets with scores of cruise missiles and guided bombs.
</P>
<P>
   In the southern province of Kosovo, thousands of Serb troops and
police backed by hundreds of tanks pressed their own offensive on
the ground, rolling up villages and torching homes in an unchecked
rampage that put untallied hordes of ethnic Albanians to a panicked
flight for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict spilled over Yugoslavia's boundaries, as U.S.
officials said Serb artillery was fired across the border into
Albania and angry ethnic Serbs protested the NATO bombings by
attacking the American Embassy in neighboring Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO out of Yugoslavia,'' some 2,000 protesters chanted.
Others pelted the embassy compound with stones and Molotov
cocktails, smashing windows and burning three cars, before riot
police dispersed them with tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to foment more such attacks elsewhere, Serbian Deputy
Prime Minister Vojislav Seselj called on Serbs worldwide to
''strike at American interests as best they can,'' prompting
heightened security at federal buildings in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton vowed to continue the U.S.-led NATO strikes,
however, until Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, president of
Yugoslavia, halts his bloody offensive in Kosovo and agrees to an
international peace plan, or until allied bombs crush his ability
to wage war.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Milosevic and his military leaders should understand
that there is no sanctuary for them,'' Clark, the U.S. Army general
who is the supreme allied commander for Europe, told reporters at
NATO headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to systematically and progressively attack,
disrupt, degrade, devastate,'' Serb military forces, Clark said.
Unless Milosevic capitulates, he added, ``we are going to destroy
these forces and their facilities and support.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, more than 60 warplanes -- including F-117A Stealth
fighters, F-16 Fighting Falcons and F-15 Eagles -- took off from
here in northwestern Italy, as U.S. Navy ships in the Adriatic Sea
launched at least 20 Tomahawk cruise missiles at Serb military
targets in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after dark, explosions ripped across Yugoslavia, from
its southern reaches of Montenegro, where local news media reported
strikes on at least six locations -- an army base, an airport and
radar facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Explosions also rocked a northern suburb of Belgrade, site of an
army base near an airport, as air raid sirens blared and a wartime
blackout cast an eerie atmosphere across the Yugoslav capital for
the second night in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon was encouraged by preliminary assessments of the
opening night of raids on Wednesday. Some 40 targets were hit,
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said, and at least three
Soviet-built MiG-29 fighters, the best the Yugoslav air force has,
were shot down: two by U.S. pilots in F-15s; the other by a Dutch
pilots flying a U.S.-built F-16.
</P>
<P>
   Maintenance crews here at Aviano spent Thursday surveying the
aircraft, rearming them for the evening's sorties and scrawling
their own messages on the side of laser-guided bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have no fear,'' read one, ``B-flight is here!!!''
</P>
<P>
   But a weapons specialist, Senior Airman Perry McCiver, 30, of
San Diego, Calif., said he prayed as U.S. planes roared off toward
the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prayed for our pilots. I prayed for the Kosovars,'' said
McCiver. ``I prayed for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   His appeals seemed well-placed.
</P>
<P>
   Serb troops spent the day extending their year-long offensive in
Kosovo, where attacks on ethnic Albanians over the past year have
left more than 2,000 dead and another quarter of a million
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's escalated today,'' National Security Adviser Samuel
Berger told reporters at the White House, referring to Milosevic.
``There have been some further burning of villages, further sweep
operations, some shelling into Albania, and it's obviously very
disturbing to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger and Clark both affirmed that U.S. information on the
ground situation in Kosovo was limited by the absence of 1,400
international monitors who left Kosovo over the weekend, as NATO
air strikes loomed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another layer of information was stripped away on Thursday,
when Yugoslavia expelled all journalists from NATO countries and
severed diplomatic relations with the United States, France,
Germany and Britain, the lead nations in the continuing air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo's provincial capital, Pristina, a CNN television news
crew was jumped by a half-dozen armed thugs, who smashed equipment,
set fire to one of their cars, slapped producer Alessio Vinci
across the face and jammed an assault rifle under the nose of
correspondent Brent Sadler.
</P>
<P>
   Serb troops arrived, established order and escorted a caravan
carrying remaining Western journalists to the Macedonia border.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon asserted that the escalation of Serb attacks on the
ground could result in increasingly aggressive air strikes
targeting the troops carrying out the repression in Kosovo and
their supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are focusing on the very forces that are being used, and
assembled for use, against the Kosovar Albanians,'' Bacon told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the 2.2 million people in
Kosovo, a province in southern Serbia, one of two states that,
along with Montenegro, that make up Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic stripped Kosovo of broad political autonomy in 1989,
and ethnic tensions gradually rose. A year ago, Albanian rebels
favoring independence began guerilla attacks against Serb security
forces, which responded with a brutal crackdown targeting villages
and civilians they identified as ``terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   In the face of the escalating violence Thursday, Berger stressed
that NATO military support for the Kosovars remained confined to
air strikes. There is no plan to send ground troops into Kosovo
from the United States or any other NATO country, Berger said,
unless a peace agreement is reached between Serbs and Kosovar
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the United States pushed ahead with the largest air
campaign to hit Europe since World War II, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright insisted that Milosevic could end the onslaught
with a phone call and a will to embrace peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diplomatic channels remain open,'' said Albright, noting that
U.S. envoy Christopher Hill was standing by at the U.S. Embassy in
Macedonia. ``They know his number.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from reaching out for peace, however, Milosevic remained
defiant.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no indication that there is any change at all in
Milosevic's position,'' Albright told reporters at the State
Department. ``He has not gotten the message yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Extending a potential face-saving opportunity to Milosevic,
Berger opened the possibility of renewed negotiations with
Milosevic over the terms of an internationally-backed peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   The accord, signed last week in France by representatives of the
Kosovar Albanians but so far rejected by Milosevic, calls for
sending a NATO peacekeeping force of 28,000 troops, 4,000 of them
American, into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   While the administration has insisted that it would not end the
bombing campaign unless Milosevic agrees to the NATO peacekeeping
force, Berger appeared to suggest that other aspects of the peace
treaty might be open to discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any changes that would be made would have to be accepted by
the Kosovars,'' Berger told reporters at the White House. ``If
there were proposed changes in the agreement, that would be
something that the Kosovars would have to accept.''
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said war and diplomacy should be backed with
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed the Serbia Democratization Act, which would
strengthen existing economic sanctions against the Milosevic
regime, boost humanitarian aid for his victims and promote
democratic opposition to replace his government.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for Mr. Milosevic's future, I don't care one way or the
other if he lives out his days in sunny Cyprus or if he will agree
to step aside and make way for democracy in Serbia,'' Helms said in
a speech on the Senate floor. ``The important thing is that he be
removed from power, whether voluntarily or not, and now.''

NATO FORCES LAUNCH ANOTHER ROUND OF AIRSTRIKES AT MILOSEVIC 

</HEADLINE>

By CRAGG HINES

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO forces hurled a fresh rain of missiles and
bombs on Yugoslav targets Thursday as President Clinton expressed
confidence that the airstrikes would soften President Slobodan
Milosevic's refusal to negotiate peace and autonomy in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the second night
of assault from warships in the Adriatic Sea and jets above the
Balkans would be ``another substantive strike; it will be severe.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said the new round of strikes would hammer forces that
have been terrorizing ethnic Albanians in the southern province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will focus more and more on achieving our primary goal,
which is to reduce the ability of the Yugoslav forces to target or
repress the Kosovar Albanians,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   A fleeting sign of accommodation by Milosevic's government was
discounted by the Clinton administration, which also turned aside
an Italian proposal for another round of diplomatic talks.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, supreme allied commander in Europe,
said the bombardment overall would be ``just as long and difficult
as President Milosevic requires it to be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to systematically and progressively attack,
disrupt, degrade, devastate and ultimately _ unless President
Milosevic complies with the demands of the international community
_ we're going to destroy these forces and their facilities and
support,'' Clark said at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Serb forces limited access to bombed areas Thursday, and damage
reports from the second wave of attacks were sketchy. But NATO
officials said all aircraft had returned safely despite Serb claims
that two planes had been downed. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Milosevic's response to the air salvos seemed subdued, but
Samuel Berger, President Clinton's national security adviser, said
Yugoslavia was shelling Albania as well as continuing its campaign
against Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Allied leaders said little about the level of damage wrought by
the airstrikes but sounded pleased after the first night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obviously early to say this, but from what we can
gather, they have been successful,'' British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   A Yugoslav commander said the first night's damage was
``minimal,'' but the Russian general staff in Moscow said the NATO
strikes badly damaged five military airfields, two factories, a
communications center, several barracks and a police training base.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian health minister, Dr. Leposava Milecevic, said on CNN
that 10 civilians and one soldier were killed and 60 other people
were wounded in the first night.
</P>
<P>
   The air attacks began Wednesday after Milosevic refused to
accede to demands from Washington and other western governments
that he agree to a cease-fire in Kosovo, grant ethnic Albanians
broad autonomy there and allow a NATO force to police the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is a southern province of Serbia. Two pieces of the old
Yugoslavia, Serbia and Montenegro, make up what now is formally
known as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Clinton was briefed by security advisers and
renewed his view that airstrikes, without follow-up ground
operations, could break Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we can create a situation in which we have limited
(Yugoslavia's) ability to make war and thereby increase the
prospects that (the Kosovar Albanians) can protect themselves
better,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   As in the first night, the initial barrage Thursday was cruise
missiles fired from U.S. warships in the Adriatic, to the west of
the Balkans. The Associated Press said that the USS Gonzalez fired
first but that two of the 18 missiles launched from the destroyer
failed and fell into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the campaign against
Milosevic's installations continued because ``nothing has changed.
He has not gotten the message yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright said diplomatic challenges remain open, but NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana said, ``We don't have any positive
response from President Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   After Albright's and Solana's briefings, Yugoslav Deputy Prime
Minister Vuk Draskovic suggested in a telephone interview with
Britain's Sky television that the Belgrade government was prepared
for new talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop bombing us and we will stop all operations against the
people, the terrorists who provoked NATO strikes against Serbia,''
Draskovic said. In Serbian parlance, ``terrorist'' referred to the
Albanian guerrillas in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema of Italy, whose nation
is host to several NATO air bases, proposed a return to diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that the time to give politics and diplomacy their
say is approaching,'' D'Alema said, contending the initial air
attacks had forced Serbs to halt their assaults in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Berger contradicted D'Alema on the point, saying: ``That's not
correct. We'll obviously point that out to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said degrading Milosevic's military force was ``a tough
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of respect for the Serb air defense
capabilities,'' Clark said, although there was little evidence much
use was made of the systems Wednesday and Thursday. ``It's a
country that has long prepared itself for war, and unfortunately
its armed forces have gained rather a lot of military experience
over the past decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said that in the first night's bombardment there were not
strikes on central Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, but he added:
``President Milosevic and his military leaders should understand
that there is no sanctuary for them, their military forces ...,
because they're part of the mechanism of the Serb military and
security forces, and the repression.''
</P>
<P>
   Across Kosovo's southern border, in the Macedonian capital of
Skopje, an angry crowd of about 2,000 massed outside the U.S.
Embassy and a hotel where international journalists and aid workers
are staying. The demonstrators threw fire bombs at the embassy and
hurled stones at cars in the hotel parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration, at dusk Balkan time, ended soon after
Macedonian security forces arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all safe,'' Albright said of embassy personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters also gathered outside the embassies of three other
NATO nations _ France, Britain and Germany. Police dispersed them
with tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia, a former republic of Yugoslavia that was recognized
as independent in 1993, has a Serbian minority population.

SOME QUESTION US RATIONALE FOR AIR ATTACKS ON YUGOSLAVIA
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ President Clinton is using a familiar rationale
to justify intervention in Yugoslavia: US credibility in the world
is at stake and inaction would allow the conflict to spread and
encourage Hitler-like dictators to commit massive atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   The Adolf Hitler of the 1990s, in Clinton's analogy, is Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic. But while Milosevic may be a brutal,
even genocidal, ruler, the comparisons with the Nazi leader are a
stretch, according to historians and political analysts.
</P>
<P>
   His self-styled Serbian empire, far from expanding, is shrinking
every day. Indeed, he is faced with an insurgency that has used its
own dirty tactics, including targeting Serb police, in its pursuit
of independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Germany and Japan were imperialist powers. Milosevic has no
grand plan except to hold on to Serbia,'' said Francis X. Winters,
professor of ethics and international affairs at Georgetown
University. ``As far as I know the Albanians in Kosovo have thrown
down the gauntlet. They want independence and they are going to
fight for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the administration's policy on Kosovo has been
shaped by the West's appeasement of Nazi Germany before World War
II, and more recently by the human cost of inaction in the face of
Serb atrocities during the Bosnian civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, the daughter of a
Czech diplomat, has been deeply influenced by the West's
abandonment of Czechoslovakia to the Nazis, analysts say. And the
State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, recently attacked
critics of US action in Kosovo as favoring the ``appeasement'' of
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sarajevo, the capital of neighboring Bosnia, is where World
War I began. World War II and the Holocaust engulfed this region,''
Clinton said in defense of military action. ``In both wars Euro pe
was slow to recognize the dangers.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Galbraith, US ambassador to Croatia from 1993 to 1998,
said the administration's fear that Kosovo is the ``powder keg''
that will ignite the entire Balkans in war is overstated.
</P>
<P>
   In 1914, the murder of Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo by a Serb
nationalist sparked World War I because powerful European nations
had conflicting territorial ambitions in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   While Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin threatened to provide
military assistance to the Serbs, a traditional Russian ally,
analysts doubt Russia has the power to challenge NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world has changed since the beginning of the century and I
think this cannot spread beyond Macedonia and Albania,'' Galbraith
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the actors from 1914 are now on the same side. The
Russians disagree with the tactics but there is nothing they can or
will do.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of the administration are concerned that the NATO
attack may lead Washington into a Vietnam-like quagmire that will
require a long-term military commitment, including US ground
troops, in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people have good reason to fear that we are
heading toward another permanent garrison of Americans in a Balkan
country where our mission is confused and our exit strategy is a
complete mystery,'' said Senator John McCain, a Republicanfrom
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat, said the
administration has exaggerated the threat Milosevic presents to
stability in the Balkans. And he added that Clinton and his
advisers need to limit the public's expectations about what
airstrikes are likely to accomplish in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He said the United States should limit its objectives to
degrading Milosevic's military and to minimizing his ability to
conduct ethnic cleansing. Otherwise, he said, the administration is
setting itself up for failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be realistic in not setting goals that
militarily you can't achieve,'' said Kerry, a Vietnam veteran. ``We
don't have the power to bring him to the peace table.''

DRIVERS LIKE `DRY' RUN IN RETURN TO TMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY D. BOGGS 
c.1999 Special to Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ No rain. No major injuries. No complaints.
And the only ``weeping'' yesterday probably came from Mark Martin
fans, who saw Dave Blaney bump the two-time Texas Motor Speedway
winner off the Busch Grand National pole.
</P>
<P>
   After a $3.2 million revamping of the oft-maligned TMS, NASCAR
drivers gave a thumbs-up to the superspeedway Darrell Waltrip
compared to the Alamo last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they did a good job,'' said Terry Labonte, a NASCAR
Winston Cup regular who is also competing in tomorrow's BGN
Coca-Cola 300.
</P>
<P>
   Added Kenny Irwin Jr.: ``The track is the best it has ever
been.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a far cry from last year, when NASCAR officials demanded
speedway improvements after drainage problems that had water
``weeping'' through the pavement. Or from 1997 and '98, when
drivers seethed over the transition coming off Turn 4. The only
blemishes on yesterday's events might have been five drivers
hitting the wall in Turn 2.
</P>
<P>
   Reconstruction on the 1.5-mile speedway began April 22 after
Martin won the NASCAR Winston Cup event on April 5. A new drainage
system was installed, and the entrances and exits of the turns were
modified.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Gossage, TMS vice president and general manager, praised
speedway owner Bruton Smith for the speedway's new look.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bruton walked in my door last year and said we need to fix
it,'' Gossage said. ``And I said, `I agree. Give me a budget.' And
he said, `Fix it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, the main complaint from drivers seemed to be about a
bump between Turn 1 and Turn 2.
</P>
<P>
   But even that didn't bother Busch driver Adam Petty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it might be a fixable bump,'' he said, ``but it's also a
characteristic of this racetrack. It's just something you have to
work around.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossage said he sat in Jeff Gordon's motorhome yesterday and
``had a much different conversation than we had last year.''
</P>
<P>
   What did Gordon say last year?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't repeat that,'' Gossage said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like a lot of the other drivers. ... When it was all
said and done, they apologized for what they said and we apologized
for what we said, and everything kind of snowballed last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said he found the track similar to how it was last year,
except that ``it's dry. There's no water on the track.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I really don't have any complaints about the racetrack,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gossage said the fact that practice started on time after a
half-inch of rain fell Wednesday night should put the ``weeping''
rumors to rest. But he's approaching the weekend with caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not about to stand here and tell you mission
accomplished,'' he said. ``We'll let \Rthe drivers\S tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   But yesterday was a good start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think things are OK, but we've got to prove ourselves,''
Gossage said. ``And that's what we're going to try to do this
weekend.''

U.S. AND CHINA IN PRODUCTIVE TALKS ON BEIJING'S ENTRY TO TRADE
GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a series of closed-door negotiations and
back-channel messages, the United States and China are racing to
reach a broad accord in the next two weeks that could pave the way
for Beijing to enter the World Trade Organization, even as the
White House fears the effort could be torpedoed by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts the two sides are making enormous progress after
years of stalemate. China, said an American participant in the
talks, has offered ``more market opening concessions in the past
three weeks than in the past three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as bombs were falling in Kosovo, President Clinton met his
top economic advisers late Thursday afternoon to review the status
of the negotiations, according to administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few weeks ago the White House was pressing for a deal as
a diplomatic triumph to accompany the April visit of Chinese Prime
Minister Zhu Rongji. Now, however, the administration is riven with
second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. assent for China to join the trade organization will
require at least the indirect approval of Congress, with the
amendment of the law that currently requires an annual renewal of
China's trade status. In the current atmosphere on Capitol Hill,
where investigations into China's suspected nuclear thefts are
intertwined with long-running concerns over human rights, Tibet,
Taiwan and a soaring trade deficit, many of the president's
advisers fear that Clinton could be forced to expend scarce
political capital on a losing battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the longest time the problem was that the Chinese wouldn't
give,'' one participant in the talks said this week. ``Now the
Chinese are giving _ not enough, but they clearly want a deal _ and
the White House has cold feet.''
</P>
<P>
   In public, administration officials say they are committed to
getting China into the trade group _ if the Chinese make
politically and economically painful concessions. Allowing a far
greater range of foreign investment in China, dramatically reducing
protective tariffs and agreeing to open markets to imports of
everything from cars to wheat could remake the way the world does
business with the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   But major sticking points remain, including whether China will
loosen restrictions on foreign insurance companies to sell policies
in China, open the telecommunications and financial services
markets to wide-scale foreign investment, and reduce or eliminate
China's requirements that outsiders deal through state-run
companies.
</P>
<P>
   For Zhu and President Jiang Zemin, the negotiation has
enormously high stakes, especially at a time of economic slowdown
and surging unemployment in China. Mishandled, opening the market
rapidly to foreign competition could worsen China's precarious
economic condition. But failing to strike a deal has costs _ in
prestige and in foreign confidence that China is committed to
economic changes that will aid foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   At a White House meeting last weekend, however, it became clear
that the political calculus was equally complex here. National
Security Adviser Samuel Berger has pushed hardest to win a deal,
viewing it as the only area in which Washington and Beijing can
achieve a major diplomatic victory in the waning years of the
Clinton presidency, senior administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin have also pressed for a deal, though only on
the condition that the Chinese make major concessions that will
insulate the agreement from political attack in Congress, according
to officials who have attended the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's domestic advisers, including White House chief of
staff John Podesta and National Economic Council Chairman Gene
Sperling, now worry that no deal will satisfy the growing chorus of
China critics in Congress, some of the participants in the internal
debate say. ``Before the latest China controversies we needed a
good deal,'' one senior official said, ``and now we need a
spectacular one.''
</P>
<P>
   Others in the White House worry that a battle over China policy
in Congress would unite liberal Democrats and conservative
Republicans who, for different reasons, bitterly oppose a trade
deal with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling, playing down the reports of dissent, insisted in an
interview that ``there is unanimous agreement that if China were to
meet the high test we are setting for them, then we should go
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   But the question of whether China has given enough will be a
matter of interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The test will come from the reaction of the business
community,'' Ms. Barshefsky, who is considering traveling to China
this weekend to push a deal along, said Wednesday. ``If the
agricultural community, or the telecommunications industry says
it's inadequate, then its inadequate. It's that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   But in China's 13-year effort to join the organization that sets
global trading rules and arbitrates disputes, nothing has proved
simple. The next two weeks seem bound to be marked by brinkmanship,
economic calculation and geo-political strategizing that may have
to do more with politics in both nations than with trade.
</P>
<P>
   For China, the immediate advantages of joining the trade
organization are modest. There is the issue of national prestige,
fueled by the fear that Taiwan might be admitted before the
mainland. China would get a measure of protection against
unilateral trade sanctions imposed by the United States or other
nations. Beijing would be able to challenge U.S. trade restrictions
in front of trade organization judges.
</P>
<P>
   Most of China's 1.2 billion people work in agriculture, so the
arguments over opening the market to agricultural imports has been
particularly bitter. And China has sought to replicate Japan's
strategy in automobiles and industrial machinery: Import
technology, but restrict foreign competition until a domestic
industry flourishes.
</P>
<P>
   China's strategy until recently was to promise market openings,
but insist on lengthy transitions _ up to 15 years, for example, to
fully open the auto market. Gradually, Zhu has switched course,
promising most market openings within three to five years. And in
the last few days, China has also offered to allow foreign
companies to hold up to 35 percent of telecommunications companies.
Until now, foreigners have been barred from investing in telephone
companies. The United States is insisting on 50 percent foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
   But as Washington's nervousness increases, so does the pressure
on Ms. Barshefsky to deliver an impressive deal _ or no deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``As compared to six months ago, or even three weeks ago, the
deal has to be more bulletproof,'' said Nicholas Lardy, a senior
fellow at the Brookings Institution and one of the country's
leading scholars on the Chinese economy. ``There are people in
Congress who don't want to know the details, because they are so
angry about other things.''

TREASURY PRICES EASE AS FED MEETING IS AWAITED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Prices of Treasury securities sagged Thursday as
market participants awaited next week's meeting of the Federal
Reserve's policy-setting committee.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 30-year bond was up 5 basis points, or
hundredths of a percentage point, to 5.58 percent, from 5.53
percent Wednesday. Its price, which moves in the opposite
direction, fell 23/32, to 96 7/32.
</P>
<P>
   Most investors were also waiting for fresh signs that the
economy was indeed slowing before making a stronger commitment to
buy government securities. The rally in the stock market also meant
that some cash found its way out of Treasuries and into the
corporate debt and equity markets. The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 169.55 points, finishing at 9,836.39
</P>
<P>
   A heavy supply of competing paper also applied pressure to
Treasury securities, as Citigroup and Mexico led a pack of
borrowers to the public debt market. Corporations and other
borrowers have been offering higher yields than Treasuries have
been offering on new debt, and this week's sales showed decent
demand, according to some traders.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico sold $1 billion in global bonds Thursday through Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter with a 9.75 percent coupon at a price to yield
449 basis points more than Treasuries. Citigroup is expected to
price a two-part global bond deal Friday: $750 million each in
five-year and 10-year maturities. Salomon Smith Barney is the lead
underwriter.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Chan, managing director and chief economist for Banc One
Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio, said, ``Perhaps the only
consolation that the credit markets can derive at present is that a
few fundamental factors should continue to lessen some of
investors' greatest fears.'' Looking toward Tuesday's meeting of
the Federal Open Market Committee, he said it was unlikely ``that
policy-makers will do anything to rock the boat,''especially given
the possibility that the military action against Yugoslavia could
have a negative impact on consumer sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   With investors alert for any signs that the economy is slowing
or that inflation is picking up, there has been little to change
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Economic reports Thursday offered renewed signs of economic
strength. For the seventh consecutive week, movement in initial
unemployment claims kept the four-week moving average in claims
below 300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Although sales of existing homes were down somewhat, Chan said,
they were not soft enough relative to expectations to indicate that
the housing sector would put a damper on economic growth.

EUROPEAN UNION STRUGGLES TO AGREE ON BUDGET REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Leaders of the European Union struggled early Friday to
reach an agreement on a reform of the 15-nation bloc's $92 billion
annual budget that would eventually make it possible for Poland,
the Czech Republic and Hungary to join.
</P>
<P>
   A sometimes bitter conflict that took the summit meeting into
early Friday morning, more than 12 hours past its scheduled
conclusion at noon Thursday, pitted northern nations that tend to
be the main contributors to the budget against southern countries
that are its main beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, whose net annual contribution to the budget of about
$12 billion is by far the largest, appeared determined to complete
negotiations that have become an important test for the Social
Democratic chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, but France, Spain and
Italy seemed unready to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Joschka Fischer, the German foreign minister, described the
talks as ``extremely difficult,'' because they involve ``large
amounts of money and legitimate national interests.'' He added that
he was not ready to predict success.
</P>
<P>
   But having worked tirelessly on the budget issue over the past
10 days, visiting most European capitals, Schroeder seemed
unwilling to abandon an effort seen by Germany as critical to
cementing the unity of Europe by bringing in former East Bloc
members. After a shaky first six months in office, the chancellor
is also in acute need of a conspicuous diplomatic success.
</P>
<P>
   The chief stumbling blocks to an accord, officials said, were
French resistance to reforms of an expensive European agricultural
policy that benefits its more than 1 million farmers; Spanish
objections to cuts in a regional fund that provides European Union
money to poorer countries, and objections from several delegations
to a rebate Britain receives that is worth more than $3 billion a
year.
</P>
<P>
   European farm spending, under a system that is designed to
shield the Union's farmers from lower world market prices, accounts
for about half of the European Union budget. With its big
agricultural sector, and its highly vocal farmers, France is
extremely sensitive to any attempt to change the way agricultural
policy works.
</P>
<P>
   But Germany, with a much smaller farm sector and the absolute
conviction that without reform spending would spiral if new members
were admitted, has proposed that outlay on agriculture be capped at
about $44 billion a year for the period from 2000 to 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Like France, Spain also objected to reform, both in the farm
sector and in the various forms of regional aid that go to poorer
European countries. This aid, designed to bring all European Union
countries to broadly the same economic level, accounts for close to
a third of the European budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spain will not accept any cuts from the level of funding it
now receives,'' the Spanish finance minister, Rodrigo de Rato,
said. Greece's prime minister, Costas Simitis, also objected to any
change. ``Our per-capita income is 20 percent below the European
average,'' he said. ``You can't say we do not need help anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the squabbling, it was clear that lethargic economies in
Europe have made leaders extremely sensitive to any suggestion that
funding will be cut off. There is simply not enough money in
national coffers to compensate for any European funds that are
withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   With money such a sensitive issue, several countries focused on
the more than $3 billion that Britain has been receiving as a
rebate each year since 1984. The payment, negotiated by Margaret
Thatcher, represents about 60 percent of the difference between its
contributions and the amount Britain receives in European Union
spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fourteen countries say Britain has to make an effort,'' the
Belgian finance minister, Jean-Jacques Viseur, said. ``If not, it
will be impossible for the others to be flexible in their budget
contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   The arguments inevitably seemed trivial as several of the
countries at the summit meeting pursued a bombing campaign in
Yugoslavia as part of the NATO force attacking there. Leaders
appeared aware that an agreement would amount to a critical display
of European unity at a sensitive time, while failure would be
ominous.
</P>
<P>
   As they talked, the leaders came under scathing criticism from
prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who said they were
about to ``dictate to Israel the results of the negotiations with
the Palestinians by supporting a Palestinian state.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's outburst was apparently based on a draft of a
statement the leaders intend to make on the situation in the Middle
East. Officials said the European leaders appeared to ready to
refer explicitly to a Palestinian right to a state and to say that,
while this state should emerge from negotiation, Israel had no
right to veto it.
</P>
<P>
   Such wording, if approved, would go beyond previous official
European positions and anything said up to now by the United States
about Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is especially regrettable that it is Europe, where one
third of the Jewish nation perished, that deems fit to impose a
solution that endangers the Jewish state and contradicts its
interests,'' Netanyahu said.
</P>

STOCKS ACROSS THE BOARD MARCH VIGOROUSLY UPWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks posted sharp gains across the board Thursday
as investors reacted to a profit surge at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, a deal solidifying ties between America Online and Ebay,
and an analyst's favorable report on Procter &AMP; Gamble. Even
long-depressed stocks of smaller companies gained.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks pushed higher through the day, with the rally in
technology shares that began late Wednesday gathering momentum and
the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index doubling its gain in
the final quarter hour to close ahead by 2.94 percent, the biggest
gain since Feb. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, the most valuable American company, soared 8 11/16,
to 179 15/16, spurred by word that it had offered a plan to settle
the government's antitrust suit against it.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which had fallen for four
straight days, surged 169.55 points, or 1.75 percent, to finish at
9,836.39, covering half the ground it needed at the opening
Thursday morning to reach the elusive 10,000 mark it touched
briefly last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard and Poor's 500 Stock Index made a similar gain,
rising 21.40 points, or 1.69 percent, to close at 1,289.99.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble, up 5[ to 100{, and American Express, up 5], to
122{, accounted for more than a quarter of the Dow's gain.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble, which touched a record 100 15/16, was lifted
by comments of Carol Wilke, who covers the company for Prudential
Securities and met with its senior management Wednesday. She
predicted that a global restructuring, whose details are yet to be
spelled out, would accelerate earnings growth and raised her price
target for the stock to 115 from 100 over the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Small-company stocks, as gauged by the Russell 2000 index, did
even better, with a surge of 2.23 percent, as investors appeared to
seek value in this lagging sector. The Russell 2000 is still down
6.87 percent for the year; in contrast, the Nasdaq composite has
gained 11.04 percent and the Dow industrials, 7.13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``See how quickly sentiment can shift,'' said Mary Farrell, a
senior strategist at PaineWebber. ``The rally is so broad, so
across-the-board.'' Nonetheless, she cautioned against too much
exuberance when the economy may have begun to slow. ``It's hard to
argue for a sustained upward move from here,'' Ms. Farrell said.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas markets also contributed to the buoyancy on Wall
Street. The main Tokyo index climbed 3.03 percent, and European
markets were ahead by more than 1 percent. Brazil's Bovespa,
benefiting from an interest-rate cut, jumped 4.88 percent, to an
eight-month high.
</P>
<P>
   The rally in stocks also bucked a rise in interest rates traced
by some analysts to an unexpected drop in the number of people
making first-time claims for jobless benefits last week and to a
very small decline from January's record pace of home sales. The
Federal Reserve has a monetary policy meeting on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks were among Thursday's most prominent winners.
Morgan Stanley jumped 5{, to 103~; Schwab, 6[, to 90{; Donaldson
Lufkin, 4 15/16, to 65\, Lehman Brothers 3}, to 58~; Citigroup, 2~,
to 63, and Knight/Trimark, 3 15/16, to 56 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   Among computer-related stocks, gainers included America Online,
rising 9], to 126{; Ebay, 14, to 159]; Amazon.com, 16 3/16, to
139~; EMC, 5 3/16, to 124 1/16, and Cisco, 3, to 107 7/16. Intel,
however, eased 1 5/16, to 117 15/16, and Micron Technology fell 4
9/16, to 47 7/16, on concern about demand for memory chips and a
weak price climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like the worst is over, at least for right now,''
said Tim Grazioso, manager of Nasdaq trading at Cantor Fitzgerald,
referring to the recent market downdraft in which technology stocks
were battered severely. He said that demand for personal computers
seemed to be holding up relatively well and that he expected
further institutional buying of stocks before the quarter ends on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of money that still has to get into the
market,'' Grazioso said, some of it fresh and some to be lured from
the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues led declining
ones by a 19 to 11 ratio, the broadest advance since March 5. But
243 issues fell to 52-week lows while 142 made new highs; for 1999
alone, 27 made new highs and 77, new lows.
</P>
<P>
   Volume rose to 784.23 million on the New York Stock Exchange,
from 762.76 million on Wednesday.

JURY DELIBERATES IN KEVORKIAN'S TRIAL ON MURDER CHARGES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. _ Whether Dr. Jack Kevorkian is a martyr trying
to end the suffering of those close to death or a cold-blooded
killer who used a dying man to heighten his own political agenda
will be left for a Michigan jury to decide Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Legal analysts said there is a strong case against Kervorkian,
70, who videotaped himself administering a lethal injection of
chemicals to 52-year-old Thomas Youk. But they questioned whether
the jury would decide to send the elderly crusader to prison for
the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors discussed the case for five hours Thursday and will
resume deliberations this morning. Kevorkian was charged with
first-degree murder, but Judge Jessica Cooper told jurors they
could consider second-degree murder or involuntary manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   By noon Thursday, Kevorkian and the prosecution had completed
spirited _ and often unorthodox _ final arguments, but the media
spectacle on the third floor of Oakland County Courthouse had just
begun.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 disabled protesters, calling themselves ``Not Dead
Yet,'' sat in the courtroom and lined the court halls in their
wheelchairs. Some stood outside the courthouse chanting ``Jail
Jack.'' Dozens of reporters, from all over the world, packed into a
tiny room to watch the trial unfold.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the chaos resulted from the fact that the man known as
``Doctor Death'' was acting for the first time in five trials as
his own lawyer. Believing that only he could argue the case with
the proper passion, Kevorkian insisted on leading his own defense,
a condition that was unacceptable to his former attorney, Geoffrey
Fieger.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian, who says he has presided over 130 assisted suicides,
including four Massachusetts residents since 1996, has been at the
forefront in the debate over physician-assisted suicide. He has
been tried four times on assisted-suicide charges, three ending in
acquittal, and one in a mistrial. This was the first time he was
charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just look at me,'' Kevorkian said in his final arguments,
which lasted 25 minutes. ``Honestly, do you see a criminal and a
murderer? If you do, you must convict. And then, take the harsh
judgment of history. And if you don't, then you must acquit.''
</P>
<P>
   When Circuit Judge Jessica Cooper threw out Kevorkian's request
to allow Youk's family to testify, he was left to convince the jury
that he did not deliberately kill Youk, who suffered from
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, better known as Lou Gehrig's
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a gray suit and maroon tie, Kevorkian rambled in his
final arguments and seemed exasperated as the prosecution hammered
away with objections. At one time, he apologized when the
prosecution argued that Kevorkian was testifying rather than given
his final statement.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed the antithesis of John Skrzynski, the smooth-talking
prosecutor who characterized Kevorkian as a man on a fatal mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came like a medical hitman in the night,'' said Skrzynski,
who argued that Kevorkian staged Youk's death last September, when
he gave the videotape to CBS News's ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But that wasn't a movie. That was a man killed before your
eyes,'' Skrzynski said.
</P>
<P>
   But Kevorkian, comparing himself to civil rights leaders, told
jurors that he was anything but a criminal. ``When Rosa Parks sat
on the bus, was that a crime?'' Kevorkian asked. ``Did Martin
Luther King want to go to jail?''
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian argued that he was doing his duty as a physician when
he injected Youk with the lethal dose of chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Irving Tukel, a Michigan defense lawyer, said that if the jury
focuses on the facts of the case, they would convict. But if they
acquit, it could be an example of ``jury nullification,'' in which
jurors essentially declare the law invalid.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a message that a lot of people like,'' Tukel said. He
added: ``He himself makes it very difficult to like him.''
</P>
<P>
   When the jury broke for lunch Thursday, Youk's widow told
reporters that she was hurt when the judge refused to allow her to
speak on Kevorkian's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Several minutes later, Kevorkian sat at a table in the
courthouse lunchroom with his legal advisers and Youk's relatives.
While he ate a hot dog and chips, protesters sitting near him
prayed aloud that he would lose the case.
</P>
<P>
   Don Downey, 30, said that when he was paralyzed 10 years ago
after an accident, he thought his life wasn't worth living.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably would have accepted Kevorkian's offer,'' he said.

AFTER 10 YEARS, WHAT SICKENS AIRLINE ATTENDANTS REMAINS A MYSTERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For 10 years, Alaska Airlines flight attendants have
complained that the air they breathe at work is making them sick.
</P>
<P>
   And for 10 years, Alaska Airlines managers have said they don't
know what's causing the illnesses among dozens of its 1,900 flight
attendants.
</P>
<P>
   The flight attendants blame a range of maladies _ headaches,
goiters, tremors and lost mental abilities _ on toxic fumes they
believe are created by hydraulic fluid in airliner ventilation
systems. And they say most of their problems occur on MD-80
jetliners, which are the backbone of the Alaska's West Coast
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a scary thing _ you don't know when you get on a plane
whether it might happen,'' said Joni Benson, an Alaska flight
attendant and Association of Flight Attendants union official.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska's response is unequivocal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not coming from our airplanes,'' said John Fowler, an
executive vice president who oversees maintenance and operations
for the Seattle-based airline.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska executives stress that passengers' health is not in
jeopardy and that reports of illness have centered on flight
attendants.
</P>
<P>
   Still, five flight attendants are too ill to work and 15 are on
reduced schedules, Benson said.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jacobs has suffered tremors since 1997, when, she says, she
worked on an MD-80 that was so smoky she could see only a few rows
of seats away when she boarded the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she supports herself with welfare, food stamps and the
help of others. Two of her three teen-age sons now live with her
ex-husband for economic reasons. Besides, she says, they get
embarrassed when she shakes uncontrollably in public.
</P>
<P>
   Shaving her legs can leave them bloody. Pulling a dish from the
oven with her shaking hands can pepper her fingers with small
burns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like it's my body, but the person I was _ I'm not that
person,'' said Jacobs, 37. ``It's not something I can forget. It's
an everyday part of life.''
</P>
<P>
   From July 1989 to January 1999, flight attendants documented 760
instances of air-quality problems involving 900 flight attendants.
Some reports described odors like burning plastic, dirty socks or
nail-polish remover. Smoke or mist sometimes accompanied the odors.
Other times, flight attendants said they felt sick but saw or
smelled nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs and other flight attendants have filed hundreds of
worker's compensation claims in Washington, Oregon and California.
They've asked state lawmakers and Congress for help. Some have
filed a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   But after a decade of concern, the cause of their illness
remains elusive: Federal investigators and the airline's own
consultants have looked, and found nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why they are ill,'' said Ed White, Alaska's vice
president of customer service. ``I am absolutely convinced that
there is not something in the aircraft environment that caused
their illnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Alaska has invested heavily in modifications, new
maintenance procedures and studies aimed at pinpointing and solving
any problems.
</P>
<P>
   While Alaska also flies Boeing 737s, about 75 percent of the air
quality complaints involve MD-80s. Those complaints began in 1989,
five years after the airline bought its first MD-80. It expanded
the fleet in 1986 through acquisition of Jet America of Long Beach,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Blaming the plane, though, is problematic. Other major airlines,
including American and Delta, fly MD-80s, but only Alaska has such
a high level of air quality complaints.
</P>
<P>
   With investigators so far unable to find a connection between
the illnesses and the planes, the Washington state Department of
Labor and Industries wants further study of Alaska's MD-80s. Dr.
Lee Glass, the department's associate medical director, is trying
to get the company and union to agree to a health-hazard
investigation, then abide by its results.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's significant to me when I hear these recurrent
complaints,'' Glass said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while L&AMP;I has received hundreds of worker's compensation
claims from flight attendants, none has won a claim initially
rejected by the airline.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has been lacking ... is evidence that there has been an
exposure of a toxic nature or that there is a definable physical
condition or that there is a link between a known exposure and a
physical condition,'' Glass said.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska and its flight attendant union have yet to agree on the
study. Both sides have doubts that they will.
</P>
<P>
   A study may be long overdue, said Dr. Scott Barnhart, director
of the University of Washington's occupational and environmental
medicine program.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one person from a workplace comes in with, say, asthma, you
might say people get asthma for lots of reasons. But when five
people come in with asthma, then that begins to raise a question
about whether there is something going on with exposure in the work
place,'' Barnhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Labor and Industries also is under pressure from the Washington
Legislature. After hearing testimony from Alaska flight attendants,
the Senate earlier this year passed a bill that requires study of
claims of workers who believe they were sickened by chemical
exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a cause may be harder than finding a needle in a field
of haystacks. Alaska has 14,000 departures a month, while the union
records about seven air quality problems a month.
</P>
<P>
   The rarity of incidents may explain why the problem appears
limited to flight attendants. If exposed to something that might be
making flight attendants ill, a passenger might not connect it to
the trip or might dismiss any symptoms to the flu or some other
common ailment.
</P>
<P>
   State officials believe that only one Alaska pilot has filed a
worker's compensation claim over the fumes. The lack of pilot
complaints, Alaska managers believe, calls into question whether
anything on the company planes are making people sick. But flight
attendants counter that pilots are unlikely to file claims because
they could face grounding if they say they were exposed to toxins.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints of headaches, dizziness, blurred vision, mental
confusion and other symptoms sparked a National Institute of
Occupational Safety and Health study in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency, the country's chief investigator of work-place
hazards, could find nothing amiss on MD-80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cause of most of these incidents remains undetermined,''
the agency concluded. ``Neither the incident reports nor the
environmental investigations provide a satisfactory explanation for
the seemingly higher rate of incidents in Alaska Airlines' MD-80
airplanes.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency called for more study, and flight attendants continue
to fill out ``irregularity reports'' about cabin air quality.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska management studied and dismissed several theories
involving radiation, cleaning fluids, ozone, volcanic dust and
other possibilities, said White, the vice president of customer
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone could make a magic wand or a crystal ball that could
identify what is causing the illness,'' said Fowler, the Alaska
vice president, ``we would ask them what it is and get it fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the airline's frustration is knowledge that about
1,200 MD-80s are in service worldwide, with only Alaska
experiencing so many air quality complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The flight attendants' union attributes that to Alaska's method
of dealing with those complaints. Other airlines ground and clean
MD-80s with fume problems before they return to service, they say.
</P>
<P>
   At Alaska, ``They send one flight crew out on an ambulance and a
new crew in the plane,'' said Benson, of the flight attendant's
union.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska managers reject that notion. Fowler said Alaska does more
than other airlines. If fumes are visible, it cleans ventilation
systems, replaces seat covers, washes walls, steam-cleans or
removes carpeting and puts in new filters, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aggravating the frustration is the occupational safety no-man's
land where flight attendants work. Pilots and flight attendants
working on airplanes are not covered by the usual worker safety
laws. The Federal Aviation Administration reserves the right to
police on-the-job safety for flight crews.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA sets health standards for pilots, but not flight
attendants. It has not taken an active role in questions about air
quality on Alaska jets. Instead, the agency monitors Alaska's work
and is satisfied with the airline's actions, said Mitch Barker, an
FAA spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Because Alaska is self-insured, worker's compensation claims are
handled internally unless they are rejected. In that event, they go
to the Washington Department of Labor and Industries.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska says it has approved some claims for short-term medical
problems in cases where there was smoke in the cabin, but it has
not covered long-term illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated flight attendants filed suit in June 1998, with 26
now suing Alaska, McDonnell-Douglas and Allied Signal, which makes
some MD-80 equipment. Boeing acquired McDonnell-Douglas in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The case, which could go to trial next year, stems from what the
flight attendant's union considers a solution to the mystery. In
1997, an Alaska mechanic suggested that flight attendants compare
reports of hydraulic-fluid leaks with air quality complaints,
Benson said.
</P>
<P>
   Hydraulic fluid, which is a synthetic compound, can be harmful
if absorbed through skin or swallowed. If partly burned, it
produces volatile organic compounds and carbon monoxide.
</P>
<P>
   Hydraulic fluid spills have been associated with some
high-profile emergencies. In March 1996, a hydraulic leak on an
Alaska MD-80 heading toward Las Vegas caused a hot plastic smell.
Three flight attendants, two pilots and three passengers were taken
to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, hydraulic fluid got into an Alaska MD-80's
auxiliary power unit _ a small jet engine that powers air
conditioning and other systems when the plane is on the ground.
Fumes spread through the cabin as the plane was taxiing to the gate
in San Francisco, forcing evacuation on the taxiway.
</P>
<P>
   And in February 1998, spilled hydraulic fluid got into the
ventilation system of an Alaska MD-80 on the ground at Sea-Tac
Airport. Three flight attendants and four passengers complained of
dizziness, shortness of breath and headaches.
</P>
<P>
   The union's theory is this: Hydraulic fluid leaks into the
auxiliary power unit. Heat from the unit, and later the engines,
degrades the fluid, producing a neurotoxin _ a poison that affects
the nervous system _ which circulates through the ventilation
system.
</P>
<P>
   Some hydraulic lines associated with engine thrust reversers
pass near the auxiliary power unit, and drains near the power unit
get rid of any nearby leaks.
</P>
<P>
   The MD-80's maker says there's no design flaw that would cause
the fumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every investigation has exonerated the airplane. It's
something of a mystery,'' said John Thom, a spokesman for Boeing in
Long Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska acknowledges that hydraulic leaks occur and can cause
temporary illnesses, but the airline says it has taken extensive
and expensive measures to reduce the chances of leaks, including
modifications to improve the drains, dams to keep fluid from
reaching the power unit, stronger clamps and thicker cable to
prevent leaks near the unit.
</P>
<P>
   The airline also has put more sensitive air filters on MD-80s
and some 737s, Fowler said, adding that Alaska pioneered some of
the changes.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska also hired an outside laboratory to test the union's
theory. Hydraulic fluid was heated to try to produce a specific
neurotoxin _ without success. In 1998 an MD-80 that had been the
source of several complaints was tested on the ground in Spokane.
The auxiliary power unit was run for six hours, but no neurotoxins
were detected.
</P>
<P>
   ``In sum, all of the scientific evidence has shown that there is
nothing in the cabin environment of our aircraft that poses a risk
to either our employees or our customers,'' Alaska executives wrote
last week to pilots and flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   But union officials criticize those tests, saying the hydraulic
fluid wasn't heated correctly in the lab and that the plane in
Spokane was cleaned first.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler said the plane got no special attention.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska and its flight attendants aren't alone in their concern
about the illness and the search for its cause.
</P>
<P>
   The Teamsters local that represents flight attendants at
Canada's Air BC is collecting air quality data for analysis, said
Don Davies, a union lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian flight attendants also complain of tremors, a metalic
taste and cognitive problems. But the plane under scrutiny in
Canada and in Australia is the BAE 146, a British Aerospace jet.
</P>
<P>
   In Australia, Ansett airlines flight attendants have filed
compensation claims, complaining of diseases from fumes in the
cabin. One Ansett pilot reported feeling ``drunk as a skunk'' from
fumes while landing at Brisbane.
</P>
<P>
   In what may be the world's first study of its type, Ansett, the
Australian government and an American engineering association will
begin looking at potential air contaminants in May.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health,
meanwhile, has declined to study the hydraulic fluid issue, telling
Alaska's flight attendant's union in 1998 that its neurotoxin
theory seems unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the dispute has become a series of claims and
counterclaims in letters between the union and the company. The
union accused Alaska of a cover-up in a February letter to flight
attendants; Alaska responded last week to what it called false
accusations by the union.
</P>
<P>
   That level of distrust may stand in the way of the study the
state would like to see.
</P>
<P>
   So the mystery remains unsolved, even as reports of air quality
incidents and illnesses continue.

THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL OF A FLIGHT ATTENDANT WITH `SKYPOXIA' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Deby Bradford and her fellow Alaska Airlines MD-80
flight attendants used to call it ``skypoxia.''
</P>
<P>
   They had the giddiness of three martinis, without taking a sip.
</P>
<P>
   A simple remark would double them over in laughter, tears
rolling down their cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   Routine tasks became impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford recalls not being able to make change for a passenger
who bought a cocktail and trying to put ice in a soda can instead
of the glass.
</P>
<P>
   And there was the time she found a baby bottle on the plane and
ran into the Los Angeles terminal to return it to the passenger.
She found herself lost, unable to find her way back to the Alaska
gate.
</P>
<P>
   It might be comical if it weren't so serious. Bradford believes
she was exposed to toxic fumes, damaging her health and her
cognitive abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she is striving to rid herself of poisons she believes
invaded her body and to regain her full mental abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wrong thing to be happening to people,'' said Bradford,
47, of Edmonds, Wash. ``It's just so wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Becoming a flight attendant seemed natural for Bradford. Her
grandfather flew small planes. As a girl she would bail out of a
swing early, sometimes wearing handkerchiefs on her arms,
pretending they were wings.
</P>
<P>
   Later, she earned pilot's and instructor's licenses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, she became an Alaska flight attendant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the job. I had a fun time. I was making good money and
going on good trips,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the skypoxia. Sometimes it came with the odor of
dirty diapers or nail-polish remover, she said. She and other
flight attendants blamed their giddiness and headaches on altitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just wasn't taken too seriously back then.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was frightening ``to lose yourself that way.'' After she
got lost in Los Angeles, a pilot on a return flight asked her if
she could evacuate an airplane _ the responsibility of flight
attendants in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just like asking a drunk if he can drive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She spent the flight in the cockpit, on oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the morning in March 1998. She woke up in Vancouver,
B.C., during a three-day work trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to die. I couldn't breathe. I felt a
heavy pressure on my chest. I had a bloody nose and was coughing up
blood,'' she said. ``I felt like I was a deep, dark tunnel.''
</P>
<P>
   The bloody coughing and the nose bleeds continued for 10 days.
At times her head ached so badly she was sure it was about to
burst. ``I was so messed up. It was too much. I couldn't do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the end of her flight attendant days.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Bradford is learning to work in an Alaska Airlines
department that provides vacation packages to travelers _ twice the
hours for 70 percent less pay, she says.
</P>
<P>
   But in five months, she can take early retirement.
</P>
<P>
   She's also one of 26 flight attendants suing Alaska, the maker
of the aircraft and the maker of some equipment. She wants the
planes fixed, she said, and her former co-workers protected.
</P>
<P>
   She is taking dietary supplements to cleanse her body and is
living as healthily as possible. She's learned to endure the sore
throat that just won't go away.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, her abilities are returning. Today, she can carry on a
cogent conversation, which seemed impossible not too long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'm thinking my best. I hope to in the future,
but I'm thinking better than I did a few months ago.''

NATO COMMANDER CALLS AIRSTRIKES `SUCCESSFUL' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Also see: KOSOVO-AIM, KOSOVO-NATO and KOSOVO-BUSH) 
 
By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Allied commanders offered a cautious but positive
assessment Thursday of NATO's bombardment of Yugoslav targets as
the second round of air attacks ended, saying that the strikes had
cost Serb forces several fighter aircraft and had seriously damaged
their military infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium,
Gen. Wesley Clark, the alliance's supreme commander, called the
strikes against dozens of targets ``successful'' and insisted that
the aerial assault dubbed Operation Allied Force will continue
until Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic ends the violence
against ethnic Albanians in the Serbian province of Kosovo and
agrees to a peaceful settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are determined to continue until we have achieved our
objectives to hold the violence and to stop further humanitarian
catastrophe,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to claims by the Belgrade government that some U.S.
planes had been shot down, Clark said that the allied forces had
suffered no casualties and all aircraft involved in the operation
had returned to their bases safely on both nights of the assault.
He said the Serbs had put up little resistance to the attacks
Wednesday and again Thursday night from their air defense systems,
which is one of the primary targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know (the Yugoslav military) has some formidable
capabilities. We just didn't see them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yugoslav air force, he said, did send up at least three
Russian-made MiG-29s, which are the most sophisticated aircraft in
Milosovic's arsenal, to engage two U.S. F-15s and a Dutch F-16
during the initial air strikes Wednesday night. The MiGs, he said,
were shot down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The principle opposition seemed to be some fighter aircraft
that were brought up against us. At least three were destroyed,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark also acknowledged that one U.S. plane was forced to make
an emergency landing in Bosnia, but it was because of a maintenance
problem unrelated to the NATO air assault. A Pentagon official said
the plane had been on a routine mission over Bosnia in connection
with the ongoing peacekeeping mission there.
</P>
<P>
   Serb military leaders claimed Thursday that two NATO aircraft
had been shot down in the second round of attacks. But Defense
Secretary William Cohen told reporters that no NATO planes had been
downed, and all had returned to their bases.
</P>
<P>
   Clark and other U.S. military officials at the Pentagon refused
to provide specific details of the attacks or the damage done. They
said satellite surveillance and film taken of the bombardments from
the aircraft involved would be analyzed before any definitive
damage assessments are offered.
</P>
<P>
   But Clark nonetheless said that the nearly 400 aircraft and
several warships participating in the operation were fairly
accurate in carrying out their attacks on military command and
control facilities throughout Yugoslavia and on air defense
facilities, including fixed and mobile anti-aircraft installations.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said that three military airfields were hit
as well as one or two military-related factories near Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav military officials told reporters, however, that little
damage had been done, and that many of the bombs and cruise missile
fired by the allies had missed their targets and struck in civilian
areas. They said at least 10 people were killed and 60 wounded by
the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Russian military officials in Moscow said that the NATO strikes
had inflicted severe damage on five airfields, two factories, a
large military communications facility, and several bases housing
army and police security personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers on Capitol Hill also said that the first night's
assault had apparently been successful in delivering blows to
Milosevic's military systems. Emerging from a briefing by State
Department and Pentagon officials, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison,
R-Texas, said she felt that the strikes had been ``successful at
this point, and it appears that we did well in combat.''
</P>
<P>
   But she quickly added that no one is is ready ``to declare
victory'' yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The obvious effort is to go for military targets that would
curb the capability for Mr. Milosevic to harm his own people. And I
think that will be the first target and the second target, and the
third target,'' Hutchison said.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks Wednesday and Thursday both began with a barrage of
more than 50 cruise missiles launched from warships and from
aircraft. The missile attacks were followed by bombardments from
high-flying B-52s from bases in England. A number of F-117 stealth
bombers and various other aircraft based in Italy and at other NATO
facilities delivered their payloads over Kosovo and throughout
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Two B-2 stealth bombers based in the United States also were
used to deliver 32 satellite-guided one-ton bombs. It was the first
combat test of the sophisticated aircraft, and Pentagon officials
said their targets included air defense systems and military
command facilities.
</P>
<P>
   In his briefing, Clark emphasized that the attacks would
continue to focus on ``carefully chosen military targets'' and that
every effort would be made to avoid damage to civilian areas. But
he refused to rule out the possibility of the allies going after
military targets in civilian areas, including various army and
government facilities in downtown Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that Milosevic could end up being a primary target.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to grind away at him until we accomplish the
military objectives, or until our political leaders tell us to
halt,'' Clark said.

MESSAGE COMES ACROSS WELL IN `DOUG'S 1ST MOVIE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a nice message for kids at the heart of the animated
film, ``Doug's 1st Movie'': do the right thing and the truth will
eventually come out, no matter how unpopular the decision.
</P>
<P>
   That's sometimes a difficult concept for kids and preteens to
understand because they're suffering under peer pressure at school
and among their friends and don't always know what to do in a
crisis. Especially when the crisis concerns a powerful adult who is
doing the wrong thing. Who will believe a 12-year-old when his
nemesis is the town's richest man?
</P>
<P>
   Doug lives in the small burg of Bluffington, has an equally
nerdy best friend named Skeeter and a nifty little dog named
Porkchop.
</P>
<P>
   He also has a major crush on Patti Mayonnaise. But every time
Doug creates a plan to get close to Patti, it backfires in his
face.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Valentine's Day dance, for example. Doug and Patti sign
up to do decorations together but upperclassman Guy Graham, the
school newspaper editor and the minion of millionaire Bill Bluff,
has his eye on Patti as well.
</P>
<P>
   Doug and Skeeter have been occupied researching the legend of
the monster of polluted Lucky Duck Lake. And when they discover the
monster really exists and isn't scary at all, just a sweet-natured
goof, the boys are faced with a dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   If Doug doesn't rescue Herman the monster from Bluff's evil plan
designed to cover up his illegal dumping of industrial waste into
the town's water, he could lose Patti to Guy. He's confronted by a
tough decision: can he expose Bluff's bluff and save Herman and
risk losing the girl of his dreams?
</P>
<P>
   The screen adventures of Doug originate from the popular
Saturday morning TV series, ``Disney's Doug.'' It was the
brainchild of creator Jim Jinkins, who admits that he's pulled
Doug's adventures from many of his own experiences growing up, and
that he believes one of the biggest fears kids face is looking
foolish in front of their peers.
</P>
<P>
   Jinkins blended that idea into the movie's plot and ``Doug's 1st
Movie'' nicely conveys, and puts into context, a worthy moral ideal
that compensates for its ho-hum animation, and which kept kids (and
adults) in a preview audience involved _ and listening.
</P>
<P>
   Doug's 1st Movie. Directed by Maurice Joyce. Written by Ken
Scarborough. Walt Disney Pictures. 77 minutes. Rated G.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the last week, before the decision was made at
the White House that force would be used against Yugoslavia, the
impending visit of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov of Russia became
a focal point that helped push the administration to act sooner
than it had planned, according to officials.
</P>
<P>
   And as the White House moved closer to using the force it did
not want to, the most hawkish member of the foreign policy team,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, whose public reputation had
been blemished by failed peace talks in France, was able to hold
her own in the inner sanctums, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger has probably
carried the most clout with President Clinton on Kosovo, as he has
on all foreign policy, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Primakov trip was important because initially the White
House had thought it would delay military action against Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic until after the Russian leader's
visit.
</P>
<P>
   But as the situation on the ground in Kosovo deteriorated
dramatically last Friday and Saturday, Vice President Al Gore, who
was to be Primakov's host, argued forcefully that the credibility
of NATO was more important than paying attention to the
sensitivities of the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made the case that you do do not want to subordinate NATO's
interest to Russia and give Milosevic another week to clean up,''
an administration official said of the vice president, who has been
the administration's chief liaison with Russian prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Piecing together the steps that led the administration to make
the decision to back NATO action against Yugoslavia, officials
describe an unfolding series of milestones and missed opportunities
that stretch all the way back to the beginning of the wars in the
former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been preferable, for example, some officials now
acknowledge, if Milosevic's side-kick in Serbian-held Bosnia,
Radovan Karadzic, had been arrested by NATO troops in Bosnia three
years ago and taken to the international tribunal at the Hague,
Netherlands, where he could have been ``squeezed'' for information
on Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But more immediately, as Milosevic took aim at the ethnic
Albanian guerrillas in Kosovo early last year, the administration
paid only sporadic attention.
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador Robert Gelbard, a State Department official whose
portfolio included Kosovo, warned Milosevic in February of last
year that he was at a ``crossroads'' as the Yugoslav leader massed
troops for a campaign against the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic unleashed his forces last spring, and some
administration officials look back at that moment as one of several
missed opportunities to curb the conflict early on.
</P>
<P>
   By early summer, Gelbard was replaced by Clinton's special
envoy, Richard Holbrooke, who believed that it was possible to
negotiate with the Yugoslav leader.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke visited Kosovo in May and June, described the village
of Kijevo as ``the most dangerous place in Europe,'' and declared
that NATO was prepared to carry out airstrikes against Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   But as Clinton's choice as representative to the United Nations,
Holbrooke was never on the Kosovo case full-time.
</P>
<P>
   And at the State Department, the Kosovo problem was swept into
the Bureau of European Affairs where Milosevic's summer offensive
using tanks and artillery against ethnic Albanian villages was
noticed but not dramatized.
</P>
<P>
   By last September, Milosevic appeared to have overstepped the
bounds of acceptability when on one day alone, his police units
massacred an entire family of more than 20 people and summarily
executed 13 men.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO headquarters, political support rallied for airstrikes
against Milosevic, and NATO's Supreme Commander Gen. Wesley Clark
pulled together an armada of aircraft ready for attack in October.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by the threat of NATO force, Holbrooke was sent to
Belgrade to talk with Milosevic. He haggled for nine days in
Belgrade, and at the end flew to Brussels, Belgium, arriving at 2
a.m., to announce a deal that involved the dispatch of unarmed
European monitors but not NATO forces.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, with the exception perhaps of Albright, who has
always argued that Milosevic only responded to force, there was
relief. Holbrooke's package, which included the drawdown of Serbian
forces, was broadly welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, the steam went out of NATO's resolve and
the White House, relieved that force did not have to be used,
settled back into hoping that Milosevic would keep his commitments.
</P>
<P>
   By January, it was clear he would not. President Clinton was
reluctant to counter with NATO airstrikes, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   First, Congress was fragmented, although Sen. John Warner,
D-Va., and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, backed
NATO intervention. Second, there was the specter of a failed
mission like that in Somalia when 19 American Army Rangers were
killed, reinforced by the fear of getting involved in a
little-known corner of the world, even though it was Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a desire to believe that the threat of force was
better than the use of force,'' said an official who has watched
the White House policy evolve.
</P>
<P>
   After the peace talks in France ended with only the ethnic
Albanians signing, Holbrooke was sent to Belgrade to deal with
Milosevic for a ``last chance.'' The engines of the NATO planes
were warming up but there were hopes in the White House that a
final collision course could be avoided, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, a muted Holbrooke said that Milosevic had not even
engaged himself and had repeated his own propaganda that the
violence in Kosovo was between ethnic Albanians killing ethnic
Albanians and ethnic Albanians killing Serbs.

 &HT;    Bush offers conditional backing of Kosovo bombing
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A day after other GOP presidential hopefuls
weighed in, Gov. George W. Bush on Thursday dipped a toe into
complex foreign policy and announced conditional support for
U.S.-backed military action in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   When the bombs began falling Wednesday, Bush went jogging
instead of attending what have become customary meetings with
reporters after his private sessions with backers of his
presidential campaign. Later Wednesday, he issued a noncommittal
statement and evaded reporters' questions after an appearance in
Grapevine.
</P>
<P>
   In between that and his regular duties, Bush was fielding advice
from policy advisers. By Thursday afternoon, after being pressed by
reporters, Bush had a press conference to make his views known on
the unfolding drama in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``As governor of Texas, I do not have access to all the
information and military intelligence available to the commander in
chief,'' said Bush, adding that he knew enough to ``share the
concerns and misgivings of many Texans and Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time we commit American troops, I believe we must have a
clear mission, an achievable goal and a credible exit strategy,''
he said. ``The ultimate question is, will this military action lead
to the goal of ending the conflict and bringing peace and stability
to the region.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his misgivings concern whether there is a plan that
will avoid leaving the military ``mired into a region without an
exit strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   But the governor and probable presidential candidate also said
the United States and its allies had to carry through on threats to
use force. Asked if the threats were reasonable, Bush said, ``I
don't have enough information to be able to make that type of
criticism at the present.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My worry is the worry of a lot of people I have heard from in
Texas, and that is, will the air strikes achieve the president's
stated mission of bringing Milosevic to the peace table to sign an
accord with Kosovo,'' he said. ``And if not, what next?''
</P>
<P>
   Before Bush offered his views, other GOP presidential candidates
and likely candidates took to the air waves and their Web sites to
offer their opinions on the NATO effort. Elizabeth Dole said the
action ``can be instrumental in forging a peaceful solution to a
dangerous, escalating military conflict.'' Pat Buchanan blasted it
as an unnecessary intervention into ``an ugly civil war inside
Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes backed the bombing and said the defenders of Kosovo
should be provided arms to defend themselves. Dan Quayle said he
and Bush's dad handled it better than President Clinton is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you what we did when I was vice president with
George Bush. We said privately and publicly, but more importantly
privately to Milosevic, stay out of Kosovo,'' Quayle said on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush's only comments Wednesday dealt with the safety of the
troops, not the merits of their mission. ``My thoughts and prayers
are with our American fighting men and women and their families.
And I wish our troops a safe and speedy return,'' he said in a
statement issued by his office.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday evening, as Clinton spoke to the nation about the
decision to begin the bombing, Bush was at a ribbon-cutting
ceremony for an outdoors store in Grapevine.
</P>
<P>
   It took more than one attempt by reporters to get Bush to
respond to questions about the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the men and women come back safely,'' he said, before
hustling to a waiting car.
</P>
<P>
   While other candidates were quicker to respond, Bush advisers
felt the weight of working for a man who may be on a direct path to
the White House, polls indicate. They wanted to make sure Bush was
as informed as possible before offering his views on a delicate and
complicated situation. An aide said privately that Bush advisers
realize his words, even 20 months before the presidential election,
could carry far more weight than those offered by contenders who
polls indicate have little chance of becoming president.
</P>
<P>
   Input to Bush came from Condoleezza Rice and Josh Bolten,
advisers to his presidential exploratory committee. Rice, who will
leave her post as Stanford University provost in June to dedicate
more time to the Bush campaign, was a top adviser to President Bush
when the Soviet Union fell apart and Germany came back together.
</P>
<P>
   Bolten, most recently with Goldman Sachs in London, is new to
the Bush campaign. In addition to private law practice, Bolten has
worked for the State Department and the U.S. Senate Finance
Committee.

EXPULSION OF JOURNALISTS COULD AFFECT US REACTION TO ATTACKS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thursday's expulsion of Western journalists and continuing
crackdown on the media by Serbian authorities could have major
political implications for the Clinton administration's military
campaign in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when televised images of conflict _ from the unrest in
Tiananmen Square to US casualties in Somalia _ can galvanize public
opinion, what happens if this war provides nothing more dramatic
than chatty pundits, NATO briefings, and blurry shots of distant
explosions?
</P>
<P>
   Some observers say a war that can't be seen and felt on live
television benefits the White House by keeping Americans
emotionally detached from the conflict and preventing the hot
breath of public opinion from affecting its strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Fordham University communications professor Everette Dennis
said, ``I think the visual connection is absolutely vital Friday''
to engage citizen interest in military action. ``Maps, charts, and
talking heads . . . it's not compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless public interest in the Kosovo crisis ratchets up, ``I'd
say it's advantageous for the White House,'' added Richard
Falkenrath, assistant professor at Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government. ``The more benign and apathetic the public response,
the better. You don't run military strikes by town meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the dramatic television moments relayed back from Operation
Desert Storm and Somalia were only snapshots provided by
journalists whose access to combat was constrained. But at least
they were there. In Yugoslavia, the images will be even more
constrained.
</P>
<P>
   After its shutdown of television transmission facilities Monday,
Serbian authorities further tightened control of the media Thursday
by expelling reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Amid reports of threats, harassment, and detention (and the
torching of a CNN vehicle), many network journalists were forced to
leave the scene. ABC's last five staffers in Belgrade made it to
Hungary Thursday. The CBS crew ended up in Macedonia and Croatia.
CNN's team headed for Macedonia, Croatia, and Belgium. It was from
Brussels Thursday that Christianne Amanpour said the forced exodus
``denies the world an opportunity to see what's going on.'' Only
NBC managed to keep two correspondents _ Ron Allen and Jim Maceda _
in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   With journalists headed for safety, Thursday was a surreal day
in the coverage of the conflict, with much more talk than action.
NATO, State Department, and Pentagon briefings were carried only by
the cable news networks. Word of the launching of a second day of
strikes against Serbian forces came not from reporters on the
ground, but from the Pentagon's press spokesman Ken Bacon. At one
point, CNN aired reports of possible NATO attacks posted on the
Internet by Belgrade-area residents who heard explosions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like there's a dearth of knowledge and pictures,''
said WCVB-TV (Ch. 5) director of programming Elizabeth Cheng,
summing up the problem for network affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   If this modified news blackout continues, several competing
forces could control the spin from the battlefield. ``I think that
obviously, everyone's going to try and manage you guys,'' said
Richard Shultz, director of the Security Studies Program at the
Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   One obvious candidate is Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
who could provide a stream of pictures of civilians injured or
killed by errant NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy learned the lesson from the Gulf War,'' said retired
Marine Corps General Bernard Trainor. ``He's manipulating things.
The networks, everybody, is depending on the coverage he's
providing.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the US military could begin to dictate the tone of
coverage with upbeat damage assessments similar to those during the
Gulf War. That would help a Clinton administration seeking public
support, said John MacArthur, publisher of Harper's Magazine and
one of the plaintiffs in a lawsuit that accused the US military of
unfairly restricting the media during the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   US policymakers ``want the usual sort of nonemotional surgical
strikes in which we hit 16 of 19 targets Friday and successfully
hit an ammunition dump, and there'll be no one to contradict
them,'' he said. ``The less emotional and the less bloody the whole
thing is, the better it is for people who make war.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some analysts say the volatile military situation _ and
NATO's strategy of bombing Serbia into submission _ could easily
and quickly transform the conflict into a public relations and
political nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the story contained and the public disengaged might make
it ``easier to deal with complicated internal warfare like this,''
Shultz said. But ``I don't think it's realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All you need is one picture,'' said MacArthur, recalling the
effect of the photo of a US serviceman being dragged through the
streets of Somalia. ``One downed pilot being held prisoner and you
can turn the whole thing around.''

``Those who believe in Magic and those who appreciate the beauty of
a rare Bird have come to see basketball's best and witness the
crowning of a new national champion.''
</P>
<P>
   _ NBC broadcaster Bryant Gumble, 1979 &QR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JEROME SOLOMON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ They were the first of their kind.
</P>
<P>
   Few, if any, before them had the imagination to even dream of
doing what they could do. They scored, they rebounded, they passed,
they dribbled they did it all.
</P>
<P>
   They did it with too much flair for men their size. Too much,
that is, for it to be fair to compare them to anyone else. All
great athletes hate to lose, but to these two, losing was not an
option.
</P>
<P>
   They are why the 1979 NCAA Tournament championship game between
Michigan State and Indiana State posted the highest Nielsen
television rating of any game in college basketball history.
</P>
<P>
   Earvin ``Magic'' Johnson and Larry Bird. College basketball has
not been the same since.
</P>
<P>
   ``What made us so compelling to others was we were so different,
but to each other we were just alike,'' Johnson said. ``Both of us
would do whatever it took to win. And we were both doing it like no
one had done it before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry was a guy that could tear you up from 30 feet out with
fancy passes, a deadly jumper and a heart you can't match. Then
there I am, a 6-8 point guard running the show, making plays that
little guys used to, then going down low with the big guys, too.
People had never seen guys as big as we were doing it like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wanted to see us get it on, and so did we.''
</P>
<P>
   The buildup to the most memorable NCAA Tournament final ever was
not about Michigan State, a school whose best NCAA finish had been
fourth place 22 years earlier, or Indiana State, a school that
prior to 1979 had never even been to the Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   It was about Magic vs. Bird, Bird vs. Magic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talk started to build once the Tournament got going,''
then-Michigan State coach Jud Heathcote said. ``Before then, no one
was thinking about a No. 2 seed (Michigan State) playing in the
final against a No. 1 seed (Indiana State), but as we started
winning games, people got to thinking we could be there, then
started hoping we would be there.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the two teams advanced to the Final Four in Salt
Lake City, the hype reached an unprecedented level.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the first time the media descended upon the Final
Four en masse like that,'' said Heathcote, who arrived in St.
Petersburg on Thursday to attend his 27th consecutive Final Four.
``All the stories written that week were Magic vs. Bird, not
Michigan State against Indiana State or any of the other two teams
in the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``And people are just dumb enough to believe what they read in
the newspaper, so there was no question in most people's minds that
they wanted to see Magic play against Bird. Even if it was
one-on-one, that was the only contest worth seeing in their
minds.''
</P>
<P>
   In the semifinals, Michigan State pummeled Penn, and Indiana
State survived a battle against DePaul.
</P>
<P>
   So the people got their wish, and the landscape of college
basketball changed forever.
</P>
<P>
   Now 20 years later, as the country focuses on whether Michigan
State, Duke, Ohio State or Connecticut will claim the last NCAA
basketball crown of the 1990s, the college game continues to
thrive, thanks to that Monday night in March 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The right tournament, the right time
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA Tournament had built a solid following by 1979, but
there were signs it was about to become an event as opposed to a
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, the championship game was moved to Monday night and
televised nationally in prime time for the first time. Only
conference champions could play in the Tournament until 1975, when
the field jumped to 32 teams. Forty teams participated in the 1979
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Terms as commonplace in basketball as jump shots and free throws
were just being coined at the time. The phrase Final Four was not
part of the lexicon of college basketball until it appeared
capitalized in the Official Collegiate Basketball Guide prior to
the 1978-79 season.
</P>
<P>
   When the Tournament brackets come out now, all the talk is of
seeding. The 1977-78 season was the first time seeding was used in
the Tournament, and the following year all the teams were seeded in
the bracket, another first.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets used to be sold on a you-want-'em, you-got-'em basis,
with thousands given out complimentary. In 1978, complimentary
tickets were eliminated, and in 1979 the first public lottery for
Final Four tickets was held.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Tournament's popularity was increasing, but like the
Super Bowl, it needed that one special year to lift it from being
something of interest to sports fans to a happening that attracted
non-sports fans.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Namath and the New York Jets' victory over the Baltimore
Colts in Super Bowl III did it for pro football. Johnson and Bird
did it for the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game was already on the launching pad,'' said
coach-turned-broadcaster Al McGuire, who teamed with Dick Enberg
and Billy Packer on NBC's television broadcast of the game. ``Then
Bird and Magic came along and pushed the button.''
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA championship game had its share of superstars prior to
Johnson and Bird.
</P>
<P>
   Famous basketball names such as Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell,
Jerry West, Lew Alcindor (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), Elgin Baylor, Bill
Walton, Bill Bradley and David Thompson are among those who have
been named Most Outstanding Player of the Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The title game also had its share of historic moments. Many
blacks had starred in the NCAA Tournament, but it wasn't until
Texas Western and its all-black starting five topped an all-white
Kentucky squad in the 1966 championship game that all the racial
barriers came tumbling down.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's win over Villanova in the 1971 title game before 31,765
fans in the Astrodome proved that if the seats are there, people
will come. But when Bird and Johnson took to the court in 1979,
people who did not watch college basketball were fighting for seats
in front of the television.
</P>
<P>
   The right players, the right time
</P>
<P>
   NBC, which had purchased the rights to broadcast the Tournament
for a then-record $1.1 million a year in 1973, knew it had
something special with the Michigan State-Indiana State final.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing star value and entertainment value and the fact that
the millions that were tuning in, many of them probably had not
watched a game all season long, and this was a way to sell the game
to them,'' NBC's Enberg said in Fox Sports Net's documentary Magic
vs. Bird: The Game That Changed the Game, which will air Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 18 million homes tuned in, representing a Nielsen rating
of 24.1 and a share of the total television audience of 38, meaning
nearly two of every five televisions that were turned on were tuned
in to the game.
</P>
<P>
   The anticipation, according to those who were there, was
tremendous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anticipation of the championship game was extraordinary,''
said Boston Globe columnist Bob Ryan in another retrospective on
the game that airs at 8 tonight on ESPN Classic, which will show
the game from start to finish. ``It was the longest Sunday between
the semifinals and the finals ever, and it was the longest Monday
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Since that final, the Tournament has become a financial bonanza
for the NCAA. The field increased to 64 teams in 1985, helping make
1998's total attendance more than twice that of 1979.
</P>
<P>
   This year's attendance should be strong as well. The Trans World
Dome in St. Louis broke records for regional semifinals and
regional finals with a combined 86,000 fans for the two sessions of
the Midwest Regional last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   When the Final Four is played in the Georgia Dome in 2007, it
will mark the 11th consecutive year the hosting stadium will be a
domed facility with a seating capacity of more than 40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the value of NCAA basketball, CBS paid $1.72 billion
to broadcast the Tournament through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``As big as the Tournament is, I am surprised that our game is
still the most watched one,'' Johnson said. ``It says a lot about
how big the hype was for Magic vs. Bird.''
</P>
<P>
   The right game, the right time
</P>
<P>
   Hindsight proves the hype was deserved, as Johnson and Bird went
on to the NBA, where they have been credited with saving the pro
game and were named two of the league's 50 greatest players.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, their 1979 meeting was not as spectacular as the
hype, though few remember it as such.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and the Spartans were in control from the opening tap.
They led by as many as 11 points in the first half and by nine at
the break.
</P>
<P>
   Bird, slowed by an injured thumb, could find no open looks
against the Spartans' matchup zone and finished just 7-of-21 from
the floor. He was 16-of-19 when he scored 35 points against DePaul
in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to have two men on him every time he touched the
ball and then have the other three defenders protect the passing
lanes because he was such a good passer,'' Heathcote said. ``But I
think the main thing people forget was _ as I told reporters before
the game _ they had one superstar, and we had two.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed Bird, the national Player of the Year for the 33-0
Sycamores, was matched by Greg Kelser, the high-flying Robin to
Johnson's Batman, with 19 points in the championship game. Johnson
scored a game-high 24 points.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State opened a 16-point advantage and looked as if it
would blow open the game when Kelser picked up his fourth foul in
the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana State made one final run, pulling to within six points
on Bird's baseline jumper, before Johnson and Kelser switched roles
to turn the play that proved to be the final nail in the coffin of
the Sycamores.
</P>
<P>
   Kelser, known more for finishing Johnson's alley-oop passes with
dunks, fed a cutting Johnson with a pass that led to a poster dunk
over Bob Heaton, who was charged with an undercut foul that
resulted in two free throws and possession of the ball for the
Spartans.
</P>
<P>
   That one game was over, but the new game had just begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the game would have reached its peak without Magic and
Bird, but it would have taken a heck of a lot longer to get
there,'' Heathcote said. ``That day will always be remembered as a
special day in college basketball. I am just proud to have been a
part of it. There will probably never be a final that is that
special again.'' &QL;

   KIJEVO, Yugoslavia _ Even after the air raid sirens wailed,
Sara, nearly 5, refused to go down to the basement shelter until
the ``Ninja Turtles'' program was over.
</P>
<P>
   Then the night sky turned orange over this southern suburb of
Belgrade, and on a hill just a mile or so away, where a radar
antenna sits, a NATO missile or bomb exploded. Sara's father, Mile,
ran to his balcony, a little stupidly, he admits.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a big cloud of dust and a huge pressure of the
air,'' he said. ``I told Sara, `Where are our Ninja turtles to help
us now?' and then we went to the shelter.''
</P>
<P>
   Mile, his wife, Biljana, Sara and her brother, Nemanja, 6, slept
in a tiny concrete storage area in their basement. There were more
explosions to the south and near Zarkovo, where there are aircraft
plants and technical compounds, and Sara was very frightened, her
mother said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She huddled in the corner, and she said, `I don't want to die,
Mommy.' We calmed her by saying it was just explosions in the stone
quarry nearby, and she said, `I was afraid they were Americans.'''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, hot and sunny, was Biljana's 32nd birthday.
``The Americans arranged these fireworks for you,'' her husband
said.
</P>
<P>
   Her face crumpled, but she stifled tears and managed a wan
smile. ``I'm the guilty one, then,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Who is guilty, really, she was asked. President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia? The ethnic Albanians? The Americans?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is plenty of guilt to go around,'' she said. ``No one
need feel left out.''
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor called up to the balcony and asked in English,
``Where are you from?'' A colleague said, truthfully, ``Austria.''
</P>
<P>
   The neighbor said bitterly, ``Well, you're still neutral, at
least so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbian anger at the West, and especially the United States, is
both media-fed and genuine. Ordinary Serbs like Mile, 37, who works
in an electrical-engineering plant, are both stupefied that the
bombs are falling and outraged that the world is treating them
``like savages,'' he said, ``just because we want to keep our
country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't try to take territory away from any other country,''
Mile said, getting angrier. ``America is intervening 100 percent on
the side of the Albanians in Kosovo. It is supporting separatism
and terrorism and trying to take away our state. Who gives them the
right to bomb anybody they want?''
</P>
<P>
   Biljana patted him on the hand, and he reverted, almost
instantaneously, to being the genial Serbian host, offering Turkish
coffee and homemade plum brandy, colored golden by the wooden cross
embedded in the bottle. ``We call this our Tomahawk,'' he said
cheerily. ``It's a precision-guided weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he darkened once more. ``We'll be in the shelter again
tonight,'' he said. ``And how many more nights? And what will be
the end? We enter the 21st century in this country with bombs
falling on us, as if we are the last and most savage place on the
earth. We used to have a good life here. Is it just Milosevic, or
is it someone else?''
</P>
<P>
   Their friend, Alexander, lives close by in Zarkovo, also a
target of NATO. A missile hit near a heating plant less than a mile
from his apartment building, shaking the chandelier and the
furniture like an earthquake, he said.
</P>
<P>
   His family and his sister, who lives in the same building, went
down to the shelters. ``The whole situation in my family changed
immediately,'' he said. ``All the foreigners, the Americans and the
English, all look like enemies now. Before the bombings, my father
didn't know what to think. Now he says, `Don't talk to these
foreigners; don't work with them; their money is dirty.'''
</P>
<P>
   He shook his head. ``It's like they've bombed an opinion into
our brains, and it will only help Milosevic. I don't like him, but
this bombing unifies all the Serbs against the world.''
</P>
<P>
   It is strange, he said, and primitive when war begins. ``Now
Clinton and all the Americans are all the same in this moment: they
are criminals. It's not just because the television said so. People
are afraid. They didn't expect this to happen. They just didn't
think it could happen.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Thursday morning, when the air raid sirens wailed again in
Belgrade, his wife finally managed to get through to him on his
cell phone, to tell him to take shelter. ``I am empty,'' he said.
``My wife and my mother are full of sedatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Miles away, in the elegant center of old Belgrade, in an
exquisite apartment stuffed with every modern convenience, Slavko
Curuvija waits for the police to come. He is the publisher of the
independent newspaper Dnevni Telegraf and the newsmagazine
Evropljanin and has been sentenced to five months in jail after
refusing to pay enormous fines under a new media law, passed in
October.
</P>
<P>
   His appeal is pending, suspended by the declaration of war
Yugoslavia issued on Wednesday night. His wife, Branka Prpa, is a
well-known historian at the Institute for Modern Serbian History.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will go to jail for five months, and after this bombing,
who will care?'' she asked. ``The West can't help him _ that's
another effect of this bombing. Milosevic can act like a dictator
and lock us all up, and who will care for us? I agree the West
should care for the human rights of ethnic Albanians, but do they
also care for mine?''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia is a European nation a millennium old, she said.
``You can't rub it out with an eraser and pretend it's some nation
without culture, without reason, without civilization, that we are
all savages, because of a Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   The West is degrading itself by using Milosevic's own tactics of
force and diktat against him, she said. ``You cannot use evil
against evil or you become the same. I only hope Serbia can survive
this one man and the madness he's done in this moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Curuvija, said it is impossible now for any
democrat or dissident to raise up their heads in this war fever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs feel under a collective guilty verdict, and the
democratic forces are pushed into their mouse holes because of this
permanent state of emergency,'' he said. ``In this moment, you
cannot say you want to change something, or bring Serbia closer to
the West, which is bombing your country _ it makes you a traitor.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to his soft yellow sweatshirt, with a Gant logo and
its red-white-and-blue colors, on his chest. ``I'd be afraid now to
wear this outside in the street,'' he said. ``There are a lot of
crazy people right now.'' He rubbed his hands over his beard and
straightened his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this helps Milosevic,'' he said. ``Everything Western is
terrible right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Another air raid siren sounded. When it died away, Ms. Prpa, his
wife, said softly, as the sunlight hit polished wood: ``The worst
of all is to feel you have no future. What kind of future do we
have?''

   AID-REPORTS (Undated) _ Yugoslavia's expulsion of most foreign
journalists left a Northwest-based aid agency as one of the few
remaining sources of information on conditions in war-torn Kosovo.

<P>
   AIRLINE-ILLNESS (Seattle) _ For 10 years, Alaska Airlines flight
attendants have complained that the air they breathe at work is
making them sick. But after a decade of concern, the cause of their
illness remains elusive: Federal investigators and the airline's
own consultants have looked, and found nothing.
</P>
<P>
   with AIRLINE-ILLNESS-ATTENDANT (Seattle) _ Deby Bradford and her
fellow Alaska Airlines MD-80 flight attendants used to call it
``skypoxia.'' They had the giddiness of three martinis, without
taking a sip. A simple remark would double them over in laughter,
tears rolling down their cheeks. It might be comical if it weren't
so serious. Bradford believes she was exposed to toxic fumes,
damaging her health and her cognitive abilities.

   ROCK-WILSON (Undated) _ Long before she became famous in the

college coffeehouse ``hootenannies.'' Wilson returns in spirit to
her coffeehouse days with her first solo album, ``Live at McCabe's

   THEATER-HUMANA (Louisville, Ky.) _ Every year, scores of theater
critics, producers and aficionados from around the world descend
upon this Ohio River town to find out what's up in American
theater. Why here? The answer lies in the Humana Festival of New
American Plays, which provides a platform for fully staged
productions of otherwise untested dramatic works. Nowhere else
gives such concentrated exposure to newly minted theater.

</P>
<P>
   FILM-EDTV (Undated) _ Thematically and structurally, ``EDtv'' is
so similar to ``The Truman Show'' that it's impossible not to
compare them, and ``EDtv'' loses out. ``Truman'' actually made us
believe its outlandish premise to the point where we gave a
considerable emotional investment to its characters. ``ED'' never
does. It is amusing, but finally tiresome and then instantly
forgettable.

<P>
   By William Arnold. (Story has moved in the ``e'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-MODSQUAD (Undated) _ The movie version of ``The Mod Squad''
is one of the less self-conscious and less pretentious of recent
big-screen remakes of vintage television shows. It plays very much
like an extended episode of the old series _ half-heartedly updated
to the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   By William Arnold. (Story has moved in the ``e'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-DOUG (Undated) _ There's a nice message for kids at the
heart of the animated film, ``Doug's 1st Movie'': do the right
thing and the truth will eventually come out, no matter how
unpopular the decision. The movie nicely conveys, and puts into
context, a worthy moral ideal that compensates for its ho-hum
animation, and which kept kids (and adults) in a preview audience
involved _ and listening.
</P>
<P>
   By Paula Nechak. (Story will move in the ``e'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   TV-FUTURAMA (Undated) _ Trying to re-invent the freshness,
irreverence and nose-thumbing smart-aleckiness of ``The Simpsons''
is probably a dumb idea. But if Fox is willing to pay the money,
Matt Groening is happy to take it. If the number of laugh-out-loud
moments in his new ``Futurama'' is a good way to measure success,
Groening may be laughing all the way to the banquette where TV
execs do lunch.

exaggerated the secretary's complaint to make me look bad. How can
I find out what the secretary actually said about me? Isn't it true
that discussions during lunchtime, away from the office, are
private and can't be used against employees? What recourse do I
have? Ilana DeBare has the answers.

 &HT;    Targets of anger: Foreign journalists leave Yugoslavia
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ CNN staffers and other Western journalists were
arrested, interrogated, threatened at gunpoint and had a car full
of equipment set on fire in Kosovo early Thursday. As a result of
the violence, nearly all journalists from NATO countries have left
or been expelled from Yugoslavia, with no clear idea when they will
return.
</P>
<P>
   Although no journalists were physically harmed, CNN
International President Eason Jordan called it ``an extremely
dangerous situation. CNN is being singled out for especially rough
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We absolutely intend to return to Yugoslavia,'' Jordan said
Thursday. ``It's not clear when that will be prudent. We're trying
to get a sense as to whether or not security will be provided to
get back in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to go back and report this story,'' CNN correspondent
Christiane Amapour said Thursday in a report from Brussels,
Belgium, where she fled after Belgrade became unsafe. ``We
certainly will be trying to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Amanpour, among those who have left are CNN's
Brent Sadler and CBS's Allen Pizzey, both of whom went to
neighboring Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Three New York Times reporters _ Carlotta Gall, Steven Erlanger
and Blaine Harden _ were expelled, spokeswoman Nancy Nielsen said.
</P>
<P>
   CBS correspondent Mark Phillips said he was detained in a police
station for six hours in Belgrade and then driven, along with Peter
Finn of The Washington Post, to Yugoslavia's border with Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said officials wanted to know what he was reporting and
who his contacts were in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt occasionally threatened,'' he said. ``Physical violence
was never used, but the threat of it was constantly in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC said its nine employees in Belgrade and Kosovo left.
</P>
<P>
   BBC reporters Monica Guerin, Ben Brown and Jacky Rowland were
ordered out of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have not yet in Pristina expelled the entire press corps,
but as we were leaving other people were having their visas
revoked,'' Guerin said. ``Certainly, freedom of movement has been
severely restricted and our ability to go find out what's going on
in the country has been reduced.''
</P>
<P>
   Two NBC reporters, Jim Maceda and Ron Allen, remained in
Belgrade. Despite the government order, they decided to stay
because nobody directly asked them to leave, spokeswoman Alex
Constantinople said.
</P>
<P>
   Several staff members of The Associated Press were leaving the
country Thursday but the news agency was still able to do some
reporting from Yugoslavia, said Thomas Kent, AP's international
editor.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian television has conducted a campaign against CNN in
recent weeks, calling the Atlanta-based news channel ``a factory of
lies'' and saying it should be prosecuted for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina, Serbian paramilitary units entered the Grand Hotel
early Thursday and began looking for CNN personnel, Jordan said.
Three CNN staffers were forced into one room, their passports and
much of their equipment taken.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the door to the hotel room was broken down by a different
mob and a shot was fired into the ceiling. As the CNN people and
other journalists were preparing to leave Kosovo in a convoy, a
crowd set fire to a CNN car.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Belgrade, about 30 journalists on the roof of the
Grand Hotel watching NATO bombing were arrested by Yugoslavian
police and interrogated.
</P>
<P>
   Amanpour, CNN's most visible correspondent in Yugoslavia for
years, was not among those arrested, but Jordan said CNN decided
she should leave immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an exceptionally dangerous situation,'' Jordan said.
``She has a long history in Yugoslavia and the leadership has a
very low regard for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Vuk Draskovic told CNN in a
telephone interview Thursday that all foreign journalists were
being allowed back into Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Journalists are not our enemies,'' Draskovic said. ``We need
foreign journalists as a window to foreign opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jordan said the problem has been Serbian ``paramilitary
units or thugs, call them what you want,'' rather than the Yugoslav
government.

 &HT;    Hard work earns Georgia title shot
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ This time a year ago, Georgia coach Andy
Landers was in the unusual position of being happy to see a
basketball season come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Bulldogs, with only eight scholarship players, had been
eliminated in the first round of the NCAA Tournament after a 17-11
season he said was his worst ever as a coach.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, he seriously considered a head coaching job
in the WNBA before deciding to stay put. On occasion, even late
into the current season, he struggled to find the right combination
to vault the Lady Bulldogs back to national prominence.
</P>
<P>
   While the Final Four is all that he has in mind when he employs
the word ``back,'' this may be the most improbable Final Four team
of all for Georgia (27-6), which meets Duke (28-6) at 7 tonight at
the San Jose Arena.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, this also may be Landers' best chance to capture the
NCAA title that has painfully eluded him since Georgia made the
first of its five Final Four trips in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not at all surprised that we're here,'' he said. ``I
really like our basketball team. We're not as good as we want to
be, but we've outworked a lot of teams to get here.''
</P>
<P>
   Some say Landers has done one of his best coaching jobs in his
20 seasons at Georgia, prodding a sophomore-dominated team (there's
only one senior on the roster) to go beyond what it probably
thought it could achieve. He did the same thing four years ago,
when Saudia Roundtree joined La'Keshia Frett, Kedra Holland and
Tracy Henderson got to the Final Four in 1995, then lost to
Tennessee the following year despite being the favorite.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the challenge has been markedly different.
</P>
<P>
   While twin guards Kelly and Coco Miller provide the kind of
competitive spirit that Frett, Henderson, et. al, lacked, their
emotional outbursts during games have been a great source of
consternation. And it is only now that Georgia players are
developing the camaraderie that was nonexistent most of last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our relationships on and off the court were not what we wanted
them to be,'' junior forward Angie Ball said. ``I don't think there
was any animosity between anyone, I just think that we didn't know
each other very well. We've done a lot to change that, and I think
it's helped us get better as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Georgia got off to a 14-0 start, the best in school
history, then lost the first of three games to Tennessee. It was
after that 102-69 drubbing in Knoxville that Landers declared he
wanted his team to think about being worthy of the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed an absurd notion, especially after the Lady Dogs went
through a nasty 1-4 slump in late January and early February. ``We
were never bad, we just lost a couple of games to teams that were
pretty good,'' he said, referring to Kentucky and Mississippi
State, both of whom got NCAA bids.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Dogs turned things around just as quickly, hammering
Florida 91-66 and then giving Tennessee a good first half in the
SEC championship game before losing by 16. That helped unlock their
postseason confidence, especially on defense. In four NCAA
Tournament games, the Lady Dogs have limited opponents to an
average of 58 points and 34 percent shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep inside, I knew we had the opportunity to be here because
we have so much talent,'' Kelly Miller said. ``After that Florida
game, we have never looked back.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone who has witnessed all of Georgia's Final Four
manifestations is John Sewell, an assistant to Landers from 1982 to
1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has an advantage because they're playing with their
hearts and not according to other people's expectations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And that's exactly what Landers likes about his present bunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the ability to flip the switch and make sure we are the
intense and aggressive basketball team that we want to be,'' he
said. ``With a veteran team, I haven't had that approach in the
past. If I get serious with some of these kids, they will call
their mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to make sure that they have the mentality that
they can keep coming along,'' Landers said. ``I've pushed them
really hard this year. But now, it's not about pushing. It's about
feeling good about who we are and playing our best.

 Disputes Away From The Office
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Ilana DeBare &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I've worked for the same company for 35 years, but our
new management would like to see all the old-timers leave.
Recently, I was called into my boss' office, reprimanded for
yelling at a secretary while we were at lunch and told that I would
be terminated if there were any more complaints about me.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that I did have a verbal disagreement with this
secretary, but I didn't raise my voice. My boss was unpleasant to
me and implied I was a liar, but a week later, he said he would
drop the complaint from my file. I believe that management
exaggerated the secretary's complaint to make me look bad. How can
I find out what the secretary actually said about me? Isn't it true
that discussions during lunchtime, away from the office, are
private and can't be used against employees? What recourse do I
have?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; Answer: &LR;  Let's start with your specific questions before we
get to the bigger issue here. Companies do have a right to
investigate disputes between employees that take place outside the
office _ particularly if one employee is a manager.
</P>
<P>
   Think about how many lawsuits there are these days involving
charges like sexual harassment or discrimination. If a manager
harasses a secretary during a lunch hour, the company could face
just as big and nasty a lawsuit as if the harassment happened in
the office. So companies have not only a right, but an obligation
to look into complaints of abusive behavior that take place among
employees outside the office.
</P>
<P>
   How can you find out what the secretary actually said in her
complaint? Frankly, I'd forget about it. The complaint already has
been dropped from your file. I'd put this particular episode behind
you as fast as you can and focus on the future.
</P>
<P>
   Here's where the big picture comes in _ the forest rather than
the trees.
</P>
<P>
   You need to get some kind of a reality check on your performance
and how you're viewed by management. Ask your boss _ or someone
high up in the company whom you respect _ to sit down and have an
honest talk about your future with the firm.
</P>
<P>
   It could be that company officials value you and want to keep
you on board but have some serious criticisms of your work. If
that's the case, you need to listen carefully and try to respond
without defensiveness or paranoia.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, maybe the company really doesn't want you
around. Then maybe you should acknowledge that it's time to move on
_ and negotiate a good severance or early retirement package to
help ease your transition to a new job.
</P>
<P>
   One more note: Consider talking to a lawyer who has handled
age-discrimination cases, especially if other old-timers feel that
they're being pushed aside, too. Age-discrimination cases are hard
to win. But having some good legal advice certainly would
strengthen your negotiating position.
</P>
<P>
   Quick-Change Artist
</P>
<P>
   Q: For the past 20 years, I've been involved with publishing
but, with all the media mergers and downsizing in the publishing
industry, I've been thinking about changing careers into high tech.
What kinds of jobs are available in the industry? What are the
salary ranges? And what kinds of training are available for someone
who works full time?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Have I got the book for you: ``High-Tech Careers for
Low-Tech People,'' by Sun Microsystems manager William Schaffer.
</P>
<P>
   This gives a terrific overview of the kinds of jobs available in
technology, the workplace culture of high-tech companies and how to
get your foot in the door. It's been out of print for a while but
is about to be reissued by Ten Speed Press in Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   For salary information, check out the JobStar Web site (formerly
known as JobSmart) at  &LR; jobstar.org.  &LR; It has links to salary surveys
for more than 200 professions, including a variety of high-tech
ones.
</P>
<P>
   For training, many community colleges offer tech-related courses
on evenings and weekends. But before you start signing up
willy-nilly for classes, think about what kind of work within high
tech you want to do: Someone who wants to become a C++ programmer
needs very different skills than someone who wants to go into
high-tech sales, marketing or human resources.
</P>
<P>
   Some general tips? Think about how your current skills and
experience in publishing could be translated into a high-tech
setting. (For instance, what specialized software does your
publishing company use? You might be a great salesperson for that
software manufacturer.)
</P>
<P>
   Also think about skills that you don't use in your current job,
but would be marketable in the tech world. (Do you love planning
family and high school reunions? You might consider work as a
corporate-event planner at a tech firm.)
</P>
<P>
   The most important thing, according to Schaffer, is simply
getting in the door. That might mean taking a job where you feel
overqualified or a job that isn't exactly what you want. High tech
is fast-paced and flexible enough that, once they're in the door,
motivated people can quickly move ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get in any way you can,'' Schaffer said. ``Once you're in, you
can branch out and get training in whatever you want, whether
that's sales or becoming a computer engineer.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BAD-MOUTHING THE BOSS, PART TWO: &LR;  Last week, I said never to
bad-mouth your old boss when interviewing for a new position.
Here's one reader's response:
</P>
<P>
   ``Keeping quiet about evil former bosses is a standard piece of
advice for job candidates. However, perhaps this should be amended
when the candidate stood up against the evil, for in doing this,
the candidate displayed integrity. Integrity is one of strongest
predictors of on-the-job success, in my opinion. Would you amend
your advice for Serpico, the New York City police officer who made
waves by refusing to take bribes, was ostracized and shot in the
head but did not relent until he had reformed the entire New York
City police force? Would you advise him to prevaricate about this
experience?''
</P>
<P>
   Good point. For every piece of advice, there are situations
where it shouldn't apply. And when navigating the tricky waters of
job-hunting, be sure to keep in touch with your own intuition,
character and conscience.

 Column: American Investors Are Barely Fazed by NATO's
Bombing  Blitz 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Mark Veverka &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Strolling the streets of San Francisco's Financial District, you
would hardly know that we were at war.
</P>
<P>
   The market was rebounding robustly while big-league investors
were impervious to the fact that cruise missiles were slamming
around Belgrade. And while Montgomery Street matter-of-factly went
about its business, emotions about the Balkan intervention ran high
at the venerable Tadich Grill _ the California Street institution
founded by the Buich family upon arrival from Croatia 150 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tadich is about as close to the Balkans as you're going to get
with a Muni or BART pass. And on most any day, you'll find a
handful of Croatian waiters working along side other immigrants
from Central Europe. (In fact, on occasion, you might even find a
Serbian working next to a Croat.)
</P>
<P>
   As you might expect, Tadich attracts numerous descendants of the
Slavic tribe _ Croatian or otherwise. And yesterday, Betty Sardelis
of Perrysburg, Ohio, could be found at the counter brimming with
conflicted feelings about Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Sardelis, who was visiting town with her husband, is a
second-generation Slovenian. Her mother was born in Slovenia, and
her sister has a home there.
</P>
<P>
   Slovenia was among the first former Yugoslavian provinces to
declare independence after the Berlin Wall fell. It was also among
the first to get pounded by Serbian armies as a result.
</P>
<P>
   We bonded. Both of my mother's parents emigrated from Slovenia
shortly after the turn of the century. Needless to say, Sardelis
was a little more worked up about the Balkan bombings than your
average day trader.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing just makes me sick,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Innocent people are dying. It's just really sad.''
</P>
<P>
   But the human element doesn't always register on Montgomery
Street. Kosovo is of little economic significance _ at least for
now.
</P>
<P>
   As was the case with the Pentagon's most recent dusting of
Baghdad late last year, the investment pros are hardly concerned by
our latest global gunfight with a pesky third-world strongman.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is good intellectual reason for all of this.
Few of them really care about Kosovo. And why should they?
</P>
<P>
   Most barely know where it is. It has no oil. It is not perched
on the edge of a critical international shipping lane or some other
location of economic importance.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, it's not surprising to find the military attack against
Serbia of little imminent concern to American investors, notes
former White House economic adviser Laura D'Andrea Tyson, dean of
the Haas School of Business at the University of California at
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the lack of response by the market is a reflection of
the fact that the (bombings) have no immediate impact on the U.S.
economy or global economy,'' Tyson says.
</P>
<P>
   That said, if American lives are lost or the conflict spreads to
neighboring nations, ``the situation has the potential to become a
more unsettling factor,'' Tyson adds.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, American investors are barely fazed by NATO's air blitz
in the Balkans. Folks in San Francisco's Financial District say the
bombings aren't weighing on the minds of salesmen peddling stocks
or portfolio managers making trades.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, if one pauses for a moment, isn't that just the least bit
unsettling? Have we become so inebriated by our own financial good
fortune that we have grown callous to the world around us, ignoring
any event that doesn't impact our stock portfolios?
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say investors should make stock decisions in
reaction to world events. But perhaps it would be good karma to at
least acknowledge them.
</P>
<P>
   No matter where you stand on the issue of intervention in
Yugoslavia _ and there is no right or wrong position _ the age of
televised war seems to have desensitized us to our government's
aggressions.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dow ticker keeps on ticking. And as long as China, Korea
or Russia aren't involved, military actions like the current ones
against Serbia aren't of dire importance to the financial world.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, they have no reason to be. But if Russia were to get
dragged into this, you can bet that war again would matter on
Montgomery Street.

GRAND JURY FOREWOMAN WOULD HAVE INDICTED CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The grand jury forewoman in the Monica Lewinsky
scandal said Thursday night that she would have indicted President
Clinton for perjury if she had been asked to.
</P>
<P>
   In the first public comments by any of the grand jurors, the
forewoman, Freda Alexander, added that she was relieved, however,
that her panel was not charged with considering Clinton's actions
as a criminal matter. And she said that she did not think his
offenses warranted his removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   Her primary misgiving about Clinton's impeachment and Senate
trial, Ms. Alexander said in a telephone interview, was the degree
to which it must have taken the president's and other lawmakers'
attention away from other tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder what would have happened _ I wonder what kind of
legacy he would have been able to leave _ if he hadn't been
distracted by all the investigations,'' she said. ``I still have a
great deal of respect for him.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Ms. Alexander said she emerged from her 18 months of
grand jury service, which ended last week, with sympathetic
feelings toward almost all the main players who came before her.
</P>
<P>
   Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr was a stickler for rules and
morals simply doing what he felt was his job, she said. Clinton's
advisers and aides were simply looking out for their boss. And Ms.
Lewinsky was simply any young girl, out for adventure and in thrall
to temptation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is a young woman who could be any one of us if we were to
truly admit it,'' Ms. Alexander said. ``We conveniently forget this
stuff once we get mature. I don't think she's a hussy. I think
she's a young person full of enthusiasm, willing to try new
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Although federal grand jurors are technically forbidden to speak
about what they heard and saw even after they are released from
service, Ms. Alexander, who is 46 and lives in Washington, D.C.,
said she felt that once her service was over, it was her ``First
Amendment right'' to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   But she said she did not approach news organizations. During her
service, she said, she lost her job as a hotel manager, and in
recent interviews for new jobs, she explained that she had been out
of work so long because of the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   That information, she said, found its way to a hotel industry
trade publication, USAE News, and from there to other news
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Alexander said her belief that Clinton perjured himself
stemmed from his insistence that he did not have sexual relations
with Ms. Lewinsky, as well as his statements that oral sex did not
fall within his understanding of the meaning of sexual relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say, for instance, my boyfriend and I define the fact that we
won't have sexual relations with any other person,'' Ms. Alexander
said. ``Now, I come home or we meet somewhere and I find him and
oral sex is being performed. That would be curtains, that would be
it, because to me that's sexual relations.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Alexander said that while she believed that Clinton
committed perjury, she did not want to see him prosecuted. In fact,
she said, her strongest criticism of his behavior in regard to Ms.
Lewinsky was that he exercised poor judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he made an awful, awful choice, because of her age,''
Ms. Alexander said. ``A young person that age loves to talk, and
because they love to talk, there's a certain discretion that you
would be missing.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that as president, a person is obliged ``to use
discretion in its highest form in everything that you do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Alexander said that she did not feel that her year and a
half on the grand jury was wasted, because it was a legitimate
inquiry that indeed got at the truth.
</P>
<P>
   What made the experience difficult, she said, was that she had
always admired Clinton and wanted to hold onto that regard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I care about a lot about some of the things he's done,'' said
Ms. Alexander, who is black. ``Look at the White House, look at the
staff. You have disabled Americans there. You have blacks. Have you
ever seen such an array of nationalities in previous
administrations?''
</P>
<P>
   She said she was not at all convinced from the evidence
presented to her that Clinton obstructed justice, the charge in the
second article of impeachment against him.
</P>
<P>
   She also said that she was often deeply moved by the obvious
fear and embarrassment that many of the witnesses brought before
the grand jury were experiencing. She said the most upsetting
moment was hearing Ms. Lewinsky talk about the day that Starr's
investigators confronted her at a hotel, told her they knew about
her relationship with the president, and detained her for
questioning for hours on end.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Monica retold her story about her detainment at the Ritz
Carlton,'' Ms. Alexander said, ``everyone was crying in the room,
including the court reporter.''

 Pac Bell Stumbles With DSL
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Deborah Solomon &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Some Pacific Bell customers who signed up for the company's
high-speed Internet service say they are not getting what the
company promised.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell's digital subscriber line service uses existing phone
lines to deliver Internet service at speeds up to 50 times faster
than with traditional modems. It also lets users talk on the phone
and surf the Web simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   But some DSL customers say they can't access the Internet after
it is installed. Others complain that technicians miss their
appointments for installations. And some customers who are told
they can get the service are then told on installation day that
their wiring can't accommodate it.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell acknowledged that the DSL rollout has not gone as
smoothly as planned and attributed it to enormous demand and
growing pains associated with deploying a new technology.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The company said yesterday it is canceling a contract with
Livermore's Prime Services Group, the firm it hired to help install
DSL service in California. Prime Services had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided in order to be world class and deliver the customer
care the people of California expect, we'd be better served to have
Pac Bell employees doing'' the installations, said Mike McLeland,
Pac Bell's vice president of business service operations.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell has been selling DSL service since last year. Last
month, it cut the price from $89 to $39 a month, prompting a huge
increase in customer demand. Company officials said Pac Bell got
three times as many more  &LR; customer calls as it expected and has
been struggling to deal with all the requests.
</P>
<P>
   The company would not disclose how many DSL customers it has.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have experienced some process problems, as customers called
in in greater numbers than we expected,'' said McLeland. He added
the company has ``all but fixed these problems.''
</P>
<P>
   McLeland said the average number of days a customer must wait
for DSL installation has fallen to seven days from 18 days in
February.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell spokesman John Britton said the company is learning as
it goes. He said Pac Bell has a 94 percent customer satisfaction
rate with DSL but admits that's not high enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you're doing something new, obstacles come up that we
have to overcome. Are we happy with 94 percent? No. We intend to
improve that and get that better.''
</P>
<P>
   The complaints about DSL have made their way to state regulators
and consumer groups. Linda Woods, manager of the state Public
Utilities Commission's consumer affairs branch, said the PUC isn't
being deluged with complaints about DSL but is taking the ones it
does get seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if we were getting half a dozen
(complaints) a day,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The Office of Ratepayer Advocates, the PUC's consumer arm,
also has received about a dozen complaints from upset customers,
according to Kelly Boyd, senior telecommunications analyst at ORA.
</P>
<P>
   One frustrated customer is Jeremy Smith, who has been trying to
get a DSL line installed in his San Mateo home for three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was told the service would be installed March 17 and
stayed home from work to wait for the technician. Nobody showed up
and the company never called to explain.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving five messages with Pac Bell, Smith finally reached
someone who apologized and said a technician would be there the
next day.
</P>
<P>
   A Prime Services Group representative arrived the next day and
told him that installation was going to be a problem because
Smith's wiring was bad. Smith left for work and when he came home,
he found a note telling him the service couldn't be installed. He
complained to Pac Bell, which sent two technicians out to fix the
wiring and install DSL, but the service never worked.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Smith's DSL service finally started working, but at a
cost: It nearly destroyed the voice quality on Smith's phone line,
something that's not supposed to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a darn disaster,'' said Smith, who ordered the line
so he could do more work from home. ``They shouldn't be offering
the service if they don't know how to make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Kelton, who lives in San Francisco, has had similar
problems with his DSL line.
</P>
<P>
   He ordered the service about a month ago but has been forced to
use his regular dial-up modem because the DSL service doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``A technician came out three weeks ago and told me my service
would be up in two days,'' Kelton said. ``It's still not working.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems appear similar to those experienced by customers
when Pac Bell's ISDN service was new. Pac Bell technicians often
missed customer appointments and failed to install the technology,
which also gives users fast Internet service. Last year, the
company was fined $309,000 by the state for providing
``inadequate'' ISDN service. The PUC established service quality
guidelines and ordered Pac Bell to waive installation fees on ISDN
if customers surveyed by the PUC continued to rate the service as
``poor'' or ``terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Larribeau, who runs the California Broadband Users Group in
San Francisco, said the DSL problems sound eerily familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company has to learn how to do DSL,'' Larribeau said.
``ISDN was the start, DSL is just a next step and people are going
to demand and want more and better services. Pac Bell needs to
learn to do it right.''
</P>
<P>
   While the company shouldn't offer a service it cannot deliver,
Larribeau said there are significant challenges to deploying the
technology that might account for some of the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Customers must live within three &UR;  &LR; miles of a central switching
office to receive DSL. Within that radius, customers who live
closer to the switching office will get higher-quality service than
those who live farther away, Larribeau said. By year end, about 50
percent of Pac Bell's customers will be able to get the service.
</P>
<P>
   Also, many of Pac Bell's phone lines are old and need to be
upgraded to handle DSL. In some cases, the company may not know
there's a problem until they attempt to install the service and
find they can't.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of issues and a lot of processes that we've
been reviewing'' McLeland said. ``These are growing pains. And for
every customer that has a bad experience, there are 95 that have
had a wonderful experience.''

Supervisors at United Behavioral Health, a San Francisco insurance
company, were less than thrilled last spring when its chairman
announced plans to hire seven high school interns to work in the
office all summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first we couldn't get managers to sign on,'' said Pam
Russo, vice president of human resources. ``They didn't feel they
had time to train a new person.''
</P>
<P>
   But the students' arrival quickly changed all that. ``They were
so enthusiastic it was contagious,'' said Russo. Longtime staffers
even began reassessing their attitudes. ``It was like, `Wow, look
how much fun they're having and how come we're not? What did we
lose and how did we lose it?''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Russo, some of last year's reluctant supervisors
now want two or three interns this year.
</P>
<P>
   With summer just around the corner, it is time for interested
employers to start planning for the arrival of high school interns,
who are available to virtually any company with entry-level work to
be done.
</P>
<P>
   Employers that don't want to do their own recruiting can tap
into myriad Bay Area groups that develop programs, recruit from
schools, screen candidates and give young workers basic training
and support.
</P>
<P>
   Some internship programs are designed for high school students
to learn about professions &LR;   &LR; that interest them. For example, San
Francisco's Enterprise for High School Students, a nonprofit that
matches students and companies, places teens with landscapers,
plumbers, environmental scientists and oncologists.
</P>
<P>
   Other programs, such as the Mayor's Summer Jobs Program in
Oakland, are designed simply to give kids their first taste of the
working world. Typical jobs are in retailing, fast food, clerical
or customer service.
</P>
<P>
   When internship programs are run well, they can boost the morale
of everyone in the office, teach young people important skills and
even be cost-effective for the employer.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also some common pitfalls that businesses should
be careful to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   The most common mistake employers make in approaching high
school interns is to view them as nothing more than cheap labor,
said Susan Hoganson, executive director of Enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The programs that aren't that successful are ones where a
supervisor says, `Oh great, I can have a kid come in and do my
filing and Xeroxing for two months,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While mundane tasks like photocopying or moving boxes may be
perfectly acceptable intern duties, there should also be an
educational component to the job, said Hoganson. ``Anybody who
supervises a young person in a new venture really has accepted the
responsibility for that person's learning and development.''
</P>
<P>
   Eva Cheng, a senior at Abraham Lincoln High School in San
Francisco, said her clerical internship last summer at Aon Risk
Services, an insurance broker, was such a learning experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just being part of an actual work environment is very helpful
for me because later on I'll know how to work with people and what
to expect from people,'' said Cheng, who is planning to go to
college and then pursue a career in business.
</P>
<P>
   One important lesson for Cheng, who has continued working for
Aon after school, was learning she could ask questions about things
she didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   Internship experts say there are certain key guidelines
employers should follow to help make their internship programs
successful:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Look for motivation above skill.  &LR; Employers should resist the
temptation to hire the fastest typist or most accomplished
programmer while ignoring the applicant's attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Many internship programs let companies interview job candidates,
a process that should help identify eager students.
</P>
<P>
   Employers should also look for students who have shown an
interest in the field through other jobs or courses, or those who
have demonstrated their initiative through after-school activities,
said Hoganson.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Put some effort into designing the program.  &LR; Once a business
has decided it wants to sponsor an intern, the next step is to make
sure there is enough work, on an appropriate skill level, to keep a
teenager challenged for a summer.
</P>
<P>
   Aon started preparing for its first interns last year by looking
at an existing entry-level job description. Human resources staff
and section heads then altered it to meet the needs of different
departments and the skill level of teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key factor in making the internships a success was the
prep,'' said Tamra Green, Aon's human resources director. ``If we
had just brought the bodies in and waited to see what happened, it
probably wouldn't have worked.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Don't underestimate the students.  &LR; While it is important to
not assign teenagers tasks beyond their abilities, managers should
also be open to giving them more responsibilities if they prove
themselves capable _ and have plenty of work on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Washington, a student at Thurgood Marshall High School in
Bayview, was asked to create an Intranet site last summer during a
stint at Charles Schwab Corp. in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, who plans to attend college and get work in a
computer-related field, worked diligently and nearly finished the
project the first week. Most of the rest of the summer was spent
doing clerical tasks, although Washington has been asked to return
during breaks from school to add material to the site.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Assign projects.  &LR; Ideally internships should revolve around
special projects that give students something concrete to show for
their efforts at the end of the summer, said Hoganson.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can say, `Wow, I produced this brochure' or `I did a
survey,' it gives them a sense of accomplishment,'' as well as
teaching them what the profession is like,'' said Hoganson.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Assign mentors.  &LR; Each intern should have one employee assigned
as a mentor and a second, backup supervisor in case the mentor
misses work. Both overseers should be willing volunteers rather
than reluctant draftees.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest things our kids are lacking is a
supportive, caring adult in their lives,'' said Hoganson. ``This
adult (mentor) hopefully will be someone who really cares.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Pop the bubble gently.  &LR; Interns may have unrealistic
expectations of glamour on the job. ``At first, they often don't
understand that we adults in the work world don't have people doing
photocopying and errand running for us,'' said Hoganson. ``The
stars in their eyes on the first day are gone by the end of the
first week.''
</P>
<P>
   To help interns make the transition, employers should make sure
the students know their work is appreciated, even if it seems
mundane.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Realize that sometimes it simply won't work out.  &LR; Like any
other employee, interns may have personality conflicts with their
co-workers. They may be immature, or they may hate the work they
thought they would enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   At Aon, a special position was created in the information
services department for an intern who wanted to work with
computers. But she turned down each task she was assigned, saying
it bored her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was counting the days till the six weeks were over and she
could get the check and go clothes shopping,'' said Green. ``From a
maturity standpoint, she just wasn't ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Students and employers interested in internships should contact
their school career center, their mayor's office or their local
chamber of commerce. County private industry councils typically
administer federally funded job programs such as the Summer Youth
Employment Training Program.
</P>
<P>
   Employers are generally expected to pay high school interns
between $6 and $8 an hour, although the U.S. government pays for
disadvantaged teens who find jobs through the SYETP.

NEW FOOD GUIDE FOR CHILDREN HAS SODA COMPANIES IN A FIZZ 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MARIAN BURROS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Department of Agriculture Thursday issued its first
guidelines on how to feed young children a nutritious diet,
emphasizing the value of grains, fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   A soft drink can that illustrates the recommendation that
children should ``eat less'' sugar in their diets has outraged the
soda companies, which annually sell an average of 56.1 gallons of
soda per person in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The new guidelines are in the form of a pyramid, with grains at
the base, fruits and vegetables on a narrower level above, meat at
a still narrower level above that, and a soda can at the top. A
similar food pyramid for the general population issued in 1992
shows sugar at the top.
</P>
<P>
   The meaning of ``less'' is not spelled out in the new Food Guide
Pyramid for Children, which is intended for 2- to 6-year-olds, or
in any of the accompanying literature, but the under secretary of
agriculture for Food, Nutrition and Consumers Services, Shirley
Watkins, said the department had long held that the most a young
child should drink is half a 12-ounce can of soda a day.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Watkins said that any additional source of extra sugar, like
sugary cereals, cookies or cupcakes, would put the child over the
recommended limit.
</P>
<P>
   According to Agriculture Department statistics, on any given day
37 percent of children 2-6 years of age in the United States
consume an average of 10 ounces of soda.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time that the consumption of soft drinks has risen
almost 34 gallons per person annually since 1970, the National Soft
Drink Association disputes the department's consumption figures for
all 2- to 6-year-olds, saying the average is 2 to 4 ounces of soda
a day.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the secretary of agriculture, Dan Glickman, the
association accused the department of ``demonizing'' soft drinks
with its new guidelines for children.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, from the association's president, William Ball III,
said that by singling out soft drinks the department ``appears to
have made an abrupt shift in philosophy'' that ``there is no such
thing as a good food or a bad food.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Watkins disputed that. ``Somehow people perceived food at
the tip of pyramid should not be eaten, and that is not true,'' Ms.
Watkins said. ``Anything on the pyramid should be eaten, but
children should eat more of certain foods than others.''
</P>
<P>
   What they should eat most of are grains, which form the base of
the pyramid, followed by fruits and vegetables, then milk and meat,
topped by fats and sweets.
</P>
<P>
   The argument did not persuade the Agriculture Department to
remove the soda pop can from the top of the pyramid, so the soft
drink industry sent its lobbyists to press members of the House and
Senate Agriculture committees, who hold the department's purse
strings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt Congress should be involved in this departure in
nutritional philosophy,'' Ball said.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Glickman, the chairmen and ranking members of the
two committees said they were ``concerned about lack of
consultation'' on the pyramid for young children. ``Based on
reports, there are several concerns with the depiction of certain
foods in the graphical presentation of the guide,'' a reference to
the soda can.
</P>
<P>
   The only change the agency made was in the colors of the soda
icon, which originally made it look like a can of Pepsi.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the news conference Wednesday announcing the new children's
pyramid, Glickman and Ms. Watkins responded to the complaints by
repeatedly emphasizing the Agriculture Department's decades-old
philosophy that there are no good foods or bad foods, and that
people should eat a variety of food.
</P>
<P>
   These messages were greeted with outrage by an advocacy group in
Washington that has urged a stronger federal role in promoting
healthy diets. Margo Wootan, a senior scientist for the group, the
Center for Science in the Public Interest, said she was very
disappointed in the pyramid, which features such high saturated fat
foods as hamburgers in the meat group, cheese and ice cream in the
dairy group and not a single whole grain product in the grain
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are basically promoting unhealthy choices,'' Ms. Wootan
said. ``USDA seems to think the two most important messages to
promote are to eat a variety of foods and that there are no bad
foods. But the most important messages for promoting health are to
eat more fruits and vegetables, eat more whole grains, choose
low-fat and fat-free dairy products and lean meats or meat
alternatives. No wonder Americans are eating a lousy diet.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the increasing obesity in the United States, experts
say the new guidelines for children are unlikely to have any more
impact than dietary advice has had on adults.
</P>
<P>
   A graphic of the pyramid and a the booklet that accompanies it
may be downloaded from www.usda.gov/cnpp, or bought for $5 from the
Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office,
Washington, D.C. 20402.

'79 GAME WAS NO CLASSIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You'll hear a lot of people reminiscing today
about the game that gave college basketball legs. It's interesting
how hindsight has effectively whitewashed the facts, giving a
second wind to an NCAA Final that wheezed and staggered into
history.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA Tournament has given us more compelling theater than
the title game that took place on this date 20 years ago. Indiana
State versus Michigan State is memorable mostly for being a key
player in the fastbreak that produced office pools as a rite of
spring, Cinderella cliches by the carriage-full and Dick Vitale.
</P>
<P>
   The 1979 matchup between a Spartans team led by Earvin ``Magic''
Johnson and an unbeaten Sycamores squad powered by Larry Bird
produced boffo television ratings, outstripping any NCAA men's
basketball championship before or since. (Even that fact is
somewhat misleading, the rating (24.1) and share (38) a product of
a time before televisions started collecting in households like
cobwebs.)
</P>
<P>
   The game attracted a large audience. But as far as drama goes,
it didn't come close to ``Dynasty,'' the prime-time-player of its
day. Think Denver's John Elway and San Francisco's Joe Montana in
the 1990 Super Bowl and you get the idea. In the 75-64 loss that
ruined Indiana State's bid for an unblemished 34-0 season, Bird
would go 13 minutes without a field goal, miss 14 of 21 shots and
finish with 19 points, 10 below his nation-leading average.
</P>
<P>
   On this night Bird wasn't just eclipsed by Johnson (24 points,
seven rebounds). He was embarrassed by the Michigan State guard he
was assigned to defend. That would be senior Greg Kelser, who
contributed 19 points and nine assists and then collected more NCAA
All-Tournament team votes than the Sycamores' stoic senior.
</P>
<P>
   Bird's last shot as a collegian was a missed jumper. So
inconsolable was he afterward that he refused to address a roomful
of reporters despite the pleadings of NCAA officials, who told him
that talking to the press was ``in the best interests'' of college
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson met every media obligation with a smile and a warm
handshake but wasn't so accommodating when it came to his
commitment to Michigan State. He passed on his final two years of
school for the NBA, paving the way for the steady exodus of
underclassmen to the pros that no less an authority than John
Wooden worries is undercutting the game today at both levels.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Bird were wondrously talented basketball players and
fiercely competitive. Without question the seed of the rivalry
planted in the Special Events Center on the University of Utah
campus in 1979 reached full bloom in the NBA, with Bird's Boston
Celtics or Johnson's Lakers winning the championship in eight of
the ensuing nine years, thrice at the expense of the other.
</P>
<P>
   What we dispute is the notion, spread like manure over the past
20 years, that Johnson and Bird were veritable sons of Zeus, who
lifted the collegiate game to prominence on their broad shoulders.
The meeting of these two superlative players in the NCAA Final
wasn't a slam dunk. It was more like the outlet pass that cable TV
took and converted into March Madness.
</P>
<P>
   If not viewed through a cable TV lens, it's impossible to
properly frame the Indiana State-Michigan State game in college
basketball's big picture. It'd be like trying to explain Muhammad
Ali's popularity without the context of the Vietnam War. Or Tiger
Woods' heroics minus the circumstances of his multiethnicity. Or
last year's home-run derby between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa
outside the framework of the 1994 baseball strike.
</P>
<P>
   But don't take our word for it. Listen to Billy Packer, who
worked the telecast of the 1979 final. Said Packer, who has had a
courtside seat for a quarter of a century of college hoops history,
``When I'm talking about all the NCAA Tournaments I've done, the
most nondescript one is 1979. Now people are trying to rewrite
history and say it was the best only because of what happened
afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened was Johnson and Bird blew up as pros and cable TV
sports exploded into our living rooms. The 1979 NCAA Tournament
would be the last of the P.C. (pre-cable) age. By the time
Louisville and UCLA met for the NCAA title in 1980 _ in the first
of eight championship games in the decade that were decided by five
or fewer points _ ESPN was up and running and trampling all over
the two-minute sportscast shoehorned into the regular networks'
nightly news.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before the cable outlet was showing every
tournament game and coating its coverage in layers of analysis
because, well, with all those endless hours of air time to fill, it
could.
</P>
<P>
   The networks responded in kind, and gods and monsters were born.
The blanket coverage piqued the interest of the public, and that
caught the attention of advertisers, who poured money into the
men's NCAA Tournament coffers, which raised the viability,
visibility and volatility of college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   What price, progress? From freshmen who weren't eligible to
play, the game has evolved, if you will, to underclassmen whose
eligibility is maintained with the help of tutors who ghostwrite
their term papers while school athletic officials look the other
way.
</P>
<P>
   That scandal rocking the University of Minnesota should give
fans of college basketball everywhere cause to glumly wonder: Was
the 1979 NCAA Tournament final the beginning or the beginning of
the end? &QL;

<P>
   Peter Finn, a Washington Post correspondent and former Fort
Worth Star-Telegram reporter, was detained and interrogated for at
least eight hours by Serbian police, then was released unharmed on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Finn was driven in a van to the border of Croatia by Serbian
police and expelled from Yugoslavia, said a Post assistant managing
editor, Philip Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   During his detention, the Serbian police interrogated Finn,
without offering him food and water, Bennett said. The police
officials asked him his views of the conflict and who he had been
interviewing.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian Police escorted Finn from his Belgrade hotel at 4 a.m.
Thursday, telling a clerk that he would be expelled, Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   Finn's wife, Nora Fitzgerald, who was in Warsaw, Poland, said
she was relieved when she heard of his release.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were up all night,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Finn, who worked for Star-Telegram Northeast edition for 2 1/2
years from 1993 until 1996, was recovering from the ordeal in
Budapest, Hungary, on Thursday. The Post plans to send Finn back to
cover the conflict as soon as he is allowed back into the country,
Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   The Post does not know why the Serbian police singled out Finn,
Bennett said. R. Jeffrey Smith, the Post's lead correspondent for
the Balkans, was not detained by Serbian police. Smith also left
Yugoslavia on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has become extremely hazardous there,'' Bennett said.
``Almost no (American) reporters are left.''
</P>
<P>
   Finn has been the Post's Warsaw Bureau chief for the last 10
months, Bennett said.

HOUSTON'S VIEW FROM THE BENCH: WATCHING THE KNICKS UNRAVEL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Allan Houston could lay back, stretch out his legs and
let his perspiration dry. He could be himself on the bench, where
there was no one to tell him to stand up straight, puff out his
chest or snap to attention.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jeff Van Gundy didn't have time for that Wednesday night
in Sacramento. There was a game to be played and an attitude that
was required. After three years of mentally challenging Houston to
search for the hidden edge inside of his soft shell, Van Gundy
decided to bench his star shooter for the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being a part of the Knicks' habitual unraveling,
Houston watched as helpless as a witness to an accident as his team
lost its third game in a row.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth time in the last week, the Knicks let a
fourth-quarter lead slip away. For the fourth time this season _
and third time alone for Patrick Ewing _ the Knicks were left to
take and miss a shot at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time this year, Latrell Sprewell's mental mistake
in the final seconds aided the collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Sprewell left Milwaukee's Del Curry alone for a
game-winning 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Kings, he inexplicably lost control of his dribble,
allowing the ball to escape off his left hand, in front of the
Sacramento rookie Jason Williams in a tie game with 12.1 seconds
remaining. Out of frustration, Sprewell fouled Williams and sent
him to the free-throw line where he made one of two to provide the
Kings with a 92-91 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just lost it,'' said Sprewell, who scored 16 points and took
several panicked shots while hitting 3 of 7 attempts in the fourth
quarter. ``I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. I got going one way
and the ball went the other. It's the same old story. Another loss
in a close one. I think we're at the bottom of the barrel.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where you could find Houston's psyche as well. Slumped on
the bench, Houston never felt so isolated. He would have rather had
Van Gundy berate him than bench him. But deep down, Houston knew he
hadn't responded when the nondescript Tariq Abdul-Wahad defended
him chin-to-chin, and he realized his lethargic defense and
careless ball handling had left him where he belonged.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had been playing well, I'd have been in the game,''
Houston said after shooting 3 for 8 and committing 3 turnovers in
26 minutes. ``I think the team needs me, and that's what's
frustrating. It's like I'm leaving the team out to dry right now.
I'm not worried about me.''
</P>
<P>
   But he is concerned with himself at times. Lately, he has seemed
torn between what kind of player he should be for the Knicks.
Should he run with Latrell Sprewell or wait for Patrick Ewing? Many
times, Houston's mind is cluttered with indecision.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to reveal a flashy side, but with 71 turnovers to just
89 assists, he does not possess the ball-handling skills to pull
off a jaw-dropping, no-look pass off the break. He longs to be a
consistent threat on the wing but often forgets to barge to the
basket when his jumper is not falling. When he gives up the ball to
Sprewell, there is no assurance that he'll get it back. When he
dumps the ball into Ewing, he becomes a plodding bystander.
</P>
<P>
   With time, Houston will probably find his niche and discover his
groove. In each of his four previous seasons, it has taken him
about two months to get going.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, there is no time. It's now, or it's over.
</P>
<P>
   Two months into the season, the Knicks are 15-13 as they prepare
to face the Suns on Friday. With less than half a season to go, the
Knicks are in danger of missing the playoffs for the first time in
more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   It's a level of mediocrity borne, in part, out of unfamiliarity.
In the past, the Knicks have known who they can count on in a
difficult situation. Now, they don't appear sure. So far, Sprewell
has yet to prove he can be a money player on a winning team, and
Marcus Camby hasn't shown he's capable of finishing a physical
layup on a consistent basis.
</P>
<P>
   At core of the team, Ewing, Larry Johnson and Houston still
remain. Ewing, at age 36, is producing enough to keep his team in
games but has looked more and more deflated as the losses pile up.
Instead of bravado, you hear uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time,'' Ewing said when asked when he could
remember a Knick team at 15-13. ``A real long time. But we have to
stay strong. What doesn't kill you makes you better.''
</P>
<P>
   Pain is all but killing Johnson. He has been close to
unstoppable early in games, but in a crammed schedule, the
tendinitis in his knee flares up on a nightly basis and his
mobility tends to plummet. He gritted his teeth to save two
rebounds by the Knicks in the last 48 seconds of the game to no
avail.
</P>
<P>
   Houston watched it all unfold from the bench. Maybe it was just
a one-time thing. Maybe it will inspire Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, there are no signs that Van Gundy is ready to start
the frenzied Sprewell _ who has grumbled about his sixth man role _
and risk damaging Houston's confidence further by using him off the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's role is too important. He is the one player who is
healthy enough, young enough and talented enough to pick up his
team. You just wouldn't know it by looking at him when he lopes by.
He doesn't carry himself with a leader's attitude.
</P>
<P>
   For three years, Van Gundy has tried to coax Houston out of his
laid-back nature. He has clapped his hands, limited his minutes and
pulled out every tough love method he can find. Through it all, Van
Gundy has watched the affable Houston dig deep to unearth a defiant
mean streak, just as he did when he scored 30 points for an
undermanned Knick team to take the first-round playoff series last
year in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But his dominant streaks are often followed up with a hiccup in
his mentality as he reverts back to form. Faced with Sacramento, in
a game the Knicks desperately needed for a self-esteem boost,
Houston couldn't snap out of his malaise. Van Gundy had little
option but to put him on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it didn't work because we didn't win,'' Van Gundy
said. `'I don't think it was one of Allan's better nights.''

AIR ATTACK CONTINUES AS US EMBASSIES ARE TARGETED
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES AND LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO forces launched a second round of airstrikes
Thursday against Serbian military targets in Yugoslavia as
protesters pelted US embassies in Macedonia and Russia and US
officials worried that the violence was spreading into neighboring
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   US officials, seeking to build public support for the mission,
said Thursday that the forces of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic had not let up their attacks on the ethnic Albanian
population in Kosovo, even after the US-led NATO strikes heavily
damaged Serb military bases and ammunition storage sites in the
first bombing wave on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been some further burning of villages, further
sweep operations, some shelling into Albania,'' said National
Security Adviser Samuel R. ``Sandy'' Berger. ``And it's obviously
very disturbing to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Several US officials pointed to Serbia's continuing aggression
against the Kosovar Albanians and the spread of fighting beyond
Yugoslavia's borders as evidence the airstrikes were necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``These developments are unfortunately exactly what we have come
to expect from President Milosevic,'' Secretary of State Madeleine
K. Albright said at a news briefing. ``They underscore the need for
sustained military action to limit the capability of his military
to threaten innocent people in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright said ``diplomatic channels remain open'' for Milosevic.
``He knows how to get in touch with us.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton joined other US officials in dismissing the
possibility of using US ground troops to help the Kosovars,
insisting that NATO's air power was sufficient to damage Serbia's
military capacity.
</P>
<P>
   US officials said the NATO bombing campaign would continue until
Milosevic's ability to wage war is diminished, or until he ends the
fighting in Kosovo and accepts the peace agreement recently
negotiated in France and signed by the ethnic Albanian separatists
but rejected by the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the second day of airstrikes began Thursday, the
Yugoslav government announced it was breaking off diplomatic
relations with the United States, France, Germany, and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The airstrikes had ``humiliated and embarrassed'' relations
between Yugoslav and those four countries, said a statement read on
Serbian state television.
</P>
<P>
   Berger and Albright insisted that the NATO alliance of 19
nations was not showing signs of strain with the mission, though
Greece and Italy suggested a return to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure you that the allies are united and supported by
many NATO partners behind forceful and sustained NATO action,''
Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon said the second day of
strikes, which began at noon, would be ``substantive'' and
``severe.''
</P>
<P>
   Having focused the first wave of strikes on neutralizing
Serbia's air defenses, the second phase is designed to destroy the
Yugoslav military and police forces responsible for attacking
Kosovar Albanians, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes also would rely more heavily on manned aircraft
rather than missiles. By late Thursday afternoon, 60 warplanes had
taken off from Aviano Air Force Base in Italy, and 20 Tomahawk
cruise missiles were launched. There was another appearance by two
batwing B-2 Stealth bombers, which successfully dropped 2,000-pound
bombs Thursday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   Missiles and bombs blasted army barracks used in the campaign
against ethnic Albanians, an airport, and communications and air
defense centers across the country, witnesses told Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO headquarters in Brussels, NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana and US Army General Wesley Clark, the top commander of NATO
forces, said they were satisfied with the initial round of strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Forty targets, including command and control systems, and
facilities of the ministerial police forces and the Yugoslav
military, were hit during the first phase of the action, dubbed
``Operation Allied Force.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav forces did not unleash the expected wave of
antiaircraft battery against NATO aircraft, most of which were
flying above their shooting range, but there was some air-to-air
combat, with losses only on the Serbian side.
</P>
<P>
   Clark and Solana, however, warned of the considerable strength
and firepower of Yugoslav forces, and the danger the weather and
terrain posed to NATO forces.
</P>
<P>
   Clark predicted that Serb forces would be brought to their knees
before the operation ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to systematically and progressively attack,
disrupt, degrade, devastate and ultimately _ unless President
Milosevic complies with the demands of the international community
_ we're going to destroy his forces,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   In Macedonia, which borders Yugoslavia, thousands of
demonstrators chanting ``NATO out of Macedonia'' reacted angrily to
the military action and attacked the US Embassy there.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia has a NATO presence of about 10,000 troops that could
be used to implement the peace agreement, if and when Milosevic
signs it. Under the agreement, US troops would be part of an
international peacekeeping force of nearly 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Concern is mounting over the safety of NATO soldiers in Bosnia
and in Macedonia. Members of Congress were told during a briefing
Thursday that it appeared Serbian forces were also shelling
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, protesters yelling ``fascists'' burned the US flag
and smashed windows, illustrating widespread anger with the attacks
on the Serbs, who have cultural, historical, and religious ties to
Russia. Russia introduced a UN Security Council resolution Thursday
demanding an immediate halt to the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the administration fended off criticism in
Congress. Senators pointed to mounting Serb aggression against
Kosovar Albanians as evidence that Milosevic might not submit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have an end game, an exit strategy, and clearly
articulated goals,'' said Senator John McCain, Republican of
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Clinton maintained, ``The exit strategy is what it
always is in a military operation: It's when the mission is
completed.''
</P>
<P>
   Some senators, however, are looking for new strategies to
resolve the conflict. Senators Joseph I. Lieberman, a Democrat in
Connecticut, and Mitch McConnell, a Republican in Kentucky,
introduced a bill Thursday calling for $25 million to arm the
Kosovars to defend themselves against the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, also proposed
legislation to make the overthrow of Milosevic official US policy.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that about half of all Americans support the
airstrikes. But Clinton said he was not concerned the public is not
more strongly behind the action. ``I believe that many Americans
really have not thought a lot about this until the last two days.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbia ordered out foreign journalists Thursday from countries
participating in NATO airstrikes, accusing them of aiding the
bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A Globe correspondent was among those ordered out, but Globe
reporters remain in the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro and in
neighboring Macedonia.

 &HT;    `Jason' star blames lawyers for mega-bust
 &HT;    By Alex Clough
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _
</P>
<P>
   He was ``Jason in Friday the 13th, Part 2,'' victimizing hapless
teens.
</P>
<P>
   Now, F. Warrington Gillet III says he's the victim _ of a Fort
Lauderdale-based law firm that cheated him, and his Palm Beach
friends, out of millions.
</P>
<P>
   Gillet, of Maryland, might not be known to those who vote for
the Oscars, but his family is very well known by those in the local
monied crowd.
</P>
<P>
   His father and stepmother, F. Warrington and Elesabeth, are
active in Palm Beach society and in the horsey set in Maryland. The
late cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post is the younger
Gillet's great-grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Gillet, 40, tapped this crowd when he came up with an idea for a
company, Discovery Studio Inc. Gillet says in a federal lawsuit
that his company was torpedoed by the fraud and negligence of the
law firm he hired _ Atlas, Pearlman, Trop &AMP; Borkson.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for Atlas Pearlman, which has an office in Boca
Raton, denied the charge and said Gillet's problems resulted from
bad luck, not fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a grandiose dream and ideas about making huge profits.
But he came into the market when it was volatile. . . . It didn't
work out,'' said James Kaplan.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery's plan was to set up photography studios in malls.
Those looking to break into modeling would pay small fees to get
their photos taken and sent to top agencies. Discovery also would
peddle cosmetics and perfumes _ the real revenue source of the
business.
</P>
<P>
   Gillet, who left acting after his stint as Jason in the 1981
movie, pulled out all the stops to launch his new business. He
brought on board Palm Beach resident Joseph Cornacchia, who
manufactured the board game Pictionary and was a top marketer of
Trivial Pursuit. Cornacchia, who acted in an informal advisory
role, invested $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Socialite Mary Lou Whitney also was involved as a member of the
company's beauty advisory committee. Two European princesses, Bea
Auersberg of Austria and Loretta Wittgenstein of Germany, signed on
to help market and distribute Discovery products overseas,
according to the company's business plan.
</P>
<P>
   Gillet then struck a deal with shopping center developer Al
Taubman to place Discovery Studios in his malls, according to the
business plan. Gillet also received a $6 million commitment from
Select Capital Advisors in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Everything was in place. All Gillet needed was a public company
shell into which he could merge his idea. The public company then
would sell stock to raise the millions needed to launch his venture
and reward Gillet's backers.
</P>
<P>
   Gillet found such a shell in Universal Licensing. But Gillet
said his lawyer was suspicious of the deal. So Gillet said he
ditched the lawyer and hired the law firm that represented
Universal Licensing.
</P>
<P>
   Atlas Pearlman was the firm. The problem, according to Gillet,
was the firm had a conflict of interest: Atlas Pearlman didn't tell
him that two of its partners also were shareholders in Universal
Licensing.
</P>
<P>
   Only after the deal was done did Gillet learn of the law firm
partners' involvement _ and that Universal Licensing was under
investigation by the National Association of Securities Dealers, he
says in his suit.
</P>
<P>
   Gillet filed suit last year in U.S. District Court in Fort
Lauderdale and amended his complaint this month.
</P>
<P>
   Gillet said an investigation revealed Universal Licensing wasn't
a public company after all. The deal was called off, but Gillet
says Universal Licensing didn't return the Discovery Studio name.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Gillet wants $50 million from Atlas Pearlman; Joel
Mayersohn, the Atlas Pearlman lawyer who worked on the deal; and
James Falacaro, an owner of Universal Licensing.
</P>
<P>
   In his amended complaint filed March 9, Gillet says Atlas
Pearlman ``owed a duty . . . to discuss their conflict of interest
and make full disclosure,'' as well as conduct due diligence on
Universal Licensing.
</P>
<P>
   Gillet says his damages include money lost by investors and on
start-up costs, as well as the revenue he expected from the
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hired Atlas Pearlman to do the deal. . . . I just didn't
know they had a vested interest as well,'' Gillet said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlas Pearlman's Kaplan doesn't deny that two of the firm's
partners had an interest in Universal Licensing. But he said the
firm had no duty to tell Gillet because Gillet wasn't a client.
Discovery Studio hired Atlas Pearlman after the deal was done to
handle reporting requirements for the public company, Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gillet said he hired Atlas Pearlman before the deal was
closed and has a cancelled check to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan insists that ``at no time did Atlas Pearlman represent
both sides of the transaction. . . . I don't know that Discovery
Studio had counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan also maintains that Universal Licensing was a publicly
traded company and had assets _ which Gillet disputes.
</P>
<P>
   At least one investor, Cornacchia, seems resigned to his loss.
``When you invest in start-ups, you hope you get a fair shake, but
90 percent of them fail,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gillet says he's determined to make Atlas Pearlman pay for a
debacle that nearly ruined his life.
</P>
<P>
   Gillet said he not only lost $500,000 of his own money, as well
as a home in New York, but his misfortune might cost him his
marriage as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I have had well-off family in Palm Beach, I've had
to struggle and work my way up like everyone else,'' Gillet said.
``I'm a regular guy just trying to make it.

IN THE LYCOS DEAL, OLD RULES DO NOT APPLY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not every deal maker could finagle a merger agreement that
forbids his proposed partner from negotiating with other interested
parties. If his betrothed does get an unsolicited offer, requires
it to sell him nearly 20 percent of the company. But those are the
terms that Diller, chief executive of USA Networks, has extracted
from Lycos Inc., the Internet portal company.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have reacted negatively to the proposed union, which
would give Lycos shareholders 30 percent of a new company combining
the portal business with USA's home-shopping and other
electronic-retail businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Upset over the stock's decline _ now down more than 25 percent
since the deal was announced last month _ Lycos' largest
shareholder, David Wetherell, quit his post on the board of
directors in protest and has said he is seeking alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   This complex transaction may say less about Diller, though, than
about the world of deal-making when a traditional media company
crosses paths with an Internet company. The old rules and
assumptions do not seem to apply; deals may be struck in days, not
months; the value of combinations can be so hard to understand that
stock prices swing erratically, and cash-poor Internet companies
may be willing to sacrifice standard protections.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to happen again and again,'' said Paul Noglows,
an analyst at Hambrecht &AMP; Quist. ``You are seeing the collision of
two very different worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   Merger agreements typically include a provision barring the
seller from seeking another suitor. But the seller usually can
consider an unsolicited offer that is better than the one on the
table. The Lycos agreement is quite restrictive, merger lawyers
say, making it nearly impossible for Lycos executives to negotiate
if a more favorable suitor comes along.
</P>
<P>
   Why would management agree to such terms?
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Davis, chief executive of Lycos, would not comment on
the agreement, saying he was prohibited from doing so because of
the pending deal. Representatives of Wasserstein, Perella, the
investment adviser to Lycos, and Testa, Hurwitz &AMP; Thiebeault, its
law firm, also refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   But one answer might be found in Lycos' desperation to find a
partner. The company was shopped to as many as 30 potential
partners _ including Time Warner, CBS and Walt Disney _ over 15
months. Only General Electric's NBC network considered buying a
stake, people close to Lycos said.
</P>
<P>
   Talks with NBC faltered in early January. Then Lycos reached out
to USA Networks, beginning eight days of intense negotiations with
Diller. Several other Internet portals had announced deals that
month, putting more pressure on Lycos, analysts said. If the
company did not move quickly, opportunities might be lost.
</P>
<P>
   Davis spent the first weekend of February _ while his team was
negotiating with Diller _ talking with executives he had previously
approached to make sure they hadn't changed their minds, a person
close to Lycos said. With no other interested parties, limiting its
ability to talk with others later ``didn't seem that important,''
this person said. Besides, negotiators for USA Networks pressed the
point, the person said.
</P>
<P>
   Diller echoed some of that sentiment Thursday. ``I think they
felt after all those conversations Nippon Steel wouldn't come in
and make an offer,'' he said. ``It was not one of the points I got
involved in.''
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations were not the first time Davis and Diller had
faced off. A year and a half ago, Lycos was interested in USA
Networks' Internet assets and talked with Diller about an alliance.
As part of that deal, Davis discussed offering Diller a seat on the
board, said Wetherell, the disgruntled former Lycos board member
and the chairman and chief executive of CMGI Inc., which invests in
Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   To further complicate negotiations, the New York law firm of
Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &AMP; Katz advised Lycos in its failed
discussions with NBC. But when USA Networks entered the picture,
the firm officially switched camps. Testa, Hurwitz was hired to
represent Lycos, but several people involved in the talks said
Wachtell continued to counsel Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   It is not illegal to advise both companies in a deal _ Wachtell
has done it before _ but some industry experts say it is
ill-advised if a deal goes awry. Lawyers from Wachtell did not
return repeated phone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   While USA Networks worked to keep other bidders out of the
picture, Lycos executives were concerned about another standard
part of the merger contract. A person close to Lycos said the
company was wary of agreeing to an astronomical breakup fee, which
compensates an intended partner if the deal falls apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cash is in short supply in the Internet world,'' said Samuel
Hayes, a professor of finance at Harvard University's business
school. ``Over-priced stock is the currency of choice.''
</P>
<P>
   So the two companies agreed that USA Networks would get the
option to buy a 17.5 percent stake in Lycos for $127.14 a share if
an unsolicited offer emerged or if the Lycos board decided to bow
out, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings and
people close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 8 _ the night before the deal was announced _ Lycos
stock closed at $127.25. In the next two days, the stock price sank
31 percent, to $87.25 a share. The confusion over the stock's value
can be chalked up to the different ways investors assess Internet
and media companies. ``I've yet to hear anyone say the assembling
of assets for these two companies doesn't make sense,'' Diller
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Wetherell admits he might not be making such a fuss if the
stock price had not collapsed. Of course, Diller's option is
worthless at the current stock price of $92.625. (If the majority
of shareholders vote against the deal in July as Wetherell expects,
Diller loses his option entirely.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people got so preconditioned to the thought there was
going to be a huge premium paid, they forgot to look at the
facts,'' said Noglows of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist. In a Feb. 11 report, he
noted that Lycos stock had risen 127 percent since the start of the
year and more than 14 percent since Yahoo's Jan. 28 announcement
that it was buying Geocities. ``I don't think anyone was prepared
for investors' reactions to what was a complicated transaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving the board, Wetherell has said he has talked to
others about forming a group of strategic investors to buy the
company and has even considered waging a proxy battle. He also said
he would support spinning off several Lycos divisions to increase
shareholder value.
</P>
<P>
   For now, investors can only sit back and watch the gamesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes a game of chess for Diller,'' said Noglows. ``He
has to determine does he have a clear majority or does he have to
come back with a sweeter bid?''

SEEKING TO BE TOKYO'S GOVERNOR, POLITICIAN ATTACKS U.S. PRESENCE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Until now, the calls for Yankees to go home have usually
focused on the American military bases in Okinawa, in southern
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, the leading candidate for governor of Tokyo
is chiming in as well. The candidate, Shintaro Ishihara, who has
made a career in recent years of urging Japan to stand up to the
United States, is demanding that the American military forces give
up Yokota Air Base in Tokyo or at least share it with civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The base is crucial to the U.S. forces and a centerpiece of the
Japan-American military partnership. But Ishihara also voiced
doubts about the security relationship and said that if elected he
would press American officials on when precisely they would come to
the aid of Japan in any territorial dispute with China.
</P>
<P>
   A governor does not have the power to expel Americans from a
military base. But Ishihara can put issues before the public and
make life difficult for American troops and for central government
officials alike.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that Japanese government officials were left
scrambling to denounce Ishihara for his comments. Hiromu Nonaka,
the chief Cabinet secretary and the most powerful person in the
cabinet of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, angrily protested that
Ishihara had no right to raise the issue in a local race, and other
officials have also tried to reassure Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Sadaaki Numata, the chief Foreign Ministry spokesman, said
``Americans should not lose their sleep or fear that a view on one
end of the political spectrum would prevail, because that is not
likely to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ishihara, who achieved notoriety in the United States after
writing a book in the 1980s called ``The Japan That Can Say No,''
urging a more assertive policy toward America, is far ahead among
eight major candidates in all the opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   The race for the April 11 gubernatorial election has turned into
a catastrophe for Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party, whose
candidate, Yasushi Akashi, formerly a U.N. under secretary-general
and envoy to the Balkans, ranks fifth in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The poor showing underscores a growing problem for the Liberal
Democrats: They rule Japan only by virtue of their domination in
rural areas, which are hugely overrepresented in Japan's political
system.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the Liberal Democrats were stunned when their
candidate lost the Tokyo election for governor to a television
personality and comedian, Yukio Aoshima, who now is not running for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Democrats got into trouble in this race partly
because they had trouble settling on a candidate. They hoped to
back a leader of the rival Democratic Party, Kunio Hatoyama, but he
forced them to find their own candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Liberal Democrats seemed to tap a former foreign
minister, Koji Kakizawa, but at the last minute ordered him not to
run and chose Akashi instead. Kakizawa angrily announced he would
run on his own, and Ishihara _ a renegade from the Liberal
Democrats _ signed up as well.
</P>
<P>
   If Ishihara wins, the Liberal Democrats will have to decide
whether to expel him for breaching party discipline, though he is
one of their few popular politicians in Tokyo. ``Many hard-liners
are strongly insisting that the LDP should kick Ishihara out of the
party,'' said Takao Toshikawa, a political analyst in Tokyo. ``But
if the LDP does that, it is condemning itself.''

NOW TARGETED, MONTENEGRINS ARE CRITICAL OF US

<P>
   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia _ Three explosions rocked this city just
after nightfall Thursday as a second and more severe wave of NATO
attacks on Yugoslav military positions got under way.
</P>
<P>
   In the last light of day, the streets emptied and grew quiet,
except for the pounding of boots on pavement as fatigue-clad troops
fanned out across this city, the capital of the Yugoslav Republic
of Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the bombing started, Violeta Vlasic, 31, rushed to
buy supplies at a grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very afraid,'' she said, clutching her 2-year-old
daughter Dara in one arm and a bundle of groceries in the other.
``Now we are going to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   Vlasic lives in a neighborhood adjacent to a military base on
the outskirts of this city, and she feared that the area was a
likely target. So she and her family moved in with cousins who live
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does America feel good about this, making mothers with their
children run for cover?'' she asked as she hurried on her errand.
</P>
<P>
   The display of NATO's firepower has unleashed a pervasive fear
on the streets of this city of 120,000, even though government
radio was reporting a relatively limited civilian death toll of 10
across Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Air raid sirens wailed intermittently Thursday night as dozens
of cruise missiles launched from the US Navy's 6th Fleet off the
coast arced through the sky and fighter jets and stealth bombers
silently cruised high overhead, seeking their targets.
</P>
<P>
   With the light of day Thursday, Montenegrins got their first
look at the damage caused by the initial night of NATO bombing, and
along with it came a rising anger and resentment toward the United
States and NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the sunshine of his garden barely half a mile from an
army radar station that was bombed in Zagrade, just north of the
port of Bar, Tony Mijo, 63, described what he had seen the night
before. He was watching television at about 8:30 p.m. when the
first cruise missile slammed into a radar station perched on a
rocky bluff overlooking the Adriatic Sea, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He stepped out on his porch after hearing the explosion and saw
a second missile score a direct hit on a cluster of military
buildings, as an orange plume of fire shot through the clear night
sky. The blast shook the frame of his house, cracking the plaster
walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``You bloody Americans still think you're fighting Indians. You
are cowards with your big smart bombs,'' said Mijo in the raw
English he learned in the coal mines of Australia, where he worked
for nearly 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You sit there with your bloody warships and you call us an
aggressor while you bomb our own land. This is your bloody
justice?'' he asked, shaking with anger.
</P>
<P>
   His torrent of hatred against the United States suggested the
emergence of a new sentiment in Montenegro. The population of
600,000 has long seen itself as separate from the 8 million Serbs
under Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The republic was moving toward democracy. Its parliament was
talking of independence from Milosevic's repressive, autocratic
regime and what many Montenegrins feel is Milosevic's
unconstitutional federal government in the Serbian capital of
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to play nice with America. We smiled and talked about
democracy. We bloody crawled for America,'' said Mijo. ``Then you
bombed us. All American promises are lies. Milosevic knows that. He
will lose this war, but at least he is standing up.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that US and NATO forces did not spare Montenegro
infuriates the people here, and may end up playing to Milosevic's
nationalistic aspirations if it helps him unify what remains of
Yugoslavia in its resentment toward the United States. The republic
was hard hit, its airports, radar stations, and military compounds
battered.
</P>
<P>
   Milka Tadic, managing editor of Montenegro's respected and
independent news magazine ``Monitor,'' said, ``After these
bombings, the feelings are different. We didn't expect America to
strike us. And it puts the (Montenegrin) government in a very
strange situation. The country it thought was an ally is now
bombing it.''
</P>
<P>
   An interview with Tadic was interrupted by the first two
explosions in the capital as the second night of bombing began. She
ran to a hotel balcony and looked out across the lights of the city
as a plume of smoke rose over a distant cluster of buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at that. This ends up helping Milosevic. It helps him
unify the country, in the sense of us having the same enemy. But I
have to hope that it will not last, and that Montenegrins will know
that Milosevic is the devil.''
</P>
<P>
   Olivera Nikolic of Montenegro's independent broadcast station,
Radio Antenna M, said the Montenegrin Parliament was in its second
day of marathon meetings over whether the republic would secede
from the federation under Milosevic. The possibility, she said,
leaves the disintegrating Yugoslavia again on ``the brink of civil
war''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's anger against America, but mostly there is confusion.
How it will sort itself out is the key. It could be a move toward
independence, it could trigger civil war, or it could be that
Milosevic gets greater unity. But that will take a while. For now,
we are just in shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before the bombing began anew Thursday &UR;  &LR; night, a young
couple was hurrying home.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can America do this? What do you think this
accomplishes?'' asked Lyca Beshica, 24, with his wife Paula, 21, as
they walked quickly down the street. ``We need an independent state
here, and we thought America would help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyca, who faces a call-up for the draft in the Yugoslav Army,
said the only way he would take up arms is to fight for an
independent Montenegro. But he succinctly described the conundrum
the Montenegrins face.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need America,'' he said. ``But now we don't trust them.''

   UNITED NATIONS _ Russia introduced a Security Council resolution
Thursday demanding an immediate end to NATO's airstrikes against
Yugoslavia, denouncing them as a ``threat to international peace''
and a ``flagrant violation'' of both the U.N. Charter and Yugoslav
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, which faces almost certain defeat when the
Council considers it Friday, was introduced by Sergey Lavrov,
Russia's representative to the United Nations. A spokesman for
Lavrov said the measure was intended to underline Russia's view
that military action is illegal and destabilizing.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Burleigh, the U.S. representative, along with other
Western delegates, vowed to oppose the measure vigorously and
predicted that it would fail to obtain the 9 votes needed for
approval on the 15-member Council, thus making it unnecessary for
the United States, Britain and France to exercise their veto power.
Only the Council's five permanent members _ the United States,
Britain, France, Russia and China _ can veto Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's representative, said the
Council's debate showed that a majority of member countries
supported the NATO action. , which was undertaken reluctantly and
only after months of talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic failed to produce an agreement that would protect the
people of Kosovo. Milosevic would have found ``little comfort'' in
the Council's two-hour-long debate Wednesday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Thursday that he saw no
political role for him at this stage of the crisis. ``The Contact
Group is in the lead and at this stage I have no plans of getting
immediately involved,'' Annan told reporters, referring to the
negotiating group on Kosovo that includes the United States,
Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Because the council has been so divided on the use of force over
Kosovo and Iraq, the United States turned to NATO rather than the
Security Council to respond to the Yugoslav crisis.

CONTROL OF DETROIT SCHOOLS IS TRANSFERRED TO MAYOR AND GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Michigan's House and Senate voted Thursday to transfer
control of Detroit's schools from the city's elected school board
to the city's mayor and the state's governor, the latest in a
series of efforts by state legislatures to improve test scores by
taking authority away from school boards.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John Engler said he would sign the legislation on Friday.
It calls for Mayor Dennis Archer to appoint six members to a new,
seven-member board; the state superintendent of education, Arthur
Ellis, an Engler appointee, will be the seventh member.
</P>
<P>
   The bill immediately eliminates all of the current board's legal
and budgetary authority. The current board's 11 members will serve
out their staggered terms, but they will only have an advisory
role. City residents will vote in five years on whether to replace
the new, appointed board with another elected board.
</P>
<P>
   The votes Thursday by the two Republican-controlled chambers
represented a political victory for the Republican governor, who
has emphasized education issues during his eight years in office
and in his increasingly frequent appearances at national Republican
events. But until Republicans took control of the Michigan House
last November, he was unable to intervene in the state's largest
city, where half the children do not graduate from high school and
half those who graduate have trouble meeting state standards for
high school graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Early versions of Thursday's bill called for Archer, a moderate
Democrat, to name all seven members of the new board. But the
mayor's political opponents, mainly Democrats from the populist
wing of the local party, strenuously fought giving him any more
power and ended up calling for the governor to play a role on the
new board, even though this meant turning to a Republican outside
the city.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents said that removing an elected board was undemocratic
denial of voting rights in a mostly black city by the all-white
Republican majorities in the Michigan House and Senate. Still,
polls showed considerable public support for the takeover, which
was backed by the city's two most powerful political forces,
municipal unions and the largely black Council of Baptist pastors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The presence of Ellis on the new board will effectively give the
governor veto power in the selection of the city's next school
superintendent, or chief executive officer, as Thursday's
legislation renames the position. The legislation requires that the
new board be unanimous in choosing the next chief executive
officer.
</P>
<P>
   State legislatures have removed school boards in Chicago,
Cleveland and five school districts in New Jersey, including
Newark. Similar plans have been proposed for Oakland, Calif., St.
Louis, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl L. Redmond, the Baptist pastor who is the current board
president, declined to comment on Thursday's vote. But Ben
Washburn, a school board member, questioned whether an appointed
board could be more effective than an elected board in addressing
issues like mustering community support for tighter discipline in
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might get a little more technical expertise, but what have
you given up?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans had repeatedly attributed the poor performance of
Detroit students to the school board's financial management
problems. Redmond had responded that urban poverty and crime were
mainly responsible for the schools' troubles, and that the board
was changing its ways.

POSSIBLE BREAKTHROUGH IN CASE OF MADALYN MURRAY O'HAIR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (mk) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In what may be a breakthrough in the disappearance of
atheist leader Madalyn Murray O'Hair, an Austin lawyer representing
a former office manager for the missing woman said federal
officials told him that his client is suspected of being part of a
plot to rob and murder Ms. O'Hair.
</P>
<P>
   David Waters, 52, appeared before a federal magistrate in Austin
Thursday on weapons charges following an eight-hour search
Wednesday of his car and apartment, which uncovered a cache of 119
rounds of ammunition. It is illegal for Waters, a convicted felon,
to have the ammunition in his possession.
</P>
<P>
   Following the appearance, Patrick Ganne, the lawyer representing
Waters, said that federal officials suspect his client of
complicity in Ms. O'Hair's mysterious disappearance four years ago,
as well as in the disappearance at the same time of her son, Jon
Garth Murray; her granddaughter, Robin Murray O'Hair, and $500,000
in gold coins that belonged to the O'Hair family.
</P>
<P>
   Ganne told reporters that assistant U.S. attorney Gerald Caruth
had told him that on Wednesday the authorities had also questioned
others with knowledge of Ms. O'Hair's disappearance, and that they
were pointing the finger at Waters. ``He told me, `People are
rolling over on your client and he better get right with God,'''
Ganne said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the U.S. attorney declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge ordered Waters held without bond Thursday on the
weapons charges, but no mention was made of the O'Hair case.
</P>
<P>
   An affidavit that supported the warrant used to search Waters'
home _ and which presumably explains the reason for the search _
remained under court seal Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Waters' name had arisen early in the speculation over what might
have happened to Ms. O'Hair. Before going to work for Ms. O'Hair,
Waters had served several years in an Illinois penitentiary on a
murder charge, and in 1994 he pleaded guilty to theft following the
disappearance of $54,000 from American Atheists Inc., the
Austin-based group Ms. O'Hair founded.
</P>
<P>
   Agents from the FBI, the IRS, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, and the Dallas County sheriff's office spent eight hours
searching Waters' home on Wednesday before discovering the cache of
ammunition. ``Mr. Waters was present during the search,'' said
Darren Holmes, an FBI spokesman. ``He was very cooperative.''
</P>
<P>
   After the ammunition was found, Waters was handcuffed, led from
the house through a cluster of reporters and charged with the
weapons violations.
</P>
<P>
   Waters has repeatedly said that he had nothing to do with the
disappearance of Ms. O'Hair or the others. His lawyer said Thursday
that the ammunition found in Waters' apartment belongs to a former
girlfriend, who recently moved out.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. O'Hair first came to national attention when she filed suit
in 1960 to have prayer removed from the public schools in
Baltimore. Three years later she was one of the parties in a suit
that reached the U.S. Supreme Court and led to a federal ban on
school prayer.
</P>
<P>
   In subsequent years, she became a prominent proponent for the
widest possible separation of church and state and a frequent
target of religious fundamentalists. She once proudly described
herself as ``the most hated woman in America.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time she disappeared, however, Ms. O'Hair had dropped
from the national spotlight and was ill and bitter over her
frustrated attempts for greater political prominence.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about what might have happened to Ms. O'Hair and the
others has varied widely, from those who believe they were robbed
and murdered to those who believe they fled the country with money
purloined from the organization's coffers. Ms. O'Hair has not been
seen in public since she left Austin in September 1995 with her son
and granddaughter. She apparently spent a month in San Antonio
before all of them fell from sight completely.
</P>
<P>
   Little new had been heard about the case in recent years until
the auction earlier this year of the missing family's household
effects, to pay a portion of their back taxes. Around the same
time, the San Antonio Express-News reported that, at the urging of
the newspaper, the authorities had genetically tested the remains
of an unidentified body found in Dallas in October 1995 and
discovered that it was that of Danny Fry, a former convict and a
friend of Waters.
</P>
<P>
   One of the theories being explored by the authorities was that
Fry had been involved in the disappearances and was killed in a
falling out with others involved.
</P>
<P>
   Waters has told reporters that he knows nothing about what
happened to Fry.
</P>
<P>
   Ganne asked Thursday how the authorities could believe his
client was involved in a plot to steal hundreds of thousands of
dollars from the O'Hair family, and kill them to cover it up, when
he is clearly strapped for cash. If Waters did it, Ganne asked, why
didn't he flee Austin with the money? Where is the money?
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone's got a bunch of money out of this,'' Ganne told The
Associated Press. ``It's not Waters. He's about to be evicted from
his apartment.''

POLITICAL STRATEGY SHIFTS AS BOMBING CAMPAIGN CONTINUES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When airstrikes were only a threat, US officials
talked endlessly of reaching a peace agreement with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic. But just two days into the bombings,
the stated goal has shifted, and the term ``peace treaty'' seems to
have all but disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the mission is being increasingly described in strictly
military terms as a campaign to get Milosevic to stop repressing
his people. What would have originally prevented the bombing _ his
signing a treaty in Rambouillet, France _ is now not enough to end
it unless he decisively stops his campaign in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could go through this whole campaign and still see him not
sign that peace agreement,'' said Representative Tom Allen, a Maine
Democrat on the House National Security Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is not to drive him back to the negotiating table,''
said Senator John F. Kerry. ``If you get that, great, that's a
bonus. But there's no guarantee of that. What I do believe we can
achieve _ and what I do believe is rational _ is diminishing his
military capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   One US defense official indicated that the rhetorical shift is
taking place mostly at the top of the political pyramid, where
officials have only recently realized that ``if you set objectives
you can't achieve with military means, you set yourself up for
almost certain failure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From the military perspective, the objective has always been
to degrade Milosevic's ability to use military force,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Other objectives,
in terms of what Milosevic does, are policy objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Milosevic has shown no signs of wanting either to sign a
peace treaty or withdraw his troops despite two days of intense
bombing. Thursday &UR;  &LR; night's raids continued to hit the Yugoslav
military's sophisticated air defense system as well as other
military infrastructure targets, defense officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In an attack similar to the one Wednesday night, two B-2
bombers, F-117 Stealth fighters, and F-16 jets swooped in on
targets across Yugoslavia. Cruise missiles again rained onto the
mountains. The chief difference from the first night of the
mission, defense officials said, was that no B-52 bombers _ six of
which helped launch the first round of missiles the night before _
were used.
</P>
<P>
   Although they refused to release details of specific hits,
officials said the strikes had so far been ``successful,'' hitting
components of the air defense system as well as some groupd troops.
</P>
<P>
   But officials conceded that most of the Yugoslavian military's
surface-to-air missile capacity _ one of its best assets _ remained
an unknown quantity. As of early Thursday &UR;  &LR; night, not a single SAM
missile had been spotted by NATO pilots, which meant that either
the missiles had been destroyed in the attacks or were being held
in reserve by the Yugoslavs. Several officials said they believed
the latter was the likelier case.
</P>
<P>
   Another growing concern was reports of increasing attacks on
Albanians by Yugoslav ground troops, which would serve a dual
purpose for the Serbs: eliminating their ethnic enemy and luring
NATO planes closer to the ground, making them an easier target.
</P>
<P>
   It was the military goal, as opposed to the political one, that
took center stage throughout the day, as numerous officials,
including President Clinton, avoided focusing on an eventual peace
treaty and instead urged Milosevic to stand down his forces in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Their messages were in near unison. NATO Secretary General
Javier Solana said his forces ``are determined to continue until we
have achieved our objective, to hold the violence and to stop a
further humanitarian catastrophe.'' US Defense Secretary William
Cohen said the strikes would stop only when Milosevic chose ``the
path of peace.'' And British Prime Minister Tony Blair said the
Yugoslav president had only to ``stop the repression of the people
of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO should take no other course than that, said defense
specialist John Pike of the Federation of American Scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be kind of silly for us to agree in advance that all
he has to do is sign a piece of paper and we'll stop,'' Pike said.
This change in NATO rhetoric, Pike said, ``means it's not simply a
question of, if he puts his initials on a piece of paper, that will
put an end to it.''

MORE PROTESTS OVER THE NEW YORK POLICE AS GRAND JURY FINISHES ITS
WORK
</HEADLINE>
   (wg) 
 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the Bronx grand jury considering last month's
police shooting of Amadou Diallo finished its work Thursday, 219
people calling for justice in the case were arrested for disorderly
conduct in front of police headquarters, and a high-profile group
of black and Hispanic leaders scheduled a meeting to plot strategy
for upcoming meetings with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer involved in the case said Thursday night that the four
white police officers who killed the West African immigrant in a
hail of 41 bullets had been indicted on charges of second-degree
murder. But the Bronx district attorney's office would not confirm
that the men had been indicted, and lawyers for the four officers
said they had not been informed of any imminent charges against
their clients.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, who has led near-daily demonstrations
since the Feb. 4 shooting, said protests at 1 Police Plaza would
continue until indictments are unsealed, with the Rev. Jesse
Jackson scheduled to be among those arrested on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan to be with a coalition of conscience that has come to
protest not only the slaying of Diallo, but in fact a mood of
permissive violence toward people of color,'' Jackson said in an
interview Thursday night. ``The atmosphere is toxic. We are in a
very explosive moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before reports of impending indictments filtered out, two
months of activism over the shooting seemed to reach a crescendo on
Thursday, with the largest crowd yet turning Police Plaza into
political theater at lunchtime.
</P>
<P>
   Among the marquee names on the roster of those arrested were the
actress Susan Sarandon and the Rev. Floyd Flake, a former
congressman who has been among Giuliani's strongest black
supporters. And for the first time, off-duty police officers staged
a counter-demonstration to protest what they said was increasing
anti-police sentiment in the city, though they were largely
overshadowed by the boisterous crowd of more than 500 chanting,
among other things, ``Arrest the killer cops.''
</P>
<P>
   As diverse crowds of students, religious leaders and workers on
their lunch breaks began to fill Police Plaza starting at 11 a.m.,
the protesting officers somberly read the names of 100 colleagues
slain in the line of duty since 1977, marking each with the ring of
a small bell. Later, they were mostly quiet as they watched the
theatrics, but when Sharpton passed, they hissed, ``Shame on you.''
</P>
<P>
   James Higgins, a board member of the Patrolmen's Benevolent
Association, organized the vigil. ``While the Diallo death was
certainly a tragedy, there is no excuse for turning it into a
full-scale attack on police officers,'' he said. ``If you're not
engaging in cop-bashing, why are you here?''
</P>
<P>
   The officers said the daily demonstrations had made their jobs
harder. ``As you ride through the streets, you can actually see
people look at you funny,'' said Officer Damian Gilsanen, 29, who
works in Staten Island. ``You know they're wondering, `Are these
guys going to shoot me 41 times?'''
</P>
<P>
   Officer Stephen Burgarella, 33, a 13-year veteran, complained
that the public was ``labeling the whole department for a few
mistakes a couple of officers made.'' Officer James Osborne, 35,
who has also spent 13 years on the force, said, ``There's a lot of
questions people ask you that you don't have answers to.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton, ebullient in the success of his daily demonstrations,
invited the officers up to his Harlem headquarters to conduct civil
disobedience. ``I'll even serve them coffee and cake,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton led four separate groups on Thursday down the aisle
created by blue police sawhorses to the doors of Police
Headquarters, where they lined up quietly before being taken inside
to be handcuffed and sent to local precincts for processing.
</P>
<P>
   The first was a group of Hispanic, Asian and African-American
students, followed by Ms. Sarandon and other members of the Center
for Constitutional Rights, a New York civil liberties group. Flake
and his supporters came next, followed by a group of Episcopalians,
including a priest who had previously been arrested for civil
disobedience protesting apartheid outside the South African
embassy, and Chloe Breyer, the daughter of Justice Stephen G.
Breyer of U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Safety at the expense of civil liberties is unacceptable,''
said Ms. Sarandon, who wore a black turtleneck sweater and
double-breasted leather jacket as she walked to her arrest, singing
``We Shall Overcome'' quietly. ``I'm here to protest racial
profiling and a lot of other issues that have made it unsafe for
people of color in this city.''
</P>
<P>
   Flake said he had spoken to Giuliani two days ago about his plan
to get arrested, and said that he hoped to act as a liaison between
the mayor and Sharpton, who was standing at his side. ``It's not
just Diallo, it is the overall weight of what has happened in the
past,'' Flake said. ``We can't afford to have another case like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Diallo's mother, Katiadou, said in a telephone interview from
her home in Conakry, Guinea, that she plans to return to New York
next week, when indictments against the four officers are expected
to be unsealed, and expressed gratitude for the daily protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why this has touched so many people is because the way this
thing happened,'' she said. ``Never have we heard about such a
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the four officers involved in the shooting said
Thursday night that they had not been notified of any decision by
the grand jury, but said indictments would not come as a surprise.
All four decided this week not to testify before the grand jury, in
part because they said criminal charges seemed inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all along that there's no doubt in my mind that the
Bronx district attorney, being a political animal, is going to
indict the defendants,'' said Marvyn Kornberg, who represents
Officer Sean Carroll. ``And there's no doubt in my mind that when
the case finally goes to trial that my client will be exonerated.''
</P>
<P>
   As the criminal case moves to a new stage, the political shock
waves caused by the shooting continue, with some of the city's
black and Hispanic leaders discussing how to capitalize on the
sudden open-door policy the Giuliani administration has adopted in
the wake of the intense protests.
</P>
<P>
   According to organizers, the strategy session, scheduled for
Saturday, will include elected officials as well as dozens of
religious, civic and labor leaders. Among those expected to attend
are Sharpton, former Mayor David Dinkins, Rep. Charles Rangel, and
state Comptroller Carl McCall, all of whom have been arrested
during the series of protests at police headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The group plans to write a list of demands to be presented to
Giuliani, possibly including the establishment of a civilian
commission with subpoena powers to oversee the police department _
a concept the mayor has fought for years _ as well as a requirement
that police officers live in the city, and a greater commitment to
integrating the predominantly white police force, the organizers
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they will either recommend or demand that the mayor
meet with Sharpton, who is considered by some to be the catalyst
for the administration's recent interest in establishing stronger
ties to the city's black and Hispanic officials, but is also
Giuliani's most vociferous antagonist. The mayor has steadfastly
refused to meet with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will not choose black leadership or Latino leadership in
this town,'' Sharpton said of the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is scheduled to see McCall Saturday morning, ending the
mayor's four-year pattern of refusing to meet with the state's
highest elected black leader. That follows Giuliani's private
session Wednesday night with Manhattan Borough President Virginia
Fields, another black leader that the mayor had previously shunned.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's efforts to improve relations with black and Hispanic
political leaders have generated skepticism among some minority
leaders, who note that he had reached out before, in the wake of
the Abner Louima case; that effort was brief and turned rancorous.
</P>
<P>
   His latest approach has also sparked some disagreements among
minority leaders.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Giuliani extended an invitation to meet with a
contingent from the City Council Thursday afternoon to discuss the
Diallo shooting. But some Council members wanted to postpone the
meeting until after Saturday's ``action plan'' summit. The City
Council spokesman Michael Clendenin said he was still trying to
arrange a meeting for Friday, but might have to wait until next
week.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Saturday's gathering, to be held in midtown Manhattan,
was decided upon after Sharpton and others learned of Giuliani's
meeting with Ms. Fields. Sharpton suggested Thursday that people
wanted to make sure that black leaders who are being ``picked off''
by the mayor for the meetings all voice similar demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure that everybody understands that if they
meet with the mayor, we should all be saying the same thing,''
Sharpton said. He added: ``No one minds if they have a meeting, but
they should all be coming out saying the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Ms. Fields defended her decision to meet with
Giuliani. ``This was an important meeting on several levels,'' she
said, adding that ``elected officials have to make their own
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate interview, Dinkins said that ``any meeting with
the mayor is meaningless if it doesn't result in his commitment to
do the things that we have all been talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, meanwhile, said Thursday that he had agreed to these
meetings in part because he thinks there is a ``serious difference
here between perception and reality.''
</P>
<P>
   If people are interested in ``informing that perception with
reality,'' he said, then he would meet with them. ``If there isn't,
then there's no point in doing that because all you do is feed the
false perception even more.'' &QL;

JUDGE HALTS YELLOWSTONE ROYALTY AGREEMENT WITH BIOTECHNOLOGY
COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal judge has ordered a temporary halt to a
precedent-setting arrangement under which a biotechnology company
is paying Yellowstone National Park for the rights to search its
geysers and hot springs for commercially valuable microbes.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth in Washington, D.C., said
that such a commercial agreement was a ``dramatic change'' in
policy for the National Park Service and required an environmental
impact assessment.
</P>
<P>
   In a decision released on Wednesday, Lamberth ordered the
agreement suspended until the Park Service complied. The decision
is a blow to what the Park Service has hailed as a major new
approach ensuring that the parks and the public benefit from
commercially useful products derived from the natural resources of
the national parks.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, officials said, scientists who took samples of
plants or microbes were free to exploit valuable discoveries
without having to compensate the park.
</P>
<P>
   A microbe discovered in a hot spring in Yellowstone in 1966
yielded a heat-resistant enzyme that was crucial to a technique,
polymerase chain reaction, that enabled scientists to replicate
DNA. The technique is so important in molecular biology that its
inventor won a Nobel Prize and patents related to the enzyme
generate an estimated $100 million a year for the drug company
Hoffmann-LaRoche. Yellowstone received nothing because there was no
requirement for royalties.
</P>
<P>
   But with the recognition that genes of wild plants and animals
can be raw materials for the biotechnology industry, countries have
begun demanding compensation for what is called ``bioprospecting.''
Many environmentalists think that such payments, by putting a value
on wildlife, can provide an incentive for the preservation of
biological diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Park Service's first bioprospecting agreement, Diversa
Corp. of San Diego is paying Yellowstone $100,000 over five years
plus royalties ranging from 0.5 percent to 10 percent on any
commercially useful discovery. The money is to go to preservation
of the park's resources and for public education.
</P>
<P>
   Yellowstone has talked to as many as 18 other parties about such
agreements, and other national parks are exploring them as well.
But any new agreements are likely to be delayed by Lamberth's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement with Diversa was challenged in court by some small
environmental groups, which argued that the agreement should have
been open to public comment and an environmental impact statement
prepared. The groups also argued that the National Park Service did
not have the authority to enter into an agreement commercializing
the resources of the national parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't somebody doing a master's thesis,'' said Mike
Bader, executive director of the Alliance for the Wild Rockies, one
of the groups that filed the suit. ``This is big business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're talking about is a modern-day Gold Rush,'' Bader
added, saying that too much bioprospecting would threaten the
park's environment. But with the court decision, he said, ``The
scheme will now undergo the close scrutiny it deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth agreed that an environmental assessment was needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, the future of bioprospecting on federal lands in
the United States appears to be a work in progress,'' Lamberth
wrote, ``but the government as of yet has not engaged in any public
debate on the issue nor made any definitive policy statement
through regulations or less formal means.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge has not ruled on whether the Park Service has the
authority to enter such an agreement, but he rejected the
government's effort to have many of the claims dismissed. Others
filing the suit were the Edmonds Institute of Edmonds, Wash., and
the International Center for Technology Assessment in Washington,
D.C., both non-profit organizations dealing with biotechnology
ethics, and Phil Knight, a guide who lives near Yellowstone.
</P>
<P>
   David Barna, a Park Service spokesman, said the agency would not
appeal the decision and would begin the environmental assessment.
He said the process could take six months, or perhaps a lot longer,
depending on whether a complete environmental impact statement or
only a simpler assessment was needed.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Park Service did not think that environmental
assessments would be needed for the hundreds of research permits
granted for purely academic work.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Finley, the superintendent of Yellowstone, said in a
statement, ``Research permits have been issued to study Yellowstone
resources for decades, with no harm to the park and great benefit
to science.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley said that action limiting agreements like the one with
Diversa ``only deprives the park of money that would be used to
protect park resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Diversa declined to comment, saying it had not seen the
decision. The company, which was not named as a party in the suit,
specializes in searching in extreme climates for natural enzymes
that could be used in industrial processes.

LIBYA WILL TURN OVER SUSPECTS IN THE LOCKERBIE BOMBING, U.N. TOLD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi ambassador
to Washington, expressed confidence Thursday that Libya would honor
its pledge to turn over by April 6 the two suspects wanted in the
1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The details of the agreement are being worked out,'' Bandar
told reporters following a meeting with Secretary General Kofi
Annan and the five permanent representatives on the Security
Council. ``Everybody's on the same wavelength.''
</P>
<P>
   Bandar, who traveled to Libya seven times to persuade the Libyan
leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, to turn over the suspects for trial
before a Scottish court in the Netherlands, said the agreement he
helped negotiate would ``kill two birds with one stone'' _ justice
would be served when the two men accused of the bombing were
brought to trial before an independent court; and the deal would
help alleviate the suffering that economic sanctions have imposed
on the Libyan people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a win-win situation for everyone,'' the prince said.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, March 26:
</P>
<P>
   As NATO air raids on Yugoslavia moved into a second night, both
sides seemed to be settling in for a long campaign. President
Clinton and other NATO leaders say they are prepared to continue
the attacks until Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic accepts the
international peace plan for Kosovo. Milosevic says he will do no
such thing.
</P>
<P>
   But even if he continues to reject a diplomatic solution,
Milosevic's military ability to repress Kosovo's ethnic Albanian
majority is likely to be steadily eroded. NATO's commanding
general, Wesley Clark, pledged Thursday ``to systematically attack,
disrupt, degrade, devastate and ultimately . . . destroy'' Yugoslav
military forces unless Milosevic accepts and carries out the Kosovo
peace plan. Clark has the air power and the authority to make good
on that threat, and Yugoslavia should take it seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Dishearteningly, the Serbian public has initially rallied to
Milosevic, as have traditional allies like Russia. The Yugoslav
leader seems determined to carry out further repression in Kosovo
while he still has the military strength to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In America, most of Congress and the general public warily
support continued bombing, but strongly oppose more risky steps
like the introduction of NATO combat troops. That defines the right
policy for now. Conventional wisdom holds that air power alone
cannot bring Belgrade to the bargaining table. But it may well be
able to ease Yugoslav military pressure on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve that goal, NATO must move quickly to destroy
Yugoslavia's remaining anti-aircraft defenses and then move on to
Yugoslav tanks and troops in Kosovo. The risk of casualties among
NATO pilots will increase as cruise missiles and stealth fighters
and bombers are now joined by more vulnerable aircraft. Yugoslav
military casualties are certain to inrease as well.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic could avoid these dangers by yielding now. The
reasonable terms of the international peace plan are still
available to him. By proceeding and risking the destruction of his
armed forces, he could create a situation where Albanian guerrillas
feel emboldened to push for full independence, rather than the
autonomy that they are now willing to accept.
</P>
<P>
   But such a show of statesmanship would be out of character for
the Yugoslav dictator. NATO must plan instead for sustained air and
missile attacks.

STREET THEATER TROUPE IRKS SAN FRANCISCO CATHOLICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL STAGGS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, an
irreverent and largely gay street theater group whose members dress
like nuns and use elements of Roman Catholic ritual in their
performances, have angered Catholics here with plans for an Easter
street party to celebrate the troupe's 20th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   The bawdy group, which was started on Easter weekend in 1979 by
four gay men from Iowa, has long been a fixture here, taking part
in gay pride parades, holding parties and contributing to
charitable causes. The troupe includes 30 gay, lesbian, bisexual
and transgender people who call themselves nuns and use such names
as Sister Phyllis Stein and Sister Reyna Terror.
</P>
<P>
   As their celebrations have grown in popularity, drawing
thousands of onlookers, they have also come under growing scrutiny
from some Catholics, unhappy about such theatrics as the troupe's
``Condom Saviour Mass'' and ritual exorcisms.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, an editorial in the San Francisco Archdiocese's
official newspaper, Catholic San Francisco, criticized the city's
Board of Supervisors for allowing one block on Castro Street, the
heart of San Francisco's gay district, to be closed for the Easter
performance.
</P>
<P>
   The paper's editor and spokesman, Maurice Healy, called the
board's decision ``extraordinary insensitivity to people of all
faiths,'' and asked that the performance be scheduled on a day
other than Easter.
</P>
<P>
   One performer, who gave her name only as Sister Ann R. Key, said
Thursday that the attacks on the troupe and its street party were
mean-spirited and missed the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not mock nuns,'' she said. ``We are not drag queens. We
are nuns, and that is an important distinction. The work we do is
the same as Catholic sisters do. We educate, we minister to the
sick.''
</P>
<P>
   The players do volunteer work in hospices and help people with
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Urged on by the editorial, readers of the newspaper have been
contacting members of the Board of Supervisors to complain.
</P>
<P>
   In a board meeting Monday, Supervisors Alicia Becerril and Amos
Brown asked that the Easter celebration be delayed until April 11.
</P>
<P>
   But Board President Tom Ammiano said Tuesday that the decision
would stand because rescinding it would require a unanimous vote,
which he asserted was ``all but impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Asking for a change in the date of the celebration sidesteps
the real issue here, that of the separation of church and state,''
Ammiano said. ``The board's vote is not an endorsement of the
sisters. It's an endorsement of the process that allows the sisters
or any group to apply for a permit and be granted due process. The
fact that the actions of one group are not popular with another
group is no reason to deny anyone their rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano, who is gay, called the editorial ``over the top,'' and
added: ``The archdiocese has been on something of a jihad against
gays and lesbians anyway. The archdiocese has been against the
city's domestic partners legislation for years, as far back as
1988. I feel that this is all homophobic.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who is also the pastor of the Third Baptist Church here,
said Tuesday that he would not have voted for the permit if he had
known more about the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may have a right to do what they want to do,'' he said,
``but the celebration. while well-intentioned, has caused a lot of
friction in the Catholic community, particularly on this most
important day in Christendom.''
</P>
<P>
   Kandace Bender, the spokeswoman for Mayor Willie Brown, said he
was asking that all parties show mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
   William Donohue, president of the Catholic League for Religious
and Civil Rights, a lay organization based in New York, said it
would place an advertisement in The San Francisco Chronicle asking
Catholic groups not to do business with the city unless the street
party was moved to another date.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just a bunch of gay guys dressed up as nuns in
some sort of `Saturday Night Live,''' Donohue said of the
performers. ``Their attacks on holy communion and the eucharist
demonstrate that we're dealing with an invidious, vicious
anti-Catholic group that does some good things like throwing money
at charities. I don't give a damn about their fund-raising. They're
a bunch of bigots.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Ann R. Key said no offense to real nuns was intended and
defended the use of what she called twists on rituals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sometimes crazy stuff that we do, but there's meaning
behind it,'' she added. ``We integrate sacred elements of organized
religion in a lighthearted way.''

HOLLINS MAKES PUSH FOR THIRD-BASE JOB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARYVALE, Ariz. _ Manager Terry Collins, general manager Bill
Bavasi and the Angels coaches met late Wednesday night to discuss
the club's options as camp nears an end. There were many
disagreements, and quite possibly none more debated than the third
base job.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus, 22, has done everything possible to win the job.
He's hitting .439 (18 for 41) with two homers and a team-leading 17
RBI. But Dave Hollins, 32, is finally healthy, his sore left
hamstring apparently better and his surgically repaired right
shoulder no longer an issue.
</P>
<P>
   Hollins will make $2.4 million this season, but Collins said
salary won't play into the decision. What matters, Collins said, is
how Hollins plays now that he's healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday afternoon against the Milwaukee Brewers at Maryvale
Baseball Park, Hollins hit two home runs (one from each side of the
plate), walked, stole a base, hit a sacrifice fly, scored three
runs and drove in six in the Angels' 11-4 victory.
</P>
<P>
   On defense, Hollins made four plays without an error.
</P>
<P>
   ``It don't count; it starts at zero opening day,'' Hollins said,
before being reminded that it does count because he's competing for
a job. ``I'm happy right now. I was coming off shoulder surgery,
then I pull a hammy halfway through camp. My thing is I know what I
have to do to get ready. If I'm not healthy, I'm not going to help
you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know one thing _ he got everybody's attention today,''
Collins said. ``He's making a statement that he's not dead. There's
a lot of baseball left in Dave Hollins. We knew that going in.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a veteran. He came into camp thinking if he's healthy
he's the third baseman.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollins, who is hitting .321 (9 for 28) with two homers and
seven RBI, added that he doesn't concern himself with what Glaus is
doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only way I know how to play _ get ready and do my
job,'' he said. ``I can't do anything about the other guy, or
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Omar Olivares gave up three runs and eight hits
in five innings against the Brewers to get his second spring
victory. He came out after his shoulder stiffened up, but Collins
said it was nothing serious.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels optioned left-handed pitchers Jarrod Washburn and
Scott Schoeneweis to triple-A Edmondton on Thursday. Washburn, who
began camp in competition for the No. 5 spot in the starting
rotation, was 0-0 with a 7.82 ERA in six spring games.
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis, 11-8 at triple-A Vancouver last season, was 1-1
with a 4.26 ERA in five spring games.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Jason Dickson underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair a
torn labrum in his right shoulder Thursday. He will be out a
minimum of three to four months.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have lost two Freeway Series games against the
Dodgers, who will play the New York Yankees on April 3 and 4. The
Angels get a Mexican League team and Cal State Fullerton instead.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are trying to attract as many fans as possible
knowing that most in Southern California would rather see the
Dodgers and Yankees at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   So before Saturday's game against the Aguascalientes
Railroadmen, WBC welterweight boxing champion Oscar De La Hoya will
throw out the first pitch. In Sunday's game, actor Kevin Costner
will play for Fullerton against the Angels. Sunday's game is free
of charge.
</P>
<P>
   Costner, 44, is a 1978 graduate of Cal State Fullerton.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels return home to Tempe today to play the San Diego
Padres at 12:05. Chuck Finley will start for Anaheim against San
Diego's Matt Clement. Singer Garth Brooks, playing with the Padres
all spring, is expected to play today.

HOW BANKS PROFITED IN THE BRAZILIAN DEVALUATION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France, Portugal )   By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ While many Brazilians are fretting over the
effects of currency devaluation, Roberto Ruhman is celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   Ruhman, managing director of Banco Matrix, guided his bank to
spectacular profits because of Brazilian government's decision more
than two months ago to abandon a system that had kept the currency
artificially high in value.
</P>
<P>
   In January alone, Matrix almost quadrupled its earnings for all
of 1998, thanks to its prescience in betting that the currency, the
real, would fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seized the opportunity that existed for us to profit when
the shift in exchange-rate policy arrived,'' Ruhman said.
</P>
<P>
   Matrix, a well-known investment bank, is not alone. More than a
dozen banks, some of them U.S. institutions such as J.P Morgan and
Citibank, also had huge profits after the devaluation, according to
preliminary figures from Austin Asis, a bank analysis firm. Chase
Manhattan is at the top if the list, with earnings of about $150
million in January, more than double its net income in Brazil last
year.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when high interest rates and diminished foreign
investment are crimping the economy, the banks' financial results
have touched off a debate over the fairness of a system that has
allowed a handful of big and rich institutions to profit while the
population as a whole is suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a citizen I feel indignant,'' said Renato Janine Ribeiro, a
professor of political philosophy at the University of Sao Paulo.
``And as a critic of the political system, I see this as a
continuation of a trend in which the government is being
manipulated by a financial system without much responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The concentration of riches among the few is nothing new in
Brazil, a nation of 165 million known for its skewed distribution
of wealth. Although changes carried out by President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso have improved things somewhat, the richest 10
percent of the population make an estimated 44 times what the
poorest 10 percent do, in an economy where the per-capita income is
roughly $250 a month, according to government figures.
</P>
<P>
   While some banks have come under scrutiny by left-wing members
of Congress over accusations that they used inside information
before the devaluation, most banks profited legally, either by
purchasing government bonds linked to the value of the dollar
throughout last year or by purchasing currency-futures contracts
that helped insulate their exposure to the Brazilian currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any reasonable person knew there would be a change in currency
policy and prepared for it,'' said Paul Bydalek, president of
Atlantic Rating, a Brazilian bank rating company.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil, which has the most complex financial system in Latin
America, allows banks and other companies plenty of ways to profit
in times of crisis, and not many of them involve traditional
lending.
</P>
<P>
   During the times of hyperinflation, for instance, banks
prospered largely by investing in high-yield government bonds.
Today, most large banks maintain offices in tax havens like the
Cayman Islands, where they can keep dollar-denominated accounts out
of the sight of the central bank. Some of the country's larger
banks have subsidiaries in Argentina, the United States or other
countries, allowing them to spread their risk over several
currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Or, banks can buy and sell contracts on the Bolsa de Mercadorias
e Futuros, the world's sixth-largest futures exchange, with 86
million contracts negotiated last year.
</P>
<P>
   Not all banks amassed profits from the devaluation. Banco Fonte
Cindam, a Rio de Janeiro-based investment bank, was sold to Banque
Nationale de Paris earlier this month after it lost 25 million
reais, or about $13 million, betting that the real's value would
remain stable. Banco Boavista, which is part-owned by Credit
Agricole of France and Grupo Espirito Santo of Portugal, opted for
a large capital injection to cover losses in its investment funds.
Banco Marka, another Rio de Janeiro investment bank with an active
trading desk suffered losses in the aftermath of the devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, some of Brazil's industrialists are upset over what
they see as unequal treatment from the monetary authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``With interest rates where they are, it's clear the government
is still not that concerned about the productive sector,'' said
Fernando Bezerra, a senator from the state of Rio Grande do Norte
and president of the National Industry Confederation, in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Bezerra's complaint, although not new, has been given new life
after Brazil's agreement with the International Monetary Fund.
Under the accord, officials expect the gross domestic product to
shrink as much as 4 percent this year, weakened partly by an 8
percent drop in industrial production. Domestic interest rates of
more than 40 percent, combined with a scarcity of financing from
abroad, have deeply wounded Brazilian industry, which suffered a
2.3 percent drop in production last year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the complaints about banks that were enriched by
devaluation, there are advantages in having a healthy banking
industry. As officials from Cardoso's government have argued, the
economy is better off without the type of banking crisis that has
damaged developing economies like those of Russia, Indonesia and
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Since the start of the president's first term in 1994, the
central bank has acted to ease the takeover of ailing banks by
healthier ones. Foreign banking companies including HSBC Holdings,
Banco Santander and ABN Amro acquired Brazilian banks with
extensive retail operations, introducing new levels of competition.
The central bank has sometimes financed these takeovers with its
own funds.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there is the discussion spurred by this latest example of
Brazil's disparities. ``We Brazilians are trying to understand what
brings us wealth and what makes us poorer,'' said Nilton Bonder, a
rabbi and author of ``The Kabbalah of Money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We see an economy which is a sort of weakened system that
allows things that could be immoral but are not illegal,'' he said.
``It's as if an economy which should be a reality has been turned
into a game.''

SHORT ITEMS ON THE ART WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Solomon R. Guggenheim's SoHo branch, whose
closing in January was rumored to be permanent, will reopen _ 7,000
square feet smaller _ on May 12. Most of the ground floor occupied
by the museum at 575 Broadway, at the corner of Prince Street, will
soon become a Prada store, the Italian retailer's third in SoHo.
</P>
<P>
   The Guggenheim SoHo's opening show _ an exhibition of 60
paintings from Andy Warhol's late ``Last Supper'' series _ is about
as fashionable as art can get. The works come from the collections
of Heiner Friedrich and Peter Brant.
</P>
<P>
   Friedrich is a Manhattan dealer who was one of the founders of
the Dia Center for the Arts. Brant is a collector who has sold
major portions of his collection recently _ works by Robert
Rauschenberg, Jackson Pollock and Jasper Johns. He also happens to
be the Guggenheim SoHo's landlord. He owns 575 Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand that their intention is to make these works
available to the public, and we're comfortable with that,'' said
Judy Cox, a deputy director at the Guggenheim. ``We have been
assured the paintings are not for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedrich bought the Warhols from the Andy Warhol Foundation for
the Visual Arts, which is the sole beneficiary of the artist's
estate. He then sold some of them to Brant with an understanding
that the two men would give each other right of first refusal if
one wanted to sell any portion of the collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to find an institution that would take them
long-term and we wanted them to stay together,'' Brant said. ``If
the show is successful, they'll stay there.''
</P>
<P>
   Guggenheim officials say the Warhols are on long-term loan and
they have set no formal closing date for the show, saying only that
it will be sometime in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the monumental ``Last Supper'' paintings were included in
a show at the Dia Center for the Arts in Chelsea in the 1994-1995
season. The entire collection was later on view in Munich.
Friedrich also rented a Chelsea gallery space owned by Dia to show
some of the ``Last Supper'' paintings privately. ``This will be the
first time they will have been shown as a group in New York,''
Brant said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Last Supper'' series represents Warhol's reflections on
Leonardo da Vinci's ``Last Supper'' (1495-97), and the works are
based more on reproductions of the famous image than the image
itself. Working from photographs, drawings and plastic models, the
artist created variations on the scene, which depicts Jesus
surrounded by his disciples.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Dennison, a deputy director at the Guggenheim and its chief
curator, said the museum had been rethinking its SoHo museum and
wanted more of the exhibitions there to be long-term and drawn from
the museum's permanent collection. ``We're deeply committed to late
Warhols,'' Ms. Dennison said.
</P>
<P>
   Would the museum like Friedrich and Brant to donate the
paintings? ``Yes,'' Ms. Dennison said. ``That's our hope.''
</P>
<P>
   What will happen in the fall, when the Warhols are taken down?
``We'll probably do something else from the permanent collection,''
Ms. Dennison said. She suggested that after the exhibition, the
Warhol works ``will be tied to the identity of the museum.''
</P>
<P>
   By that time, the Guggenheim may well have firm plans for
another site in Manhattan, and it could include a special gallery
for the ``Last Supper'' series. The museum hopes to build a huge
new museum designed by Frank Gehry, the California architect
responsible for the Guggenheim in Bilbao, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   One site in which the Guggenheim is interested is Pier 40, a
15-acre site owned by New York state along the Hudson River off
Houston Street. The museum is also looking at other sites, one of
which is thought to be on three piers near the South Street
Seaport.
</P>
<P>
   The Economic Development Corp. of New York City called for
proposals for building on the piers; Bernadette O'Leary, a
spokeswoman for the agency, declined to say who responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been in discussions with the city about a variety of
sites along the waterfront,'' Ms. Cox said. ``We haven't ruled out
any potential sites. We're working with the city to determine what
would be the best possible location for a museum.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston Debut, in Japan  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the making for more than seven years, the Nagoya/Boston
Museum of Fine Arts is finally scheduled to open on April 17 in
Japan. It will be the first museum in Japan to provide an
encyclopedic view of art from all cultures and time periods.
</P>
<P>
   In much the same way that the Guggenheim persuaded officials in
the Basque region of Spain to pay for its Bilbao branch, the Museum
of Fine Arts has won financing from Nagoya's Foundation for the
Arts, its city government and the Aichi Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
   The project has faced delays compounded by economic shakiness in
Japan and political battles within the foundation. It was
originally supposed to have opened three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 20 years, $50 million will be given to the Boston
museum for operations, capital expenses, special projects and its
endowment. In exchange the Nagoya museum will receive a 20-year
commitment for loans from the Museum of Fine Arts collection.
(Boston received the first $5 million when a letter of intent was
signed in 1991, and used it to pay off bonds.)
</P>
<P>
   The new museum will present two shows a year from Boston as well
as one five-year loan exhibition. The opening exhibitions include
``Monet, Renoir and the Impressionist Landscape'' (April 17 through
Sept. 26) and ``Art of the Ancient Mediterranean World'' (April 17
through March 2004).
</P>
<P>
   The new museum has about 15,000 square feet of exhibition space
on three floors and will also have a shop, lecture room, library,
offices and storage. It will be operated by the foundation under
the direction of Tadao Ogura, who was previously the director of
the Kyoto National Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston museum has a long history of collaborations with
Japanese institutions. It has been collecting Japanese art since
the 1890s and has been sending shows to different parts of Japan
for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in St. Louis &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brent Benjamin, the deputy director for curatorial affairs at
the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston for the last five years, has been
named director of the St. Louis Art Museum. On May 1 he replaces
James Burke, who is retiring after 19 years in the director's post.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin takes over just as the museum is undergoing a
transformation. Over the next 10 years it plans a capital campaign
to make its structure in Forest Park earthquake-safe and add a new
building of gallery space.

<P>
   Within hours of secretly transmitting fluorescent green
``nightscope'' camera images of the first NATO air strikes on
Kosovo on Wednesday night, CNN correspondent Brent Sadler and his
three crew members heard their hotel room door being broken down at
3 a.m. In came a man brandishing a rifle and a flashlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was curtains,'' Sadler said Thursday by telephone
from Skopje, Macedonia, where he and about 50 other Western
journalists fled after the Serbian government ordered all members
of the press from NATO countries to leave.
</P>
<P>
   That intruder and another an hour later merely ripped out wires
and rummaged through files. But the next morning, as Sadler and his
crew began to load their armored car to leave, a gang of six or
seven armed men accosted them, slapping a CNN producer, Alessio
Vinci, across the face and poking a Kalashnikov rifle under
Sadler's nose. The assailants then began smashing the crew's
equipment and set it and the car on fire as crowds of Serbian
passersby cheered, and frightened fellow journalists watched from
the lobby.

<P>
   Sadler said police officers and Yugoslav army soldiers restored
order and escorted a caravan of about 15 armored cars carrying
Western journalists from Pristina to the Macedonian border.
</P>
<P>
   While the atmosphere in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo
province, was reportedly more tense than elsewhere in the country,
other journalists also faced harassment. In Belgrade, two
Americans, Mark Phillips of CBS News and Peter Finn of the
Washington Post, were taken from their rooms at the Hyatt Hotel in
the middle of the night, held at a police station for 11 hours,
then driven to the Croatian border and released.
</P>
<P>
   An expulsion order issued by Serbian Information Minister
Alexander Vucic said: ``Journalists of foreign public media from
the countries that took part or allowed their territories to be
used in NATO aggression on our country will be expelled.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were reports of conflicts within the Yugoslav
government about whether to enforce the order, with some officials
arguing that showing the impact of the air strikes would create
sympathy for the nation.
</P>
<P>
   While most journalists left Yugoslavia on Thursday, NBC News
said that its two correspondents, Jim Maceda and Ron Allen, and
their crews had decided to stay in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips of CBS News had no choice. By telephone from Zagreb on
Thursday, he said he had heard a knock on his door around 3:30 a.m.
and had peered through the peephole to see a hotel clerk, who said,
in English, ``Room service.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said `I didn't order room service,' and a gruff voice next
to the clerk said, `State security police _ open up,' '' Phillips
said. Told to pack, he asked where he was going and was told, ``No
questions; this is war.''
</P>
<P>
   In the hotel lobby, while the officers went upstairs to get
Finn, Phillips said he managed to get a message to his producer in
another room, before being taken to a local police station. There,
Phillips said, he and Finn were questioned separately.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked what I had written, whom I had spoken to, and they
asked who we were working with in terms of local people,
translators and such, which was very worrying,'' Phillips said. ``I
danced a very awkward line, saying I only knew the guy's first
name, he'd been hired by someone else in our group _ giving them
enough to keep them from getting angrier, but at the same time not
incriminating anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, the three ``inquisitors'' got ``angrier and
angrier,'' and one said to Phillips: ``Why is it that someone like
me who loves American rock music and wears jeans and Nikes feels so
furious at the U.S. for this barbarous and uncivilized act?''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, air raid sirens sounded, Phillips said, and he
thought, ``I'm toast.'' But after about 11 hours at the police
station, he said, they were put into a Serbian militia vehicle with
barred windows and driven to the border.
</P>
<P>
   Because Phillips' producer had gotten word to London about his
detainment, a CBS News employee was dispatched from Zagreb to the
border crossing, and met the three journalists there about 20
minutes after they were released, he said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Yugoslavia withstood a second wave of NATO air
assaults on Thursday, with the White House vowing prolonged and
severe attacks while Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was
reported to be defiantly stepping up his military campaign around
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's escalated today,'' said Sandy Berger, President Clinton's
National Security adviser, conceding that, despite the NATO
assault, Milosevic's military forces continued their sweep, burning
ethnic Albanian villages in Kosovo and even sending ``some
shelling'' into nearby Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very disturbing to us,'' Berger said at a White House
briefing. But he declined to speculate on the motives of the
Yugoslav leader, who has rejected NATO demands that he cease
hostilities against the ethnic Albanian separatists of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As fresh salvos of missiles and bombs struck targets in
Yugoslavia, the NATO supreme commander, Gen. Wesley Clark,
resolutely vowed that the duration and severity of the military
campaign was up to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to systematically and progressively attack,
disrupt, degrade, devastate and ultimately, unless Milosevic
complies with the demands of the international community, we're
going to destroy his forces,'' Clark said at NATO headquarters in
Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   On the second straight day of NATO bombardment, cruise missiles
and guided bombs rained down on targets that Pentagon officials
described as military and air depots and factories underpinning the
yearlong assault against Kosovo, the southernmost province in the
Serbia republic, which is Milosevic's power base as Yugoslav
leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be another substantive strike; it will be severe,''
said Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon as the bombing was renewed
from an armada that includes six warships and roughly 400 bombers
and fighters. He said the latest attacks were ``principally on air
defense targets and military targets'' that are being used in the
repression of the province's ethnic Albanian majority.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen expressed satisfaction with the
effectiveness of the NATO raids, but declined to discuss any
strategic timetable. ``The Serb forces should not take any comfort
that they could be free from any sort of assault or attack from our
forces at any time during the course of the day or night,'' he said
in an interview on public television. ``It could be done at any
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Western news workers were ordered to leave Yugoslavia Thursday,
and most did, limiting the news coverage from the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Although there were no detailed accounts of target destruction
in the latest bombing run, the Pentagon said that the list of
targets was broadened Thursday but that air and missile strikes
continued to focus on air-defense systems. Those systems were
significantly damaged but not destroyed on the first night, the
Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 targets were hit on Wednesday, Pentagon officials
said. But on Thursday the jets did not encounter the Yugoslav air
force. For the first time, the Yugoslavs fired a surface-to-air
missile, a Soviet-era SA-6, a dangerously mobile weapon. But it
missed. There was heavy anti-aircraft fire, but all the NATO
aircraft returned safely to their bases, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, some Air Force officials expressed an eagerness
to press plans to use A-10 and other attack jets designed to
destroy tanks and other armored vehicles. But the NATO plans call
for at least three nights of strikes to soften defenses, before
risking sending in more vulnerable low-flying jets like A-10s.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, the Milosevic government insisted it was the
innocent victim of NATO aggression. Deputy Prime Minister Vuk
Draskovic talked of possible compromise in news interviews, but no
such talk was heard from Milosevic, Belgrade's authoritarian ruler
who has rigidly rejected calls for a cease-fire. ``Stop bombing
us,'' Draskovic contended on Britain's Sky TV, ``and we will stop
all operations against the people, the terrorists who provoked NATO
strikes against Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   In Skopje, Macedonia, near Kosovo's southeast border, thousands
of Serb sympathizers marched on the American Embassy, throwing
rocks and torching cars in protest against the NATO raids and in
support of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He must either choose peace or we will limit his ability to
make war,'' President Clinton said of the Yugoslav leader in brief
White House comments amid a busy day of military briefings. Various
administration officials carefully stressed the goal was not to
knock Milosevic from power but to force him to observe Kosovo peace
promises he made, then broke, last year.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Russian threats to lift the arms embargo on
Yugoslavia, Clinton declared, ``I think that would be a terrible
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The administration's concern over Moscow's angry denunciation of
the NATO raids was emphasized by Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright at a briefing. One of the administration's main diplomatic
goals now that airstrikes are under way, she said, was
``maintaining contacts with Russia and making clear that our
differences over Kosovo need not disrupt progress on other
fronts.''
</P>
<P>
   Warning Milosevic against widening his military campaign to the
surrounding region, Albright said plans were being made for ``a
flood of new refugees.'' She said ``Milosevic's forces in Kosovo
are today continuing their offensive against civilians, burning and
looting and attacking political leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   With Republican critics questioning whether the administration
has a strategic alternative to bombing, Berger defended the NATO
air assault, insisting that Milosevic ``will sustain the most
serious damage if he thinks he can ride out an air attack.'' Even
more, he underlined Clinton's assertion that the operation will not
see the commitment of U.S. fighting forces on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is something we do not intend to do,'' Berger declared.
</P>
<P>
   Facing news reporters, the president's security chief was asked
whether the 19-member NATO assault has now established ``a
precedent for intervening in civil wars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every situation has to be taken on its own merits,'' Berger
replied, maintaining that Milosevic presents ``a rather weak
argument'' in invoking sovereignty after his record of hostilities
in Croatia, Bosnia and Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has said many times that it depends upon whether
America's national interests are involved, as well as our values,''
Berger continued. ``Our values are involved in preventing what I
believe would be a humanitarian catastrophe. Our interests are
involved in avoiding a wider conflict in southeastern Europe, which
I think would most likely involve us at some later point with far
greater costs and at far greater risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The president has argued that the 19-member NATO alliance has a
moral obligation to deal with the Kosovo onslaught, terming it
Wednesday a ``powder keg at the heart of Europe'' that will
endanger neighboring nations unless Kosovo is stopped in his
campaign of ethnic cleansing and atrocity against the Kosovar
majority. An estimated 2,000 people have been killed in the past
year, with hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians driven from
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Looking haggard and sounding weary, Clinton brushed aside signs
that the nation is divided over U.S. participation in the NATO
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that many Americans really have not thought a lot
about this until the last two days,'' he told reporters between
military briefings. ``I also believe very strongly that it is my
responsibility to make this judgment based on what I think is in
the long-term interests of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   A CNN/Gallup/USA Today survey released Wednesday showed that 46
percent of Americans support the nation's participation in the
bombings while 43 percent oppose it. A CBS News Poll released
Thursday showed that 50 percent favor the intervention and 30
percent oppose it, but it also showed that 52 percent said that
peace in Yugoslavia was not worth the price of American lives.
About one third said peace was worth that price.
</P>
<P>
   The White House indicated Clinton's appeal for public support in
the risky military assaults would be ongoing across the NATO
action, which thus far has not been described as subject to a
specific time limit. ``I don't believe last night's address to the
nation was the last thing the president needs to say,'' said White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he believed that a majority of the public would
support the case he laid out in his 13-minute address to the nation
Wednesday night. ``I did my very best to explain what we were doing
and why,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, Sens. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, and Joseph Lieberman,
D-Conn., unveiled legislation to authorize $25 million to train and
arm Kosovars in defense of the ethnic Albanians. Lieberman said he
hoped the airstrikes would produce peace in the Balkans. But if
they do not, he said, the arms proposal answers the question of
what might be an exit strategy from Kosovo. But McConnell conceded
that, in recently bringing up the proposal with the president and
other administration officials, the only reaction was ``stunned
silence.''
</P>
<P>
   At his security briefing, Berger rebuffed suggestions that NATO
was disunited in the raids. He said comments by Italian Prime
Minister Massimo D'Alema about the urgent need for diplomacy seemed
based on the erroneous impression that the fighting in Kosovo had
ended. ``We'll obviously point that out to him,'' Berger said,
adding: ``There are varying perspectives in any alliance, but I
believe that there is clarity and solidarity about this mission.''

HAVANA NEIGHBORHOOD OFFERS INSIGHTS ON FATHER
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
Editor's note: Baseball columnist Pedro Gomez, a first-generation
Cu ban-American, describes his impres sions of his parents'
homeland. He is in Havana for Sunday's historic exhibition game
between the Balti more Orioles and the Cuban Na tional Team. &HT;     By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
HAVANA _ The same man who pleaded with my parents to stay in Cuba
has lost his hair and his two-day old beard is white. His mind and
body, however, are sur prisingly strong and he looks no where near
his 84 years.
<P>
   For so many years, Rodolfo Fernandez-Guzman has been a face less
person to me. All I knew of the ``old man'' was that he tried in
vain to keep my parents from fleeing Cuba in 1962, shortly after
commu nism was sweeping through the island.
</P>
<P>
   This is the man my mother and paternal grandmother, Trinidad, ar
gued with almost daily. This is the man who told my mother that by
the time I reached kindergarten the world would be dominated by com
munists.
</P>
<P>
   I met Guzman on Thursday when I made my way to the El Vedado
neighborhood of Havana where my father lived until the day he and
my mother left for the United States in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely I remember going back and forth with your mother
and Trini,'' Guzman said. ``All I said was that the child inside
your mother might grow up to be a great scientist, a ballplayer, a
good com munist, or whatever.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that the child should be able to decide for itself. Now
look at you, you're a grown man with a family of your own. I can't
believe you were the one inside her belly. The world gives us so
many differ ent turns, sometimes it works for some and not for
others. For you, it seems to have worked fine. But who knows where
you would be if you had been born here?''
</P>
<P>
   Like every Cuban I have encoun tered during my first visit to my
parents' homeland, Guzman went out of his way to be gracious and
generous. He was open, with his ideology and his home, offering
food and drinks.
</P>
<P>
   The map my father drew for me two weeks ago served as a perfect
guide to reach his old home, which looked identical to what he
remem bered from 36 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   After taking the jam-packed M6 bus line south on Avenue 23
toward El Vedado, I exited at 24th Street and set off on a short
walk filled with intrigue and mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Just before reaching the Almen dares River, there was 32nd
Street. One block to the right was Pasaje A. And then I was there,
at the only home my father knew until he fled to Miami with my
mother, who delivered me three weeks later in the U.S. The current
tenant, Vilma Varela-Alfonso, has lived in the same home for 29
years.
</P>
<P>
   The home is 65 years old and has housed exactly two families: My
father's and now Alfonso's. Consid ering how transient Americans
are, it's mind-boggling to consider that only two families have
lived in the same home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this home,'' Alfonso said. ``I've spent my entire life
here. I will never leave here. It's a very comfortable home. It's
very private and quiet. This is where I want to finish my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfonso is 32. She was kind enough to offer a tour of my
father's boyhood home. Once inside I saw the exact bed where my
father slept and, as Guzman pointed out, where I was
``fabricated,'' the room where my parents lived during their final
year in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right there, they made you,'' Guzman said. ``So in a way,
you've actually been here before.''
</P>
<P>
   Walking up to No. 13 on Pasaje A, I felt a strong sense of
pride. Meeting the people of the neighbor hood, at least the ones
who were here when my father still lived here, was like an
out-of-body experience.
</P>
<P>
   First there was Asuncion de la Cruz and her son, Abilio
Valdez-de la Cruz, who vividly recalled playing chess with my
father while growing up. Asuncion informed me of a crush my father
had on her daughter, Magalis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ooph,'' de la Cruz said, ``Your father used to chase my
daughter around the neighborhood all the time. I know he had a
thing for her.''
</P>
<P>
   From there I met Ofelia Gonza lez-Pargo, whose husband owned a
grocery store on the same block before it was nationalized by the
government in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   She nearly started crying when she discovered I was Trini's
grand son.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an amazing coinci dence,'' she said. ``I swear on my
mother's grave I was talking about Trini (Wednesday) night. I was
talking about my son's baptism and how we had a little party. I
started talking about all the guests we had and I brought up
Trini's name. I can't believe this. They are sad memories of
glorious times.''
</P>
<P>
   Trini was born in Madrid. At 4-foot-8 and stocky, she resembled
a tough little sparkplug, unwilling to take anything from anyone.
She was known as La Gallega, a common name Cubans have for all
Spaniards. Her reputation in the neighborhood was well known.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel de la Cruz was then a rambunctious 7-year-old and used to
play doorbell ditch at my grand mother's home, the game where you
ring a doorbell and run away before the occupant opens the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knew she had a short temper,'' de la Cruz said. ``We
all knew we could get her going. Then she would stand on the porch
cursing at all of us. They were just things children do.''
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood remains tight-knit. All are friendly and all
take care of one another. The core of the neighborhood is exactly
as my father described it, strong and friendly.
</P>
<P>
   I now have a little better sense of my father and everything
that shaped his life. Not surprisingly, I see the same qualities in
him to this day. &QL;

him to this day. &QL;

STATE SIERRA CLUB IS THREATENING TO TAKE OVER NEW YORK CITY
CHAPTER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Sierra Club's New York state chapter is
threatening to suspend its New York City group in a dispute over
the local group's political and financial independence, according
to leaders of the environmental organization.
</P>
<P>
   The schism between state and local leaders of one of the
nation's most influential environmental lobbying groups reflects
deep divisions over issues including political endorsements,
revenue sharing and fund raising. The leadership of the city group,
for example, is interested in creating a Hudson River park on the
West Side of Manhattan, while the state organization, called the
Atlantic chapter, is more interested in issues like land
conservation upstate.
</P>
<P>
   The board of governors of the 34,000-member Atlantic chapter is
scheduled to vote Saturday on whether to take control of the
12,000-member city group and its finances and oust its leadership.
The board's executive committee approved the action last Saturday,
with the approval of the club's national headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The state chapter's leaders are upset because for the second
year in a row the New York City group mailed a fund-raising letter
to its members after the state chapter's board of governors voted
to forbid it. The club's rules limit fund-raising activities in
order to prevent a competition for funds among the club's local
chapters and groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club is unusual among major environmental groups
because its leaders are elected annually by the entire membership.
</P>
<P>
   When the statewide chapter endorsed Gov. George Pataki's bond
referendum to pay for environmental programs, the New York City
group went its own way, publishing criticism of the spending
priorities in its newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't make an environmental decision without checking
with the chapter, as we can't make an environmental decision
without checking with the national club,'' said Rhea Jezer, the
chairwoman of the Atlantic chapter.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to fund-raising, she said, ``The national club
does not want us penny-anteing everybody. They don't want every
chapter sending out requests for money when they are sending theirs
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Chapters, however, are allowed to solicit money from their
members during March, and the New York City group decided that it
was entitled to do the same thing, said Moishe Blechman, its
chairwoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told them in no uncertain terms not to do it,'' Ms. Jezer
said of the mailing. ``But being a New Yorker myself, I know the
mentality _ they knew better.''

HE'S THE DIFFERENCE  
 SPARTANS OWE SEASON'S SUCCESS TO GUARD CLEAVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, FLA. - Sorry, but Jason Terry isn't the guy. An
eye-popping season, no doubt, and never has a toothpick carried so
much weight without snapping. But the Pac-10 has been exposed and
Arizona has long departed, unable to grasp a tournament victory or
anything else worth engraving.
</P>
<P>
   To select Elton Brand is like glorifying one string of Jimi
Hendrix's guitar, completely ignoring that Duke is good enough to
win an NCAA championship and escape the NBA lottery.
</P>
<P>
   And while a wonderful talent, Wally Szczerbiak only passes the
ball with implicit instructions: That it's returned to sender
within seconds, if not sooner.
</P>
<P>
   No, the Player of the Year is a guy who will clang shots off the
rim until it matters, a guy whose game has been scrutinized,
criticized, dissected like a lab frog. The guy who has simply
willed the other school in Michigan to a place it hasn't been in 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   Mateen Cleaves isn't pretty. He doesn't play over the rim or
drop 30-point bombs when Dick Vitale is sitting at the scorer's
table. He is destined for a nice career in the Continental
Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're looking for steely substance, this is your guy.
The 90s version of a consummate point guard, complete with tattoos
honoring his mother and his hometown. A guy who can dominate
without raw statistics, from a generation weaned on numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, there is no Magic surrounding this bunch from Michigan
State. Just a leader who defers to everyone else until it's time to
win, and a basketball team that usually does.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't many point guards like Mateen Cleaves,'' Duke
Coach Mike Krzyzewski said.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State arrives at the Final Four with little celebration
and even less chance at derailing Duke. They are a nice story, a
team that overthrew their rivals in Ann Arbor and disrupted the
balance of power in the Big Ten.
</P>
<P>
   They are led by a coach, Tom Izzo, who practically begged Jud
Heathcote for an assistant's job worth $7,200 a year. After a pit
stop at Tulsa, Izzo waited eight years for the big dog to retire.
And now he breaks down film with 49ers Coach Steve Mariucci.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans also arrive with a few grease smudges. They are
frowned upon for a lack of aesthetics, for clutching and grabbing,
for incorporating a football mentality into a game of grace. Before
the advent of style points and SportsCenter, a blue-collar team
such as this might've been championed.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans are nobody's darling, but this much is certain:
They will not be intimidated by Duke, and their fearlessness stems
from one guy.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves hit last-second, game-winning shots at Minnesota and
Penn State, and did the same against Northwestern in the conference
tournament. He led the Spartans to 15-1 record in the nation's
toughest conference, a team that has lost once in the past 30
games. He personally foiled Mississippi's upset bid in the final
five minutes of a second-round battle in Milwaukee. And, by now,
you know what he did against Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   He is tough, physical, strong. A former high school quarterback.
An All-American content to take eight shots a game. A point guard
who believes in putting his teammates first. Owner of a back-alley
jumpshot, yet when it's time for heroes, somehow ugly finds the
bottom of the net.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves isn't without baggage. On a recruiting trip to Michigan
three years ago, he was involved in a roll-over car accident with a
few Wolverines players. Last year, he was arrested for carrying
open alcohol in a car. And this season, after a 4-3 start, he
landed on the grill for his lack of production.
</P>
<P>
   But on the 20th anniversary of the 1979 championship team, Magic
Johnson pulled aside Cleaves. A few pointed words from the most
famous Spartan to ever wear shorts, and the rest is on the resume.
</P>
<P>
   He is not the best college basketball player in the country, but
no one had a better year. No one had the game or his teammates on a
string like this guy. And before his season ends Saturday, there
should be one more triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Mateen Cleaves, puppet master, player of the year. &QL;

AUGUSTA LINKS GETTING ROUGH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Those guardians of the game at Augusta National
Golf Club, site of the annual spring rite known as the Masters,
sure thanked Tiger Woods for setting their tournament record. They
immortalized him even before he's won his second major or come
close to developing a paunch shot _ which like a fine wine comes
with a little age on it.
</P>
<P>
   So it's OK if Tiger flames out. His star's been burned into the
firmament two years after he scorched the Masters' field by 12
strokes and stomped on former champion Nick Faldo.
</P>
<P>
   And now things will never be the same again at the hallowed
expanse of green at the end of Magnolia Lane.
</P>
<P>
   After Woods' record-setting performance, Masters officials began
mulling ways to toughen up their perfectly manicured and usually
tough course. They can't have the guys posting birdies and
generally treating Augusta National like it's one of those TPC
(Tournament Players Club) venues.
</P>
<P>
   So now we know what Tiger wrought.
</P>
<P>
   Masters officials have grown their course some hair, though more
of a Drew Carey buzz-cut than an Alice Cooper mane.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Augusta National will have some rough,
though no one will confuse it with the stuff at the U.S. Open or
even The Players Championship, the fifth major and annually the
year's first.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the whole course was fairway, and looked pretty on
TV, too. This year the grass beyond the fairway will be 1] inches
high. This is a huge change, though it's still an almost perfect
lie.
</P>
<P>
   Two holes are longer, too, and 20 pine trees have appeared along
the right side of the 15th fairway.
</P>
<P>
   Augusta members are a dignified lot and don't call longer grass
rough. They prefer a more gentrified ``second cut'' when referring
to the taller stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``While changes made to the golf course this year included
distance, the principle objective was to place greater emphasis on
accuracy off the tee,'' Hootie Johnson, in his first year as
chairman, told the Associated Press. ``The second cut is consistent
with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, and it should be consistent with higher scores, too.
</P>
<P>
   Augusta is as famous for lightning fast, contoured greens as its
green jackets. And their new second cut is just about as deep as a
golf ball is tall. That is going to make it tough to hit a ball
from the rough with any kind of control. Look for shots to end up
in some strange, terrifying places.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, all these years you've had a beautiful lie with
which to do anything you can to the ball,'' said Ben Crenshaw, a
two-time Masters champion. ``Even if you take just a little bit of
spin off the ball, it will make a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Things could be worse.
</P>
<P>
   Woods shot his record-setting 270, 18 under par, after opening
with a 40 on the first nine holes. It was one of the all-time great
comebacks.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' score was one shot better than the record set by Jack
Nicklaus in 1965, when Augusta officials probably wrung their hands
in worry but they pretty much left the course alone for years.
</P>
<P>
   And they didn't scramble to give it a face lift when Raymond
Floyd equaled Nicklaus' record in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ernie Els, capable of torching a course or two himself,
thinks Woods' record will last for ages as long as the rough is up.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: This year's winner of The Players Championship wins a
three-year pass into the Masters. This is the only other tournament
that's not classified a major in which the winner is accorded such
a privilege. So what does that make the Players? An almost major,
minor-major or what? . . .
</P>
<P>
   This just in. OK, it came in Wednesday, but it's long overdue.
The PGA Tour is banning cellular telephones and cameras from all
its events starting this week. Take your cell phone or camera to a
PGA tournament and you will have to check it at the gate. A golf
course is a golfer's office and some of the players have been
carping about phones chirping and flash bulbs flashing in the
middle of their backswing. Fans caught with either device will have
to turn them in or scram. &QL;

SUIT AGAINST DOCTOR ALLOWED OVER REFERRAL TO A SPECIALIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ALAN FINDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a decision that could make it easier for patients
to bring malpractice suits against doctors in managed-care
programs, New York state's highest court ruled Thursday that the
widow of a man who died of a heart attack could sue her husband's
primary-care doctor for failing to refer him quickly enough to a
heart specialist.
</P>
<P>
   The court of appeals, in a unanimous decision, did not determine
whether the primary-care physician was actually guilty of
malpractice, leaving that to be decided by a jury in state supreme
court in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The court of appeals did rule, however, that a federal law that
had often blocked consumers from suing managed-care providers did
not pre-empt the widow from suing her husband's doctor.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was brought by Susan Nealy, whose husband, Glenn,
died in 1992. Nealy, who was 37, was diagnosed with coronary
disease and had an angioplasty in March 1992. Not long after the
procedure, Nealy's employer, Photocircuits Corp., replaced its
health insurance company with three HMOs. Nealy enrolled in one of
the HMOs, U.S. Healthcare, paying a premium so he could also go to
doctors outside the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Nealy's participation in the HMO went into effect on April 1.
His widow said that he tried to see Dr. Ralph Yung, the Bronx
doctor whom he selected as his primary-care physician in the HMO,
on April 2 and April 3 because of chest pains. But Nealy was turned
away each time because of disagreements over whether he was
properly enrolled, Mrs. Nealy said.
</P>
<P>
   Nealy was examined by Yung on April 10 and asked to return three
days later for more tests, according to the court of appeals
decision. Yung told Nealy during one and perhaps both of these
visits that he should see a cardiologist.
</P>
<P>
   Nealy asked to be referred to the cardiologist who treated him
previously, Dr. Stephen Green, who was not in the HMO. Yung agreed
to submit a request to U.S. Healthcare to approve a referral to
Green and to waive a co-payment that Nealy would ordinarily have to
pay. But Yung did not submit the form to the HMO until about a week
later, the court of appeals said.
</P>
<P>
   The HMO turned down the request about two weeks later,
suggesting that Nealy see one of the plan's cardiologists. He
agreed, obtained a referral on May 18 and made an appointment for
the following day. But Nealy died later on May 18 of a massive
heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Nealy sued Yung, U.S. Healthcare and two subsidiaries,
among others, for malpractice and breach of contract in state
supreme court in the Bronx. All but Yung were removed from the case
in federal court, on the ground that federal law pre-empted a
patient from suing a managed-care company for administrative acts.
Because Yung did not seek action by the federal court, the case
against him remained in the state courts.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two decades, insurance companies, health
maintenance organizations and doctors involved in managed care have
been largely protected from malpractice lawsuits because of the
federal law, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.
</P>
<P>
   The law says that its provisions cannot be superseded by state
laws since they involve employee benefit plans. State and federal
courts had often interpreted this to mean that patients and their
relatives could not sue for malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that Congress did not intend to pre-empt claims
such as those now before us,'' Chief Judge Judith Kaye wrote in the
decision.

CROWD SIZE WON'T BE LIM ITED AT PHOENIX OPEN
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Phoenix Open organizers will not limit the crowd size, but they
will attempt to better control the behav ior of fans once they get
to the course.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix Thunderbirds said Thursday that daily tickets priced
at $20 will remain a fixture of the Phoenix Open. The decision was
made after the Thunderbirds and the PGA Tour worked out a strategy
for handling crowds and security for next year's tournament.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of an incident at this year's Phoenix Open, in which
an armed man scuffled with police, there was speculation that the
tour nament would switch to a more expensive, weeklong badge in
order to cut down on the largest galleries in professional golf.
</P>
<P>
   Tournament chairmen say the PGA Tour didn't direct them to
significantly reduce future crowds at the TPC of Scottsdale or to
change the atmosphere of golf's most free-spirited tournament. The
Thun derbirds and PGA Tour Commis sioner Tim Finchem reached those
conclusions during meetings the past two days at the PLAYERS
Championship in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing that came out of our meetings is that
the tour has asked us to take the lead on establishing crowd size
and security at the Phoenix Open,'' said Steve Matteucci, chairman
of the 2000 Open. ``There is no mandate from the tour that we
reduce the size of the crowds, only an emphasis on how our fans
behave once they get to the course, specifically their alcohol
consumption and decorum.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as daily tickets go, they are very much alive. Anyone
will be able to walk up to the front gate next year and purchase a
daily ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Finchem was attending the PLAYERS Championship and was
unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Matteucci and Artigue acknowl edged that the Thunderbirds had
been reeling from the flak created from an article in The Arizona
Republic that said the PGA Tour had called for sweeping changes in
the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most controversial involved modeling the Phoenix
Open after the GTE Byron Nelson Classic in Dallas, which caps
crowds at 250,000 for the week by offering only a limited number of
$150 badges. The Byron Nelson also confines alcohol consumption to
specific areas.
</P>
<P>
   Artigue said the Thunderbirds made it clear that limiting crowds
by eliminating daily badges wasn't an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently that was just one (tour) staff member's idea on how
to rectify what happened this year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 31, the final day of the Open, Brian K. Murphy of
Phoenix was arrested for being intoxicated and scuffling with a
Scottsdale police officer. The incident made national news because
Murphy was carrying a concealed .380-caliber semiautomatic pistol
while follow ing a group that included golf icon Tiger Woods.
Subsequent fears ex pressed by Woods and other players put the onus
on the PGA Tour to bring changes.
</P>
<P>
   During a PGA Tour policy board meeting March 2 in Miami, the
Phoenix Open was the No. 1 topic of conversation. One unidentified
tour official told the policy board that ``something has to be done
about Phoenix.'' Three days later, the Thunderbirds announced a
task force to study crowd and security issues, as well as the
alcohol question.
</P>
<P>
   ``The final word from the task force on all of these issues
still will come on June 1, just as we planned,'' Matteucci said.
``At the moment, we're still gathering ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Matteucci said fans will notice that the biggest changes at next
year's tournament will involve alco hol, although he stopped short
of saying that such beverages will be confined to certain areas of
the course. Precedence was set at this year's Open when the
Thunderbirds banned alcohol sales around the notorious 16th tee,
where fans tend to get louder and crazier as the day wears on.
</P>
<P>
   Banning sales around the 16th ``was met with limited success, as
a lot of those fans just brought (alcohol) in with them,''
Matteucci said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That won't happen next year, and if someone has had, or is
about to have, too much to drink, we'll cut them off and ask them
to leave,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll adopt some other meas ures to refine that, but at the
moment, I'm just not ready to say what they'll be because we're
still looking into them.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Artigue said, several Thunderbirds plan to visit
the Byron Nelson in mid-May to see how the sponsoring Salesmanship
Club of Dallas deals with its galleries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to make (the Phoenix Open) a fortress, because
we want our fans to enjoy the tournament as they always have,''
Artigue said. ``At the same time, we will adopt some measures to
refine the way we do things out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Matteucci added that security will increase significantly for
next year's tournament, ``although at this point, I'm not sure by
how much.''
</P>
<P>
   Artigue and Matteucci agreed that the record crowds that once
roamed the TPC of Scottsdale are a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about being knocked off the hill or even being
king of the hill,'' said Artigue, noting that this year's
attendance of 422,650 fans was down 10 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, if the crowd shrinks a little bit again, that's not
a negative, it's a positive. We're not trying to set attendance
records, and even if we only draw 350,000 to 400,000 fans, we'll
still be the largest tournament in professional golf. I don't think
that crown will ever be wrestled away from us.''
</P>
<P>
   Artigue and Matteucci both said that crowds probably will be
even smaller next year because some of the ``freebies'' _ daily
tickets that are doled out by the thousands to corporate entities
and consignment brokers _ will be reduced or possibly eliminated.
Artigue illus trated that point by noting that skybox patrons get
100 daily tickets for each of the seven days of the tournament,
while corporate and presenting sponsors receive thou sands of daily
allotments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the PGA Tour under stands the uniqueness of our tourna
ment based on the size of it,'' Artigue said. ``We're still working
together with them, and (the PGA Tour) will have some input on the
changes that we come up with.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the reins of this stagecoach are now in the hands of the
Thunderbirds.''

IMPASSE ON NEW YORK STATE BUDGET WORSENS AS PATAKI THREATENS
VETOES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The state's budget impasse worsened Thursday as
Gov. George Pataki declared the Assembly and Senate proposals
unacceptable, threatening a repeat of last year's sweeping vetoes
unless the Legislature drastically scales back its spending plans.
</P>
<P>
   With the April 1 start of a new fiscal year a week away, the
three sides are so thoroughly stalemated that none claims to know
the next move. The Senate and Assembly were long since supposed to
have begun meeting in conference committees to hash out their
differences, but they have not, and the leader of each house is
blaming the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Assembly spending plan is just much, much too high, and
unacceptable,'' Pataki said Thursday in a news conference called to
make his first extensive comments on the Legislature's work toward
a budget. ``Even the Senate, in my view, spends at a rate that
creates very real problems in the years 2000, 2001, 2002 and
beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just saying very plainly that I will not accept a budget
that drives huge out-year expenditures and that threatens to undo
the progress that we've made over the last four years,'' he said,
seated in the ornate corner room of the Capitol that was Franklin
D. Roosevelt's office. ``I think everybody knows that if the level
of spending is unacceptable, then I will veto.''
</P>
<P>
   After two years in which he increased spending steeply, the
Republican governor has made a firm commitment to restraining
spending in the next fiscal year, proposing a 1.8 percent increase,
to $72.66 billion, despite the state's $2 billion surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's Republican majority wants to raise spending by at
least 2.7 percent, while the Assembly's Democratic majority has
proposed an increase that it puts at 4.6 percent but that the
governor's office says is closer to 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's statement appeared to dash the hopes of Joseph
Bruno, the Senate majority leader, that his plan had struck a
balance that could win over the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a
Democrat, while staying within bounds that were acceptable to
Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno, clearly taken aback by Pataki's comments, said, ``I'm
very conscious of next year and the year after, and we're trying to
be responsible, we're trying to be prudent.''
</P>
<P>
   The state appears headed for a repeat of 1994 through 1997, when
bitter, highly partisan clashes led to the four latest budgets in
state history. The 1996 budget, approved 104 days late, and the
1997 one, 126 days overdue, were believed by independent
researchers to be the two tardiest state budgets in American
history.
</P>
<P>
   A protracted fight would carry a new twist this year because,
under a salary increase law enacted in December, legislators'
salaries will be withheld as long as there is no budget.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1997, the governor and legislative leaders negotiated the
budget in secret meetings. Last year, the Senate and Assembly, in a
bid to make the process more public and involve more legislators,
met in conference committees to negotiate a budget publicly with
little direct input from the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki lauded the process, then vetoed more than 1,000 line
items, well over $1 billion in spending, most of it in Democrats'
pet projects. The vetoes stunned lawmakers of both parties, and
they continue to roughen his already abrasive relations with the
Legislature.

SUDDENLY, WOMEN'S FIELD IS FULL OF INTRIGUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Tennessee is gone, its Final Four challenge
having become a frantic quest to pawn $50,000 worth of hotel rooms
and tickets to the Final Four games that the school and its
boosters no longer need.
</P>
<P>
   But on the scene are four teams itching to lead a new order in
the NCAA's women's basketball tournament. As Louisiana Tech's Leon
Barmore, the only coach left in the field who has won this
tournament, said Thursday: ``I've never been to a Final Four like
this, where nobody knows who's going to win. There's not much
difference between the four teams. Purdue is ranked No. 1 and
Georgia is a great team and we're playing our best and Duke is so
high they could probably take on the NBA and beat them. These girls
are tying their shoes real tight and saying, `I'm going to whip
you.'''
</P>
<P>
   It is also a field with a web of unusual, and in some cases,
interlocking, story lines, from a tough-love coach to a lame-duck
coach, from loyal twin sisters to feelings of disloyalty caused by
a firing.
</P>
<P>
   Duke (28-6) plays Georgia (27-6) in the first game Friday night
at the San Jose Arena, and then Purdue (32-1) faces Louisiana Tech
(30-2). As parity infiltrates women's college basketball, nothing
else seems guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It proves there are more than one or two teams to watch in our
game,'' Purdue coach Carolyn Peck said.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh off its upset of Tennessee in Monday's East Regional
final, Duke swept into the Bay Area Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Two Duke players also provide the most intriguing subplot to the
tournament. Duke's star center, Michele VanGorp, and guard Nicole
Erickson each transferred from Purdue to Duke in 1997 because Lin
Dunn, the coach who brought them to Purdue two years earlier, had
been abruptly fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they did was wrong, and there was no reason for it,''
VanGorp said after Duke's practice Thursday. ``And when I asked for
a reason, I got odd-ball answers from the school. They never
explained anything to anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I wanted to leave Purdue, and Nicole and I wanted to go
together. I don't ever regret it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn was the winningest coach in Purdue's history and her
departure was extremely controversial. University officials never
went into detail about her exit, which sparked lawsuits that ended
with Dunn accepting a $100,000 settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Should Duke and Purdue advance to Sunday night's championship,
VanGorp said she would not be more motivated to defeat her former
school. But she added, ``They still haven't had the decency to
personally tell me why my coach was fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Louisiana Tech senior forward Monica Maxwell has
her own history with the Purdue program. Coming out of Central High
School in East Chicago, Maxwell narrowed her choices to Purdue and
Louisiana Tech.
</P>
<P>
   She called a news conference to announce her decision but did
not know that she would pick rural Ruston, La., until moments
before she faced reporters. She knows many of the current Purdue
players, but said coolly, ``When I play Purdue Friday, I'm not
going out there to rekindle any friendships.''
</P>
<P>
   Purdue and Louisiana Tech have their own history. Purdue
defeated Louisiana Tech by 71-65 in December. Louisiana Tech
eliminated Purdue in a regional final in last year's NCAA
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell has led the charge in the last two months for Louisiana
Tech, which has won its last 22 games. Early in the season, Maxwell
scored only 19 points in six games, but her play improved after a
Barmore scolding.
</P>
<P>
   ``He calls it tough love,'' Maxwell said. ``It's definitely
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   In Purdue, Louisiana Tech faces a team that hasn't lost since
Nov. 22, when Stanford edged the Boilermakers by 1 point. Guards
Stephanie White-McCarty and Ukari Figgs make up what most consider
the best backcourt in women's college basketball. And they have
kept their composure in difficult circumstances, weathering a
season of questions about Peck, who is leaving Purdue to join the
Orlando franchise of the Women's National Basketball Association
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   At Georgia, the twins Kelly and Coco Miller are the double image
that can't be double-teamed. Kelly has had the better tournament so
far. She was the Mideast Regional most valuable player after
averaging 27.5 points, 7 rebounds and 6.5 assists in four games.
</P>
<P>
   The Millers have always played on the same team and let
recruiters know they came as a package. Georgia coach Andy Landers
had no problem with that, since the Millers are the third set of
twins he has coached. ``I've gotten numb to it,'' Landers said.

A PERFECT GUY DOUSES HIMSELF WITH GASOLINE AND STRIKES A MATCH .
 WHY?  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL ZIELBAUER

<P>
   WILTON, Conn. _ To everyone in this small, affluent town, Sam
Hingston was just about the finest young man they had ever seen: a
courteous A student at Wilton High School, a captain on the
football and wrestling teams, and as handsome as any 17-year-old
kid on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was, like, the perfect guy,'' said Allison Dymnicki, 16, a
junior who passed Hingston in the hallways each day. So there was
no explaining why, shortly before 3 a.m. Wednesday, Hingston gulped
down a shot of gasoline from an old Gatorade bottle, doused himself
with fuel and struck a match, setting his body ablaze in the locked
bathroom of his family home. Before his parents could get to him
and extinguish the flames, most of Hingston's body had been
scorched by third-degree burns. Paramedics airlifted him to the
Westchester County Medical Center in Valhalla, N.Y., but the burns
were too severe. He died that evening.
</P>
<P>
   The news spread almost instantaneously through Wilton, a town of
20,000 shrouded by wooded hills, a place Connecticut magazine
ranked as the third-best small town in the state last year. ``We're
all trying to grapple with: `Why a young death? Why a suicide?'''
said Deborah Low, Wilton High's principal. ``He didn't give any
signs. If you had a list of people least likely to have this happen
to, he would be on the list.''
</P>
<P>
   To his parents, Margie and Richard Hingston, Sam was something
of a boy wonder with a promising future. After the family moved to
Wilton from Woodstown, N.J., in April, Hingston established himself
as an outstanding student athlete at Wilton High. Classmates
described him as charming and friendly in class and a warrior on
the football field, where he was a starting linebacker, and on the
wrestling mat, where he earned a 14-1 record and a regional
championship last year at 160 pounds. Next fall, Hingston was
planning to attend Boston College, his family said. His twin
sister, Sarah, also a senior at Wilton High, plans to attend the
University of Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Hingston had been complaining of headaches for a few weeks, said
his grandmother Dorothy Czulewicz. But it did not seem serious, she
said. Tuesday evening had started and ended just like any other
night inside the warmly decorated Hingston home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had dinner with us at the table,'' Mrs. Czulewicz, who
lives in the family's four-bedroom house, said Thursday as she
tended to a table filled with photos of her grandson. ``We watched
`Jeopardy!' together.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone went to bed around 11 p.m. Tuesday, she said; Hingston
had a cold compress on his head to relieve another headache.
Sometime before 3 a.m., though, he padded into the garage, filled
the Gatorade bottle with gasoline from a gas can and locked himself
in the bathroom with a book of matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incomprehensible,'' said David Clune, superintendent of
the Wilton School District. ``He had everything _ looks, brains,
friendships.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingston's death hit many of his classmates hard. ``People go
through the stairwells and don't say a word,'' said Theresa
Dalessandro, 16, a junior. ``You can actually hear footsteps, which
is strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, Hingston's French teacher broke down in class
and sobbed, students said.
</P>
<P>
   Crisis counselors took turns speaking to groups of the school's
930 students in the school library.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us the Sam we knew wasn't the Sam that did this to
himself,'' said Jackie Sherman, 16, who knew Hingston from her
American history class.
</P>
<P>
   Hingston's body will be cremated Friday; a funeral service is
scheduled for 11 a.m. Saturday at Our Lady of Fatima Roman Catholic
Church, two miles from Wilton High. The family agreed to donate
some of Hingston's organs for transplant, his grandmother said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilton police do not plan to investigate Hingston's death.
Residents say that no matter how long they think about it, they are
not sure they will ever understand what was going through Sam
Hingston's young mind in that locked bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only person that really knows,'' said Capt. Ronald
Beliveau of the Wilton police, ``is the person that's dead.''

FROM GODS TO A QUEEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Bill Condon successfully tackled a provocative
subject when he adapted and directed ``Gods and Monsters,'' a
fictionalized account of the last days of the filmmaker James
Whale, creator of the Frankenstein movies.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday Condon won an Academy Award day for best adapted
screenplay. But his first studio film, which he hopes to begin
shooting later this year, may be even more provocative, especially
for New Yorkers. He is undertaking the life story of Bess Myerson.
The movie is tentatively called ``Queen of the Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Her life is amazing,'' Condon said. ``She was the first Jewish
Miss America, and was named that moments after people were exposed
for the first time to the images of the concentration camps. She
was one of those women famous for being famous. In the '70s she
reinvented herself as a city official ... And then came scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Myerson was charged with trying to bribe a New York state
judge who was handling her lover's divorce. She and two
co-defendants were acquitted on Dec. 22, 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's actually one of the most complex characters I've ever
come across,'' Condon said.
</P>
<P>
   The script was written by John Hoffman, a New York playwright,
and studios executives are already interested. Condon has not yet
approached actresses, but his targets include Meryl Streep,
Sigourney Weaver and Glenn Close, and possibly even Jane Fonda, who
has been in retirement in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Condon, who attended Regis High School in Manhattan and later
majored in philosophy at Columbia University, said he had not met
Ms. Myerson. ``She once said, `I'm like an onion: You peel and peel
and can't get to the middle of it,''' Condon said. ``It's an
extraordinary story.''
</P>
<P>
   Condon may have been the most stunned person at the Academy
Awards when his name was announced as the winner for the best
adapted screenplay. He has struggled for years in Hollywood as a
screenwriter and journalist and is unaccustomed to the hoopla that
is now around him.
</P>
<P>
   The other day he boarded a flight to London to attend the
opening there of ``Gods and Monsters.'' He said he hoped there
would be a telephone on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm leaving the country with 150 unanswered phone calls,'' he
said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Graduating to Producer &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few good scripts around,'' said Dustin Hoffman.
``By definition leading roles are written mostly for people in
their 30s and 40s, not people like me. So you become a friend of
who the movie is about, or you carry a gun in those action things,
which I won't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman, who is 61, was explaining his decision to produce the
first film in which he is not appearing. (His company, Punch
Productions, was a producer of ``Tootsie'' and ``Rain Man,'' in
which he starred.) The new film, ``A Walk on the Moon,'' to be
released on Friday, is a drama, set in the summer of 1969, about a
family vacationing in the Catskills and the restlessness of the
mother, played by Diane Lane, who feels that life is passing her
by.
</P>
<P>
   The cast includes Liev Schreiber as her husband, Anna Paquin as
her adolescent daughter and Viggo Mortensen as a hippie who seduces
her.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman said he had been tracking the script, by Pamela Gray,
for a while and even thought of directing it until he heard that
the actor Tony Goldwyn had already signed on to make the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked on the phone, and I said, `Please let us produce
it,''' Hoffman said. ``It didn't take long before we realized that
we saw the film in the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman was attracted to the writing as well as to the
underlying theme of a middle-class family in the grip of personal
upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main issue is timeless,'' he said. ``In the same ways that
it's hard to make marriages work, it's also hard to make families
work. Especially in a year like 1969, when you had Woodstock, the
Apollo mission, the war in Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman has a reputation as a meticulous, some say obsessed,
perfectionist who has had his share of run-ins with directors. He
decided early on not to be too intrusive and not to go to the set.
The film was made on a tight budget of $8 million in the Laurentian
Mountains north of Montreal where the resort scene is remarkably
similar to the Catskills.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't need me there; the actors didn't need me there,''
Hoffman said. ``I've been around producers 30 years, and usually
what a producer does is tell you what you can't do. I didn't want
to be that kind of producer. I don't like the idea of hovering.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hoffman said he received videotapes every day of the scenes
being made and spoke to Goldwyn each evening. He added that he was
stunned from the first day he began viewing the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I called Tony and said, `Look at the work you're getting from
the actors,''' Hoffman said. He gave the novice 38-year-old
director one bit of advice: Keep the camera rolling sometimes even
before and after a scene technically starts and ends. ``Some of the
best stuff happens when the camera is on and the actors don't know
it,'' Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldwyn said that whatever nervousness he first had about
working with Hoffman vanished overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `It's your movie, you do your thing,''' Goldwyn said.
``He'd give exhaustive notes. We talked for hours. But he kept
saying, `It's your decision.' What more could I have asked for than
to have an artist of Dustin's caliber and creative instincts who
did everything to help the creative process and gave me freedom to
do what I wanted.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those Mortal Fools &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The triumph of ``Shakespeare in Love'' as best picture at the
Academy Awards is viewed by Michael Hoffman as an especially good
omen.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman, director of ``One Fine Day,'' ``Restoration'' and
``Soap Dish,'' has been consumed for the last year in filming ``A
Midsummer Night's Dream,'' Shakespeare's most magical comedy.
</P>
<P>
   He gathered an all-star cast, including Michelle Pfeiffer as
Titania and Rupert Everett (Oberon), Calista Flockhart (Helena),
Kevin Kline, Sophie Marceau (Hippolyta) and Stanley Tucci (Puck).
The movie was shot in northern Italy and is set to be released on
May 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``In broad strokes, `Shakespeare in Love' will certainly help
us,'' said Hoffman, 43, who lives in Boise, Idaho. ``That film made
people close to Shakespeare in a very clever way.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``The more you read biographies of Shakespeare,
the more distant you feel from Shakespeare the poet. But in
`Shakespeare in Love,' by essentially falsifying all the
biographical data and recasting Shakespeare as one of the
characters in his plays, you open up a way for audiences to feel
connected to the genius of Shakespeare, which was his ability to
create characters.''
</P>
<P>
   The director became involved with the project in 1995 when he
had a conversation with Kline, a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the never-ending post-production of `Restoration,'
and he was doing `Fierce Creatures,' the sequel to `A Fish Called
Wanda,' and neither one of us was at our happiest,'' Hoffman said.
``We were commiserating and looking for solace, and we began
talking about Shakespeare and how much we loved those plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman's involvement with `A Midsummer Night's Dream' really
began more than two decades ago when he was among the students from
Boise State University who began the Idaho Shakespeare Festival,
which is still flourishing. In the first production, ``A Midsummer
Night's Dream,'' Hoffman played Lysander.
</P>
<P>
   Several years later, while studying Renaissance Drama as a
Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, he directed a version of the
play, which led to film work.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman said that for him ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' was
Shakespeare's loveliest and most poetic play. Shakespeare set his
story in an English version of ancient Greece, but the movie is set
in Tuscany around 1900. The play itself deals with love, in all of
its comical and fantastical forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became very intrigued by the way all these characters seem
to be balancing the desire for love with the desire for dignity,
the desire to maintain their pride and the degree to which each
character is willing to sacrifice or compromise their dignity to
have love,'' said Hoffman, who also adapted the play for the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   He said he proposed the idea for the movie to Fox Searchlight, a
division of 20th Century Fox that releases artier films. After
reading the adaptation, studio executives quickly agreed to make
the movie for about $13.5 million, a relatively small amount for a
film with such high-profile names.
</P>
<P>
   The actors worked for only three weeks or so and hardly took
their usual salaries to appear in the film.
</P>
<P>
   There have been at least six film versions of ``A Midsummer
Night's Dream,'' including one with an 11-year-old Mickey Rooney
playing Puck, and an animated one in 1965 with Magoo as Puck. The
character of Puck, the fairy trickster, was, at least initially,
the central image in Hoffman's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning I just had an image of fat little Puck riding
in the Tuscan countryside on the back of a turtle,'' he said.

TIMBER'S STANDING STILL PRIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA _ A few things have changed since we ranked the Kentucky
Derby contenders for the first time in February.
</P>
<P>
   Then-undefeated Exploit has been not only defeated but retired
with a knee injury. Florida's Three Ring has become the fourth
filly to merit consideration this year. Del Mar Futurity winner
Worldly Manner, out of sight and virtually out of mind while
training in Dubai, has restored his reputation by winning a fast
``trial race.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing hasn't changed.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Timber remains No. 1 in our book.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an updated top 10 heading into the last round of preps
for the May 1 Kentucky Derby _ Saturday's Gallery Furniture.com
Stakes at Turfway Park, the April 3 Santa Anita Derby, and the
April 10 Blue Grass at Keeneland and Arkansas Derby at Oaklawn.
</P>
<P>
   1. Prime Timber: He'll be ridden again by David Flores when he
heads a three-horse team for trainer Bob Baffert in the Santa Anita
Derby. Baffert is also aiming General Challenge (Chris McCarron)
and Finder's Gold (to be determined) for the race. Prime Timber
threw off Exploit _ whom we ranked No. 2 at the time _ and a
reputation for cutting it close when he won the San Felipe Stakes
by two lengths.
</P>
<P>
   2. Vicar: He cuts it close but keeps winning _ the Fountain of
Youth by a neck, the Florida Derby by a nose. Next: Blue Grass.
</P>
<P>
   3. Wondertross: Everybody's wise-guy pick in the Florida Derby
ran second despite some trouble. It wouldn't be a Kentucky Derby
without trainer Nick Zito. Next: Blue Grass.
</P>
<P>
   4. Cat Thief: It wouldn't be a Santa Anita Derby without trainer
D. Wayne Lukas, but his only good 3-year-old will stay back east
for the Blue Grass, leaving Lukas without a starter here for the
first time since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   5. Worldly Manner: If it's legitimate, his reported track-record
1:46.59 clocking in winning a 1[-mile trial in Dubai makes the
``Arab horse'' a factor, despite his handlers' unorthodox approach.
</P>
<P>
   6. Three Ring: After dominating her division in Florida, she's
only the second filly to sign up for the Derby since Winning
Colors' 1988 victory.
</P>
<P>
   7. Straight Man: Two flashy victories give owners Bob and
Beverly Lewis (Exploit) new hope. Next: the Gallery Furniture race,
for which he drew post 1, helpful to a front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   8. Excellent Meeting: Still Baffert's top filly after narrow
Santa Anita Oaks win.
</P>
<P>
   9. Desert Hero: Two for two going into Santa Anita Derby with
new trainer Richard Mandella, and facing same obstacle as Straight
Man: lack of experience.
</P>
<P>
   10. General Challenge: Fifth in the Louisiana Derby, he then
worked in a sizzling :57 3/5 at Santa Anita after blinkers were put
on.
</P>
<P>
   Hello, Dubai: Fans at Santa Anita will be able to bet on
Sunday's $5 million Dubai World Cup throughout Saturday's card.
Windows will reopen at 7:15 a.m. Sunday. The race will be shown at
8:15 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm and jockey Gary Stevens drew post 3 and were made
2-1 favorites to repeat their 1998 victory in the 1\-mile race.
Victory Gallop and Jerry Bailey got post 4 and 5-2 odds. Malek and
Alex Solis got post 7 and 12-1.
</P>
<P>
   The top non-U.S. horse _ one of four Dubai-trained runners in
the field of eight _ is '98 Epsom Derby winner High Rise. He and
Frankie Dettori drew post 1 and are 11-4 third choices.
</P>
<P>
   Jock switch: Everybody who predicted Stevens would replace Kent
Desormeaux aboard 1998 Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner Real
Quiet is right, but much later than expected and for the wrong
reason.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert said Stevens will ride Real Quiet in the April 3 Oaklawn
Handicap in Arkansas, but not because of any failing by Desormeaux,
real or imagined. It's just that Desormeaux had already committed
to ride Honest Lady for trainer Bobby Frankel in the Santa Anita
Derby the same day.
</P>
<P>
   As long as Stevens will be in Arkansas, he'll also take over
from Desormeaux aboard Excellent Meeting in the April 2 Fantasy
Stakes for 3-year-old fillies.
</P>
<P>
   Back-markers: After The Blood-Horse magazine named the century's
top 100 thoroughbreds, Bill Finley of the New York Daily News
spoofed the whole exercise by naming the 10 worst.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 was Bum, who finished last in all three starts, beaten a
combined 105 lengths, before being retired in 1989. Others on the
Finley list: Zippy Chippy, 0 for 85 when Finger Lakes banned him;
Ricks Natural Star, the not-so-great pretender of the '96 Breeders'
Cup; Glue Pot, earner of $0 in the '50s, and Snaafi Dancer, the
$10.2 million yearling who never raced.
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing how really bad names go with really bad horses, or
at least the ones we remember.
</P>
<P>
   The voice: Michael Wrona is coming back to Hollywood Park, and
this time he'll stay like a mother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   The witty Australian was a popular choice to call the races in
Inglewood beginning April 23, replacing Luke Kruytbosch, who left
for Churchill Downs. Wrona, 33, worked at Hollywood for three weeks
in the fall of 1991, and has been at Golden Gate Fields for seven
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ecstatic to be coming full circle after almost a decade,''
said Wrona, who'll spend the Hollywood offseason at Turf Paradise
in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Wrona is distinguished by his creativity, which gave us his
oft-quoted call of a victory by a front-runner with unproven
stamina: ``Will he stay? He'll stay like a mother-in-law!'' &QL;

NETS SIMPLY CAN'T SHOOT STRAIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By RON DICKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among the New Jersey Nets' problems in their 5-21 season is
their awful shooting, which has mushroomed from a slump to a trend
to a lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Excuses about the short training period no longer apply. Every
other team in the NBA has faced the same condition, and not one has
a worse shooting percentage than New Jersey's 38 percent heading
into Friday night's game against Indiana at Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   With a few more games like Wednesday night's 32 percent shooting
in a loss against Detroit, the Nets (5-21) will have the Milwaukee
Hawks standing a little taller in their history. The 1954-55 Hawks
own the league's worst team shooting percentage at 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the Nets' misses are adding up to one of the
worst offenses in league history. Their 86 points a game and the
Bulls' 84.1 would be second and first for the fewest points in
league history, with those same Milwaukee Hawks holding the season
record at 87.4.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Kittles and Kendall Gill, the Nets' perimeter shooters,
are at 35 and 37 percent, respectively. Keith Van Horn's 20.2
scoring average cannot mask his 42 percent accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   Different Nets have different solutions to their shooting
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn said the answer is practice, so he was one of three
starters _ Kittles and Jayson Williams were the others _ to show up
for an optional workout Thursday at Champion Center in East
Rutherford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Kittles said of the shooting slump: ``The main thing is to stay
aggressive and work through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Don Casey believes intensified defense would help create
easy baskets off a turnover or in transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a breakout,'' Casey said. ``And with the teams we're
playing _ Indiana and Cleveland _ certainly defensively, we're
going to have to make our own breakout. So if we don't get to the
foul line, if we don't take it to the hole, then the misery will
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephon Marbury, who has shot 43 percent in seven games with New
Jersey, said part of the problem is hesitancy. ``I'm penetrating
and I'm kicking out, but they're not shooting,'' he said about his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Casey agreed, saying that slumping players often pass up a good
shot for a sure shot, which often does not come.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the team hopes nightly for a player with a hot
hand, but that player has rarely materialized. Van Horn said good
shooting can be just as contagious as bad shooting.
</P>
<P>
   While the Nets' shooting problems show no sign of abating, Casey
has adopted the philosophy of Indiana's Larry Bird, against whom he
will be coaching Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shot till you miss or you shoot till you make,'' Casey
said. ``So we're shooting until we make.''

BIG QUESTIONS FACE USC DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As USC begins spring practice today, coach Paul
Hackett envisions a completely different team than just three
months ago, when the Trojans ended their season at the Sun Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outlook is we have flip-flopped this team in terms of the
offense now has experience and the defense does not have
experience,'' Hackett said. ``It's the opposite of a year ago. I am
extremely concerned about the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker and Butkus Award winner Chris Claiborne is noticeably
gone, but several other key starters, including Rashard Cook, Marc
Matock, Daylon McCutcheon and Grant Pearsall, will need to be
replaced on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of young guys that have to come on and have
great springs,'' Hackett said. ``That is a huge priority for us.''
</P>
<P>
   On offense, there are far fewer questions, especially now that
wide receiver R. Jay Soward has returned from his self-imposed
exile from the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, the expectation level ought to be considerably
better than last year,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Although quarterback Carson Palmer started five games last
season, Hackett said his main objective in spring practice will be
to keep the offense as uncomplicated as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be simpler than we've ever been,'' Hackett
said. ``The reason is the quarterback. He was not a starter until
midway through the season and never had a spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to to go slower than last spring and try to
emphasize the fundamentals.''
</P>
<P>
   There already have been several position changes before spring
practice has started. Defensive end Sultan Abdul-Malik, a two-year
starter at defensive end, is going to spend at least part of the
spring at outside linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Miguel Fletcher of Alemany High has switched from
tailback to defensive back. True freshman tight end Jacob Rogers of
Oxnard, who enrolled in the spring, will also be used as a punter
in spring to back up Mike MacGillivray.
</P>
<P>
   Other previously reported changes include tight end Lonnie Ford
and quarterback John Fox to linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Soward, the only experienced wide receiver is
senior-to-be Windrell Hayes, who caught 24 passes last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the man now,'' Hackett said. ``He should catch more balls
than anybody else on the offense.''
</P>
<P>
   One player who will not participate in spring but is expected to
return to USC this summer is offensive lineman Faasea Mailo. A
part-time starter in 1996, Mailo is finishing up a two-year Mormon
mission in Japan and is expected to attend summer school at USC.
</P>
<P>
   USC will hold 15 practices spread out over the next four weeks,
with a public scrimmage scheduled for April 10 at Howard Jones
Field.

TRANSFER FROM BOSTON COLLEGE GIVES BUCKEYES A BIG BOOST
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ They knew this point guard was coming to Ohio
State, hard on the heels of the new coach, and they knew fast that
he would be a shot of adrenaline for a dying team.
</P>
<P>
   He and a bunch of walk-ons were killing the starters in practice
last year, the short muscular water bug who had followed Jim
O'Brien from Boston squirting through the first team's defense.
</P>
<P>
   They had heard his unusual name _ a derivation of ``uno''
because he was the first son _ and they had heard he was the Big
East rookie of the year and the most valuable player of its
tournament as a sophomore, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But they had no idea he was nuts until Scoonie Penn, the
transfer who played in practice with more ferocity than the team
showed in games, announced at the start of this season that Ohio
State was going to go from last in the Big Ten to the tournament
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Not the National Invitation Tournament, as O'Brien had hoped,
figuring his team might somehow finish above .500. No, Penn meant
the NCAA tournament, the one Ohio State had not sniffed for six
years but that now, with the Buckeyes facing Connecticut in the
Final Four on Saturday, features one of the most remarkable
turnarounds in college basketball history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach O'Brien told me to turn it down,'' Penn said, referring
to his talk. ``But I honestly felt that way. Last year, it was
tough, going 8-22 and knowing I couldn't help them out. We were a
young team and we just needed some experience. I watched them work
during the summer and they got experience last season. I just had
this feeling we could do something really good this season. I never
imagined it being this good.''
</P>
<P>
   Who could have? Certainly not O'Brien, the former Boston College
coach who sweated out a few weeks two years ago after he accepted
the Ohio State job while Penn decided what to do.
</P>
<P>
   A tightening of admission standards had scorched O'Brien's
recruiting efforts at BC and led to a bitter split with the
administration of his alma mater. Penn, after starting every game
as a freshman, had been ruled academically ineligible for the first
five games of his sophomore season.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the season, after Boston College had won the Big
East tournament and with his coach on the way to a place Penn knew
nothing about, he knew he was through, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very tough decision because it was my home area and
things were going very well for me at Boston College,'' Penn said.
``After seeing the direction Boston College was going in,'' the
future of the basketball program ``wasn't a direction I wanted to
be a part of.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn, from Salem, Mass., barely had a clue where Ohio State was
situated, let alone whether a kid who had the recognition of his
hometown could adjust to a strange place with a failing team.
Penn's decision, which forced him to sit out a year, meant
everything, O'Brien says. He is the only change in Ohio State's
starting lineup from last season.
</P>
<P>
   Penn is averaging 17 points a game and was named the Big Ten
player of the year. After he bruised his hip in the regular-season
finale against Penn State, he struggled in the conference
tournament, and Ohio State lost to Illinois. Penn, now recovered,
and Michael Redd make up one of the best backcourts in the nation.
They have scored more than half of Ohio State's points in the NCAA
tournament, 154 of 296.
</P>
<P>
   Against St. John's in the South Regional final, Penn outplayed
Erick Barkley, scoring 22 points and, with a subtle hand to
Barkley's hip, causing the turnover that clinched Ohio State's trip
here.
</P>
<P>
   Now Penn is the subject of a song on Columbus radio and has been
making statements that he is not leaving for the NBA, even though
he has been told he would be a first-round pick. His play dazzles
even his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every play he makes is `Wow!''' Redd said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the difference in that team from last year to this
year,'' Auburn coach Cliff Ellis said. ``He's not a good guard.
He's a great guard.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as Penn's ability to break a press and shoot were
important to Ohio State's resurrection, his attitude was more
critical. O'Brien arrived to find a group of moribund players, who
had practically come to accept losing.
</P>
<P>
   Penn changed that. He took some of the defensive attention off
Redd, who ceded his role as the offensive star to someone who could
get him into better position to score, and laid some responsibility
on his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Penn would not accept losing, not even in practice. He was
outspoken but endearing, quickly becoming a leader without
alienating those who had been there before him _ largely because he
already knew O'Brien's system better than the Buckeyes did.
</P>
<P>
   Redd says a number of the players thought they could make the
tournament, but only Penn had the guts to say so publicly. Here was
competitive fire that had been lacking at Ohio State for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a couple of years in a row, where losses are
piling up, there's a feeling, `That's what we do, we don't win
games.''' O'Brien said. ``He came with a totally different
approach.''

KPMG'S CANADIAN UNIT IS PREPARING TO BOLT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Concerned that their giant accounting firm is not staying
competitive at a time many companies have global operations, the
5,000 accountants and consultants working at KPMG &UR;  &LR; in Canada are
planning to move to the firm of Arthur Andersen, top partners at
both firms in Canada said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   If the merger of the two Canadian firms takes place as planned,
Arthur Andersen will become the largest accounting firm in Canada,
while KPMG will suffer a blow, possibly losing most of its Canadian
business.
</P>
<P>
   KPMG is now the second-largest accounting firm in Canada and
expects to have revenue of $682 million (Canadian), $452.3 million
(United States), this year.
</P>
<P>
   Upon hearing the news, Colin Sharman, the chairman of KPMG
International, issued a statement saying that the firm would
aggressively fight to keep its most valued Canadian clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not believe this action will have any measurable impact
on KPMG International,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   J. Spencer Lanthier, chairman of KPMG in Canada, said Thursday
that KPMG's top Canadian partners had decided to merge with Arthur
Andersens because of their frustrations that KPMG's hundreds of
offices worldwide were poorly connected, hurting the firm's ability
to serve multinational companies.
</P>
<P>
   For example, KPMG does not have a global e-mail system or voice
system that connects its professionals, as Arthur Andersen does,
although it is working on them. And, while Arthur Andersen operates
as a global partnership, KPMG International is a loose federation
of smaller partnerships in each country.
</P>
<P>
   ``KPMG has been structured as a federation of firms rather than
a global business,'' Lanthier said. ``Although KPMG International
embarked on a global restructuring program last year, we have had
concerns about the high cost of the reorganization and the number
of years it would take to complete.''
</P>
<P>
   Lanthier said that he thought most of the firm's clients in
Canada would move with the accountants and consultants to Arthur
Andersen.
</P>
<P>
   The merger must still be voted on by all partners at both
Canadian firms and be approved by Canadian regulators. The firms
plan to join their operations on Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Sharman of KPMG International said that he was surprised by
Thursday's decision by the 35 partners who manage KPMG's Canadian
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The incident was fostered by a leadership that may not be in
touch with the interests of most Canadian partners,'' Sharman said.
``We've already opened a dialogue with key practice leaders among
Canada's partners to insure that the most respected and valuable
portions of the entity remain within KPMG International. We will be
aggressive in preserving the practices and the clients that are
most important to KPMG.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharman said that the partners' decision might have been
prompted by the significant cost of financing the Canadian firm's
pension plan. The Canadians had also been unwilling to help pay for
the costs of uniting KPMG's global offices, he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Canadian firm had the lowest average net income per partner
of any KPMG firm in North or South America last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed Canadian merger is a boost for the international
operations of Arthur Andersen, which is battling its sister firm,
Andersen Consulting. The two Andersen firms make up the global
giant known as Andersen Worldwide. But Andersen Consulting wants to
take its thousands of consultants and become a separate firm.
</P>
<P>
   The last year, Arthur Andersen partners have been aggressively
courting other accounting firms, especially in countries like
Germany and Canada, where they do not have a significant presence.
</P>
<P>
   KPMG now has 5,300 employees in Canada, while Arthur Andersen
has 1,600.
</P>
<P>
   Under the firms' plans, Lanthier would become chairman and chief
executive of the new Arthur Andersen firm. Russel Robertson,
managing partner of Arthur Andersen in Canada, would become a
deputy chairman at the new firm.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, another crack in KPMG's global operations appeared
when many of KPMG's consultants in France left the firm to join the
French consulting practice of the Computer Sciences &UR;  &LR; Corp., which
is based in El Segundo, Calif.

WATTS ,  ESTES SHARE LEAD AT PLAYERS CHAMPIONSHIP
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. _ After his first three holes Thursday,
Brian Watts was already 4-over-par.
</P>
<P>
   What was he saying at that point?
</P>
<P>
   ``You probably can't print what I said,'' Watts said.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Watts, his anger became a catalyst. Playing his
last 15 holes in 8-under-par, and climbing to the top of a tightly
bunched leader board, Watts shared first place with Bob Estes after
Thursday's first round of the Players Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Watts and Estes shot 4-under-par 68s, one stroke better than
David Duval, Hal Sutton, and Joe Ozaki. Tiger Woods, Davis Love III
and Jeff Sluman were among nine players tied at 70.
</P>
<P>
   It was an eventful round at the TPC of Sawgrass, and the famous
island green at No. 17 was not surprisingly in the thick of things.
It was kind to some and cruel to others.
</P>
<P>
   Joey Sindelar (72) had a hole-in-one there using a sand wedge
off the tee. Greg Norman (72) tripled-bogeyed the hole, hitting
into the water to hurt what had been solid round. Nick Faldo (71)
played his strongest round in months, but he bogeyed both No. 17
and No. 18. And a frustrated Fred Couples (77) made par the hard
way at the 17th, hitting his first shot into the water, then
hitting his next shot from the tee directly into the cup.
</P>
<P>
   But for Watts, Thursday's blistering finish was the latest
example of his flair for the dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   At last year's British Open, Watts forced a playoff with the
eventual champion Mark O'Meara by hitting a seemingly impossible
shot at Royal Birkdale's 18th hole _ a 50-foot bunker shot, out of
a tough lie from an off-balance stance, that stopped less than a
foot from the hole to save par.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Watts pulled the neat trick of tying for the lead,
despite having an 8 on his card. That does not happen often on the
PGA Tour. And it said something for Watts' character that he
refused to fold after such a rugged start on a demanding course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 4-over, and then the miracle happened,'' said Watts,
describing his round. ``I tried not to get down on myself. The
worse thing that can happen is either I shoot in the 80s or I miss
the cut. I'm still going to live through the day, most likely.''
</P>
<P>
   Teeing off on the back nine, Watts immediately flirted with
disaster with a triple bogey at the par-5 11th, followed by a bogey
at the par-4 12th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like, `What a great start this is going to be,''' Watts
said.
</P>
<P>
   But over his final 15 holes, Watts played like the man who
finished second at last year's British Open, a performance that
earned him $309,260 and a place on the PGA Tour after five years on
the Japanese tour.
</P>
<P>
   Teeing off on the back nine, Watts began his comeback by making
four consecutive birdies, starting at No. 13. And when Watts made a
50-foot chip for birdie at No. 14, he figured his luck might be
changing.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a fun day for Estes, who made six birdies and only
two bogeys. Despite having only one tour victory, the 1994 Texas
Open, Estes is coming off a strong 1998, when he won a career-best
$987,930, including seven top 10 finishes.  &QL;

MARTIN IS DAY TO DAY
</HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When you're 2-23, hype is a ghost, unless judges
will allow the hyperextended left knee of point guard Darrick
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   This injury was accomplished near the benediction of Wednesday's
92-80 loss to Golden State at the Sports Arena. Thursday's MRI
revealed no serious damage, so Martin was given treatment and
listed as ``day to day.''
</P>
<P>
   After Thursday's workout at Carson, he accompanied the team to
Seattle, where tonight it will take on the unsettled SuperSonics.
Martin is scheduled for more treatment, and if all is well enough,
he'll be able to take on Sonic Gary Payton, considered by many
(those who factor in defense) to be the league's best point guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't know until about 7 (p.m.),'' Martin said of his
availability. ``It (the knee) was sore today. I was more scared
last night (Wednesday), because it jerked so fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Should Martin be unable to answer the gong, Troy Hudson will be
the lucky recipient of his first NBA start. Hudson arrived from
Planet CBA on Tuesday with a 10-day contract. He had three
rebounds, one assist, one turnover and no points in Wednesday's
five-minute cameo. Most of his time was spent chasing the vapor of
5-foot-3 Muggsy Bogues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be pretty unfair to make a determination on him after
that,'' Coach Chris Ford said. ``But he looked quick and strong.
Maybe he can really play; you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Hudson still may not know Ford's complete offensive catalog, but
does know he's prepared to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be ready to go,'' said Hudson, who feels confident of
improving upon his debut performance. ``It felt great to be back
out there, although I was a little shaky on offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, there's an epidemic. The Clippers scored just 13
points in Wednesday's fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Subhead No `F' for effort
</P>
<P>
   Despite their knack for collapsing, Ford remains pleased with
the attitude and effort demonstrated by his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been good,'' he said. ``They're trying to win
games. I'm proud of the way they continue to come to work.''
</P>
<P>
   The weakness du jour was Wednesday's inability to duplicate the
crisp and timely passing that led to Sunday's victory at Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent most of the workout going over our offense,'' Ford
said following Wednesday's practice, ``making sure the ball doesn't
die. We also added a few more options.''
</P>
<P>
   And failing to show up still is not an option.
</P>
<P>
   Subhead `Pike' not in peak form
</P>
<P>
   Eric Piatkowski attended Wednesday's practice, but a strained
right knee prevented the shooting guard from participating.
</P>
<P>
   Piatkowski's knee absorbed two nasty bumps in a recent game
against the Knicks and became a bit tender during the Golden State
game.
</P>
<P>
   He is listed as ``probable'' for tonight's tussle with Seattle.

TRIP TO BASKETBALL'S FINAL FOUR PUTS CONNECTICUT IN FRENZY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   STORRS, Conn. _ Faced with dark-tinted windows on the charter
bus packed with University of Connecticut basketball players, Steve
Rowe stood on tiptoes, pried open a vent, then stuck his video
camera in to catch some blurry players jostling in the aisles.
</P>
<P>
   Rowe, a machinist from Plainville, had made the hourlong drive
in the rain with his 11-year-old daughter, Chelsea, who began
shrieking for Khalid El-Amin, the star guard. As the bus lurched
away, Chelsea began crying so loudly that she could be heard above
the hundreds who had packed the sidewalk for Wednesday's send-off
to St. Petersburg, Fla., and the team's first trip to the Final
Four.
</P>
<P>
   She'll live. Husky fans have to be resilient. The stats, which
would elate most schools, merely taunt the UConn faithful: ranked
in the final top 10 for six of the last 10 seasons . . . a 1990s
record of 255-74 . . . one of only three schools with at least
seven appearances in 10 years in the Sweet 16 of the NCAA finals .
. . four trips to the Elite Eight.
</P>
<P>
   But until now, never the Final Four. A result is a state
possessed, a place where the Siberian husky has practically become
the state mascot and where hoops is the new common language.
</P>
<P>
   The signs are everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   _ The CBS television station in Hartford, which now calls itself
``Connecticut's Huskies station,'' has broadcast a half-hour
``March Magic'' special every night this week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Optimists, confident that the Huskies will win the semifinal
game on Saturday against Ohio State, are desperately trying to
unload tickets to a Rolling Stones concert in Hartford on Monday
night, when the final will be played.
</P>
<P>
   _ A lawmaker has called for an ``honorary state holiday,''
regardless of how the team does.
</P>
<P>
   _ Patrons of coach's, a sports bar in Hartford, have said they
expect to be at the bar by noon Saturday so they will be sure to
have seats for the 5:42 p.m. tipoff.
</P>
<P>
   _ The state's largest newspaper, The Hartford Courant, started a
front-page feature called ``Final Fourcasts,'' illustrated by an
ice-blue crystal ball. Prognosticators for Saturday's game have
included an actuary (UConn ``a slight favorite'' over Ohio State),
a meteorologist for a St. Petersburg television station (UConn
wins) and a psychic picked randomly from the Yellow Pages (UConn
loses).
</P>
<P>
   _ Throughout the tournament, Gov. John Rowland received updated
NCAA brackets in his daily news summary.
</P>
<P>
   After trying to play it cool all week, Rowland got swept along
and said Thursday that he would fly to St. Petersburg for the
games. As for the idea of statewide holiday, he offered to go one
better. ``Why not take the whole weekend?'' he asked. ``Forget just
Saturday. Let's make it Saturday through Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is not that unusual for cities to go a bit ga-ga when
the local team hits the NCAA jackpot, the UConn frenzy seems a
little broader, with little regard for where people actually went
to college or to their proximity to this tiny college town tucked
away in the rolling hills of eastern Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Part of it has to do with the fact that since 1997, when the
Whalers hockey team left for the Sun Belt, Connecticut has had no
professional sports franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Part of it has to do with the state's size; only Rhode Island
and Delaware are smaller. ``Everyone else thinks Connecticut's a
nothing state, so we stick together,'' said Lynn Czernicki, a
third-grade teacher in West Hartford who has attached four speakers
to her television set, the better to hear the Husky sneakers
squeak.
</P>
<P>
   And clearly part of it has to do with the vindication that many
fans feel after all the years of yearning and at-the-buzzer
heartbreak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always said, `We've got a great team _ they're going to
make it this time,' and then they choked,'' said Susan Killian, 28,
a member of the class of 1992 who is a technology marketer in
Manhattan. ``This should shut a lot of people up.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the campus in Storrs this week, coach Jim Calhoun
saluted the disappointed teams of previous years. ``The win on
Saturday was as much for them as it was for this present group,''
he said, referring to UConn's victory last week to secure a spot in
the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   But there was an edge to his voice in another interview. ``Maybe
people look at what you've done,'' he said, referring to reaching
the Final Four, ``as opposed to what you haven't done.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the basketball fever has also been stoked by
the women's team. This year, both the men and women were
simultaneously No. 1 in the nation for five weeks of the season.
Just a few hours before the men's triumph last Saturday, however,
the women were upset by Iowa State to finish the season 29-5.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Gramling, a UConn accounting professor, said that when
he visits other parts of the state for seminars and professional
meetings, people always walk up and start talking about basketball.
``I ask them what year they graduated, and then I find out they
didn't,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The school's reputation has spread beyond the state's borders.
Other schools have been overwhelmed by the UConn press entourage,
which has become known nationwide as ``the horde.'' The team's
press corps includes reporters from 15 daily newspapers, 5 of which
send two writers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Husky rooting section is releasing at least a decade of
pent-up partying. More than 1,000 people bought a $1,300 travel
package through the Alumni Association, which has chartered three
jets to go to St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   If the Huskies make it past Ohio State, and then beat their
opponent in the final, most likely the awesomely strong Duke Blue
Devils, the celebration on the campus seems likely to be limited
only by imagination and the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they won the Big East tournament, people burned sofas in
the quad,'' said Mike Longo, 21, a junior from South Windsor. ``I
can't imagine this weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   The university set aside 700 tickets for students, who were
issued lottery numbers. This week, officials posted a list of 350
winners (from reliable No. 10 to lucky No. 2086), who had the
chance to buy two tickets for $100 each.
</P>
<P>
   The list was as scrutinized as anxiously as draft numbers in an
earlier generation. Doug Rumanoff, 18, of Cheshire was a loser, but
a brother in Alpha Sigma Phi knew someone who did not want to use
his winning number and was willing to give it to someone else. ``A
connection,'' Rumanoff said triumphantly.
</P>
<P>
   Some students waited in line for three days for the chance to
buy any leftovers. A brick breezeway outside the gym became a Husky
City as students pitched tents and hauled in recliners and sofa
cushions. They were relieved to discover that Domino's delivers to
hallways.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Humphrey, 22, a senior from Stamford who spent the night in
the breezeway, bought a plane ticket to St. Petersburg last fall.
``I took a big leap of faith,'' he said. ``That's part of being a
Husky.''

VENUS WILLIAMS GAINS; AND YES, SO DOES SERENA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. _ It's not nice to jerk the defending
champion of the Lipton Championships around the court like a
wayward puppy on a leash, but that's precisely what Jana Novotna,
the 30-year-old defending Wimbledon champion, did Thursday to
18-year-old Venus Williams in the opening set of their titanic
2-hour-20-minute Lipton quarterfinal.
</P>
<P>
   For more than an hour, the veteran toyed with the teen-ager,
running her from corner to corner and yanking her rudely toward the
net only to waft a tempting but untouchable lob just over her
beaded head.
</P>
<P>
   For more than an hour, it seemed that the fourth-seeded Novotna
would stretch her reign over the sixth-seeded Williams to 4-0 and
that the Lipton would miss out on a double dose of Williams sisters
in Friday's semifinals and, horrors, be deprived of the potential
for a historic sister-sister finale Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams, who covets the chance to defend this title the way
she successfully retained her first career title last month in
Oklahoma City, refused to be treated like a novice. With her pride
and her title at stake, she cranked up the power in the second set,
banged her way to a 5-0 lead, and then completed her 5-7, 6-2, 6-3
comeback. She will next face Steffi Graf, who advanced when Lindsay
Davenport withdrew with a sore wrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually had to work for my points; that was a good thing, I
suppose,'' said Williams, who is fighting a cold and withdrew from
the doubles competition Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   In the upset-riddled men's field, the seventh-seeded Richard
Krajicek, the 1996 Wimbledon champion and the highest-seeded man
still in contention for this title, served himself into Saturday's
final with a 6-4, 6-2 dismantling of the 1999 Australian Open
runner-up, Sweden's 14th-seeded Thomas Enqvist. According to
Enqvist, you can't hit what you can't see. The 27-year-old Krajicek
served blurs on the first serve, winning 20 of 22 points, and
encore blurs on the second, dropping 8 of 27 points. Enqvist's
baselining instincts needed to be superhuman. Instead, he suffered
in silence for 1 hour 16 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel at the moment my game is going up, together with
my confidence,'' said Krajicek, who played himself into form by
downing top-ranked Pete Sampras. He served just nine aces but
produced them at the most opportune moments: his third and fourth
aces converted the first set and he blasted his ninth and final
bullet at match point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to take my hat off to Richard, of course,'' said
Enqvist, who encountered zero break chances. ``But I think I made
it a little too easy for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Graf's path to the semifinals became automatic after her
intended opponent, the second-seeded Davenport, abruptly withdrew
from contention, citing the left wrist sprain she incurred hitting
a two-handed backhand during practice five days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good thing for her that it's only the left hand, it's
nothing serious, but it makes it not easy if you have to withdraw
out of a quarterfinal; that's a stage where you don't want to
withdraw,'' said Graf, a five-time Lipton champion who has reached
the semifinals or better on all 11 visits here and is 2-1 against
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's other semifinal features the other Williams sister,
17-year-old Serena, who will test her tour-leading 15-match
unbeaten streak against Martina Hingis. The top-ranked Hingis has a
2-0 edge in their rivalry, but Venus Williams said the odds were
good for a Williams sister final on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serena's just come so far just in the past four weeks,'' she
said of her 16th-seeded sibling's back-to-back title spree.

METS' PITCHING MATH: ADD HERSHISER AFTER SUBTRACTING NOMO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JUPITER, Fla. _ One day after officially evicting Hideo Nomo
from their starting rotation, the New York Mets acquired another
former Los Angeles Dodger ace Thursday, signing Orel Hershiser to a
guaranteed one-year $2 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   With the start of the season just a week and a half away, both
moves can be considered fairly radical this late into camp. They
were made in an attempt to stabilize the back end of a pitching
rotation that has looked shakier and shakier as the spring has
progressed.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser's signing, coupled with Nomo's assignment to the minor
leagues on Wednesday, came amid indications that the Mets were
still interested in making another move to upgrade their starting
rotation, possibly by replacing the team's other struggling
Japanese starter, Masato Yoshii, before the season begins April 5.
</P>
<P>
   According to one person familiar with the Mets' scouting
interests this spring, the team has been taking long looks at a
pair of Seattle Mariners left-handers, Jeff Fassero and Jamie
Moyer, as well as the Oakland left-hander Kenny Rogers and a
Minnesota right-hander, Brad Radke. A Mariners scout was in
attendance here Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   By bringing in the 40-year-old Hershiser, the Mets add a pitcher
who can provide five or six innings a night and replace one in Nomo
who in less than a year with the Mets could not regain the form
that he had displayed with the Dodgers early in his career.
</P>
<P>
   The day culminated with a pair of scoreless innings from
Hershiser against the Montreal Expos here Thursday night in his
first appearance in a Mets uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser, who is 10 victories shy of 200 for his career, said
that contrary to popular opinion, he and his family love New York,
which was one reason he spurned higher offers from other teams.
Hershiser had gone to spring training with Cleveland but received
his release; Atlanta, Florida, Philadelphia and the Chicago Cubs
had also sought him.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Phillips and manager Bobby Valentine tried to dispel
any notions that they may have disagreed on the decision to
outright Nomo to the minor leagues. Phillips went so far as to ask
Valentine if he thought he had been undermined.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I did not think I was undermined,'' Valentine insisted
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   One high-ranking member of the organization who spoke on
condition of anonymity said that there was no rift between the
manager and the general manager but that there may have been some
disagreement as to how to proceed with Nomo, with Valentine hoping
that Nomo could have one more chance this spring to pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a timing thing,'' Valentine said, explaining that he
wanted Nomo to have one more start _ to have 10 more starts, for
that matter. But Valentine also said that Phillips asked him if he
needed to see Nomo pitch one more time before Phillips put Nomo on
waivers. And Valentine said he said no.
</P>
<P>
   Semantics aside, Nomo's agent, Don Nomura, said Thursday that he
and the pitcher were discussing whether to accept the assignment to
the minors. ``We still have until Saturday,'' Nomura said. The Mets
apparently believe that Nomo will accept the assignment rather than
declare free agency, which would exempt the Mets from paying him
this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets could still release Nomo. However, Phillips said that
he has been given permission by the team's owners to keep Nomo in
the minor leagues, even though he is scheduled to make $2.925
million this season.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether the Mets miscalculated in their
belief that they could resurrect Nomo's career. All spring long,
Nomo struggled with his control, as he had all of last season. Nomo
struggled mightily against Atlanta last Saturday night.

YAGUDIN CAPTURES GOLD MEDAL AT WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS, WEISS EARNS
BRONZE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELSINKI, Finland _ He still had a combination spin and a flying
spin remaining, but as soon as Aleksei Yagudin landed his last
triple jump cleanly Thursday night, he was already pumping his
fists.
</P>
<P>
   Yagudin knew. He knew despite the fact that four men had yet to
skate in the final group, including the younger Russian who had
beaten him in the short program and the Russian national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Tatyana Tarassova, his coach, knew, too, and she was hunched
over with emotion at rinkside as Yagudin, 19, put the finishing
touches on one of the finer free programs in world championship
history: a program that earned him the unanimous approval of the
nine judges and his second consecutive world title.
</P>
<P>
   Tarassova already had helped one teen-aged Russian with all the
jumps win the gold medal at the 1998 Olympics. But Ilya Kulik
elected to miss the major championships this season, and now, in
less than a year, Tarassova has helped an even better pupil refine
his self-expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``She added so many things, and the most important thing was
feeling all the music,'' Yagudin said. ``The jumps are the same.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, Yagudin landed eight triple jumps and a quadruple toe
loop tonight (the same total Kulik had in Nagano, Japan), and when
he stopped skating gracefully to music from the ``Lawrence of
Arabia'' soundtrack, he dropped to his knees and kissed the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Yagudin, who left his coach, Aleksei Mishin, to train with
Tarassova last year, received no mark lower than a 5.8 from the
judges, and he received a perfect 6.0 from the Polish judge for
technical merit.
</P>
<P>
   The silver medal went to Yevgeny Plushenko, the 16-year-old
Russian who won the short program but could not match his former
practice partner Yagudin's blend of explosiveness and artistry
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The bronze medal went to Michael Weiss, the 22-year-old American
whose performance in the free program was enough to vault him past
Elvis Stojko of Canada, the three-time world champion. It was
Weiss' first medal in a world championship.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Russians have won the first two gold medals awarded
in Helsinki, they are not the overwhelming favorite for a third in
the ice dancing. Friday, the French team of Marina Anissina and
Gwendal Peizerat won the original dance, finishing ahead of the
reigning world champions Anjelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsyannikov of
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The French team had never beaten the Russians in any phase of an
ice dance competition, but the two teams are now even heading into
Friday's decisive free dance.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Wednesday's pairs competition, in which the
Russian team of Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze won the
gold medal over the Chinese pair of Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo, there
were allegations of possible collusion among the judging panel.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian television network, CTV, has video footage showing
communication between a Ukrainian judge, Alfred Korytek, and a
Russian judge, Sviatoslav Babenko, during the competition. Such
communication is against International Skating Union rules, and the
footage was made available to the ISU pairs referee Hely Abbondati
on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Both Korytek and Babenko placed the Russians first and ranked
the top seven teams in the same order. Abbondati will file a report
to the ISU figure skating technical committee, which will then
review the conclusions and make a recommendation to the ISU
council, which could suspend the judges.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the two judges' votes, the Russians would still
have won the gold, because their first-place margin after the free
skating was 7-2.

EDITORIAL: THE MAYOR REACHES OUT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, March 26:
</P>
<P>
   New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has finally begun to reach
out to African-American leaders concerned over his administration's
handling of the Amadou Diallo killing. The mayor met this week with
Manhattan Borough President C. Virginia Fields, announced plans to
talk with state Comptroller H. Carl McCall and expressed through
his spokeswoman a desire to begin ``building bridges.''
</P>
<P>
   This is something of a breakthrough for an administration that
insisted for a long time that there were bridges aplenty, and only
a lack of politically objective black leaders willing to march
across them.
</P>
<P>
   This change represents a welcome turnabout by the mayor, and
black and Latino leaders should reject the Rev. Al Sharpton's
attempt to delay the meetings. McCall was right to stick with his
plan to meet with Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   City Council Speaker Peter Vallone deserves praise for helping
to broker the meeting between Ms. Fields and the mayor, a
discussion that apparently was cordial and involved a sincere
exchange of views. But the fact that Giuliani needed a high-level
mediator to get him to sit down with the highest-ranking black
official in New York City is a sign of how far he still has to go.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, the mayor has already met privately with church
and youth groups in the minority community. He says he intends to
continue those meetings and take unannounced neighborhood walks.
There is value in these activities and in more public outreach
efforts that show he is listening to people who live in the
communities where resentment of the police is highest.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir has also increased his
outreach, meeting with a group of black ministers that included an
administration critic, the Rev. Calvin Butts, and attending a City
Council meeting on the shooting of Diallo, a West African
immigrant, by police officers.
</P>
<P>
   That does not wipe out the dreadful lapse of judgment Safir
showed in trying to duck the Council meeting while jaunting to
California on a private jet paid for by a Revlon executive.
Although Revlon does not directly do business with the city, the
commissioner's acceptance of expensive transportation and hotel
rooms is too reminiscent of the old, discredited street-cop
practice of taking free meals or sandwiches from friendly
neighborhood grocers and restaurateurs.
</P>
<P>
   The city corporation counsel will decide whether Safir broke any
ethics rules by his conduct. Meanwhile, the commissioner has plenty
of opportunities to demonstrate his sincerity in attempting to
respond to community complaints about the police.
</P>
<P>
   Under this administration, the Police Department has made a
practice of keeping as much information as possible from the press
and public. Like Giuliani, Safir's efforts to win the trust of his
critics will be more successful if he works in the open.

NEWS OF THE GREAT WHITE WAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   (af)

<P>
   In what union officials called a victory for directors' rights,
the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers said it had
completed an out-of-court settlement with a theater in Florida over
its production of ``Love! Valour! Compassion!'' The union said the
theater had used the work of Joe Mantello, the play's director on
Broadway, without his permission.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, between the union and the Caldwell Theater Co.
of Boca Raton, ends a three-year legal battle. As part of the
agreement, Mantello is to receive about $7,000 as well as a written
acknowledgment that the theater had inadvertently used his work
without his permission.
</P>
<P>
   William McCarthy, the development director and lawyer for the
Caldwell, confirmed the settlement but said it was premature to
comment on it. While the agreement does not resolve the murky
questions of how much of a director's work is protected by law, Ted
Pappas, the president of the union, said he hoped it would set a
precedent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want our work to be done,'' he said. ``But we want to be
paid for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The case began in March 1996 when Mantello was told by a friend
that the Caldwell's production of ``Love! Valour!'' bore an uncanny
resemblance to the Broadway staging. Mantello saw the show and
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Mantello later filed a federal action, contending that when a
theater obtains rights to do a play, the director's staging isn't
included. In July 1997 a federal judge upheld the complaint and
cleared the way for a trial. But this week's settlement avoids that
route.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never been my point to pull apart the collaborative
process of putting together a play,'' Mantello said. ``But a
director can provide original elements to a production and deserves
to be compensated for them.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Happiness? Not Yet &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Producers of ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown''
have seen the show's revenues sharply decline in the last few
weeks, and so this week they are undertaking an unusual gambit,
sacrificing evening performances in favor of a more child-friendly
schedule and beginning a pricey advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The effort was formally announced Thursday as producers staged a
news conference complete with representatives of Actors Equity and
the cast singing a version of a song from the show, ``My New
Philosophy,'' with revised lyrics to reflect the production's
revised schedule. (Ah, publicity!)
</P>
<P>
   But the strategy has been in the works since producers saw the
weekly ticket sales for the $4.2 million production fall at the end
of February. Last week the show's gross was $194,550, which
represents a loss of about $30,000. That is not crippling, but not
good.
</P>
<P>
   To counter this, the show petitioned and received special
permission two weeks ago from Equity and the other theater unions
to allow a third Saturday performance, at 11 a.m., in addition to
two on Sunday and a Thursday matinee. (The show will be dark Monday
through Wednesday.) The idea is to target the show's demographic:
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids get up at 7 a.m. on Saturdays,'' said Mick Leavitt, one
of the show's producers. ``Eleven is matinee time for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The show also spent some $400,000 on its first television
campaign, buying time on cable channels like Nickelodeon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our feeling is we did something very risky: we opened in early
February,'' Leavitt said. ``It's like wearing a T-shirt in winter.
But we're looking forward to starting this campaign, and finally
getting into the tourist season.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Real Prize: Survival &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Producers banking on the magic of a Tony Award may
want to consider this: With Sunday's closing of ``Titanic,'' which
won the prize for best musical in 1997, there is only one survivor
of the bumper crop of musicals that opened that year.
</P>
<P>
   Which one? ``Jekyll and Hyde,'' which was shut out at the 1997
awards, celebrates its 800th performance Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Titanic'' won five Tonys; also nominated for best musical of
1997 were the long-departed ``Steel Pier,'' ``The Life'' and ``Juan
Darien.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Marge
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Julie Kavner replaces Mo Gaffney in Paula
Vogel's ``Mineola Twins'' on Tuesday, she is stepping into Ms.
Gaffney's sizable shoes, literally, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm wearing three Dr. Scholl's innersoles,'' Ms. Kavner said.
``They're too big. But there's something kind of nice in the
literalness of it.'' Ms. Kavner's arrival in the show at the
Roundabout Theater was an unexpected twist resulting from Ms.
Gaffney's pregnancy. Ms. Kavner didn't see it coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't read the play, and I knew nothing about Paula Vogel's
style,'' she said. ``That's why I'm waking up at 3 in the
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kavner, who splits her time between homes on eastern Long
Island and in Los Angeles, has just begun her 11th season as the
voice of Marge on the animated television series ``The Simpsons.''
While she calls her cartoon persona ``the greatest gig in
America,'' she said she was happy to be onstage for a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being animated, you only have control over the performance of
the voice,'' she said. ``You have no control over the body
movement. I prefer to have the whole enchilada.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Along the Way &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Boneau-Bryan Brown, the theatrical publicity agency, recently
received a fax from a reporter asking for press seats to a play
called ``Near.'' The staff was flummoxed; the agency handles no
such show. But after several minutes, one employee discerned the
true title the intrepid journalist sought: ``Closer.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Expect a few aching bones on this crew. Producers for ``Night
Must Fall'' said Thursday they will close at the Lyceum after the
matinee on April 11, pack up and aim to reopen a mere two days
later at the Helen Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Ancestral Voices,'' a new play by A.R. Gurney, will receive
staged readings at the Mitzi E. Newhouse at Lincoln Center on
Sunday and Monday nights through June 7. Mary Louise Wilson stars.

PARAPLEGIC SECOND AT LOS ALAMITOS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   O.J. Waddell achieved a larger victory when he drove an
8-year-old mare to second place in a $2,700 harness race Thursday
night at Los Alamitos in Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell, 37, became the first paraplegic to compete in a
parimutuel race, capping a 17-year licensing battle with California
authorities and other drivers, who had expressed safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I showed them that I do belong,'' said Waddell, a
former Fontana High wide receiver who lost the use of his legs in a
1979 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Starting from the rail at 10-1 odds, Waddell and the pacer Hutt
Girl followed 3}-length winner Canterbury Tower and driver Steve
Desomer throughout the incident-free race on a sloppy track.
</P>
<P>
   Hutt Girl finished 2\ lengths ahead of third-place Kudos for
Ahab, driven by Jim Lackey, who had criticized Waddell's quest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Lackey) told me I did a good job, and that meant a lot,''
Waddell said. &QL;

   MICROSOFT OFFER TO SETTLE RECEIVES A COOL RECEPTION
</P>
<P>
   State and federal officials were dismissive of Microsoft's
proposal to settle its antitrust suit, but they said the two sides
would meet for negotiations, probably beginning on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of U.S. District Court has asked
both sides to try to settle the case. As a result, officials said,
even though the Justice Department and state attorneys general
question whether the Microsoft proposal is serious, they feel
compelled to show a good-faith effort.

   UNITED AIRLINES PARENT NAMES CHIEF
</P>
<P>
   James Goodwin was appointed chairman and chief executive of UAL,
the parent of United Airlines. The decision by UAL's board ended a
five-month search that had narrowed the choice to Goodwin and a top
executive at General Motors. Goodwin appears to have had the edge
because he was an insider and had cultivated strong relations with
United's unions. He was the unanimous choice of the six-member
executive committee.

<P>
   STOCKS RALLY ON STRONG EARNINGS
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average surged 169.55 points, or 1.75
percent, to 9,836.39, and the Nasdaq composite index climbed 69.52
points, or 2.94 percent, to 2,434.80, as investors reacted to a
profit surge at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. The Standard and Poor's
500-stock index gained 21.40 points, or 1.69 percent, to 1,289.99.

   Treasury prices sagged as investors awaited next week's Federal

   DIABETES PILL COMES UNDER SCRUTINY
</P>
<P>
   The market for oral diabetes drugs will soon become more
competitive _ but just how competitive may depend in large part on
what action regulators take on Warner-Lambert's Rezulin, a popular
pill that has been linked to 28 deaths and seven liver transplants.
</P>
<P>
   NASD PANEL PROPOSES CHANGES
</P>
<P>
   The board of the National Association of Securities Dealers,
which governs Nasdaq, approved a rule that would allow officials to
halt trading in a stock in response to market news or rumors, even
if the officials cannot immediately reach the company's executives.
It also proposed steps intended to rein in excesses among day
traders and cut fees that investors pay for real-time stock
quotations.

   AUDITORS IN CANADA TO JOIN RIVAL
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that their accounting firm is not staying competitive
at a time many companies have global operations, the 5,000
accountants and consultants working at KPMG in Canada are planning
to move to the firm of Arthur Andersen, partners at both firms
said.
</P>

   BRAZILIAN COMPANIES BORROW AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   Although the mid-January devaluation of Brazil's currency, the
real, initially left foreign investors wary, a handful of Brazilian
companies have resumed borrowing in dollars on global debt markets.
Among them are Banco Bradesco, one of the nation's largest banks,
and the Brazilian unit of Citibank.
</P>
<P>
   The real's devaluation made money for banks that anticipated the
move, like Banco Matrix of Brazil and Chase, JP Morgan and Citibank
in the United States.
