<HEADLINE> China Reacts to Asian Financial Crisis Responsibly: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- China has responded to the Asian
financial crisis in a responsible way by having kept its promise
not to devalue the Chinese currency while deepening reform and
continuing its opening-up policy, a senior Chinese bank official
said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
China's National People's Congress has set out macroeconomic
targets for 1998, with the GDP growth rate at 8 percent, Governor
of the State Development Bank of China Chen Yuan told a seminar on
the Asian financial crisis held before the Asian Development Bank
begins its annual meeting here in Geneva from April 29 to May 1.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that China's achievements will not only benefit China
itself but also contribute to economic recovery and stability in
Asia. To attain above targets, Chen said, China intends to adopt
the following measures:
</P>
<P>
-- Domestic demand will be stimulated through nurturing new
economic powerhouse. Target growth rate of fixed asset investment
is more than 10 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Key areas of investment include agricultural water conservancy,
energy, transportation, telecommunication, environmental
conservation, industries with high and new technology and housing
construction.
</P>
<P>
-- Prudential regulation and oversight will be further
strengthened over the financial system.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China (PBC) will be restructured to
strengthen its supervisory capacity. To minimize interference from
local governments, existing branches of the PBC will be
consolidated to establish new branches which have jurisdiction
over more than one provincial area.
</P>
<P>
China's Ministry of Finance will issue 270-billion-yuan worth
of special bond, whose proceeds will be used to boost the capital
base of banks with the aim of achieving a capital adequacy ratio of
8 percent by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
-- Equilibrium in balance of payment and stability in exchange
rate will be maintained.
</P>
<P>
China aims to exceed 345 billion U.S. dollars in its foreign
trade this year by taking measures in four areas: to slash the
domestic cost of export and enhance external competitiveness, to
rationalize the composition of export, to expand and diversify
the export market and to promote export by resorting to
globally-accepted economic incentives, including an increase in
the access by exporter to bank credit and improvement in the tax
rebate system.
</P>
<P>
-- The policy of opening up in the economic field will continue
to be upheld.
</P>
<P>
This process will not be slowed down due to the Asian financial
crisis. On the contrary, the crisis makes China realize that it has
to exert greater efforts in preparation for full convertibility of
the Chinese currency.
</P>
<P>
China will license more foreign financial institutions to open
offices in China.
</P>
<P>
As another sign of China's continuous economic opening-up, a
package of tariff reduction plans, to slash the arithmetic average
tariff rate on industrial import to 10 percent by the year of
2005, has recently been submitted to the World Trade Organization.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Will Revive Vigor, Tung Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The worst effects of the
financial turmoil are now over and after a period of adjustment,
Hong Kong will surely regain all its vigor, Chief Executive of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Tung Chee Hwa said
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing SAR deputies to the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), Tung said that since the latter
half of 1997, Hong Kong economy and Hong Kong people have been
suffering from the regional financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Therefore topping the agenda of the SAR government is to take
all necessary measures, such as slashing taxes and increasing
public investment, to get Hong Kong economy out of the straits as
soon as possible and at the same time to alleviate the pains felt
by Hong Kong people and recover their confidence in the city, the
SAR leader said.
</P>
<P>
Tung noted that Hong Kong's current situation ranks best among
Southeast Asian countries and regions. With the approaching of a
new round of economic growth on the Chinese mainland, the
economic hinterland of Hong Kong, and strong support from the
Central People's Government, he added, "we have every reason to be
fully confident of Hong Kong's future."
</P>
<P>
Finally, he called upon the CPPCC deputies to make joint
efforts with the SAR government and people from all walks of life
in Hong Kong to tide over the current difficulties and create a
better future for Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Intra-Afghan Peace Talks Still in Deadlock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The intra-Afghan peace talks
between the Taliban and the rival Northern Alliance still made no
major breakthrough Tuesday owing to differences between the two
sides on the definition of a proposed Ulema Commission.
</P>
<P>
Assistant General Secretary of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC) Ibrahim Saleh Bakar told reporters here after the
conclusion of third-day talks that the OIC and the United Nations
had made two proposals Tuesday in a bid to promote the on-going
peace talks between the two Afghan warring factions.
</P>
<P>
However, Bakar did not elaborate on the two proposals.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban representative based in Islamabad, Abdul Hakim,
said the Taliban accepted one of the two proposals, but he also
did not disclose what these proposals are.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Taliban delegation to the peace talks Abdul Wakeel
told reporters that "we are still insisting on the formation of
the Ulema Commission."
</P>
<P>
"Only qualified Ulema (religious scholars), or typical
religious leaders, can be included in the Ulema Commission," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Northern Alliance suggested that professors and
teachers should also be included in the Ulema Commission.
</P>
<P>
There will be no discussions on the Ulema issue Wednesday,
Wakeel said, adding that "if the Northern Alliance want to
continue the talks, they should clearly respond to our proposals."
</P>
<P>
He said that regrettably "the opposition was not accepting our
proposals and they are prolonging the talks."
</P>
<P>
Wakeel also said the talks may achieve some progress if the
Northern Alliance come up with a clear response to the Taliban's
proposals on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The intra-Afghan peace talks, which began here on Sunday, are
the first face-to-face encounter between the Taliban and the
Northern Alliance in more than a year. The talks are scheduled to
continue Wednesday morning.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Federation of
Trade Unions (HKFTU) gave a reception here Tuesday to celebrate
its 50th birthday and the upcoming May Day.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Chief Executive
Tung Chee Hwa was present at the reception.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the reception, Lee Chark Tin, president of the
HKFTU, said that after 50 years of development, there are now 134
trade unions with some 270,000 members in the HKFTU.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of the federation in April 1948, the HKFTU
has been upholding its patriotic position and sticking to its aim
of serving the workers, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
The federation has won the trust and support of grassroots
masses and the recognition and acceptance of various classes in
Hong Kong, Lee noted.
</P>
<P>
After Hong Kong's return to China on July 1, 1997, the overall
situation in Hong Kong is very good and Hong Kong remains
prosperous and stable as the policies of "one country, two
systems," "Hong Kong People governing Hong Kong" and a high degree
 of autonomy have been successfully implemented, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
He said the recent Asian financial turmoil has affected the
workers' lives. But with the effort of the Hong Kong people, under
the leadership of the SAR government and with support from the
state, the temporary difficulties will surely be overcome, Lee
stressed.
</P>
<P>
At the reception, Chief Executive Tung expressed his respect to
 the labor sector, which he said has contributed a lot to the
current achievements of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Tung said the SAR government is concerned over the loss and
pain caused to citizens by the recent Asian financial turmoil. He
stressed that the government will try its best to overcome the
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Tung noted that the fundamentals of Hong Kong are good and with
the support of the state, the economy of Hong Kong will recover
soon and Hong Kong's future will be better.
</P>
<P>
Among the about 1,000 guests at the reception were SAR
government officials, delegates of the All China Federation of
Trade Unions and the Federation of Trade Unions of Guangdong
Province and representatives of trade unions from Macao.

<HEADLINE> Re-exports up, Domestic Exports, Imports Down in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The value of Hong Kong's
re-exports recorded moderate growth in March 1998 while that of
imports and domestic exports registered year-on-year decreases.
</P>
<P>
The value of total exports gained 2.9 percent over a year
earlier to reach 108.6 billion HK dollars (13.9 billion
U.S. dollars), as demonstrated by figures from the Census and
Statistics Department Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Of this total, re-exports accounted for 94.1 billion HK dollars
(12.1 billion U.S. dollars), up 3.7 percent, while domestic
exports lost 2.1 percent to 14.5 billion HK dollars (1.9 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The value of imports dipped 3.5 percent to 123.6 billion HK
dollars (15.8 billion U.S. dollars), thus resulting in a visible
trade deficit of 15 billion HK dollars (1.9 billion U.S. dollars),
equivalent to 18 percent of the value of imports in the month.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of 1998, the value of total exports was
lower by one percent over the same quarter last year. Of this
total, the value of re-exports increased marginally by 0.1 percent
while that of domestic export dropped by 7.4 percent. Meanwhile,
the value of imports registered a decrease of 5.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Over the same period, a visible trade deficit of 32.6 billion
HK dollars (4.2 billion U.S. dollars), or 9.5 percent of the value
of imports, was recorded. This was smaller than the deficit of
48.2 billion HK dollars (6.2 billion U.S. dollars) or 13 percent
of the value of imports, recorded a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Introduces New Policy to Public Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 28 (Xinhua) -- South Africa launched a new
policy on affirmative action Tuesday to accelerate the creation
of a racially representative public service, South African Press
Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The new policy, put forth in a white paper, requires all
public service entities, including municipalities and
parastatals, set up affirmative action policies containing
numeric targets and time frames, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The government's current target is that the public service's
management includes at least 50 percent black, 30 percent female,
and two percent disabled people by 2000, director-general of the
Public Service and Administration Department, Paseka Ncholo, said
at the launching of the policy.
</P>
<P>
These targets would be reviewed and reset by the end of 2000
and every three years thereafter.
</P>
<P>
Every manager, supervisor and human resource practitioner
would be held responsible for implementing affirmative action
plans in national goverment departments and provincial
administrations, according to the white paper.
</P>
<P>
Ncholo said no excuses would be tolerated and that heads of
departments and supervisors failing to implement the new policy
could face dismissal.
</P>
<P>
The public service commission and the Public Service
Department would review the departments' progress in achieving
their targets, and would report to parliament, he said.
</P>
<P>
Public Service Minister Zola Skweyiya said affirmative action
would be one of the criteria used when evaluating the performance
of directors-general.
</P>
<P>
Skweyiya said the move was to ensure that the public service
became representative of the society it served. Black people
accounted for over three quarters of the country's population.
 ` "The public service has always suffered from a lack of
legitimacy and it is hoped that having a public service with
which the majority of citizens can identify will overcome this,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> France Urges U.N. to Make Political Gesture Toward Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- France Tuesday called on the United
Nations to make a political gesture toward Iraq by recognizing the
destruction of nuclear materials by Iraq, which will lead to the
first step in lifting sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"A majority of the members of the Security Council have agreed
to recognize the progress accomplished in the nuclear field and we
hope that the countries most reserved over this will make a decision
in this direction," said French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne
Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
Russia has called on the Security Council to adopt a resolution
closing the file of nuclear disarmament in Iraq, and thus take the
first step in lifting sanctions against Baghdad imposed since the
invasion of Kuwait by Iraqi troops in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The International Atomic Energy Agency said in a recent report
that the U.N. inspectors have found neither nuclear equipment nor
materials that are banned by the U.N. in Iraq, nor any U.N.-banned
activities in making nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
It was based on this report that Russia has made such a request
at the U.N.
</P>
<P>
"France hopes that a resolution will be adopted the most
rapidly which will remind Iraq of its obligations (in the field of
disarmament)," said the French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations should continue to control nuclear inspections
in Iraq, instead of limiting or reducing them, she said.
</P>
<P>
"It is not a question of reducing the controls nor limiting the
inspections.... The methods of control are the same concerning the
visits of inspectors, the supervision and control of imports of
materials for double usage," she added.

<HEADLINE> Intalsat Urges Africa to Broaden Technology Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The International Satellite
(Intalsat) Tuesday urged African governments to broaden their
technology base to enhance economic development.
</P>
<P>
Diretor-General of the organization Irving Goldstein, who
arrived here Tuesday to attend the annual general meeting of
Africa group one, said improved telecommunications is key to the
economic development of every country.
</P>
<P>
He said the improved telecommunications should not be
restricted to urban areas but should cover all parts of the
country so that all can benefit.
</P>
<P>
Goldstein stressed the need to improve infrasturcture, saying
that it is vital to development.
</P>
<P>
Africa has been fairing well in the development of new
technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
The director-general promised to give African countries the
tools to develop new technology.
</P>
<P>
He refuted the notion that Africa has been made a dumping
ground for outdated technology from the west.
</P>
<P>
The Intalsat official said the kind of technology being used
in Africa is the same as those in developed countries.

<HEADLINE> Thai Senator Calls for Global Financial Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A Thai senator called here Tuesday
for global financial reform, saying the current Asian financial
crisis is not just a crisis in Asia and international cooperation
is needed.
</P>
<P>
"Global finance as being practised today is in need of reform,"
said Narongchai Akrasanee at a seminar on the Asian financial
crisis held before the Asian Development Bank (ADB) begins its
annual meeting here in Geneva from April 29 to May 1.
</P>
<P>
After recalling what had happened to Thailand following the
financial crisis, which started in Thailand last July and spread
to many parts of Asia, Akrasanee stressed that experiences with
the financial crisis in Thailand should be taken as a lesson in
economic development and in reviewing global financial order.
</P>
<P>
"This task will have to be performed by major industrialized
countries and the relevant international organizations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious that a developing country cannot introduce
financial sector reform by itself," Akrasanee said. "International
cooperation is needed."

<HEADLINE> UK Drugs Education Plan Attacked by Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Teachers in Britain criticized the
government plan to give children education about the dangers of
drugs from the age of five, saying the government was dumping
social problems on to schools, said UK media reports Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women
Teachers was quoted as saying that it was unrealistic to expect
schools to fill the moral vacuum created by so many different
forces at work in society. Dumping on schools was a cop-out by
government and society, it added.
</P>
<P>
The plan was unveiled in a White Paper published Monday and was
part of a coordinated strategy aimed at reducing the growing
number of young people in the country on drugs.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that 48 percent of all children will have tried
drugs before they are 20 although few become addicted.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, the national curriculum should include
lessons introducing pupils aged five to the dangers of drugs.
</P>
<P>
The association also accused Prime Minister Tony Blair of
setting a bad example by courting pop stars as he invited them who
are associated with the drugs scene to receptions at No. 10
Downing Street.
</P>
<P>
Some other organizations, such as the Family and Youth Concern
and the Conservative Family Institute, also attacked the plan,
saying that introducing drug education to five-year-olds is a
desperate measure, which at worst is simply going to open up
appetites and desires as they get older.

<HEADLINE> Britain Calls for Peace Settlement in Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The British government Tuesday
called on the international community to encourage the Sudanese
government and rebel groups to reach a peace settlement in the
ravaged African country.
</P>
<P>
British International Development Secretary Clare Short, whose
country is the current European Union (EU) president, openly
criticized the Sudanese government for deliberately causing
starvation by blocking international aid.
</P>
<P>
"The trouble is that the leadership of neither side wants
peace. There's plenty of aid available. The problem is that the
government deliberately won't let it through and is deliberately
causing starvation," Short told BBC television.
</P>
<P>
Short stressed that the EU should become more involved in the
international efforts in bringing peace back to Sudan and Britain
favored a United Nations initiative to put pressure on the
government and rebels.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone should try harder to put pressure on the two sides to
get a peaceful settlement. We need far more international pressure
on both sides to come to the table and reach a peaceful
settlement," she added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that peace talks between the Sudanese
government and the Sudan People's Liberation Army have been
postponed to May 4 from April 30.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Police Rapped for Shooting Student </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's opposition party, the
United Parties (UP) Tuesday condemned police for blocking
University of Zimbabwe students who sought to air their
grievances through demonstration last week.
</P>
<P>
Publicity and Information Secretary Isaac Manyemba said in a
statement that the use of live firearm by the police during
peaceful demonstrations, resulting in the shooting of one student
last week, was a serious violation of human rights, the Zimbabwe
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The third year bachelor of science student Morememories
Chawira, who was shot in the neck, is in the intensive care unit
of Parirenyatwa Hospital in Harare.
</P>
<P>
Manyemba said police should go back to their primary duties of
protecting life and property.
</P>
<P>
"The incessant use of armed policemen by the present
government against innocent civilians is an indicative of an
unpopular leadership which wants to prolong its tenure of
office," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Zimbabwe National Debate Association Tuesday
urged the government to consider dialogue as a way of solving
problems at the University of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Executive Director of the association Karauone Chihwayi said
in a statement that security agencies should not use live
ammunition during demonstrations as this violated people's
constitutional right to protest peacefully.
</P>
<P>
"Our organization unreservedly condemns the shooting incident
by the police of the University of Zimbabwe student on Wednesday
April 22, 1998," said Chinwayi.
</P>
<P>
He also blamed police for causing the death of five people at
the national sports stadium during the independence celebrations
on April 18 in Harare.
</P>
<P>
The high court issued an order Monday allowing the students to
march into the city of Harare Wednesday in solidarity with
Chawira.

<HEADLINE> Israel Liberalizes Foreign Currency Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Israel unveiled a foreign
currency liberalization program on Tuesday, lifting most of the
restrictions on currency exchange in the country.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Finance Minister
Yaakov Neeman and Governor of Bank of Israel Jacob Frenkel
announced the program at a joint news conference held here.
</P>
<P>
This marked the completion of the process of removing
foreign-currency restrictions on Israeli residents - individuals
and businesses - which started at the end of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The program allows Israeli residents complete freedom to engage
in transactions of both foreign and local currencies, and to invest
abroad, including in land and real estate. So far such investments
were controlled by the government.
</P>
<P>
The program also abolishes the restriction on holding foreign
currency in cash; payments in foreign currency will be permitted
in cash or by check.
</P>
<P>
But there does remain a short list of restrictions, such as on
direct investments abroad by pension funds, provident funds and
insurance companies, which are expected to be removed in the next
stage of the liberalization process.
</P>
<P>
This is because of the apprehension that foreign investors
would practice financial manipulation which would shake Israel's
economy.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told the news conference that the program will
simplify transactions and expand opportunities for Israeli
residents in the management of their assets and liabilities
portfolios.
</P>
<P>
Neeman said the program is one of the key steps in Israel's
integration into the global economy.
</P>
<P>
He said that it will thus encourage foreign investment in
Israel's economy, help to boost growth and create employment, and
open new channels for investment abroad and for domestic savings.
</P>
<P>
The liberalization measures will take effect after the Israeli
Knesset (parliament) approves them in a few days.

<HEADLINE> U.N., OIC Suggest New Form of Ulema Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations and the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) have suggested a new
way of forming a proposed Ulema (religious scholars) Commission
for Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
According to informed sources here Tuesday, the United Nations
and the OIC, which are co-chairing the on-going intra-Afghan peace
talks, proposed that religious scholars from other Muslim
countries be selected to form the Ulema Commission if the Taliban
and the Northern Alliance could not sort out their differences on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
The intra-Afghan peace talks between the two Afghan warring
factions still made no major breakthrough on the third day Tuesday
owing to differences between the two sides on the definition of
the Ulema Commission.
</P>
<P>
Assistant General Secretary of the OIC Ibrahim Saleh Bakar told
 reporters after the conclusion of third-day peace talks that the
United Nations and the OIC had made two proposals in a bid to
promote the talks.
</P>
<P>
however, Bakar did not elaborate on the two proposals.
</P>
<P>
The informed sources told Xinhua that one of the two proposals
is believed to be concerning the composition of the Ulema
Commission.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the two Afghan warring factions still
seem to be in deadlock as the two sides are insisting on their
respective positions on the Ulema issue.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Taliban delegation, Adbul Wakeel, told
reporters late Tuesday afternoon that "we are still insisting on
the formation of the Ulema Commission."
</P>
<P>
"Only qualified Ulema (religious scholars), or typical
religious leaders, can be included in the Ulema Commission," he
added.
</P>
<P>
However, the rival Northern Alliance held that professors and
teachers should also join the commission.
</P>
<P>
Wakeel said there will be no discussions on the Ulema issue
Wednesday when the talks continue.
</P>
<P>
"If the Northern Alliance want to continue the talks, they
should clearly respond to our proposals," he said.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Government Survives No-Confidence Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Belgian government survived
Tuesday a no-confidence vote triggered by the temporary escape of
a convicted child rapist and killer.
</P>
<P>
The parliament voted 81-64 with one abstention against the
no-confidence call made by the opposition parties.
Parliamentarians of the opposition voted for a dismissal of the
current government.
</P>
<P>
The call was made last Thursday when Marc Dutroux, a convicted
paedophile still waiting for trial, managed to run away from a
pre-trial hearing and remained at large for more than three hours
before being shot and recaptured by police.
</P>
<P>
The incident rocked Jean-Luc Dehaene's center-left coalition
government, of which the deputy prime minister who also served as
interior minister as well as justice minister resigned to take the
responsibility while Prime Minister Dehaene dismissed Tuesday
another high-ranking official.
</P>
<P>
Dehaene announced in Tuesday's parliamentary session that he
was dismissing Willy Deridder, chief of the country's gendarme or
armed police force.
</P>
<P>
Deridder had served in that post since November 1989.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also promised to further reform the
country's police and justice systems by further separating their
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
Dehaene has nominated Louis Tobback for outgoing Deputy Prime
Minister and Interior Minister Johan Vande Lanotte and chose Tony
van Parys to replace Justice Minister Stefaan de Clerck.
</P>
<P>
Vande Lanotte and de Clerck handed in their resignations after
Dutroux managed to run loose from only one police guard.
</P>
<P>
Dutroux was charged with raping and killing four of the six
young girls he had abducted in mid-1996 when a nationwide child
sex ring was exposed to rock the nation.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Richard Butler, executive
chairman of the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in
charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, Tuesday
called for full cooperation from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Butler said that if Iraq keeps its
promises and gives the UNSCOM full cooperation, the UNSCOM can do
a competent, honest and quick job in the inspection of Iraq's
prohibited weapons.
</P>
<P>
Butler was responding to the UNSCOM's latest report to the
Security Council of the United Nations which covers the period of
the past six months.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the report, Butler said that during this period,
there had been a very difficult time between Iraq and the UNSCOM,
which resulted in two crises in the inspection of Iraq's weapons.
</P>
<P>
Butler said that due to the crises, there had been no virtual
progress made in the verification and Iraq failed to provide the
UNSCOM with new documents about its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM had achieved some progress in its inspection work in
the recent weeks because of the cooperation given by Iraq, and the
inspection could be finished quickly if Iraq provided the UNSCOM
with all the documents it wanted to verify, he said.

<P>
LUANDA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations observers and
political experts would continue to stay in Angola to help
maintain the hard-won peace and rebuild the economy, a U.N.
official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by Alpha Son, advicer to Blondin Beye,
U.N. Special Envoy to Angola while addressing a forum themed as
"Angola Facing New Challenges" sponsored by the churches here.
</P>
<P>
Son said that in the context of materializing peace in the
country, Angola faces the challenges of consolidating peace,
promoting democracy and re-building its economy.
</P>
<P>
He said U.N. peace observers and political experts would
continue its stay in Angola to help establish government
administration in areas formerly controlled by the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) in 18 provinces in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Angola has to accomplish the tasks of settling refugees,
demobilizing soldiers or ex-fighters and clearing mines before it
could rebuild its economy, Son said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. would continue its efforts in helping Angola in the
work, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The country is entering a critical stage, in which every
citizen should replace the memory of war with a sense of peace,
and in which non-governmental organizations, churches, trade
unions, youth leagues and women organizations should play their
vital role in coordinating actions for peace and tolerance among
Angolans, he said.
</P>

Over 150 people, including government officials, parliament
deputies, and people from non-governmental organizations and
other grass-root organizations attended the forum which ended

According to one of the VHF radio operators in Jamama district
who escaped the fighting with his radio apparatus to the nearby
jungle, the anti-aircraft machine-guns mounted on the battle
wagons have reached the town at 15:00 hours local time Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Some reports say that the town has already fallen to the
forces of General Morgan. The radio operators revealed that six
people were killed and 12 others suffered gunshot wounds during
the battle.
</P>
<P>
However, the casualties on General Morgan's side is not yet
confirmed, but reports from the Southern port town of Kismayu,
500 km South of Mogadishu, said four of their militiamen have
died in Monday night's operation and several others were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Observers here in Mogadishu express concern that this renewed
hostility among the Darod sub-clans and now spreading to the
Hawiye-dominated territories may escalate to a more catastrophic
fighting similar to that in 1991 which took place between the
Hawiye and Darod communities.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Humanitarian Goods Arrive in Baghdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A plane carrying 35 tonnes of
medicine and medical appliances sent by a humanitarian
organization of the United States landed at the Saddam
International Airport in Baghdad on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival at the airport, head of the American
non-governmental "AmeriCares" Andrew Hanna said the medical
consignment is an expression of American people's willingness to
help alleviate the sufferings of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
"It is the first batch of relief supplies that the organization
is going to send successively to Iraq," he said.
</P>
<P>
"AmeriCares" has planned to send Iraq two more batches of
humanitarian goods, which are expected to arrive in the coming two
days.
</P>
<P>
Hanna praised Iraqi officials' cooperation to facilitate the
arrival of the medicine and medical supplies.
</P>
<P>
The move of the American organization was approved by the
United Nations Sanctions Committee a week ago.
</P>
<P>
This was the first humanitarian flight sent from the U.S. to
Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration has been oppositing to supplying
humanitarian goods to Iraq, but it reportedly expressed support
for the action this time.

<HEADLINE> Defense Renewal to Cost S. Africa Over $2 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A defense renewal program
could cost the South African government more than 10 billion Rand
(2 billion U.S. Dollars), Defense Minister Joe Modise said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Opening an air show at Waterkloof air base outside Pretoria,
Modise said the government was prepared to go beyond the current
figure of 10 billion Rand over 10 years for the renewal program,
because the equipment purchases from abroad would bring in
investment.
</P>
<P>
The government-to-government arms packages would bring huge
investment into South Africa and could inject a new vitality into
the economy, South African Press Association quoted Modise as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The process to replace the country's aging defense equipment
was taking long to ensure that South Africa received the maximum
benefit from the counter business offers the arm deals would
entail, he said.
</P>
<P>
The amount of future investment in South Africa by potential
suppliers of new equipment is a major factor in selecting them,
Modise said.
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to persuade those wishing to sell to us to invest
in our country. They must improve our economy a great deal,"
Modise said.
</P>
<P>
The government is looking for offers which would produce new
jobs in the country, enabling more people to look after
themselves and reducing the government's burden of social
spending.
</P>
<P>
Modise said South Africa is looking for business partners,
especially those already playing a significant role in
international marketing. But it would consider the partner's
ability to provide South Africa with markets as the primary
concern.
</P>
<P>
Modise said the updating of equipment was of vital importance
for the South African National Defense Force (SANDF), as it would
compensate for the envisaged staff cuts in the SANDF.
</P>
<P>
"You cannot reduce your force and at the same time allow your
equipment to deteriorate," he said.
</P>
<P>
In August last year, parliament approved the defense review,
thereby giving the go-ahead for the purchase of corvettes,
helicopters, tanks, submarines and light fighter aircraft.
</P>
<P>
At least 150 exhibitors from 20 countries are taking part in
the Aerospace Africa '98, which is the continent's biggest air
show ever staged. It will feature flying displays from several
international aerobatic teams.
</P>
<P>
The show will run over five days and was expected to attract
65,000 visitors.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- International Aero Engines (IAE),
in which Rolls-Royce plc is a major shareholder, is to supply
V2500 engines to three leading Latin American airlines in the
biggest single order in the consortium's history.
</P>
<P>
Grupo Taca, Lanchile and TAM Brazil have selected the V2500 to
power 88 firm and 87 option Airbus Industrie A319 and A320
aircraft, Rolls-Royce announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The contract worth up to 2.3 billion U.S. dollars has a
potential value to Rolls-Royce of 770 million U.S. dollars, the
company added.
</P>
<P>
IAE President Barry Eccleston said, "The industry has long
recognized Latin America as an area of great potential growth.
This is a significant development which turns that into a
reality."
</P>
<P>
San Salvador-based Grupo Taca, which had previously ordered a
total of 14 V2500 powered A320s, has specified an additional 30
firm and 30 option aircraft.
</P>
<P>
LanChile, which has its headquarters in Santiago, has ordered
20 firm plus 20 options while TAM-Brazil, based in Sao Paulo, will
take 38 firm with options on a further 37 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Some of the A320s will be powered by the 27,000lb thrust
B2527E-A5, a version optimized for "hot and high operations,"
Rolls-Royce said.
</P>
<P>
IAE has won a 57 percent share of firm engine orders for A320
series aircraft this year. V2500s power 98 percent of Airbus
Industrie single aisle aircraft ordered in Latin America.

<HEADLINE> Manufacturing, Services Gap in UK Overstated: Lloyds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Worries about the pace of growth
in the service sector in Britain may be overdone as new analysis
by Lloyds Bank shows it is already slowing in response to weaker
manufacturing growth and earlier policy tightening.
</P>
<P>
Figures released Tuesday by the bank reassure critics who fear
that unless monetary policy is further tightened, the UK is in
danger of becoming a two-tier business economy with manufacturing,
the underclass.
</P>
<P>
But, in its latest Economic Bulletin, senior economist Trevor
Williams warned that only a few sections of the service sector
were fast growing, and tightening monetary policy to slow them
could damage the rest of the economy.
</P>
<P>
By recalculating GDP without those fast growing sectors, such
as financial services, economic growth is already growing below
trend at 1.9 percent rather than 2.9 percent for the last quarter
of 1997, according to the bank's analysis.
</P>
<P>
Williams said, "Sixty percent of the service sector is already
slowing in response to weaker manufacturing growth and policy
tightening. The 40 percent... is not slowing."
</P>
<P>
That 40 percent, he said, represented just 27 percent of GDP,
and one of the most important factors driving growth is the
millennium bug, which is buoying activity in industries that are
big users of computers.
</P>
<P>
Also driving it is the introduction of the euro which requires
additional spending to enable banking facilities and some retail
activities in the euro to be available to UK residents, he added.

<HEADLINE> "Walk With Lions" to Come True in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Touring game parks in Africa, to
many, may be an experience of "caged men" in their vehicles
parading free animal world, but a new project here in Nairobi is
to free tourists from the cages and "walk with lions".
</P>
<P>
Just as the newly-shot Hollywood film "Walk with Lions" may
hint, the project, dubbed "Nairobi Safari Walk", is to bring men
and animals as close to their natural environment as possible,
David Western, Director of the Kenyan Wildlife Service told
Xinhua here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony for the Mini-Orphanage park,
a makeshift place for the building of the future "Nairobi Safari
Walk", Western said that the project would serve as a very good
education program for wildlife reservation in the country.
</P>
<P>
About 400,000 visitors are expected to come and view the new
para-natural park each year, Western said, adding that this would
be the most-visited park throughout the whole of Kenya, where
there are nearly 30 game parks.
</P>
<P>
The building of the project, the first of its kind in the
country, would take about 12 to 18 months, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Nairobi Safari Walk" is to be built on the current site of
the Nairobi Animal Orphanage which was established in 1964.
</P>
<P>
Originally served as a refuge for wild animals found abandoned
or injured throughout Kenya, the Nairobi Animal Orphanage has
taken in other animals, including non-Kenyan species as
chimpanzees and tigers, Western said, and the new idea is to
reshape it into a park between city and wilderness, and make it a
modern educational exhibition of live animals.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan Wildlife Service director said that two classrooms
are to be built along with some other tourist facilities in the
Kenyan Safari Walk.
</P>
<P>
Visitors would move through a natural environment,
encountering animals as part of an unfolding tableau, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
The new facility may attract wild animals to the Safari Walk
park, blending seamlessly with those in permanent exhibit areas
carefully crafted to appear part of the native landscape, he
said.
</P>
<P>
All development in the new park will be integrated into the
natural landscape of Nairobi National Park, the first wildlife
reserve in Kenya, which, just nine kilometers out of the capital
Nairobi, opened its gates to visitors in 1946, Western said.
</P>
<P>
Open savanna merged with bush, forest and wetland, would make
the animal habitat area in the park a natural world for the
animals originally housed in the zoo-like Nairobi Animal
Orphanage, Western said.

<HEADLINE> European Shares End Mixed Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Major stock market in Europe ended
mixed Tuesday, with London and Paris recovering dramatically from
Monday's steep drop to end sharply higher and Frankfurt extending
its losses.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE 100 index staged a strong recovery from Monday's
2.48 percent fall to end up 84.2 points or 1.47 percent at
5,806.6, recouping the bulk of Monday's hefty loss, supported by
the ease of fears of U.S. interest rates rise and a strong dollar.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that worries over U.S. interest rates eased after
the Washington Post quoted Federal Reserve sources as saying that
the move to a bias towards higher rates did not mean they were
imminent.
</P>
<P>
Financial issues were at the forefront of the recovery on the
London market.
</P>
<P>
French shares in Paris also staged a big recovery, with the
CAC-40 index closing 91.40 points or 2.48 percent higher at
3,777.23, lifted by the strong dollar and Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the market made progress on the back of a
rally in the automobile sector and the dollar's rebound above the
psychologically important 6-Franc level.
</P>
<P>
But on the Frankfurt market, which ends before Wall Street
opens, Germany's blue-chip stocks index extended Monday's losses
and ended at 5,018.67, down 69.46 points or 1.37 percent.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the market closed lower as fears of a rate
hike in the U.S. in May still persisted.

<HEADLINE> U.N., OIC Propose 3-Member Foreign Ulema Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 28 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to end the deadlock of
the intra-Afghan talks, the United Nations and the OIC Tuesday
proposed that three foreign Ulema judge the qualification of the
Ulema to be chosen by the Taliban and the rival Northern Alliance
for a Ulema commission.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the two proposals floated on Tuesday by the
United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference
(OIC), which are jointly presiding over the landmark intra-Afghan
talks in Islamabad,  sources close to the Afghan delegations told
Xinhua Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the United Nations and the OIC suggested that
three Ulema (religious scholars) from other Muslim countries like
Saudi Arabia and Egypt should be selected to decide whether the
Ulema to be entered by the Taliban and the alliance for a proposed
Ulema Commission are qualified if the two sides fail to iron out
their differences on the issue.
</P>
<P>
However, the sources, who asked not to be named, said the two
sides had not discussed the proposals so far and possibly they
will take them up when the talks are to be resumed at 10 a.m.
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The talks of the Afghan Joint Steering Committee, consisting of
five Taliban and nine alliance delegates, still made no
significant headway Tuesday due to the two sides' differences on
the definition of the Ulema. The talks, which began on Sunday, are
the first formal encounter between the two Afghan rivals.
</P>
<P>
OIC Assistant General Secretary Ibrahim Saleh Bakar told
reporters after the two sides concluded their fifth session of
talks Tuesday evening that the United Nations and the OIC have
made two new proposals to the Afghan factions. However, Bakar did
not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, who now control two-thirds of Afghan territory,
have insisted that only those who have a degree from institutions
of Islamic education and teaching could participate in the Ulema
Commission, which would decide the future political setup of
Afghanistan if and when formed.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Alliance, which holds the rest one-third of the
country, demanded that other renowned figures, including
university professors, teachers and politicians, should also be
included in the Ulema Commission.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Taliban delegation, Adbul Wakeel, told reporters
late Tuesday afternoon that "we are still insisting on the
formation of the Ulema Commission."
</P>
<P>
"Only qualified Ulema, or typical religious leaders, can be
included in the Ulema Commission," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, there will be no discussions on the Ulema
issue at Wednesday's talks.
</P>
<P>
The Steering Committee talks, which were made possible by
hectic political efforts by the United Nations, the OIC, Pakistan
and some other neighboring countries, had to be suspended on
Monday as the Taliban and the alliance bogged down in the
definition of the Ulema. The talks reopened Tuesday afternoon
after both sides consulted their respective leaderships on the
issue.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Coup Plotters Sentenced to Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's former Chief of General
Staff Lt. Gen. Oladipo Diya and two former ministers involved in
a foiled coup plot to overthrow the current military government
were sentenced to death Tuesday afternoon by a special military
tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. Tajudeen Olarenwaju and Maj. Gen. Abdulkareem Adisa
were former ministers of communications, and works and housing
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The three former big men were found guilty on both treason and
conspiracy to commit treason, which were punishable with death
penalty, according to the tribunal president, Maj. Gen. Victor
Malu.
</P>
<P>
However, the sentences would be subject to the confirmation of
the Provisional Ruling Council, the highest decision-making body
of the country which could meet at any time from now to decide
whether the execution will be carried out by firing squad.
</P>
<P>
Also sentenced to death are two other military officers,
including Diya's chief security officer, and one civilian,
according to a report from Jos, northern Nigeria, where the
special military tribunal has completed its more than two months
of the coup trials.
</P>
<P>
Diya, once the second person of Nigeria, and 25 others were
brought to the tribunal charged by a special investigation board
which spent one month to investigate the involvement of suspects
in the coup plot uncovered on December 21 last year.
</P>
<P>
According the News Agency of Nigeria, 15 out of the 26
accused, including soldiers, civilians and one police officer,
were discharged and acquited.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the others were sentenced on charges of either
treason, conspiracy, concealment of treason, accessory, illegal
importation of arms and ammunition, forging documents or other
criminal crimes, with jail terms ranging from 14 years to life
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The verdict was delivered amidst tight security. All the 26
accused, wearing handcuffs and leg chains, were present when
sentence was read at a military barracks serving as the seat of
the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
The sentences were read in only 30 minutes and it was all
over, a report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations General
Assembly will hold a special session to address the drug problem
on June 8-10, it was announced here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, world leaders are expected to adopt a worldwide
plan to substantially reduce drug demand and supply by the year
2008, spokesman for the president of the General Assembly Alex
Taukatch told reporters.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, there are about
190 million drug users in the world today and the globalization of
the drug trade requires an international response.
</P>
<P>
"Drugs are tearing apart our societies, spawning crime,
spreading diseases such as AIDS and killing our youth and our
future," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Taukatch said a declaration expected to be adopted will set up
target dates in the fight against drugs.
</P>
<P>
Governments are requested to make combined efforts to reduce
drug demand in 10 years following the establishment of effective
drug prevention, treatment and rehabilitation programs by 2003.
</P>
<P>
The declaration will also call for the strategies to eliminate
or significantly reduce illicit cultivation of drug crops by 2008.
</P>
<P>
To curb drug money laundering, it will ask governments to adopt
relevant national legislation by 2003. Currently only 30 percent
of countries are estimated to have effective anti-money laundering
laws in place, according to U.N. data.

talks with Algerian Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia and business
leaders.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association quoted Pahad as saying that he
encountered a strong political will in Algeria to expand economic
interchanges with South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day Pahad signed eight agreements between the
two countries, including treaties on merchant shipping, air
services, tourism and the avoidance of double taxation.
</P>
<P>
Algeria is the first leg of a three-nation African trip by
Pahad. During his visit he introduced a private and parastatal
delegation from South Africa to a business forum in Algiers.
</P>
<P>
The forum was arranged for the business communities of the two
countries to indentify possible areas of future commercial
ventures.
</P>
<P>
Algeria, one of Africa's richest economies with large oil and
gas supplies, imports almost all its commodities.
</P>
<P>
Pahad said during his talks with Ouyahia he stressed that the
idea of an African Renaissance could not be realized without
closer political and economic links between North Africa and
Sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
"For too long the northern parts of Africa were considered
separated from the continent. It is incumbent on us to promote
the unity of the entire African continent," Pahad said.
</P>
<P>
He said he handed a message from President Nelson Mandela to
Ouyahia in which Mandela agreed to visit Algeria in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
Pahad is due to leave for Tunisa and Libya after visit to
Algeria.

<HEADLINE> Iraq: Security Council Should Keep Promises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has complied with
resolutions of the U.N. Security Council, thus the council should
keep promises on its part by lifting sanctions against Iraq
immediately, Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf
stressed here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sahaf was responding to the decision made by the Security
Council of the United Nations Monday to prolong the sanctions
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Sahaf said Iraq had destroyed all the
prohibited weapons of mass destruction under Resolution 687 of the
Security Council, and the U.N. Sanction Committee and the Security
Council should consider to lift the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions had been in place for eight years which had
brought great sufferings to Iraqi people, and most of the council
members shared the common view and had been pushing towards
lifting the sanctions against Iraq, he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said only very fewer countries, namely
Britain and the United States, had been blocking lifting sanctions
against Iraq. He called for justice from the council.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on closing the file of Iraq's nuclear weapons, Sahaf
said that was only a very small area, and other areas also should
be closed as there was on evidence showing that Iraq still had
prohibited weapons.
</P>
<P>
On the visits to Iraq's presidential sites, Sahaf said the
Special Group had made initial visits to them and no prohibited
weapons were found there. According to the deal reached between
the U.N. chief and Iraq, there should be subsequent visits if
there was a need. But it should be decided by the U.N. chief and
not by others, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Orders for Durable Goods Increase in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. orders for big-ticket
manufactured goods increased in March despite of a continued slip
in demand for aircraft, the Commerce Department reported here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Orders for durable goods, big-ticket items which could last for
over three years, rose 0.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted 186.6
billion U.S. dollars, the department said.
</P>
<P>
The increase came in the wake of a 0.8 percent drop in
February, revised from an earlier estimate of a 1.1 percent
decline, and an increase of 1.6 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
As in February, orders in March were pulled down by a drop in
aircraft orders, reflecting the impact by the economic ebbing in
Asia, a big market for commercial airliners. Civilian aircraft
orders fell 4.7 percent in March after dropping 30.2 percent the
month before.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile aircraft, orders picked up 0.6 percent
in March after a 0.8 percent rise in February.
</P>
<P>
Orders for primary metals such as steel fell 4.4 percent, but
orders rose 1.9 percent for industrial machinery and 2 percent for
electronic equipment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, shipments, a measure of current production, rose 1.4
percent in March representing a seasonally adjusted 190.9 billion
dollars in the month after a 2.9 percent rise in February.
</P>
<P>
Because shipments rose faster than orders, the backlog of
unfilled orders declined 0.8 percent in March, to 513 billion
dollars, after slipping 0.5 percent in February.

<HEADLINE> Breastfeeding, Best Way to Feed Infants: Gov't </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Breastfeeding is the best way to
feed infants, according to a new set of guidelines by Canada's
Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
"Breastfeeding may continue for up to two years of age and
beyond," said the guidelines which were published Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The department, along with the Canadian Pediatric Society and
Dietitians of Canada, came up with the recommendations to help the
health care community better advise parents and caregivers on
infant nutrition.
</P>
<P>
"If an infant is not breastfed, or is partially breastfed,
commercial iron-fortified formulas are the most acceptable
alternative to breast milk until nine to 12 months of age," the
department said.
</P>
<P>
It recommended that breastfed infants also receive extra
vitamin D in the form of a supplement.
</P>
<P>
The use of nutritionally incomplete alternate milks as the sole
source of nutrition for infants is inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
Dietary fat restriction during the first two years is not
recommended because it may compromise the intake of energy and
essential fatty acids and adversely affect infants' growth and
development, it said.

<HEADLINE> Greece Rejects Turkish Claims Over 4 Aegean Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Greece Tuesday rejected
neighboring Turkey's claims over four Greek islands in the Aegean
Sea, saying that such claims ran contrary to international
treaties regulating the status quo in the region.
</P>
<P>
Greek Parliament President Apostolos Kaklamanis Tuesday accused
Turkey of trying to create problems in the region by making claims
beyond the bounds of reason and contrary to international law.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas dismissed
the lastest Turkish provocation as a continuation of Turkey's
policy aimed at trying to create an issue of supposed "grey areas"
in the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
On March 26, Turkey reportedly questioned Greece's sovereignty
of the islands such as Fournoi, Agathonisi, Farmakonisi and
Pserimos during a meeting in Ankara between a Greek embassy
representative and a Turkish Foreign Ministry official.
</P>
<P>
Greece has insisted that the four islands are in fact Greek in
accordance with the treaty of Lausanne in 1923 and the peace
treaty of Paris in 1947.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey have been at odds over decades for their
disputes in the territorial waters, air space limits, the
delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean and the Cyprus
problem.

<HEADLINE> UK's Long-Term Challenge, Productivity Growth: CBI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The strong pound is hurting UK
manufacturing, and exporters in particular, and the Monetary
Policy Committee (MPC) has been called to take this fully into
account when making interest rate decisions.
</P>
<P>
According to a quarterly industrial trends survey by the
Confederation of British Industry (CBI) released here Tuesday, the
continued pressure from the strength of sterling has led UK
manufacturers to register a sharp fall in confidence to the lowest
since October 1992.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to an audiencer of business people at the CBI's
gathering Tuesday, its Director-General Adair Turner said, "The
strong pound is hurting our exporters badly, and is beginning to
hit their investment plans."
</P>
<P>
"It is important that the MPC takes this into account in its
deliberations over interest rates. The CBI's judgement is that the
inflation target can be met without further interest rate rises,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Looking to the longer term, Turner argued that business has as
little interest in an undervalued as in an overvalued pound. He
urged companies to focus on the challenge of improving their
productivity.
</P>
<P>
Turner said, "British manufacturing and services have got to
redouble their efforts to pursue best practice. If we copied best
practice in manufacturing, our GDP would increase by 60 billion
pounds (96 billion U.S. dollars) a year."
</P>
<P>
The CBI's National Manufacturing Council is now spearheading a
national best practice campaign with the government to help
companies improve their productivity.

ANKARA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 Turks staged a
demonstration against the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK)
Tuesday evening in southern Turkish city of Antalya, according to
the semi-official Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Chanting anti-PKK slogans, the protesters demanded that the
PKK rebels stop their armed activities around this famous tourist
attraction on the Mediterranean coast.
</P>
<P>
PKK activities have been reported in the mountainous areas
around Antalya recently and five guerrillas killed by government
security forces in a village near the city.
</P>
<P>
Antalya and its nearby resorts are popular with European
tourists, Germans in particular, in summer season.
</P>
<P>
Security officials said that the PKK stepped up operations near
the tourist city in an attempt to tarnish Turkey's international
image and undermine its tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a separatist war since 1984 in
eastern and southeastern Turkey, in which more than 35,000 people
lost their lives in armed clashes.

<HEADLINE> Cigarette-Maker to Cooperate with Criminal Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Liggett &AMP; Myers Inc., smallest
of the big five cigarette-makers in the United States, agreed
Tuesday to cooperate with the Justice Department's criminal
investigation of the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
The department is investigating whether tobacco executives lied
to Congress and federal agencies about the addictiveness and
industry tactics.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement announced Tuesday in Washington, Liggett
agreed "to provide truthful, complete and accurate information"
about industry knowledge of the health consequences of smoking
cigarettes and the addictive nature of nicotine.
</P>
<P>
The company has also agreed to tell what it knows about the
alleged targeting of children and teenagers by the industry, and
the manipulation of nicotine in cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
Liggett will also cooperate with the Justice Department as it
investigates whether tobacco company lawyers participated in
directing research or in crafting "false or misleading statements"
by the tobacco companies to Congress, the Food &AMP; Drug
Administration and consumers.
</P>
<P>
Liggett also has promised to help investigators obtain evidence
of crimes in those documents, which the companies still claim are
protected by attorney-client or related privileges.
</P>
<P>
The department says it offered no immunity from prosecution in
exchange for cooperation from New York City-based Liggett Group
and its subsidiary, Liggett &AMP; Myers of Durham, N.C.
</P>
<P>
Bennett LeBow, chief executive of the Brooke Group Ltd.,
Liggett's parent, stunned the other tobacco companies last year
when, as part of his settlement with 22 states suing the industry,
he ended decades of industry denials that smoking was addictive
and caused cancer.
</P>
<P>
He also alleged tobacco companies had deliberately marketed
their products to teenagers.
</P>
<P>
The Liggett settlement, which quickly drove the other cigarette
makers to negotiate with their opponents, required the company to
make an immediate 25 million dollar payment and to pay 25 percent
of its annual pretax profits for 25 years into a fund to help
cover the states' tobacco-related health care costs. The other
companies have since backed away from a 368.5 billion dollar
settlement with the states.

<P>
LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Chris Patten, the last British
governor in Hong Kong, said on Tuesday he would be honored to head
up a review of policing in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with BBC radio, Patten said if there was a job,
"I would be very honored to do what I could to help." But he added
there would not be a job until a referendum had been held on May
22 on the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
"As a former Northern Ireland minister...who strongly supports
the 'Good Friday' agreement, I would obviously want to do anything
I could to help all those people who have been so brave in
Northern Ireland in reaching this agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday, Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam said
Patten had been asked to chair a review of policing in the
province but he had not formally accepted the job.
</P>
<P>
The job is one of the toughest tasks in the re-building of
peace in Northern Ireland -- chairing an independent commission on
the sensitive issue of policing in the wake of a peace deal
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Reports of his appointment emerged after talks on Monday
between Gerry Adams, leader of IRA political wing Sinn Fein, and
British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein is pressing for the RUC to be disbanded and for
British troops to withdraw completely from Northern Ireland.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- People in Bo, Sierra Leone's
second largest city, staged a demonstration to protest the
government of Liberia for its support for the ousted military
junta while the country's 37th independence anniversary was
celebrated.
</P>
<P>
According to a British Broadcasting Corporation report
monitored here Tuesday evening, the demonstrators accused
Liberian President Charles Taylor of sending his former factional
fighters to fight with the junta forces in east Sierra Leone,
killing innocent civilians there.
</P>
<P>
The peaceful demonstrators were angry at Taylor's men to fight
against the west African peacekeeping force ECOMOG, which ousted
the junta in mid-February this year.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that Sierra Leoneans demonstrated against
the government of President Taylor.
</P>
<P>
Taylor has repeatedly been accused of helping the junta,
particularly when ECOMOG is mopping up the remnants of the junta
forces following the reinstatement of Sierra Leone's legitimate
government in May.
</P>
<P>
The people also appealed to the Sierra Leonean government to
take the collaborators of the junta for trial in the southern
city.
</P>
<P>
Many people were reportedly saying that they had evidences of
these accused persons' collaboration with the junta, but it was
not easy for them to leave their business for the capital
Freetown, where trial has been carried out.
</P>
<P>
There is also a high court in Bo, they argued.

OTTAWA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government will face
a test Tuesday evening when the House of Commons vote over
compensation for people infected with hepatitis C through tainted
blood.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Jean Chretien, who will be back just in time for
the vote from his Cuba visit, has defined the vote as one of
confidence, which means the government could fall if it loses.
</P>
<P>
The vote is expected to be close, with the ruling Liberals only
holding a majority of 11 seats. All four opposition parties are
expected to line up against Chretien's government.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's vote is on a motion by the Reform Party, the official
Opposition in the federal parliament, that all hepatitis C victims
be compensated, not just those who were infected with the virus
between 1986 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
The government has offered 1.1 billion dollars (770 million
USD) in compensation to about 20,000 people who were infected
between 1986 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that as many as 60,000 are left out because
their legal case is deemed to be weaker.
</P>
<P>
If the ruling Liberals lose the vote, they could call an
election or introduce another motion expressing confidence in the
government, analysts here said.

<HEADLINE> HK Residential Mortgage Loans Rebound in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's residential
mortgage business rose sharply in March after hitting a two-year
low in February, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The amount of gross new loans rose by 54.4 percent to 12.6
billion HK dollars (1.6 billion U.S. dollars), compared with a
1.5-percent decrease to 8.2 billion HK dollars (1.1 billion U.S.
dollars) in February.
</P>
<P>
Despite the substantial monthly increase, new loans made in
March were still well below the monthly average of 21.55 billion
HK dollars (2.8 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997, according to the
HKMA, which has been watching closely the local mortgage business.
</P>
<P>
"The rise in new lending in March reflected increased primary
market activity in February," said David Carse, deputy chief
executive of the HKMA. "However the volume of lending remains
moderate compared with 1997."
</P>
<P>
The average size of new loans increased to 2.1 million HK
dollars (269,000 U.S. dollars), compared to 1.99 million HK
dollars (255,000 U.S. dollars) in February.
</P>
<P>
New loans approved during the month also rose sharply by 55.3
percent to 14.6 billion HK dollars (1.9 billion U.S. dollars).
Loans approved during the month but not yet drawn went up by 28.1
percent to 8.1 billion HK dollars (1 billion U.S. dollars) in
March.
</P>
<P>
On the pricing front, mortgage rates continued to harden in
March, when 77 percent of new loans were priced at 1 percent or
more above besting lending rate, compared with 72 percent in
February.
</P>
<P>
Gross loans for the purchase of properties in the Chinese
mainland jumped to 169 million HK dollars (21.7 million U.S.
dollars) from 113 million HK dollars (14.5 million U.S. dollars)
in February.

LONDON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Following a massive surveillance
operation, police here have arrested several men connected to the
"Mardi Gra" bombings in and around London.
</P>
<P>
"Police officers arrested a number of suspects last night who

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- General Secretary of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) and State President Jiang Zemin
today praised all generations of Beijing University students for
their good traditions of patriotism, progress, democracy and
science.
</P>
<P>
Jiang spoke highly of the students' important roles in the
country's efforts to achieve independence, liberation and
prosperity. University students are the future of the motherland
and the hope of the nation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The CPC leader made the remarks today during an inspection to
the university, the oldest and prestigious institution of higher
education in China, which is preparing to celebrate its 100th
anniversary on May 4 this year.
</P>
<P>
Jiang toured teaching facilities, labs, a library and
a students' dining hall.
</P>
<P>
He chatted cordially with a group of students' and teachers'
representatives, who made comments and proposals on different
subjects such as the university curriculum, development of
university-run businesses and academic achievements made by the
university's researchers.
</P>
<P>
Li Ling, a master's candidate in law, told Jiang that the
students of Beijing University are studying hard, leading a
colorful school life and cherish lofty political goals.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China has to adhere to the focal task of economic
growth and firmly implement the strategy of reinvigorating the
nation through developing science and education in order to
accomplish the country's century-straddling development targets.
</P>
<P>
To carry out this strategy is of great importance for the
country's prosperity and the Chinese nation's revival, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted the great significance for China of fostering a

<P>
HONG KONG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A total of 3,350 traffic
accidents were recorded in Hong Kong in the first quarter of 1998,
representing a dip of 10.4 percent from the fourth quarter of
1997.
</P>
<P>
The number of casualties also dropped by 5.5 percent from 5,004
to 4,730 in the same period, a spokesman for the Road Safety
Council noted Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Although the figures showed improvements in various aspects,
"we will continue taking enforcement and making use of education
and publicity to keep all road users alert of safety messages," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Official figures had earlier showed that the private vehicle
growth rate in Hong Kong accelerated from 2-3 percent in 1996 to 7
percent in 1997, which exceeded the government's target of
limiting the growth to 2 percent per annum.
</P>
<P>
Despite the growth, the traffic conditions, as measured by the
average car journey speed, improved in 1997, thanks to the
completion of a number of new strategic roads and tunnels.

<HEADLINE> UK Roads in Poorest State for 20 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Road Conditions in Britain have
deteriorated sharply over the last 12 months and are in their
worst state of repair for at least 20 years, according to an
official survey Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The National Road Maintenance Condition Survey said that major
and minor roads in the country have been in their poorest state
since the annual survey began in 1977, with 7,000 miles of highway
needing total replacement.
</P>
<P>
There is also a sharp decline in the condition of the country's
pavements, with rising cases of "severe uneveness," the survey
said.
</P>
<P>
Large sections of road now have a "residual life" of less than
zero due to cutbacks in maintenance and the "defects index" for
major roads rose last year to a level 16 percent higher than in
1977 and 40 percent up over 1986.
</P>
<P>
Highway engineers said that a combined total of almost 7,000
miles of roads require rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
A junior transport minister laid the blame on "a worrying
legacy of past under-investment" for the poor road conditions.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Vice President to Visit Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States Vice
President Albert Al Gore is due in Saudi Arabia Friday for a
two-day visit, U.S. diplomatic sources in Saudi capital Riyadh
announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwait News Agency quoted the sources as saying that Gore
would meet Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz and Crown Prince Abdullah
Ibn Abdul-Aziz, discussing the U.S.-led efforts in reviving the
Mideast peace process and ways to promote bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Gore would voice to Saudi leaders Washington's
keenness in advancing the Mideast peace process and breaking the
current deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian talks.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross failed to persuade
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accept a
U.S. initiative aimed at reviving the peace process during his
recent visit to Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. proposal calls on Israel to hand back to the
Palestinians 13.1 percent more of the West Bank in its second
troop redeployment.
</P>
<P>
But Israel insists on handing back no more than 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Gore's visit comes ahead of the May 4 London meeting during
which U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will meet
Netanyahu, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in an effort to break
the deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian talks.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is the first leg on Gore's three-nation Mideast
tour, which also includes stops in Israel and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi government has been urging the U.S. administration
to make its utmost efforts to break the deadlock in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Gore's last visit to Saudi Arabia was in March 1995.

<HEADLINE> Irish Swimming Official Defends De Bruin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- An Irish top swimming official on
Wednesday defended Michelle de Bruin, who has been accused of
handing in a contaminated dope sample that could end her career.
</P>
<P>
"There has been a lot of speculation in relation to Michelle in
the past, none of which has been proven," Irish Amateur Swimming
Association chief Mary O'Malley was quoted as saying in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
The International Amateur Swimming Federation (FINA) said
earlier that De Bruin had handed in a dope sample on January 8
which an International Olympic Committee laboratory found showed
"unequivocal signs of adulteration".
</P>
<P>
But O'Malley made clear she felt it was too soon to jump to
conclusions about De Bruin, who is due to attend a news conference
with her lawyers at 1500 GMT in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
De Bruin, 28, became the toast of Ireland after she won three
gold medals and a bronze in Atlanta under her maiden name Smith.
</P>
<P>
But reports said her success after years as an also-ran was
overshadowed by constant innuendo about her phenomenal rise at an
age at which most swimmers' careers are on the wane.

<HEADLINE> Cross-Straits Political Talks Essential: Commentary  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Resumption of cross-straits
dialogue should be started as soon as possible, with procedural
talks on political negotiations to pave the way for negotiations
on practical matters, according to a commentary released by Xinhua
today.
</P>
<P>
Marking the fifth anniversary today of the talks between Wang
Daohan, president of the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS), and Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the
Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), the commentary
called it a historic step in cross-strait relations and urged
expansion of the exchange between ARATS and SEF.
</P>
<P>
Since early this year, high-ranking figures on both sides of
the Taiwan Straits have expressed their desire to resume the
ARATS-SEF talks that have been suspended for nearly three
years. ARATS and SEF have also exchanged several letters on this
matter.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the previous talks shows that the political
difference was the fundamental reason that negotiations on
practical issues led to no concrete agreements signed between the
two sides, the commentary said, adding that the time is now mature
for political negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Authoritative figures said that significant changes have taken
place in the situation on both sides of the Taiwan Straits over
the past three years, and procedural talks on political
negotiations is the only way leading to the resumption of the
cross-straits dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities, however, still expect to resume the
dialogue on the basis of negotiations on practical matters, the
commentary said, noting that this is a one-sided wish of the
Taiwan authorities.

<P>
Since the ARATS-SEF talks have been suspended for three years,
the article said, more exchanges should be conducted between the
two organizations for an exchange of unofficial views on
procedural talks on political negotiations.
</P>
<P>
At present, the most important and pressing issue is to arrange
a meeting between Koo Chen-fu and Wang Daohan in Beijing, it
stressed.
</P>
<P>
When Jan Jyh-horng, a deputy secretary of the SEF, visited
Beijing recently, ARATS and SEF officials exchanged views on Koo's
Beijing visit. The SEF proposed "proceeding in order and advancing
gradually" and "creating a favorable atmosphere," while postponing
a visit by Koo to Beijing within this year.
</P>
<P>
Tang Shubei, executive vice-president of ARATS, said that the
mainland has made all necessary preparations for Koo's visit and
that he hoped that SEF would give its detailed opinions on this
matter, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
Since the mainland has made various efforts to improve
cross-straits relations for early realization of procedural talks
on political negotiation, the commentary noted, it is now high
time for the Taiwan authorities to take substantial actions.

<HEADLINE> Bureau Calls for Crackdown on Direct Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- All direct sales activities in
China will be halted before October 31, 1998, thus ending a decade
of rampant ``pyramid'' sales abuses in the country, according to a
circular issued by the State Industrial and Commercial
Administration Bureau.
</P>
<P>
In the circular, the bureau demanded that all its agencies
nationwide take tough measures to wipe out direct sales
businesses, in response to the State Council's call for banning
direct sales before October 1, 1998 earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Direct sales activities spread at an alarming rate in China
after they were introduced into the country at the end of the
1980s. By the end of 1995 a total of 163 firms were promoting
direct sales in more than 30 major Chinese cities, according to
official sources.
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of the lack of legal regulations, many
such business people cheated the people they recruited to engage
in ``pyramid'' selling.
</P>
<P>
The circular directed all agencies to take steps to prevent
direct sales businesses from going underground, and urged all
direct sales enterprises to change or cancel their registrations
with local industrial and commercial administrations before the
deadline.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran's President Mohammad Khatami
Wednesday underlined the need to reform his country's economic
structure and called on the workers of the country "to prepare for
a great role" in the restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a gathering of exemplary workers to mark the
International Labor Day, Khatami said Iran should make a desperate
effort to diversify the economy and reduce its dependence on oil.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the difficulties and at any price, we must traverse
the road" to attain the goal, he said, urging people from all
walks of life to contribute to the strive.
</P>
<P>
Lauding worker's contribution to the economy since the 1979
Islamic Revolution, particularly during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war,
he assured that the government would protect the work force by
securing social justice.
</P>
<P>
Khatami stressed the role of workers in social development and
progress of Iran, saying that work and work force are two main
pillars of the country.
</P>
<P>
Preparing the country's third five-year development plan, the
Khatami government is reportedly studying structural changes to
achieve "an economy without oil" from what it termed "sick
economy" at the present.
</P>
<P>
Oil revenues currently account for about 90 percent of Iran's
foreign currency earnings.

HANGZHOU, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Oceanography Bureau of
east China's Zhejiang Province announced today that a system of
paid use of sea areas will be launched for the development of the
province's sea areas.
</P>
<P>
Sea development activities include industrial and tourist
projects, pollution emission and waste dumping, as well as other
commercial projects, Huang Qingming, director of the Zhejiang
Provincial Oceanography Bureau quoted a recently approved
stipulation on the use of Zhejiang's sea area as saying.
</P>
<P>
Huang pointed out that industrial projects will cover building,
repairing and dismantling vessels, exploring mines, wharfs for
industrial and mining uses, and petroleum chemical industry.
</P>
<P>
But use of sea area for the purposes of public welfare,
scientific research, education, fishery, transportation, ecological
environment and so on will not be applied to the measure, Huang
noted.
</P>
<P>
Units and individuals that need to use sea area within the
aforementioned scope can apply to the oceanography departments,
which would examine their applications and grant certificate for
those qualified sea developers, Huang said, adding that the
standard of the utilization charge is under discussion.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang ranks one of China's provinces with longest coastline
and has a jurisdiction over 260,000 square kilometers sea area.
</P>
<P>
China's coastal province of Liaoning and coastal cities of
Xiamen and Qingdao have already introduced the system of granting
permits and paid use of sea area.

LONDON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Vickers confirmed
Wednesday that it has agreed to sell its Rolls-Royce Motor Car to
BMW for 340 million pounds (566.2 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The company said it has reached full agreement on the terms of
the proposed sale and has entered into a contract with BMW to this
effect.
</P>
<P>
In view of the relative size of the transaction, the contract
is conditional on the approval of Vickers' shareholders, according
to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
There will be an adjusting payment, to the extent the net
operating assets change in the period up to completion, which is
expected to occur at the beginning of July, it added.
</P>
<P>
Vickers also announced that it intends to implement a corporate
reorganization as part of the arrangements for the planned sale of
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars.
</P>
<P>
This includes a Scheme of Arrangement which will establish the
continuing Vickers' businesses under a newly listed holding
company owned by the Vickers ordinary shareholders and will
facilitate a return of surplus capital to them.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the sale, Colin Chandler, chairman and chief
executive of Vickers, said, "We are pleased to have achieved our
objective of securing a very good deal for Vickers' shareholders
and a strong new owner for Rolls-Royce Motor Cars."
</P>
<P>
"We can now focus all our management attention and resources on
the future development of our core businesses and I am confident
of our ability to continue to build shareholder value in these
areas," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The German airline Lufthansa
Wednesday announced that its first-quarter operating profit soared
six-fold from the same period of last year to 125 million marks
(69.8 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The strong increase came on top of a record-setting 1997 when
Lufthansa's pre-tax profits increased to 1.65 billion marks (920
million dollars), up 140 percent from the level of the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Lufthansa chief Juergen Weber attributed the sharp gains in
earnings mainly to the company's successful restructuring and
cost-cutting programs as well as its strategic alliances with

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong Wednesday called on workers and unions to maintain good
industrial relations so as to keep international confidence in
Singapore amidst uncertainties and poor sentiments.
</P>
<P>
In his May Day message, the prime minister said that over the
next two years, Singapore's "vulnerabilities and resilience to
stress" will truly be tested, as the country's economy will slow
down "considerably in 1998."
</P>
<P>
Trade and investments will moderate and unemployment will rise
sharply in the region, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In preparing Singapore beyond the current regional crisis, Goh
said, workers and unions play a pivotal role. He stressed that
good industrial relations are even more important in a period of
economic uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
With a weakened regional market, Goh said, Singapore needs to
preserve its export competitiveness in the world markets. "We have
to especially manage labor costs carefully as they account for 35
percent of total business costs in Singapore," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The government has already adopted a wage freeze for its top
civil servants, the prime minister noted, adding that workers must
be prepared for more severe wage adjustments this year, depending
on how the regional situation unfolds.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that even when the region recovers, wage
restraint cannot immediately be relaxed because Singapore workers
will face what he called even stronger competition from their
neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Non-State Enterprises to Benefit Information Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese economist said today
that the development of non-state high-tech enterprises can be
beneficial to the progress of the information industry as a whole.
</P>
<P>
In addition to some major state-run enterprises, non-state
enterprises with high technology also play a positive role in
China's electronic information industry, said Prof. Yu Zhitian, a
former official with a leading group on information promotion
under the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Non-state enterprises usually did not have large amounts of
funds when they were founded, but some of them have developed
rapidly into major enterprises in the information industry by
depending on advanced technology, Yu told a forum on Scientific
Progress and the Information Industry, sponsored by the Chinese
Association for Science and Technology, here today.
</P>
<P>
Such enterprises have contributed a great deal to the
industrialization of China's information technology, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 80 percent of the 52 state-level and 58
provincial hi-tech development zones grew from non-state
enterprises, many of which are involved in electronic information
businesses.
</P>
<P>
Yu noted that more non-state enterprises will be built in the
21st century, when the knowledge-based economy will play an even
bigger role than at present. The Chinese government should promote
the development of such enterprises while taking care of state-run
hi-tech projects.
</P>
<P>
Experts also pointed out at the forum that enterpreneurs should
update their concepts of developing the information industry,
and the government should improve its comprehensive management of
information network construction.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Poll Body Accredits Top Six Parties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' Commission on
Elections (Comelec) has accredited six political parties that
enjoy priority in receiving official copies of election returns
and other documents, local television reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The six major parties are also entitled to launch full-scale
poll monitoring activities by fielding principal watchers in
polling stations in the May 11 national elections.
</P>
<P>
Citing a resolution issued by the Comelec Tuesday, the reports
said the top six political parties include those of four of the 10
official presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Lakas-NUCD Party with Speaker of the House of
Representatives Jose de Venecia as its presidential bet is listed
as the dominant majority party.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition LAMMP (the Fight of Patriotic Filipino
Masses Party) is named as the dominant minority party, with Vice
President Joseph Estrada as its standard-bearer in the May polls.
</P>
<P>
Reporma ( the Party of Democratic Reform) of former Defense
Secretary Renato de Villa and the Liberal Party of former Manila
Mayor Alfredo Lim are also among the top six.
</P>
<P>
The other two accredited major parties are KBL (the New Society
Movement Party) and the Party of Democratic Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
KBL presidential candidate Imelda Marcos, widow of the late
former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, announced her
withdrawal from the race Wednesday, while the Party of Democratic
Filipinos has no candidate for the upcoming ballots.
</P>
<P>
Under the election law, the top six political parties have
priority in receiving copies of the certificate of canvass and the
official election returns.
</P>
<P>
These poll documents will help the candidates and their parties
determine if poll fraud such as vote-padding or vote-shaving has
been committed.
</P>
<P>
According to Comelec Commissioner Manolo Gorospe, the six other
presidential candidates are also entitled to field at least one
poll watcher and could request any one of the six major political
parties for a copy of the election returns.
</P>
<P>
On May 11, the country will elect a new president, a new vice
president, part of the bicameral congress and more than 150,000
local government officials and members of local legislatures.

<HEADLINE> EU Calls for WTO Debate on Electronic Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The European Union unveiled a
proposal on Wednesday for a World Trade Organization (WTO) debate
on removing obstacles to electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
The EU proposal to the WTO suggested that international trade
rules relating to electronic transactions should be clarified and,
in some cases, revised by December.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation union also called for establishing a basic set of
principles to add transparency and legal certainty for online
trade.
</P>
<P>
Union officials said that electronic commerce is an area of
increasing importance to world trade, with economic predictions
suggesting that online and especially Internet trade will continue
to grow rapidly to the benefit of both developed and developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
The EU proposal focuses on five aspects of an agreement on
no-duty import of online services, effective protection of privacy
of individuals, competition in electronic commerce, clarification
of the status of electronic commerce within the WTO, and WTO
debate in relation to intellectual property and government
procurement.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive agency of the European
Union, argued that a debate on electronic commerce can lead to
agreement on a basic set of principles to improve transparency and
legal certainty for the industry and consumers as well.
</P>
<P>
The EU proposal also recognized a need to increase the
participation of developing countries, union officials said.
</P>
<P>
Network-generated or electronic commerce revenue is forecast to
total one trillion U.S. dollars by the year 2001 via 20 million
Internet hosts and 100 million users worldwide.

<HEADLINE> French Farmland Prices See First Increase in 20 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- France saw farmland prices rise
for the first time in 1997 since 1978.
</P>
<P>
The current land price stands at 19,600 francs (3,266
U.S. dollars) per hectare, up 3.18 percent, said a national farm
land management federation, the SAFER, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The increase is due to higher revenues from farm products, the
costs of operating a farm, the renewed confidence of farmers, and
stronger competition in the farm market.
</P>
<P>
France's farmland prices dropped by 10 percent between 1992
and 1993, after the European Union began to reform its common
agricultural policy, lowering incomes dependent on French farm
products.
</P>
<P>
The prices of farmland in France remained at almost the same
level from 1994 to 1996.

<HEADLINE> France Yields to U.S. Pressure on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- France yielded to pressure from
the United States Wednesday by tightening its position toward
Yugoslavia over the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
A French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said that France supports
"extra sanctions" against Yugoslavia, such as freezing Yugoslav
assets in the West, but ruled out the possibility of excluding the
Yugoslav national football team from the '98 France World Cup
finals.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said that during a telephone conversation
between French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine and U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright on Tuesday, the latter threatened to
withdraw from the six-nation "Contact Group" on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The United States warned the Contact Group against "an
agreement around the smallest common denominator" at their meeting
in Rome over the Kosovo situation.
</P>
<P>
Waving stick and carrot at the same time, Washington wants the
Yugoslav authorities to negotiate with the ethnic Albanians there
or face tougher sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"Appropriate measures should be decided today" by the Contact
Group, said French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne
Gazeau-Secret, who deplored "risks of a worsening situation" in
the troubled Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Extra pressure from the international community is necessary
in the first place against Belgrade, because the openings made (by
Yugoslavia) are not enough," she said.
</P>
<P>
But she said that a hardening of pressure on Yugoslavia should
be made "gradually," while sanctions should be imposed separately.
</P>
<P>
France also cautioned the Contact Group about the consequences
that new sanctions could bring to Montenegro and the neighboring
countries of Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Pledges Support for U.S. Redeployment Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat for the first time Wednesday announced his support for the
United States plan calling for a 13.1 percent Israeli pullback in
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from a meeting with visiting Egyptian Foreign Minister
Amr Moussa in Gaza, Arafat said he accepted the U.S. plan although
it falls far below the Palestinian expectations.
</P>
<P>
He said that under the signed agreements Israel must withdraw
from 40 percent of West Bank in the first two of the three-phased
redeployments, but the Palestinian side has lowered its demand
first to 30 percent, then to the present 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) made the concessions
in order to leave Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu no
chance to escape from carrying out the redeployment, Arafat added.
</P>
<P>
This move was apparently aimed at increasing pressure on
Netanyahu, who has flatly rejected the U.S. plan or any plan of
more than 9 percent troop withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's hardline stance has cast doubt on the upcoming
London meetings on May 4, in which U.S. Secretary of State
Madeline Albright will talk separately with Netanyahu and Arafat
in a bid to push forward the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks,
which has been stalled for over a year.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dannis Ross is in the region to
prepare for the London meetings and bridge the gap between the
Palestinians and Israel. He has already held two meetings with
Netanyahu and one with Arafat, but seemed to have achieve no
progress.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Netanyahu was invited to the Egyptian capital Cairo
for talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who advised
Israel to accept the U.S. plan.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu snubbed Mubarak's call, and instead asked Mubarak to
exert influence on Arafat to make more concessions.
</P>
<P>
Following the fruitless Netanyahu-Mubarak summit, Moussa flew
to Gaza Tuesday to brief Arafat on the results.
</P>
<P>
Moussa criticized Israel for using security as an excuse for
derailing the peace process with the Palestinians, and urged
Israel to analyze the situation correctly and take steps to
advance the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Moussa also presided ver a meeting of Egyptian-Palestinian
Executive Cooperation Committee and signed 13 accords with the PNA
on cooperation in the fields of investments, agriculture,
education, culture, tourism, transportation and communications.
|  These agreements were meant to compensate for the failure
of the Israeli-Palestinian economic pact signed in Paris in
1994, which provides for free flow of goods and personnel between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The agreement has been seriously breached by repeated closures
imposed on the Palestinian territories by Israel with the pretext
of curbing terror attacks.

Cement stocks came under heavy selling Wednesday morning and
led the bourse into a selling spree. The earlier announcement by

<P>
MANILA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and the
rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) have agreed to
"continue mutual confidence-building efforts in their genuine
quest for peace," President Fidel Ramos said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here Wednesday night, Ramos said the
government peace panel agreed to undertake such appropriate
actions as may be proper and necessary in order to preclude any
disturbance of peace in Maguindanao.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the next government-MILF technical committee meeting
will be held on May 25-26 to discuss the designation of considered
MILF-controlled areas and an agenda for formal peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The MILF and the government ended their technical committee
meeting in Mindanao earlier without making any progress on the
status of MILF-held areas and the timetable for formal peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
The MILF and the government began low-level exploratory peace
talks in January 1997, but the two sides are still far apart on

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's 1st Black Army Chief Appointed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's cabinet
Wednesday appointed lieutenant-general Siphiwe Nyanda as the new
chief of the South African National Defense Force (SANDF),
marking the first time an African took the post.
</P>
<P>
Nyanda succeeds general Georg Meiring who retired earlier this
month after handing a flawed report to President Nelson Mandela
which claimed left-wing elements in the African National Congress
(ANC) were plotting a coup.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, commander-in-chief of the army, appointed Nyanda
after due consultation and the his choice was welcomed by the
cabinet, government spokesman Joel Netshitenzhe was quoted by
South African Press Association as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nyanda, currently deputy Defense Force chief and chief of
staff of the SANDF, said he felt humbled by the confidence and
trust the government had demonstrated in him.
</P>
<P>
"I am conscious of the heavy responsibility it places on my
shoulders. I pledge to return the trust shown in me by serving
the government and the people of South Africa with unflinching
loyalty, dedication, and to the very best of my ability," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The 47-year-old former commander of the ANC's armed wing,
Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), said he realized he could only achieve
this with the support of all serving members of the defense
force.
</P>
<P>
He said he would spell out his vision of the future of the
SANDF only after Meiring's departure at the end of next month.
</P>
<P>
Nyanda, whose brother was killed by security forces of the
former government in a cross-border raid into Swaziland in 1983,
said he felt nothing personal about the past.
</P>
<P>
"This (the appointment) is something of national importance,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Nyanda was born in the black township of Soweto outside
Johannesburg and had studied science at the University of
Zululand. He underwent military training in the former East
Germany as a MK member in the 1970s and later served in various
capacities in the underground movement of the ANC.
</P>
<P>
Nyanda was elected to the ANC 's national executive committee,
its decision-making body, in 1991 and served as chief of staff of
MK from 1992 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
He was appointed chief of staff of the SANDF in June, 1994
when MK, the former South African defense force and Apla were
integrated into the new defense force.

dubious penalty call which led to Bacau's winning goal, two denied
penalties in favour of Rapid and the failure to send off a Bacau
defender who fouled an attacker.
</P>
<P>
The outcome, combined with Steaua Bucharest's 1-0 defeat of
lowly Farul Constanta, propelled Steaua into two-point lead atop
the standings with only two matches left and virtually assured
them of the title.

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen Meets Albright </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen
here today met visiting US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and exchanged views with her on Sino-US relations and other
international and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Qian, noting that US President Bill Clinton will soon visit
China at the invitation of Chinese President Jiang Zemin, said
that the coming visit will be "a major event" in Sino-US
relations. President Jiang and the Chinese government attach great
importance to Clinton's June China tour, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the two sides are making active preparations for the
visit, of which Albright's current trip is a part. According to
the vice-premier, China wishes, through joint efforts with the
United States, to strengthen high-level discussions and exchanges,
expand mutually beneficial cooperation and handle divergences
properly in a bid to ensure that Clinton's visit will be a
complete success, just as President Jiang Zemin's US tour was last
fall.
</P>
<P>
Albright said Clinton is looking forward to visiting China. In
her view, Jiang Zemin's visit last year was "very successful", as
the Chinese president introduced China to the people of the United
States. She said that she hoped Clinton's China visit would
likewise further the understanding of the people of the United
States as regards China. The US side hopes that the coming visit
will show how deep US-China relations are, as well as the various
opportunities brought about by this relationship, she said. She
hoped that the visit would be "constructive" for both countries.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the history of Sino-US relations, Qian said that the
key to ensuring the continuous development of Sino-US relations is
for the two sides to clearly comprehend and master their common
interests and the strategic situation.
</P>
<P>
During Jiang's US visit the two heads of state agreed to build
a constructive strategic partnership between the two countries,
Qian said, adding that through Clinton's visit and the joint
efforts by the two sides, the relationship between the two
countries will witness new developments, given the fact that the
issues concerning the two sides can be handled properly. "We are
optimistic about this," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Albright said that she considered the upcoming visit a rare
chance for the two countries to improve and develop their
bilateral ties, saying that such ties are beneficial to the
peoples of the two countries, as well as to regional and global
stability. "To that end, we have to seriously tackle the problems
we face," she said.
</P>
<P>
Qian pointed out that the Taiwan issue is the most sensative
part of Sino-US relations. "Only by handling this issue properly
can Sino-US relations see smooth development," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Albright in reply said that the United States pays close
attention to the stance of China on the Taiwan issue, and
reiterated that the United States adheres to the "one China"
policy.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that frequent consultations between the
two countries on certain major international and regional issues
are beneficial to safeguarding world peace and stability. The two
sides showed their willingness to continue their discussions on
these issues.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi and US Ambassador
James Ralph Sasser were present at the meeting.

<P>
Meanwhile, China has already developed cars that use
alternative fuels such as natural gas, methanol, ethanol,
electricity and solar energy.

<HEADLINE> Iranian MP Ready to Get Kuwaiti POWs in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A visiting Iranian member of
parliament expressed willingness on Wednesday to mediate the
release of Kuwait's prisoners of war held in Iraq if she is asked,
the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Kuwait Red Crescent Society, Zahra Pishgahifard
said that "to mediate in the release of POWs is a legislative and
religious duty. If you want us to mediate ... in this Islamic,
humanitarian issue, then we are ready to do so."
</P>
<P>
Pishgahifard is one of the delegates accompanying Iranian
Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri on a three-day official
visit to Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
"From an Islamic and humanitarian point of view, we wish that
all the POWs in Iraqi prisons, whether Iranians or Kuwaitis, are
promptly released," Pishgahifard said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait insists that there are still 625 people, 550 of them
kuwaitis, missing becuase of Iraq's seven-month occupation of
Kuwait from August, 1990. But Iraq has denied that it has any
Kuwaiti POWs.
</P>
<P>
The issue of POWs remains the most thorny problem in the ties
bewtween Kuwait and Iraq after Iraq recognized the common border
and started to pay compensations under the supervision of the
United Nations.

<P>
Officials said that Chinese car manufacturers have to meet
international standards so as to compete with their counterparts
abroad.
</P>
<P>
China has to reach the global average level of automobile gas
emission by the year 2010, according to an international agreement
on greenhouse gas emission.
</P>
<P>
They expressed optimism about meeting the target by saying that
China will reduce the present level of gas emission from automobiles
by 70 to 80 percent after the year 2000.

<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Senior police officers from east
China's Fujian Province have made self-criticisms here at the
Ministry of Public Security for two cases of extortion of
confessions by torture.
</P>
<P>
On February 14 and March 13 this year police in Zhangpu County
and Quanzhou City, both in Fujian, extorted confessions from
suspects by means of torture.
</P>
<P>
Jia Chunwang, minister of public security, pointed out that
such actions contravene the basic principles of China's police
force.
</P>
<P>
Instead of covering up the existing problems inside the
national police force, public security bureaus nationwide should
uncover the problems and punish those responsible without
leniency, he said.
</P>
<P>
The senior officers from Fujian conceded that the two cases
proved that there still exist loopholes in the training and
management of local police forces, especially in the case of newly
recruited policemen.
</P>
<P>
Luo Feng, secretary of the Discipline Inspection Committee of
the ministry, said that officers responsible for such torture
cases should be brought to justice in order to eliminate this type
of abuse.

<HEADLINE> EU Passes Preliminary Draft Budget for 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission adopted
a preliminary draft budget for 1999 on Wednesday, with an
expenditure proposal totalling 183.252 billion euros (EUR).
</P>
<P>
A euro is now set to be equal to an ECU.
</P>
<P>
The expenditure total breaks down to 96.902 Billion EUR in
commitment appropriations and 86.350 Billion EUR in payment
appropriations.
</P>
<P>
The level of expenditure will be 1.11 percent of the total
gross national product of the 15 European Union member states.
</P>
<P>
The main increase in the draft budget is for structural
operations that lead to an increase of 16.6 percent in commitments
and 9 percent in payments.
</P>
<P>
Spending in agriculture, internal and external policies, as
well as in administration, increases no more than 0.6 percent in
commitment appropriations and 0.5 percent in payment
appropriations.
</P>
<P>
Resources are concentrated on priorities such as employment,
trans-European networks, research and technological developments.
</P>
<P>
"This is the last budget of the Delors II package, which
expires in 1999," said Erkki Liikanen, European commissioner
responsible for budget and administration.
</P>
<P>
"The (European) Commission proposal fully respects the
political priorities of the commission. It also takes into account
the budgetary rigor of member states and the financial
requirements of future enlargement," added the commissioner.

<HEADLINE> China-Uzbekistan Judicial Assistance Accord Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- An accord on civilian and
criminal judicial assistance between China and Uzbekistan was
approved here today at the second meeting of the Standing
Committee of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Entrusted by the State Council, Vice-Foreign Minister Zhang
Deguang made an explanation of the accord that was submitted to
the NPC Standing Committee meeting April 26.
</P>
<P>
He said relations between China and Uzbekistan have been
progressing rapidly since the two countries established diplomatic
ties, noting that it is necessary for the two countries to conduct
judicial assistance with each other to protect the legitimate rights
and interests of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
In April 1996 Uzbekistan set forth a suggestion to China on
negotiating accords on civilian and criminal judicial assistance
and extradition.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen, who was also foreign minister
then, and visiting Uzbekistan Foreign Minister Kamilov Abdulaziz
Hafizovich signed an accord on bilateral judicial assistance last
December.
</P>
<P>
The accord contains 34 articles, and its main contents include
offering judicial protection to nationals of the other country,
recognition and implementation of civilian adjudication, and
exchange of legal information.
</P>
<P>
Zhang noted that the bilateral judicial assistance accord
complies with the basic principles of the related Chinese laws and
judicial practice as well as international laws.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it does not exceed the scope of the judicial
assistance accords China has signed with other nations of the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), while taking into
account the judicial system and practices of Uzbekistan, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the accord will help to increase
judicial cooperation between China and Uzbekistan, and boost
bilateral mutual economic, trade and personnel exchanges.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Peso Weakens Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso weakened
further Wednesday but managed to close higher than the day's low
after the Central Bank of the Philippines slightly hiked interest
rates, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The peso was traded at an average of 39.979 to one U.S. dollar
for the day, up from Tuesday's 39.883 pesos, but below the morning
session's average of 40.041 pesos.
</P>
<P>
The central bank raised its overnight borrowing rate by half a
percentage point to 13.5 percent in an effort to support the peso.
</P>
<P>
Before the central bank's intervention, the peso fell to a low
of 40.18 pesos due to tight dollar supply and higher dollar demand
caused by mounting concerns over the May 11 presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
Investors fear that political instability may result from a
failure of elections due to violence or massive cheating.

WUHAN, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The development zones in central
China's Hubei Province, which were set up in the mid-1980s, have
come to act as important "windows" backing the province's opening
up.
</P>
<P>
Hubei's development zones, including three state-level and 24
provincial-level, had used foreign fund of 2.13 billion
U.S. dollars by the end of 1997, making up one-third of the total
of the province, according to Yin Guangzhi, director of the

<HEADLINE> Senior Nepali Official on Economic Diplomacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Nepal has taken a number of
initiatives to promote economic diplomacy and has made some
headway in this regard in less than two years, Narayan S. Thapa,
special secretary of Nepal's Foreign Ministry, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Thapa said that since economic
diplomacy was formally launched in June 1996, the government of
Nepal has made various institutional arrangements in order to
vigorously pursue economic diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
He said among them are the establishment of and economic
relations and coordination division in the Foreign Ministry, the
establishment of the International Business Forum comprising
senior officials of relevant ministries and private sector
business community, and the establishment of international
relations desks in relevant ministries such as finance, commerce,
industry, tourism and labor.
</P>
<P>
Besides, a new mechanism, which allows the Foreign Ministry to
assign half of the ambassadors from its career diplomats, has been
in practice, Thapa said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, most of the ambassadors were political figures.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the institutional arrangements, the newly-formed
Institute of Foreign Affairs sometimes organizes briefing and
interaction programs for envoys and conducts training for the
officers and staff members of the Foreign Ministry, he said.
</P>
<P>
Thapa, who is also spokesman for the ministry, said that the
initiatives have created a favorable environment among the
business and industrial community in Nepal and, to some extent,
has also helped promote Nepal abroad.
</P>
<P>
"It takes time, we're going stage by stage," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The traditional notions of diplomacy have undergone radical
changes worldwide, and economic dimensions are gaining ground in
foreign policy conduct everywhere," Thapa said. "In this context,
it is in our own national interest to pursue economic diplomacy
whose ultimate aim is to promote our national economic interest."
</P>
<P>
He said there has been a growing realization in Nepal that in
order to accelerate the pace of economic development, the Foreign
Ministry and the Nepalese missions abroad should actively play a
role of facilitator for promoting the country's trade, tourism,
investment and overseas employment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that before the Visit Nepal Year' 98 was
formally launched in January, the Nepalese missions abroad had
done a lot of promotion and publicity work.
</P>
<P>
"The political commitments, democratic institutions,
transparent and liberal rules and regulations are favorable
factors for effective implementation of economic diplomacy while
inadequate infrastructure can be considered as some of the
impediments," Thapa said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Envoys of the six-nation "Contact
Group" gathered here Wednesday to discuss the situation in the
troubled Kosovo province of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Political affairs chiefs from France, Germany, Britain, Italy,
Russia and the United States met at the Italian Foreign Ministry
to seek a solution to alleviate tensions in Kosovo and resume the
political dialogue between Yugoslavia and the ethnic Albanian
majority in the southern Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) troika -- Denmark, Poland and Norway
-- were also present to deliver their assessment of the situation
following a visit to the province.
</P>
<P>
Italian Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Umberto Vattani
presided over the meeting. The Contact Group was expected to
decide whether or not to impose further sanctions against Belgrade
over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The European Union feels that Yugoslavia, now a federation of
Serbia and Montenegro, has not been doing enough to halt the
violence.
</P>
<P>
Although Belgrade has offered to negotiate with the ethnic
Albanians, their leader Ibrahim Rugova has declined the offer,
claiming it is only a ploy to cover recent Serb military action in
the province.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo, a Serbian province with an ethnic Albanian majority,
has sunk into chaos since ethnic Albanians calling for
independence from Serbia clashed with local Serb police in
February.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav and Serbian authorities have rejected any
international mediation or the internationalization of the issue,
arguing it is Serbia's internal affair.

<TEXT>
<P>
Li said that the NPC Standing Committee's supervisory role over
the State Council, the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme
People's Procuratorate is totally different from the restraining
role of the parliaments of some other countries over government
and judicial departments.
</P>
<P>
Thus, he said, in the NPC's work, supervision is expected to be
combined with support. While the NPC is performing its supervisory
function, it should also stress the role of support, and through
the supervision, the NPC expects the work of the government,
courts and procuratorates to be enhanced, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the relations between the law and the leadership of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), Li Peng said that the CPC is the
leading core of China's socialist construction and the CPC's
leading position has been formed by history.
</P>
<P>
He said that practice has proved that China cannot do without
the leading role of the CPC.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, the CPC should act in line with the Constitution
and laws.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's laws are formulated by the legislature
under the leadership of the CPC which has grasped the objective
rules of social development, summarized practical experiences and
concentrated the people's will.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it is a consistent view of the CPC that no people
or organizations have the power to act beyond the Constitution and
laws.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said that the NPC Standing Committee is at the
forefront of the construction of the socialist legal system, and
it shares an important responsibility for the rule of law and
socialist legal construction in China.
</P>
<P>
He called on the members of the NPC Standing Committee to live
up to the expectations of the people of all nationalities, and to
do their work well with the utmost enthusiasm and a strong sense
of responsibility.

BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), today called on
the committee to enhance its supervisory role.
</P>
<P>
In his closing speech at the second meeting of the Ninth NPC
Standing Committee, Li urged China's highest legislative body to
improve its supervisory mechanism and raise the efficiency of its
supervision.
</P>

major ways that the NPC performs its supervisory function.
</P>
<P>
Such examinations should be part of the committee's regular
work, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the members of the committee to be on guard
against formalism and to go to grass-root units to listen to the
people's opinions on legislation.
</P>
<P>
He said that some of the results of the examinations should be
made known to the public so that legislation becomes subject to
the supervision of both the NPC deputies and the people.

<P>
Li Peng said that the NPC Standing Committee should focus its
supervisory functions on the major issues of the country's reforms
and construction, as well as on other issues of great concern to
the people.
</P>
<P>
In the next few years the NPC Standing Committee is expected to
conduct supervision on some special topics so as to raise
all-round efficiency, he said.
</P>
<P>
The supervision will focus on some major issues on the basis of
examination of the working reports of the State Council, the
Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the supervision work of the NPC is to promote and
support the roles of the government, the Supreme People's Court
and the Supreme People's Procuratorate in line with the laws, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the NPC Standing Committee, the State Council,
the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate
are all state organs under the leadership of the Chinese Communist
Party, adding that although they have different functions, they
share identical objectives and basic starting points.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Welcomes Afghan Factions' Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Wednesday welcomed an
agreement reached by the Taliban and the rival Northern Alliance
on the formation of a Ulema (religious scholars) Commission, which
has prevented the intra-Afghan talks being held here from
collapsing.
</P>
<P>
"This landmark agreement would lead to a durable and lasting
peace in Afghanistan," said a spokesman of the Pakistani Foreign
Office in a press release issued here Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also expressed his confidence that both parties
would continue in the spirit of cooperation and accommodation in
their future deliberations as well, so that the Afghan people may
enjoy the peace for which they have made tremendous sacrifices.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan's Islamic Taliban militia and the rival Northern
Alliance, who are holding in Islamabad their first formal meeting
in over a year, Wednesday agreed to set up the proposed Ulema
Commission which would bear the responsibility of deciding the
future political setup in Afghanistan if and when formed.
</P>
<P>
After the two sides wrapped up their six-hour-long sixth
session Wednesday afternoon, Ibrahim Saleh Bakar, assistant
general secretary of the Organization of the Islamic Conference,
announced the three-point agreement.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, each delegation will submit a list of
Ulema for the commission; neither side will have the right to veto
any names on the proposed list; and the deliberations and
decisions should be completed and implemented in accordance with
the principles of Islamic law.
</P>
<P>
Bakar's announcement was greeted by a burst of applause from
all the participants in the talks of the Joint Steering Committee
which is made up of five Taliban and nine alliance delegates.
</P>
<P>
James Ngobi, acting head of the U.N. Special Commission on
Afghanistan, said, "We are very hopeful that the talks will
continue this afternoon and tomorrow (Thursday)."
</P>
<P>
Ngobi and Bakar are presiding over the talks between the
Taliban and the Northern Alliance.
</P>
<P>
The landmark talks, which started Sunday morning, had to be
suspended Monday as the two sides bogged down in the definition of
the Ulema. The talks reopened Tuesday afternoon, but no solution
was found to the deadlock at the session.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban had insisted that only those who have a degree from
institutions of Islamic education and teaching could participate
in the Ulema Commission while the Northern Alliance demanded that
some other renowned figures, including university professors and
politicians, should also be included in the commission.

<HEADLINE> Steffi Graf's Father Free From Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Peter Graf, father of the word
tennis star Steffi Graf, was released from jail Wednesday after
serving 10 months of a 45-month sentence for tax evasion, reports
said.
</P>
<P>
The 59-year-old Peter Graf was placed on parole for the rest of
his sentence, reports quoted the Stuttgart court as saying.
</P>
<P>
Graf was found guilty in January last year of cheating tax
authorities of 12 million marks (7.5 million U.S. dollars) by
hiding 42 million marks in revenue his daughter earned between
1989 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
Although he had only served 10 months of his prison term after
being jailed in July, he had already served 15 months on remand
prior to his imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
German law stipulates that a prisoner may be released on parole
once half the sentence has been served.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, a court in the southern town of Ulm, where
Graf was imprisoned, turned down his application for parole.
</P>
<P>
Since December, Graf had been allowed out of prison during the
day but was obliged to return to his cell at night.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Gohar Ayub Khan said Wednesday that peace is imperative for
Afghanistan but it is not an easy objective.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the prospects of the on-going intra-Afghan
peace talks jointly sponsored by the United Nations and the
Organization of the Islamic Conference, Ayub Khan said the
situation was now different from what it had been in the peace
initiatives in the past.
</P>
<P>
The mere fact that the two warring Afghan factions, the Taliban
and the Northern Alliance, were represented at this level "is a
good indicator," because before this the two sides had been trying
for a military solution, said Ayub Khan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan had proposed that six immediate neighboring countries
of Afghanistan plus the U.S. and Russia seek a peaceful solution
to the Afghan crisis, he said.

<HEADLINE> Mysterious Viral Flu Identified in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A mysterious viral flu, which is
prevalent in many parts of Sri Lanka mainly among children, has
been identified by the Medical Research Institute (MRI) here as
"influenza-A," a health ministry spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This flu is more virulent than the common flu, the spokesman
said, adding that blood samples have been sent to the World Health
Organization for final confirmation.
</P>
<P>
He said the complications of "influenza-A" are: high fever,
cough, vomiting, stomach pains, throat infection and liver
problems.
</P>
<P>
According to MRI officials, the spokesman said, those who have
a severe attack may show signs of pneumonia, kidney and liver
complications and if they do not get proper and prompt treatment,
it might result in death.
</P>
<P>
At least 20 children have died of the flu in the past few weeks
in Sri Lanka, according to local press reports.

<HEADLINE> Delegation of Religious Leaders Opposes U.S. Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- An international delegation of
religious leaders voiced their concerns here Tuesday over pending
legislation in Congress that would authorize sanctions against
dozens of countries accused of religious persecution.
</P>
<P>
Six religious leaders from Indonesia, Pakistan, Russia and the
Middle East told a press conference at Capitol Hill that the bill,
sponsored by House Representative Frank Wolf and Senator Arlen
Specter, would "do more harm than good for the very people it
seeks to protect."
</P>
<P>
They came to the United States at the invitation of the
National Council of Churches, a religious organization which is
spearheading a campaign against the "sanctions-oriented"
legislation in America.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the House International Relations Committee approved
by 31 to 5 the "Freedom of Religious Persecution Act" that targets
over 70 countries for export and aid sanctions. Indonesia,
Pakistan, Russia and some Middle East countries would eventually
get hurt if it is enforced.
</P>
<P>
Amier Rais, a Muslim leader from Indonesia, said the bill, if
it became law, would be very difficult to implement and would
build up tension among various religious groups in his country.
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqi people have been living under sanctions for nine
years, and if the United States imposes new sanctions, I don't
know what will happen there," said the only Muslim leader in the
delegation.
</P>
<P>
Two Christian leaders from Indonesia, Soritua Nababan and
Joseph M. Pattiasina, echoed him by warning that such unilateral
sanctions would cause the poor more misery and hardship.
</P>
<P>
Bishop Sammy Azariah, a Christian leader from Pakistan, said
the pending legislation was by nature against Christianity.
</P>
<P>
He added that sanctions would not root out religious
persecution but only make things worse. Promoting mutual
understanding and tolerance would serve the purpose, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Middle East Council of Churches General Secretary Riad Jarjour
voiced the same concern that hostility might be fanned up among
groups of different faiths in the Middle East, the cradle for
three major religions the world over -- Islam, Christianity and
Judism.
</P>
<P>
Anatoly Krasikov, from the International Religious Liberty
Association of Russia, spoke out against what he judges to be
unconstitutional portions of the new laws affecting religious
liberty.
</P>
<P>
Albert Pennybacker, Director of the NCC Washington Office, told
Xinhua that it is likely the bill will get through Congress.
"This is why we must take action," he said.
</P>
<P>
NCC General Secretary Joan B. Campbell also expressed the same
fear. Although the NCC's opposition to the bill is well-known,
Campbell preferred to give the floor to his guests to voice their
concerns at the press conference.
</P>
<P>
The proposed sanctions "would build walls, not break down
walls," between Christians and people of other faiths, and people
of faith and their governments," said an NCC press release.
</P>
<P>
The NCC, along with the Baptist Joint Committee and American
Jewish Committee, vowed to continue to oppose the bill in spite of
some changes in the draft. However, the evangelical Christian
groups have shown support for the bill.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton met some 60 evangelical Christian
leaders at the White House Monday. He urged them to withdraw
their backing.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that such legislation put pressure on the
executive branch to "fudge," or overlook, violations so that it
would not have to carry out the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The international delegation of religious leaders will seek
meetings with Congressmen to express their anxiety face-to-face
during their stay in the United States. It is hard to predict
where the effort might lead.

<HEADLINE> Peace Prerequisite for Economic Cooperation: Pak PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif said Wednesday that an environment of peace and
rapprochement is the essential prerequisite for meaningful
economic cooperation among South Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating a two-day second meeting of commerce ministers of
the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC),
Sharif urged the members states to review their relevant economic
regimes and take a unified approach under SAARC.
</P>
<P>
He said that even a cursory glance at successful regional
models suggests that trade and commerce flourish only when an
enabling environment of peace and rapprochement is created.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said regional economic cooperation is an important
component of Pakistan's development strategy.
</P>
<P>
He noted that under the South Asian Preferential Trading
Arrangement (SAPTA), two successful rounds of negotiations on
trade liberalization have been completed and substantial progress
has been made in the on-going negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Sharif stressed that the reduction and elimination of tariffs
have to be accompanied by parallel efforts to bring down
non-tariff barriers that impede and distort trade.
</P>
<P>
"Harmonization of trade and customs policies and procedures
among the member states is a prerequisite for a unified
collaborative arrangement offering equitable benefits to the
participants," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Failure to do so will only accentuate the present imbalances
to the detriment of our region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, he said, attaches the greatest importance to SAARC.
Since SAARC's very inception Pakistan has contributed to its
evolution as an effective mechanism for promoting the
socioeconomic uplift of the peoples in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said the emergence and success of regional economic
groupings have given a new dimension to the geo-economic landscape
in the contemporary world.
</P>
<P>
He said that although SAARC's population accounts for one-fifth
of the world total, the share of its seven member states in global
trade is a dismal 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Even the intra-regional trade is as low as 3 percent of their
total trade and an estimated half a billion people in South Asia
are living in poverty with income and consumption levels even
below the nationally-defined poverty lines," said Sharif.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need to seriously assess the shortcomings and
take speedy and effective measures.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said developing countries would find it hard to compete
entirely on their own. "For countries such as the SAARC
constituents it is better to pursue the advantages of
globalization and dispel their hardships through regional
cooperation."

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) should take up more business
training to equip themselves for the challenges and opportunities
ahead, a trade promotion official said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
With targeted training in business skills and market knowledge,
SMEs can be more competitive in the international business arena,
said Michael Sze, executive director of the Hong Kong Trade
Development Council (TDC).
</P>
<P>
Sze was speaking at the opening of the SME Training Center
Wednesday. Located at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition
Center Extension, the center is the TDC's latest service to
support the developments of SMEs.
</P>
<P>
"SMEs are facing challenges that stem from intensive worldwide
competition, fast-changing technology, and the uncertainty related
to the Asian financial crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
"While at the same time, they have better business prospects
with global trade liberalization and the emergence of electronic
commerce."
</P>
<P>
To capitalize on these opportunities and face the challenges
ahead, Sze continued: "SMEs need to enhance their business
knowledge, upgrade their operation and management skills, and be
informed of market and technology developments through targeted
training."
</P>
<P>
Designed to offer tailor-made programs to SME personnel, the
SME Training Center provides the hardware facility to these
resources, he said.
</P>
<P>
The newly opened center features modern audio-visual equipment
and facilities. It offer a comprehensive training programs
catering to the needs of SMEs covering five areas: export
marketing and management, China trade, information technology
application and electronic commerce, service industry and hot
trade issues, and business language.
</P>
<P>
Industry and market experts, business consultants, government
officials, professionals and academics, both from Hong Kong and
abroad, are invited to conduct the training. Seminars, workshops,
visits and demonstrations are some of the formats used.
</P>
<P>
In 1991 the TDC started to offer business training to local
companies and more than 80,000 business people have attended. A
total of 130 courses are now organized every year.

<P>
HONG KONG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) signed here Wednesday an air
services agreement with the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
The document "provides the legal framework for the further
development of the air links (between the two parties). With its
conclusion today, the aviation relationship between Hong Kong and
the UAE has entered a new stage," HKSAR's Secretary for Economic
Services Stephen Ip said at the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong-UAE route is one of Hong Kong's busiest air
routes, Ip noted.
</P>
<P>
Now four airlines, namely Cathay Pacific, Air Hong Kong, Gulf
Air and Emirates, offer a total of 37 passenger and all-cargo
services per week between Hong Kong and the UAE, whose air links
could be traced back to two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
The four airlines carried about 140,000 passengers and 32,000
tons of cargo on the route in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, effective from Wednesday, is the 28th air
services agreement signed by Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Acting under the authorization of the Central People's
Government, the HKSAR government is going to conclude air services
agreements with more aviation partners in the near future," the
Hong Kong official added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the establishment of an extensive network of
air services accords is very important for developing Hong Kong's
economic relations with the rest of the world and maintaining Hong
Kong's status as a center of international and regional aviation.

<P>
BRUSSELS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the

<P>
HONG KONG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- More Hong Kong residents
believe that the policy of "one country, two systems" will have a
positive impact, rather than negative, on the relations across the
Taiwan Straits, according to a survey released here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that about 43 percent of those polled are
satisfied with the Chinese Government's practice in implementing
the "one country, two systems" policy, and believe such a policy
has a positive impact on the relations across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Only less than 10 percent gave negative responses.
</P>
<P>
The poll also showed that Hong Kong residents are satisfied
with and confident of the overall effort of the government of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China.
</P>
<P>
About two-thirds of the people interviewed said they are
optimistic about China's economic prospects, according to the poll
results.
</P>

The survey, initiated by the Hong Kong Center for Studies on
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, was conducted by the Hong Kong
Institute of Asia Pacific Studies of the Chinese University of

<HEADLINE> Indian Central Bank Announces Short-Term Objectives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of India
(RBI), India's central bank, announced on Wednesday its short-term
objectives in reviving the persistent sluggish economy, the Press
Trust of India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
Outlining the monetary policy for the financial year of
1998-99, RBI Governor Bimal Jalan said increasing industrial
investment and output and maintaining low rates of inflation are
among the important short-term objectives.
</P>
<P>
The objectives of the Mumbai-based bank also include the
continued pursuit of fiscal reforms, reduction in interest rates
and improvement in credit delivery mechanisms particularly for
agriculture and medium and small sectors, Jalan told governors of
Indian commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in industrial growth in the first half of 1997-98
has turned out to be more persistent and widespread than expected,
the governor said in his statement on monetary and credit policies
for the first half of 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
However, Jalan said, given the rising shares of the industrial
and services sectors in gross domestic product, it is increasingly
evident that the Indian economy has the potential of achieving a
growth rate of 7-8 percent in the medium term.
</P>
<P>
RBI will keep a close watch on liquidity conditions and ensure
that sufficient credit is available to permit the growth potential
to be realized, he said.

HANOI, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam Held a state funeral for
its late veteran leader Nguyen Van Linh in the city of Ho Chi Minh

<P>
Linh, a former general secretary of the CPV, died on April 27
at the age of 82.

<P>
When serving as the general secretary, Phieu said, Linh played
a significant role in mapping out guidelines and policies of
renovation.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Rivals Agree on Formation of Ulema Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Islamic Taliban
militia and the rival Northern Alliance broke a three-day deadlock
in their talks Wednesday after they reached a three-point
agreement on the formation of a proposed Ulema (religious
scholars) Commission.
</P>
<P>
After the two sides wrapped up their six-hour-long sixth
session in the afternoon, Ibrahim Saleh Bakar, OIC assistant
general secretary, announced that the Taliban and the alliance
have agreed to set up the Ulema Commission, which would be
responsible for deciding the future political setup in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is the result of intensive consultations and
discussions between the two delegations and their leaderships in
the spirit of brotherhood, understanding, compromise and
reconciliation, Bakar said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Bakar said, each delegation will submit a
list of Ulema for the commission; neither side will have the right
to veto any names on the proposed list; and the deliberations and
decisions should be completed and implemented in accordance with
the principles of Islamic law.
</P>
<P>
Bakar's announcement won warm applause from all the
participants in the talks of the Joint Steering Committee which is
made up of five Taliban and nine alliance delegates.
</P>
<P>
James Ngobi, acting head of the U.N. Special Commission on
Afghanistan, said, "We are very hopeful that the talks will
continue this afternoon and tomorrow (Thursday)."
</P>
<P>
Ngobi and Bakar are presiding over the first formal talks
between Taliban and the alliance in over a year.
</P>
<P>
The landmark talks, which started Sunday morning, had to be
suspended Monday as the two sides bogged down in the definition of
the Ulema. The talks reopened Tuesday afternoon but the two Afghan
rivals failed to end the deadlock at that session.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Calls for Better Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Ninth National People's Congress
(NPC) Standing Committee Chairman Li Peng said here today that a
socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics will be
basically set up during the committee's five-year term.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the closing meeting of the second session of the
NPC Standing Committee, Li Peng said that the making of laws will
be carried out step by step with good planning and priority given
to the most important areas.
</P>
<P>
The legislative work of the Standing Committee will be
integrated with the major decisions of the Central Committee of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the State Council regarding
the country's reform, development and stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
In particular, laws which ensure sound economic growth
and social security will be given top priority, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
"Practice in the course of our reform and development which
prove to be correct should be fixed in the form of law, and
laws which cannot meet the present needs should be revised or
abolished," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the making of laws should take into full
consideration the opinions of people of various social sectors,
especially NPC deputies.
</P>
<P>
To raise the quality of laws and the efficiency of legislation,
NPC Standing Committee members will examine draft laws in three
stages: initial examination of drafts after listening to the
explanations of those submitting them; in-depth deliberation on
the key points of the drafts after thorough investigations and
studies over periods of two months or longer; and voting
after relevant NPC special committees have revised the drafts.

<HEADLINE> Tens of Thousands of People Visit Chinese Warships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AUCKLAND, New Zealand, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Queens Wharf
here seemed to become smaller on Wednesday as tens of thousands
of people gathered here to visit two visiting Chinese warships.
</P>
<P>
The visitors included old and new generations of immigrants
from the Chinese mainland, compatriots from Taiwan, and New
Zealanders. Even the police on duty on the wharf took the
opportunity to visit the ships.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the ships were open to the public at around 9
a.m., a long queue was formed and had never disappeared since. A
late morning shower had little effect to dampen the enthusiasm of
the visitors.
</P>
<P>
But after 3 p.m., people still streamed in. Many deplored that
they arrived too late and had to be content with getting the
chance to take a photo in front of the destroyer "Qingdao".
</P>
<P>
A deputy commander of "Qingdao" told the reporter that at peak
time, between 50 and 60 people came aboard the ship a minute. A
New Zealand naval liaison officer on the wharf said he estimated
that the number of visitors must be well over 10,000.
</P>
<P>
A pedestrian on the street near the wharf said this was the
first time she saw the wharf was packed with so many Chinese in
Auckland.
</P>
<P>
As the new school term in New Zealand started on Monday, many
parents asked schools to allow their children to take one-day
leave to have a glimpse of the warships.
</P>
<P>
Still some people who were at work on Wednesday took their
lunch break to visit the ships.
</P>
<P>
One visitor, asking not to be identified by name, said he had
to make an excuse to his boss to leave the office and come to see
the warships.
</P>
<P>
Many visitors felt very excited when they were told that
"Qingdao" was entirely designed by China itself and most of the
equipment on the ship was built by China.
</P>
<P>
"Qingdao" and the training ship "Shichang" will end their
four-day visit to New Zealand Thursday morning and sail to Sydney
to continue their three-nation Pacific tour which also includes
Australia and the Philippines.

among East Asian countries could help overcome the economic
difficulties they are facing and promote economic development.
</P>
<P>
Meeting a Chinese business delegation headed by Yu Xiaosong,

<HEADLINE> ADB Should Adapt Itself to Changing Environment: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
should adapt itself to the changing environment by transforming
from a conventional project financier to a broad-based development
institution following the Asian financial crisis, ADB president
Mitsuo Sato said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"That is the most important lesson that we, the bank itself,
have to learn from the currency crisis," Sato said at the opening
session of the 31st ADB annual meeting being held here from April
29 to May 1.
</P>
<P>
To attain the goal of transformation, Sato outlined the
following ways:
</P>
<P>
-- The crisis has underscored the critical importance of good
policies in the development process. A policy concern related to
the overall sustainability of the development process should be
central to the ADB's operation.
</P>
<P>
-- The ADB's assistance should focus on building up
institutional capacities in its developing member countries
(DMCs). Capacity building should address such cross-cutting
issues as achieving good governance in terms of greater
transparency and accountability in governmental functions.
</P>
<P>
-- The ADB needs to continue emphasizing its catalytic role in
enhancing the developmental impact of its operations. Through
private sector activities and the promotion of a private-public
sector partnership in the provision of infrastructure, the ADB can
mobilize significant additional resources.
</P>
<P>
-- The ADB should continue to promote subregional cooperation.
Subregional cooperation will not only enable the parties concerned
to enjoy greater complementarity and economies of scale, but will
also contribute to maintaining regional peace, which by itself is
a worthy investment.

<HEADLINE> Eel Industry Losing Glamor in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The eel growing-and-processing
trade has passed its glamorous age and is facing a possible
drastic decline in south China's Pearl River Delta, a major eel
production base.
</P>
<P>
A ton of standard eels costs 75,000 yuan, down 22.3 percent
from last year's price, according to a recent issue of the China
Special Zones Times.
</P>
<P>
Because the eels were raised one or two years ago when baby
eels and feed were very expensive, farmers lose 12,000 yuan when
selling one ton of standard eels and more than 20,000 yuan when
selling bigger eels, said the Shenzhen-based newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Growing eels was once considered a highly lucrative trade in
the coastal areas of China, with resilient and high demand by the
Japanese. However, the scale of eel-growing has surpassed the
market demand, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
With eel products concentrated in just one market, its prices
inevitably drop, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Like eels, the fate of turtles is similar and their prices are
falling, observers said.
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon is not surprising when market guidance is weak
at a time when China is being transformed from a planned economy
to a market economy, experts said.

<HEADLINE> Securities Depositories in HK, N. Zealand to Be Linked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A reciprocal bilateral linkage
between the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) operated by the Hong
Kong Monetary Authority and the securities depository in New
Zealand will begin operation on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This was jointly announced by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority
(HKMA) and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
These bilateral linkages will help reduce settlement risk by
facilitating cross-border delivery versus payment, besides helping
the development of the securities market.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Yam, Chief Executive of the HKMA, said that following
CMU's link with the securities depositories in Australia in
December 1997, this is another major step forward for cross-border
securities linkages in the region.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the on-going effort to develop the Asian debt
market through enlarging the investor base by facilitating
cross-border securities transactions in a safe and efficient
settlement mode, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Don Brash, governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand,
said: "This linkage is expected to broaden the investor base for
New Zealand's debt market. It will provide a more direct route for
settlements between New Zealand and Hong Kong and help develop
financial markets that are safer and more efficient for
investors".

MACAO, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Macao government is to
establish a new foundation soon to promote academic events,

</P>
<P>
The governor has invited seven people, including Edmundo Ho

managing director of the Macao Tourism and Amusement Company

</P>

The establishment of the foundation was decided last year by

Lisbon. An earlier report on the Macao Daily News said the new
foundation is expected to start operation in the coming summer.
</P>
<P>
The foundation will be supported mainly by the STDM, which
monopolizes Macao's casinos. STDM will have to hand in a certain
proportion of its gross income to the foundation, according to a
contract signed by the Macao Government and the STDM last year.

<HEADLINE> Former U.N. Chief Warns Against Amendment of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Visiting former United Nations
Secretary General Butros Butros-Ghali Wednesday warned against any
attempt to amend the U.N. Resolution 425, saying the resolution
is very clear and needs not to be changed.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks during his meeting with Lebanese House
Speaker Nabih Berry, Lebanese Voice of the People radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Butros-Ghali said that the U.N. should continue making efforts
to secure the implementation of the resolution without any
conditions, rather than to make some change or reinterpret it.
</P>
<P>
He said that the resolution, which calls for an unconditional
Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon, is very clear and
therefore there is no need for amendment, but immediate
implementation.
</P>
<P>
On April 1, Israel finally adopted the 20-year-old resolution,
but demanded the Lebanese government give security guarantees
against cross-border guerrilla attacks before it would pull back
its forces.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon rejected the offer, noting that Resolution 425 calls
for an immediate and unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But, the country is becoming more and more concerned about
the mass media speculation that current U.N. chief Kofi
Annan has set up a working team to discuss the Israeli
offer and intends to make some changes to the resolution to
secure the Israeli pullout.
</P>
<P>
Butros-Ghali stressed the U.N. task as an international
organization, saying it should avoid dual standards in the
implementation of the resolution.
</P>
<P>
The former U.N. chief is attending a conference held here in
his capacity as the secretary-general of the Francophone
Congress, a new post to which he was elected last October at the
summit of the Francophone movement in Hanoi, Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
At the opening session of the 12th conference of the
Francophone on Monday, Butros-Ghali was decorated by Lebanese
President Elias Hrawi with the Order of the Cedars, the country's
highest medal of honor, in a tribute to his support for
Lebanon's struggle to liberate the south from Israeli
occupation.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 allegedly to protect its northern borders from
cross-border guerrilla attacks.

<HEADLINE> Commercial Banks Urged to Increase Number of Housing Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China (PBOC)
today issued a circular urging all commercial banks to support
residential housing construction and consumption by further
increasing loans in this sector.
</P>
<P>
The circular pointed out that residential housing is a new leg
of growth for the national economy. It plays an important role in
restructuring the economy, increasing social demand, solving
residents' housing difficulties and reaching the economic growth
target.
</P>
<P>
All commercial banks should readjust their credit structure and
give more support to the residential housing industry, the
circular stated.
</P>
<P>
The PBOC demanded in the circular that, this year, 15 percent
of the newly increased loans should be channeled into residential
housing.
</P>
<P>
According to the circular, banks with the right to handle
housing loans have been extended from the original Industrial and
Commercial Bank, the Agricultural Bank and the Construction Bank
to all state-owned commercial banks and the Bank of Communications.
</P>
<P>
The circular also urged commercial banks to actively support
residential housing consumption by increasing home mortgages.
</P>
<P>
The PBOC stressed that the management of residential housing
credit business will be further standardized, and the PBOC will
gradually improve related management measures.
</P>
<P>
The commercial banks and branches of the PBOC are urged to step
up supervision and management of residential housing credit
business, to ensure that the credits are used for common
residential housing construction and consumption. No credit should
be used in developing high-grade commercial housing, the PBOC
said.

<HEADLINE> NPC Standing Committee Meeting Closes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Second Session of the
Standing Committee of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC)
today approved three laws and decisions and some name lists.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, presided over
the closing meeting and delivered a speech.
</P>
<P>
One of the most important achievements of the session was the
approval of the 100-member name list of the Preparatory Committee
of the Macao Special Administrative Region, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
Macao's smooth return to China in December 1999 will be the
second great event for the Chinese people since the return of Hong
Kong last year, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the preparatory committee signals an
important step forward in the process of the transition, as it has
a great role to play in this regard, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The session also approved the decision to amend the existing
Forestry Law. The amendments to the law will protect the nation's
forests and ensure the effective management of forestry resources,
Li said.
</P>
<P>
The Law on Fire Control was the only law passed at this
session. The law clarifies the responsibilities of the various
governmental levels and fire-control authorities, Li explained.
</P>
<P>
The law is needed to strictly safeguard public property, public
order and people's lives, Li added.
</P>
<P>
After four days of heated discussion and deliberation in
separate groups, the top legislature also approved the legal
assistance treaty between China and Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
In addition, name lists of senior officials of the Supreme
People's Procuratorate and local procuratorates were passed at
today's meeting.

<HEADLINE> More Gold Reserves Discovered in Qiadam Basin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'NING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese geologists claim that a
300-kilometer-long rocky vein of gold has been discovered in the
southern rim of the Qiadam Basin on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
</P>
<P>
Geologists had previously found rocky gold deposits of 500
kilometers in length on the northern rim of the Qiadam Basin,
according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
Located at the northeastern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau,
Qinghai province, where the basin is, has six prefectures and a
county rich in gold deposits. Its total gold reserves are
estimated at 350 tons, according to officials with the Qinghai
Provincial Geological Prospecting Bureau.
</P>
<P>
However, there is still a great potential to be tapped in
prospecting for gold within the prefectures, which cover an area
of more than 700,000 square kilometers, said Li Changli, an
official with the prospecting bureau.
</P>
<P>
He said that the province has planned to build several large
and medium-sized gold mines on both the north and the south rims of
Qiadam Basin.

<P>
GENEVA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A dope sample provided by Irish
swimmer Michelle de Bruin has shown signs of contamination, the
International Amateur Swimming Federation (FINA) announced in a
statement in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
If it confirmed with the second urine sample, the triple
Olympic champion could be banned for life according to the FINA
rule.
</P>
<P>
The International Amateur Swimming Federation (FINA) said an
International Olympic Committee (IOC) laboratory had reported
"unequivocal signs of adulteration" had been found in analysis of
the out-of-competition test.
</P>
<P>
The federation said the result of the analysis was also
"compatible with physical manipulation".
</P>
<P>
FINA said it has informed Michelle de Bruin and the Irish
Amateur Swimming Federation of the results of the analysis of the
A sample.
</P>
<P>
THe statement added that the analysis of the B sample will be
conducted no later than 18 May, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar pulled
itself higher to close local trading on a positive note after
initially sinking to three-month lows Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The local currency gained ground after inflation figures
released Wednesday appeared to dampen chances of a cut in official
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The unit ended the local session at 64.77 U.S. cents from 64.48
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Early in the session it had dropped to 64.25, its lowest point
since mid-February.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the fall had been partly inspired by comments by
newly appointed Reserve Bank of Australia board member Jillian
Broadbent that she had a bias toward easing monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that the consumer
price index (CPI) rose 0.3 percent in the March quarter, for an
annual inflation rate of minus 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The CPI rose 0.3 percent in the December quarter, when the
annual rate was a negative 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the March quarter CPI figures indicated that
inflation had reached its trough in the current cycle.
</P>
<P>
"The CPI data today shows us that inflation has troughed," a
National Australia Bank bonds dealer said.
</P>
<P>
On the cross-rates, the Australian dollar closed at 85.72 from
85.01 against Japanese yen and at 1.1629 from 1.1539 against
Deutsche marks.

</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The profit growth rate of all national banks of
the United Arab Emirates (UAE) averaged 21.3 percent in 1997 in

<HEADLINE> China's Price Law Embodies Features of Modern Market Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China's first Price Law is
scheduled to go into effect on May 1.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that the law, which is different from a
traditional pricing system in a planned economy and from a
free-wheeling market price system, will embody features of a
modern market economy and have a profound impact on the
development of a socialist market economy with Chinese
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the legislation -- to build and improve a new
pricing system commensurate with a socialist market economy -- has
penetrated the entire law, said Wei Dale, an official with the
State Development Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
China has finished two shifts toward pricing reform -- a change
from setting prices mainly by the state to setting prices mainly
by enterprises, and another change from direct control mainly
relying on administrative means to indirect control mainly through
economic and legal means, said Wei.
</P>
<P>
"The two shifts have laid a realistic theoretical foundation
for formation of a new price-control system which is compatible
with the requirements of a socialist market economy," said the
official.
</P>
<P>
The Price Law, which contains four chapters and 48 articles,
establishes the rights and duties of pricing and rules of
standardized performances for enterprises and the state, two major
players in the market.
</P>
<P>
Under the Price Law, businesses are entitled to the autonomy of
setting prices, which is a prerequisite to form rational market
prices. But whether actual market prices are reasonable or not
will be eventually decided by the fact that enterprises may or may
not participate in fair-market competition.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises are also required to participate in market
competition by way of improving management and reducing production
costs under the principles of fairness, legality and
trustworthiness, instead of engaging in illegal competition,
seeking exorbitant profits or disturbing normal competition.
</P>
<P>
The new Price Law sets standards for pricing competition among
enterprises, especially prohibiting such unfair pricing activities
as pricing monopolies, price-cheating, fictitious lowering of
prices, double prices and price discrimination, said the official.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the new Price Law also urges the state to
reduce interference to the least extent and to exercise indirect
control over macro prices mainly by economic and legal means. It
strictly standardizes the pricing action of the state and clearly
defines the scope and procedures for the state to directly manage
prices, limiting random interference by the state over most of the
market prices.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The members of the Preparatory
Committee for the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR), who
were approved today by China's top legislature, represent broad
social sectors in Macao.
</P>
<P>
The second session of the Ninth National People's Congress
(NPC) Standing Committee passed a name list of 100 committee
members.
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee is a powerful body authorized by the
NPC Standing Committee to be responsible for affairs related to
the establishment of the SAR government as Macao's return to the
motherland draws near.
</P>
<P>
In detail, the group will form an election committee for
selecting the first SAR government and chief executive, set up the
first legislative and judicial bodies, and map out major measures
to ensure a smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen will be chairman of the
Preparatory Committee, and the nine vice-chairmen include Xie Fei,
Ma Man Kei, Liao Hui, Wang Qiren, Wang Yingfan, Ho Hau Wah,
N. G. Fok, Susana Chou and Stanley Ho.
</P>
<P>
To demonstrate the principle of "Macao people governing Macao,"
60 of the committee members are from Macao. Five out of the nine
vice-chairmen are from Macao.
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee has enlisted the elite of various
social groups in Macao, including those within the communities of
administration, legislation, law-enforcement, business, labor,
science and technology, education, cultural undertakings and
religion.
</P>
<P>
To take into consideration the interests of Portuguese people
born in Macao, they also are represented on the committee.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the 40 committee members from the inland areas of
the country are mainly central and local government officials in
charge of Macao affairs, and specialists in economic, social and
cultural fields.
</P>
<P>
Some of them, who used to participate in drawing up the Basic
Law of Macao, are acquainted with the realities of Macao and
expected to offer appropriate solutions to possible problems faced
by the Preparatory Committee.
</P>
<P>
What's more important, most of the members from the inland
areas used to work for the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong
SAR and have a thorough understanding of the principle of "one
country, two systems" and its implementation.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Seeks Aid from Interpol to Seize Wanted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is seeking
assistance from the International Criminal Police Organization
(Interpol) to seize two suspected leaders who masterminded a riot
at the Mwembechai Mosque here late last month, The Guardian
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We'll seek help from the Interpol if the chase of the two
suspects leads us beyond the country's borders," the newspaper
quoted Alfred Gewe, the Dar es Salaam Regional Police Commander,
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The manhunt for Ponda Issa Ponda, the self-styled Secretary of
the Committee for Muslims Rights, and Sheikh Omar Bashir, the
self-proclaimed Chief Imam of the Mwembechai Mosque, was launched
by the police for "stirring up riots, conducting religious
preachings without authority and destroying property," the
police commander said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The two are alleged to be ring leaders of the March 29 riot,
in which hundreds of mobsters took to the street to burn
government vehicles, loot shops and attacked people.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to the search until the two are brought to
justice," Gewe said, adding that the police has announced hotline
numbers to the public so that people can give clues to their
whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the police has started investigation
into a resurgent group which is conducting irate preachings in
several mosques in Dar es Salaam, said the Kinondoni District
Commissioner, Ritha Mlaki.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government has repeatedly warned against
slanderous preachings, calling the people of different religions
to live in harmony with each other and defend the cherished peace
of the country.

<P>
GENEVA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
has pledged to help its members get out of a financial crisis that
swept many Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
"We and the bank owed them assistance," Chairman of the ADB
Board of Governors Nicolas Imboden said at the opening session of
the 31st ADB annual meeting here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that action should be taken at once and the details
could be worked out later, otherwise "the very fundamentals of two
decades of hard work" would be threatened.
</P>
<P>
"The Southeast Asian crisis is more than a financial
crisis: its basic tenants are structural," said Imboden.
</P>
<P>
"The provision of liquidity could not be enough to restore
confidence," the Swiss said. "The structural issues had to be
addressed simultaneously."
</P>
<P>
Imboden reminded the audience that it would not be easy to deal
with structural issues. "Structural issues are difficult to tackle
in the best of times, they become a nearly inhuman challenge in
times of crisis."
</P>
<P>
"This formidable task requires the involvement of all parties,
the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the ADB, and
private creditors, from the very beginning," Imboden stressed.

<HEADLINE> Pollution Control Project Scheduled for Dianchi Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan Province
plans to allocate 100 million yuan to reclaim the heavily polluted
Dianchi Lake, a well-known scenic site in the suburbs of Kunming,
the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
The pollution control project will include construction of an
11-km pipeline to handle domestic and industrial sewage from urban
districts, a two-meter-high stone dam and an aeration tank.
</P>
<P>
Completion of the project in August this year will ensure the
lake is no longer a dumping ground for wastewater discharged by
Kunming residents and enterprises, according to a local government
official.
</P>
<P>
Dianchi, China's sixth largest freshwater lake, covers an area
of 307 square kilometers. Over 3.5 million people live in the
lake valleys. In addition, some 2,000 industrial firms there
pumped 200 million tons of sewage into the lake on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
The lake has been listed as a key state pollution treatment
project over the next two years.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China expects a Tuesday merger
between the largest domestic automotive air conditioning system
manufacturer and a Shanghai-based joint venture to significantly
improve related production levels.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-US venture--Shanghai Delphi Automotive Air
Conditioning Systems Co. Ltd,--involves a three-phase investment
of 88 million U.S. dollars, with the Chinese partner holding a 66
percent equity share.
</P>
<P>
The new joint venture, based in Shanghai's Pudong New Area,
will become the major supplier of automotive air conditioning
systems for domestically manufactured Santana and Buick model
vehicles. The venture also plans to target overseas markets. The
initial annual production capacity has been set at 700,000 units.
</P>
<P>
The former Shanghai Automotive Air Conditioning Systems Plant
was previously the largest domestic manufacturer of automotive
air conditioning systems with 70 percent in market share.

BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China's newsprint market is

demand approaching one million tons this year, according to a

<P>
The newspaper reported that the newsprint market remains

efforts to stem smuggling.

The article alluded to the possibility of downward trend in
prices of newsprint, especially in terms of this year's prices for
art paper. The trend remains a distinct possibility despite the
robust growth in the demand for newsprint used by news

TAIYUAN, April 29 (Xinhua) -- An inauguration ceremony for the
Bodhisattva statue and 500 Buddhist Arhats was held today on Mount
Wutai, a sacred Buddhist mountain in northern Shanxi Province, to
mark the birthday of the Bodhisattva.
</P>
<P>
Buddhists from all over the country, including Hong Kong and
Taiwan as well as Thailand, attended today's ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The statue of the Bodhisattva, personifying supreme wisdom and

Buddhist Arhats, representing close disciples of the Buddha, are

CHANGSHA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China's electronics and
information industry has developed at an annual growth rate of 27
percent since 1990, a national symposium on domestic consumption
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The output value of electronics and the information sector
across China totaled 380 billion yuan in 1997, ranking seventh in
the world, said He Xiuming, an expert on domestic consumption
research, at the symposium which is being held in Changsha,
capital of central China's Hunan Province.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Appeals to Hold Election on Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen Wednesday urged that the country's general
elections be held on schedule, calling it a guarantee of peace,
development and alleviation of poverty in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen made the remarks at a "Peace Day" gathering held at
Olympic Stadium in the capital of Phnom Penh organized by
Cambodia's 42 non-government organizations.
</P>
<P>
Some 10,000 people took part in the gathering, including some
envoys of foreign countries in Cambodia and representatives of
international institutes.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the gathering were some 100 former Khmer Rouge
soldiers who defected to the government recently, including
high-ranking officers Ke Pauk and Picu Cheang.
</P>
<P>
It is Hun Sen's first appearance in nearly two months since his
mother died early last month.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, he also called on all the members of the
Cambodian People's Party (CPP) and the armed forces to support the
National Election Committee, other political parties and all
people in order to ensure the general elections be held freely and
fairly on July 26 as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hun Sen said that he would hand over power in
the most peaceful way at any time if his party is defeated, but if
the CPP wins the elections he will form a new coalition government.
</P>
<P>
He is confident that the elections will be held on schedule
because the atmosphere is much now better than that of 1993.
</P>
<P>
If the elections are to be held under circumstances of no
intimidation and violence, he believed the election result will
certainly be accepted by the Cambodian people and the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, also CPP vice president, has recently been nominated
as the candidate for the premiership of the party by the CPP's
Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to travel to the northern town of Siem Reap to
see King Norodom Sihanouk on May 2 and then make a long-awaited
official visit to Thailand on May 6.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review: Trade Fair Demonstrates Good Export Prospects (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Though the final results of the
83rd China Export Commodities Fair are incomplete, Chinese trade
experts now can heave a sign of relief as preliminary figures
point to record overseas participation and soaring transactions.
</P>
<P>
Known as a "thermometer" of China's foreign trade, the biannual
event which will end Thursday has attracted more than 63,000
overseas buyers from 166 countries and regions since it opened on
April 15, with both figures setting new records.
</P>
<P>
As expected, transactions with countries of Southeast Asia and
the Republic of Korea have dropped, and that with Japan remained
at last year's level, partly due to the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
But, to the surprise of some market observers, the business
volume with Europe, the United States, the Middle East, Africa,
Latin America and other newly emerging markets has sharply
increased.
</P>
<P>
"We can see that the climax of this year's fair has actually
come earlier than usual," said one analyst.
</P>
<P>
One participant of the fair, Liu Xiangdong, assistant to the
minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, said that the
optimistic trend of the fair has enhanced his conviction that
China's exports will grow by more than 10 percent and hit the
200-billion-U.S.-dollar target.
</P>
<P>
His belief is based on more than the fair, of course. In the
first quarter of this year, China's exports rose by 13.2
percent. Though the growth was lower than last year's, it is still
an upbeat figure taking into consideration the impact of the
regional financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Guangzhou export trade fair has become the largest export
trade event in China, hammering more than 20 billion U.S. dollars
of deals every year.

PARIS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The United Nations Security Council allied with the position
of Washington and London in deciding Monday night to maintain the
sanctions against Iraq for at least six more months. The U.S.
ambassador to the U.N. Bill Richardson said prior to the voting that
the sanctions could not be lifted because of insufficient
destruction of biological and chemical weapons by Iraq, an argument
backed by UNSCON chief inspector William Butler.
</P>
<P>
-- Michel Cuingnet, the chief French military advisor serving in
Rwanda from 1987 to 1994, said at the hearing organized by the
National Assembly on Rwanda on Tuesday that during his mission in
the country, he saw how Rwanda changed by plunging into violence and
how the regime of President Juvenal Habyarimana use all means to
"converting latent hostility into permanent acts of aggression
againt the Tutsi minority."
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- In an interview with Le Figaro to mark the 50th anniversary of
the founding of the State of Israel, former Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres said that Israel itself is a "miracle". "The future
of Israel should not rely on its past. We should construct the
future and should take a risk in making peace," said Peres.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Nobel Prize for Peace laureate Elie Wiesel told Le
Figaro that in the present world, fanaticism frightens him
everywhere in the world, Israel included. "I keep away from those
who try to injure and humiliate their fellow human beings. In this
sense, Israel deserves trust," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli singer Noa told Le Figaro that 50 years after
establishment of the country, Israel does not know what it wants --
a Jewish state, a state for the Jews or a democracy impregnated with
Jewish culture.

<HEADLINE> Shanxi Province Channeling Funds into Railway Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Land-locked Shanxi Province,
known as the largest coal producer in China, has rapidly expanded
local railways in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The province has continually sought to raise funds for local
railway construction through multiple channels during the last few
years. It has raised 2.1 billion yuan for several railways.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises, overseas investors and individuals are allowed to
invest in the construction of local railways, and the province has
also set up a construction fund, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
The province is also applying for support from the central
government, and plans to issue stocks and bonds for railway
construction, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Yangquan-Shexian and Xiaoyi-Liulin railways are jointly
owned by Shanxi Province and the Ministry of Railways, according
to local sources.
</P>
<P>
The Wuxiang-Modeng and Qinyuan-Qinxian railways were jointly
built by Shanxi Province, Changzhi City and the Ministry of
Railways.

<P>
Since the current fair is being held when the impact of the
Southeast Asian financial crisis is still uncertain, it is
considered by many as a testimonial to the competitiveness of
Chinese products.
</P>
<P>
"The results achieved so far show that the efforts to adjust
the export commodity structure and opening up new markets are
paying off," market analysts said.
</P>
<P>
One seller standing out at the fair is the Haier Group. To
date, the leading Chinese home appliances manufacturer has already
received orders worth more than 50 million U.S. dollars. Including
orders formerly made, the group has accomplished its annual export
target of 80 million U.S. dollars ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
The Qingdao-based conglomerate has already set up sales offices
in more than 70 countries and regions selling its products under
the "Haier" brand.
</P>
<P>
In the first days of the fair, a Saudi Arabian dealer signed
order worth 9 million U.S. dollars with Haier. "We have more and
more powerful and experienced overseas companies to work as our
sale agents," said Huo Shengjun, general manager of the group's
International Trade Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Another prominent player is Guangdong Province. Benefiting from
the long distance and new markets, the transactions of China's
No.1 exporter soared by 9 percent in the spring fair of 1997. This
time, these new markets accounted for 73 percent of the province's
orders already received, with those with the United States,
Eastern Europe, countries of the Commonwealth of Independent
States rising by 100-to-300 percent.
</P>
<P>
Wal-mart, the world's leading chain store, has showed strong
interest in Chinese commodities during the fair. After pondering
for a few days, the U.S. department-store giant placed orders to
buy glassware from King King company of Qingdao, Shandong
Province. The fair has invited 26 large chain-store groups.
</P>
<P>
"From the fair we can see that the financial crisis in
Southeast Asia will be less an obstacle if we've worked hard,"
said Liu Xiangdong.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Province Exports 7,000 Tons of Maize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Nampula Province in northern
Mozambique has exported over 6,900 tons of maize to the
neighboring Malawi, given its bumper grain harvest in past few
years.
</P>
<P>
The province will also export 300 tons of maize to complete
its contracted goal of 7,200 tons.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed Tuesday by Selemane Girano, an official from
the Mozambique Institute of Cereals.
</P>
<P>
The province exported a total of 25,000 tons of maize
to Angola and Indonesia last year, Girano was quoted by
Noricias as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the current difficulty facing food
export is transport and granary, which had been destroyed in
the 16-year-long civil war.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that agricultural production in Nampula Province
has been on the increase in the recent three years. Last year,
the province produced over 810,000 tons of grain, a 3.4 percent
increase over the year 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
Albright said the U.S. hopes China will join the World Trade
Organization (WTO) at an early date and expects the two nations to
 score progress on this issue in their negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. appreciates China's constructive contributions to the
recent financial crisis in southeast Asia, she said, adding it is
serious and positive for China to have decided not to devalue its
Renminbi.
</P>
<P>
She noted that she expected both sides to maintain close
consultations and cooperation on regional and global financial
issues.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. will observe its promises on the Taiwan issue, the
U.S. secretary of state added.
</P>
<P>
Tang said the two countries have made some progress in their
talks on China's entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese side hopes that the U.S. side fully considers
China's reality as a developing nation, and takes a flexible,
practical and constructive attitude to help the talks achieve
tangible results in an effort to reach an agreement at an early
date," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the non-proliferation issue, Albright said she hoped both
sides maintain the momentum of cooperation to safeguard world
peace and regional security.
</P>
<P>
Tang noted that both China and the U.S. share common interests
in this regard and have conducted useful cooperation.
</P>
<P>
On the existing differences, he said, both sides could
undertake dialogue, seek common points and narrow the gap in the
spirit of seeking common grounds while reserving differences on
the basis of equality and mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the talks, the two foreign ministers signed an
agreement on the establishment of a direct secure telephone link
between the two governments, in line with the provisions described
in the Sino-U.S. joint statement signed last October when
President Jiang visited the U.S., which states the two countries
agree to a Washington-Beijing presidential communications link to
facilitate direct contact.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who arrived here at 11:15 am for a visit as Tang's
guest, will also meet Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen later

<HEADLINE> Mobile Police Deployed to Patrol N. Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Uganda will deploy a mobile
police patrol unit (MPPU) in the northern district of Gulu to
maintain security there, The New Vision reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
MPPU is a force mainly to maintain security within Gulu
municipality. It used to be engaged in fighting against the
rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), but has never been
deployed in the district.
</P>
<P>
Security sources revealed in condition of anonymity that the
security beef-up measure is taken under the situation when LRA
rebels are expected to penetrate into the eastern part of the
district at any time from Kitgum district.
</P>
<P>
Another report reaching here said the LRA rebels have
penetrated into Gulu through an old route used by the rebels 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
The rebels often divided themselves into small groups to operate.
The Ugandan authorities asked the local people to report any
presence of the rebels in their regions.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that a team of 200 to 400 LRA rebels
penetrated from southern Sudan into Uganda in mid-April, but the
government troops have successfully stopped their further advance
in the border areas in Kitgum district.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni is reportedly to visit the
northern district of Gulu to coordinate army operations there.
</P>
<P>
LRA is a rebel group operating in the north of Uganda and had
some 2,000 fighters in the previous years. But now it has only
hundreds of remnants in its ranks.

CAIRO, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Egyptian newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- The World Bank has approved a grant of 270 million
U.S. dollars in assistance to the health reform program in Egypt,
said Egyptian Minister of Health Ismail Sallam on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The program is designed to transfer U.S. medical experience to
the Egyptian medical workers for improving health care in all
parts of the country, in particular in villages and remote areas.
</P>
<P>
-- Egypt's first sophisticated satellite, named Nilesat 101,
was launched into space on board the Ariane-4 rocket on Wednesday,
making Egypt the first Arab and African country to launch an
advanced communications satellite.
</P>
<P>
Al-Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak advised Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Tuesday to deal positively with a
U.S. proposal on Israel's pullout from 13.1 percent of the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
In a two-hour meeting with Netanyahu, Mubarak said a
positive Israeli attitude will pave the way for resuming the
stalled Middle East peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Experts Encourage Ocean Protection Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A number of environmental experts
today called for the adoption of ocean protection measures at the
earliest possible date.
</P>
<P>
They pointed to red tide as an example of nature's revenge on
human pollution.
</P>
<P>
The red tide which has hit the coastal waters in China's
Guangdong Province and Hong Kong has caused losses of 350 million
yuan, including losses of some 50 million yuan in Guangdong,
according to recent statistics.
</P>
<P>
Yang Jiwu, an official with the National Bureau of
Oceanography, said that the frequency of red tide has climbed
since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
"Cases of red tide occur about 40 times annually," said Yang,
adding that red tides are closely related to pollution and
"China's oceanic ecology faces unprecedented pressure along with
rapid economic growth."
</P>
<P>
China empties some eight billion tons of wastewater into the
sea annually, with the volume increasing year by year.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that the large volume of wastewater containing
nitrogen and phosphorus has provided rich nutrients promoting the
growth of algae which is one of the major factors decimating the
fish population.
</P>
<P>
Lu Yaping, an official with the Ministry of Agriculture, said
that overbreeding of fish in a limited area also causes pollution
to the saltwater areas.
</P>
<P>
Geologists point to the fact that excessive reclamation of land
from marshes has also damaged the ocean ecology and is yet another
factor leading to the increasing occurrence of red tides.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Receives "Very Big" Arms Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- South African Defense
Minister Joe Modise said that the total value of the arms
procurement packages for the defense force will probably exceed
10 billion Rand (two billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the opening of the Aerospace
Africa exhibition at an airforce base outside Pretoria, Modise
said the packages offered to South Africa are "very big" and
South Africa may not stick to the originaly 10 billion Rand.
</P>
<P>
Several countries, including Sweden, Germany, France and
Russia, are in the process of preparing tenders to supply
armament systems to South Africa in line with the South African
armed forces' requirements as set out in its Defense Review
published last year.
</P>
<P>
According to Modise, the process is on track and South African
engineers have visited Sweden and Germany in the past few weeks
to test systems offered to South Africa. Aircraft from France
already arrived in South Africa for testing.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the packages are not normal tenders,
stressing "the packages must improve our economic performance...
must create jobs in South Africa to enable people to look after
themselves without having to look at the government for their
survival."
</P>
<P>
He said it appears that this type of counter-trade system is
the only way in which South Africa could attract foreign
investments.

<P>
Since the end of last year, the two countries have gradually
put into practice the common understandings reached by the leaders
of the two countries in Washington by expanding and strengthening
the exchanges and cooperation in wide range of sectors, Tang added.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of President Jiang Zemin, President Clinton
will pay a visit to China by the end of June, Tang said, adding
that this is another important event in the Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that through the joint efforts of the two
countries, President Clinton's China visit will inject new
vitality to the establishment of Sino-US constructive strategic
partnership geared towards the 21st century," said the foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
A series of high level visits and consultation have taken place
recently between the two countries, and new progress has been
witnessed in the bilateral cooperation in some important fields
such as culture, education and public health, Tang noted, adding
that all these will help to create sound atmosphere to ensure
Clinton's China visit a success.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that for the long-term interests of the two
countries, the two sides will consider and handle the bilateral
ties with strategic and far-sighted vision to firmly grasp the
overall situation of the Sino-US relations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tang noted that the two sides should also actively seek the
converging point of the common interests of the two countries,
strictly adhere to the principles enshrined in the three Sino-US
joint communiques and the Sino-US joint statement, and properly
handle the differences of the two countries, especially those on
the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
Albright said that President Jiang's U.S. visit has pushed
forward the development of the bilateral ties and Clinton's China
visit will definitely accelerate the advancement of the US-China
relations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side hopes that through Clinton's visit, the American
people would enhance the understanding of China, she noted.
</P>
<P>
The United States holds that the advancement of the US-China
ties would help to maintain peace and stability in the world, and
contribute to the establishment of the constructive strategic
partnership oriented towards the 21st century between the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Manufacturing Production Slows Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The production of the Philippines'
manufacturing sector slowed down in January 1998 as tighter credit
and other effects of the regional financial crisis began to exert
pressure on the sector, the National Statistics Office said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On a yearly basis, production in January declined by 3.7
percent in value and 12.7 percent in volume compared with the
year-ago-level, according to an interim monthly survey of selected
industries issued by the office Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the statistics office in cooperation
with the Department of Trade and Industry, is designed to provide
flash indicators on the performance of industrial enterprises such
as production, sales and employment.
</P>
<P>
The interim survey will only cover the value and volume of
production and sales in the manufacturing sector while the formal
survey questionnaire is still being finalized.
</P>
<P>
On a month-on-month basis, value of production dropped by 12.4
percent and volume by 15.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
But value of sales in January increased by 37.7 percent and
volume by 24.2 percent compared with the same month last year. On
a monthly basis, value of sales rose by 21.7 percent and volume by
12.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in January production was generally attributed to
higher inventories, tighter credit, lower supplies of raw
materials and anticipation of weaker demand in the coming months,
the statistics office said.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown, following two successive months of double-digit
growth in production volume, indicated that many manufacturers
appeared to have used up remaining inventories of materials due to
expectation of high Christmas consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
The fast growth in sales was attributed to the sales of
carry-over stocks of finished goods, the increase in peso value of
exports and possible hedging in anticipation of higher prices in
the following months.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Fair Attracts Businesses from Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing 83rd Guangzhou
Export Commodity Trade Fair (CECTF) has played host to more than
30,000 business people from Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao, 10
percent more than the previous session, the trade fair organizer
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Orders signed with traders from the three regions are valued at
1.1 billion U.S. dollars, third only to the European Union and the
United States, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Customs statistics, exports from the interior
areas of China to Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan totaled 47.8 billion
U.S. dollars, 26.2 percent of China's total export.
</P>
<P>
Though the economic growth of the three regions slowed down in
the latter half of last year because of the financial crisis in
Southeast Asia, they are expected to have moderate growth this
year, said Zhou Shijian, a foreign trade expert of China.
</P>
<P>
Tin Ka Kang, chairman of the Hong Kong-based Tin's Trading
company, placed a big order for toys and games at the current
session.
</P>
<P>
"Some of them will be sold in Hong Kong while the majority will
be re-exported to North America and Europe," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has been the largest re-export center for Chinese
products. Exports via Taiwan have also increased by a big margin
since a direct flight between both sides of the Taiwan Straits

<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, one of the poorest areas in China, has emerged
as the country's major sugar producer with an annual output of 2.2
million tons.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent issue of the China Economic Herald
Tribune, the region has led the nation in sugar output for five
consecutive years and produces about a third of the nation's
total output.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi is currently home to 109 sugar refining companies,
with the industry's total output value accounting for nine percent
of the region's total industrial output value. The sugar industry
also accounts for 10 percent of the region's annual fiscal income.
</P>
<P>
The skyrocketing growth of the region's sugar industry has
helped some 4.5 million people shake off poverty over the past 10
years, according to the paper.

<HEADLINE> More People Prefer to Live in Xinjiang's Rural Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Last year, 27-year-old Yang Wanxin
paid 3,000 yuan (361 U.S. dollars) for a rural residence card to
resettle his family in his home village.
</P>
<P>
Only seven years ago Yang, a farmer from Manasi County of
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, spent 6,000 yuan to buy a
non-rural residence card which enabled him to move to the county.
</P>
<P>
Both of his decisions were economically motivated. Yang moved
to the county because he wanted to have a better-paying job. He
returned home because his 200-yuan monthly salary from the
county's tobacco company was much less than what he can earn as a
farmer.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Yang and his family contracted two hectares of land
which brought him more than 20,000 yuan of income.
</P>
<P>
In Manasi County, where farmers' per capita income has ranked
first for nine consecutive years in Xinjiang, more and more
farmers are returning.
</P>
<P>
"Too many people want to have a rural residence card and settle
down at our township. But we dare not accept all the demand
because our arable land resource is limited," said Li Xiqing, head
of the township.
</P>
<P>
"If we open further, then each residence card can fetch 10,000
yuan," he added.

BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China and the U.S. agreed that

States should make joint efforts to further accelerate the
development.
</P>
<P>

which, she holds, will be beneficial for both sides and will
help promote the development of bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> Imelda Marcos Withdraws From Philippine Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Imelda Marcos, the widow of former
Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos, on Wednesday announced her
formal withdrawal from the May 11 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
The former first lady made the announcement before a rally of
hundreds of her supporters in downtown Manila, according to a
Manila radio report.
</P>
<P>
Imelda Marcos, a member of the House of Representatives, said
she was hoping the next president would free her from her
disastrous plight, referring to her recent conviction of a graft
charge and government's efforts to recover Marcos' hidden wealth.
</P>
<P>
According to the radio report, her party, Kilusang Bagong
Lipunan, was strongly opposed to her withdrawal from the race.
</P>
<P>
Imelda Marcos told her disappointed supporters that she would
just help her son Ferdinand Jr. in his bid for the governorship of
Ilocos Norte province in the northern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The young Marcos is running under the United Opposition led by
Vice President Joseph Estrada.
</P>
<P>
Imelda Marcos, who has been among the tail-enders in many
popularity polls, has yet to make clear whom among the remaining
10 candidates she will support in the presidential polls.
</P>
<P>
Political observers narrowed down her choice between front
runner Estrada and Lower House Speaker Jose de Venecia of the
ruling Lakas-NUCD party.
</P>
<P>
On May 11, the country will elect the president, the vice
president and more than 150,000 members of national and local
legislative bodies.

KAMPALA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Four foreign investors have been
pre-qualified to bid for 51 percent shares in Uganda Telecom
Limited (UTL), the New Vision paper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The four bidders are Telecom Malaysia Berhad, Telecom South
Africa and two consortiums, with the first two bidding for the
full 51 percent shares on offer.
</P>
<P>
Portugal Telecom International, Aga Khan Fund for Economic
Development, and Alta Telecom International form a consortium. Of
the shares on sale, they want to buy 50, 40 and 10 percents
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Another consortium of Worldtel and Detecon is pre-qualified to
bid for 70 and 30 percent of the shares.
</P>
<P>
"With the recent issuance of a second national operator's
licence to the Mobile Telephone Networks Consortium, the
privatization of the UTL marks the final stage of the
government's telecommunications reform strategy," said Anne
Mugisha Bwomezi, the spokesperson of the Privatization Unit.

Issues about economic stability, environmental protection,

Albright also spoke highly of the efforts US and China have
made in limiting the effects of the Asian financial crisis, which
she said will be further discussed while meeting Tang later.
</P>
<P>
In responding to a question about Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan,

they are criminals. They both went to the US on bail for medical
treatment at their own requests with approval by the Chinese
judicial department in accordance with relevant Chinese laws.
</P>
<P>
If they want to come back, they must also go through relevant
legal procedures, Tang added. China is speeding up the improvement
of the democratic and legal system, and is making efforts
to govern the country according to law. The bail of Wei and Wang
complies with this principle.

Awang's home was recently connected to the village's new spring

JERUSALEM, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Israel and Poland have agreed
to conduct a new series of missile tests in Poland for upgrading
Polish helicopters, local daily The Jerusalem Post reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Israeli defense officials as saying that a
committee in this regard will be set up in line with a memorandum
of understanding signed last year, under which Israel would help
Poland equip its Huzar helicopter with Israeli anti-tank missiles
and avionics.
</P>

The officials said the committee, to be formed by May 15, will

transfer to Poland under the 800-million-U.S. dollar upgrade
contract.
</P>
<P>
For their part, the report said, Polish officials assert that
the committee would focus on conducting a series of tests by
Israel's NT-D anti-tank missiles.
</P>
<P>
Polish Defense Minister Janusz Onyszkiewicz has said the NT-D
tests conducted in January 1997 in Israel were inconclusive about
whether they fulfilled Poland's needs. He said the new tests
should be conducted in Poland.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli officials said they would not object to moving the
test site to Poland.

<HEADLINE> Anecdotes Abound of Beijing University's 100-year History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- As Beijing University (Beida)
celebrates its centennial anniversary, many anecdotes and
reminiscences of Beida's early days are becoming a popular
conversation topic.
</P>
<P>
"Although there is no lack of spirit of rebellion in Beida, the
university put emphasis on rules when it was founded one century
ago," said Chen Pingyuan, a well-known professor in the Chinese
Department at the school.
</P>
<P>
Regulations at the school, which was China's first
comprehensive state university, stipulated that students should
answer questions in turn in class, and should not rush to speak,
according to Chen, who has studied Beida's history.
</P>
<P>
Regulations also forbade spitting on the ground, and anyone
caught spitting faced severe punishment, added Chen.
</P>
<P>
"From those regulations, people today must realize that 100
years ago, it was rather hard for the students to change their old
living habits," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The foundation of Beijing University was regarded as the start
of China's modern higher education. Some historical records show
that most of the students in the university's early days came from
families of high officials and noble lords.
</P>
<P>
"On the playground, teachers of sports called with the greatest
care 'Your Excellency, turn left,' or 'Halt, Your Excellency',"
said Chen.
</P>
<P>
He said that the original site of Beida was beside the palace
of China's last dynasty, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), and Beida
was then regarded as an imperial university. But during 1920s and
1930s the articles describing the environment of the university
mentioned little about the palace.
</P>
<P>
"The popular consciousness was increasing in the university,"
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He then compared Beida with another famous university, Qinghua
University (translated as Tsinghwa in its early days).
</P>
<P>
"Students in Tsinghwa usually outperformed those in Beida in
examinations. But Beida encouraged students' spirit of originality
and independence," he said, "Students and teachers in Beida valued
personality highly."
</P>
<P>
At that time, many poor students managed to dodge tuition to
attend lectures, thanks to the professors who were disdainful to
call the roll in class.
</P>
<P>
"The names of those poor students could not be found on the
membership rosters of Beida. But the unregistered students played
a unique role in spreading Beida's spirit and building up Beida's
reputation," Chen said.

<P>
TAIYUAN, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The government of north China's
Shanxi Province has launched a months-long campaign urging local
officials at various levels to reduce bureaucracy.

The provincial government has since announced a decision that
local departments should review local bureaucratic practices
between April and July in order to curtail cases involving
dereliction of duty.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi Governor Hu Fuguo said that Shanxi has
a large number of hardworking and pioneering officials, but also
noted that a number of bureaucrats fail to exhibit
concerns for the well-being of the masses.
</P>
<P>
Those engaged in excessive bureaucracy, no matter how their
position, should be punished according to the law, said Hu.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Govt Companies Buy Stakes in Bangkok Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Two Singapore government
investment holding companies have taken what is described as
"small but significant" stakes in Bangkok Bank, the largest
commercial bank of Thailand, the Business Times reported here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Business Times report said that a Bangkok Bank spokesman
confirmed the purchase by the Government of Singapore Investment
Corporation (GIC) and Temasek Holdings, but declined giving
details.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok Bank President Chartsiri Sophonpanich said that details
of the buyers were confidential until the bank's Board of
Directors had been informed and had given the necessary approvals
regarding the recent sale of 470 million new Bangkok Bank shares.
</P>
<P>
Besides the two Singapore companies, buyers are said to include
Japan's Sakura Bank, which bought about 30 million shares or a two
percent stake, and a consortium of Taiwanese companies comprising
China Development Corporation, the President Group and Tunrex
Petrochemicals.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Bank had flogged the new shares at 93 baht (about
2.4 U.S. dollars) each to international investors in an effort to
recapitalize the bank which had been badly hit by its heavy
exposure to Thailand's property sector, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The 470 million shares for the international market is expected
to boost the bank's foreign stake to 46 percent from 25 percent
new and will raise the number of issued shares from one billion to
1.47 billion on completion, it said.

<HEADLINE> NATO Meeting Calls for More European Responsibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Most officials attending the
NATO and partners international meeting stressed that European
countries should take more security responsibilities in Europe
while keeping the presence of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The officials made the remarks at the two day meeting between
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and its partners, which
ended Tuesday in Haiko, Finland.
</P>
<P>
Klaus-Peter Klaiber, the Vice Secretary General of NATO, told
the meeting that NATO is seeking good political and military
relationship with its member countries of the Partership for Peace
Program.
</P>
<P>
He said the military alliance has kept its door open to those
applying for membership, but it won't hold any membership
negotiations before the summit meeting to be held in the summer of
1999.
</P>
<P>
On relations between the European Union (EU) and NATO, he said
the EU was equally as important as NATO, since the security issue
not only concerned the military, it also dealt with economic,
social and environmental aspects.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held within the framework of the Euro-Atlantic
Partnership Council. About 60 representatives from 30 countries
including NATO members, north European and Baltic countries and
Russia attended the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Explosion in Gas Field Panic in Bangladesh Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people fled Sylhet,
northeast Bangladesh, for safety since Tuesday afternoon following
a leakage from a gas field, about four kilometers north of the
town, reports reaching here Wednesday said.
</P>
<P>
Local people were gripped by fear after large patches of gas
were seen oozing out at the Jalalabad gas field in Lakkhatura,
making loud noise within the vicinity of the area, and an
evacuation alert was given by local government for people residing
within one kilometer of the spot.
</P>
<P>
The alert was withdrawn several hours later after the gas
leakage was reportedly sealed. But fire fighters in the town
remained stand-by there at the site, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The spot of gas leakage was only 250 yards from the Sylhet
Osmany Airport road. All traffic through the road was stopped, and
the national airlines, Biman, canceled its last flight form Sylhet
to Dhaka Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The gas field was operated by the Occidental, a U.S. oil
company. "It (the gas) came out of a well where there were
absolutely no reasons for such an incident," a senior company
official was reported as saying.
</P>
<P>
On June 15 last year, a huge explosion occurred at a gas well
at Magurchhara in Moulvibazar district, some 170 northeast of
here, which the U.S. company was drilling. The burnt-out site was
sealed off early this year and abandoned subsequently.
</P>
<P>
An expert hinted that only negligence could cause such a
blow-out in a well drilled before. It was highly unusual for a
"workover well" to have such an accident, another expert was
quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Military to Take Over Poll Duty in Philippine Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Government soldiers and policemen
will take over poll duties in several communities in a southern
Philippine province after teachers there refused to serve as
election inspectors in the upcoming general polls, local
television reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lawyer Hector Masna, regional director of the Commission on
Elections (Comelec), was quoted as saying many public school
teachers in Lanao del Sur province in Mindanao refused to serve
during election day for "security reasons".
</P>
<P>
Some other public school teachers are prohibited from acting as
election inspectors because they are close relatives of some
candidates, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's election code, election inspectors shall be
teachers from public schools, or teachers from private schools and
employees in the civil service in case there are not enough public
school teachers.
</P>
<P>
Masna said that detailing lawmen as election officials will
ensure an orderly and peaceful voting in the traditionally hot
spot towns in Lanao del Sur.
</P>
<P>
But he said the campaign period in the province was "unusually
quiet" as not a single election-related violence has been
reported.
</P>
<P>
In the 1995 midterm elections, a failure of elections was
declared in at least 381 communities in Lanao del Sur and
neighboring Lanao del Norte province. But this was not enough to
affect the results of the senatorial elections.
</P>
<P>
The election law stipulates that the Comelec can declare a
failure of elections "on account of natural calamities, violence,
terrorism, fraud or other analogous causes."
</P>
<P>
Comelec officials earlier have predicted a failure of elections
in many parts of the country, particularly in Mindanao, owing to
volatile peace and order situation. Such a failure may lead to a
delay in the proclamation of winning candidates, including the
next president.
</P>
<P>
The Comelec has already identified Central Mindanao, Northern
Mindanao and the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao as the most
violence-prone areas in the country during the May 11 elections.
</P>
<P>
Comelec officials said Mindanao is historically a problem area
because of the presence of rebel forces such as the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) and the Abu Sayyaf, as well as the
presence of highly partisan police, military and local officials.
</P>
<P>
But President Fidel Ramos declared Tuesday there will be no
failure of national elections in May, saying he expects
election-related violence will not escalate.
</P>
<P>
Citing police and military reports, Ramos said atrocities
during the current election season are fewer than in previous
elections.
</P>
<P>
According to him, less than 12 people have been killed in
election-related incidents since January this year, compared to
the more than 100 election-related deaths in the 1992 general
elections.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Approves Decrees to Boost Liquidity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet has approved
four executive decrees to boost liquidity for the cash-strapped
private sector.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai said after a 12-hour marathon
cabinet session Tuesday that the decrees would be submitted to
parliament for approval on may 13.
</P>
<P>
Two decrees expand the role of the asset management corporation
and the financial restructuring authority, according to
Wednesday's Bangkok Post.
</P>
<P>
A third will allow the central bank's Financial Institutions
Development Fund (FIDF) to issue long-term local bonds, while the
fourth gives authority to the Finance Ministry to issue bonds in
international markets.
</P>
<P>
Under the decrees, global bonds worth 5 billion u.s. dollars
will be issued over the next 30 months, Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanhaeminda told reporters after the cabinet session.
</P>
<P>
The funds will considerably boost liquidity in the economy,
Tarrin said, adding that details on allocation of the funds will
be considered by the cabinet later.
</P>
<P>
The bonds will be used to help establish a social safety net
and fund other programs to ease the impact of the economic crisis
on the poor.
</P>
<P>
The decrees envisage the restructuring of the short-term
borrowings of the FIDF into long-term ones through the issue of up
to 500 billion baht (13.5 billion U.S. dollars) worth of domestic
bonds over the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
"The problems of the fund has seriously unbalanced the
short-term money market, affecting liquidity and causing interest
rates to stay high," Tarrin said.

MACAO, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Air Macao transported more than two
million passengers by Tuesday night, a press release from the
company said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The air company has seen a fast-growing business since the
Macao International Airport was inaugurated in November 1995. It
received its millionth passenger in May last year.
</P>
<P>
Air Macao reported a net profit of 79 million patacas (about
10 million U.S. dollars) in 1997, the first profitable year since
its establishment.
</P>
<P>
It now has a fleet of six airbuses. The 7th aircraft will
arrive in Macao on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The carrier is now operating air routes to Beijing, Shanghai,
Xiamen, Qingdao, Wuhan, Fuzhou, Nanjing in China's interior areas
and Taipei, Kaohsiung in Taiwan. It also has regular flights to
Manila and Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Its 8th destination in China's inland -- Chongqing, will be
inaugurated on Thursday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Compaq Tops in World PC Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Compaq gripped its position
as the top PC maker both in the United States and the world,
according to the first quarter's shipments.
</P>
<P>
With 1.33 million shipments, the PC maker's U.S. market share
grew to 17.1 percent in the first quarter of the year, up from
13.3 percent a year ago, said California-based market research
firm Dataquest.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide, Compaq shipped 2.64 million PCs and enjoyed a 12.5
percent market share, up from 10.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The industry as a whole grew at 14.1 percent, down from 15.4
percent a year ago. As has been the case for some time, the
top-tier companies accounted for most of the growth.
</P>
<P>
IBM's U.S. shipments in the quarter increased just 10.1
percent, far behind the growth rate of other top PC-makers. Compaq
grew by 49 percent, and No. 2 Dell by 63.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that part of Big Blue's problem was its late entry
into the market for PCs priced below 1,000 U.S. dollars. The fact
that the company has been unable to sustain a long-term marketing
strategy adds to its problem. Its share in the U.S. market slipped
below 8 percent, dropping it from a tie for third place to
fifth. Worldwide, IBM still is No. 2 behind Compaq, but it is
threatened after showing a meager 3.3 percent increase in
first-quarter global shipments.
</P>
<P>
At present growth rates, both third-place Dell and fourth place
Hewlett-Packard, with 1.54 million and 1.33 million shipments
respectively, soon could pass IBM which shipped 1.6 million PCs.
</P>
<P>
The only top PC-maker to perform worse than IBM in the first
quarter was Packard Bell based in California's Sacramento. The
company began losing momentum when other companies jumped into the
low end of the retail market.
</P>
<P>
Apple Computer shipped 650,000 PCs worldwide in the first
quarter, putting it well below the top five.

<HEADLINE> Russia Hails Removal From EU Non-market List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Vladimir Rakhmanin said on Tuesday that Russia welcomes the
European Union's decision to stop including Russia in the
"non-market economy list".
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency said Rakhmanin hailed the decision on
Monday as the EU's concrete contribution to the implementation of
the EU-Russia Partership and Cooperation Agreement.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out however that although leaders of the EU
Commission admitted Russia had made substantial progress in its
transition towards a market economy, the decision did not denote
the EU's full recognition of Russia as a nation with a market
economy.
</P>
<P>
The non-market economy list was incorporated as part of the
EU's anti-dumping policy. Removal also indicates openess in the
domestic market when seeking evidence of dumping.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmanin hoped the EU would not link such recognition with
other problems that had arisen in the ongoing trade negotiations
between Russia and the EU.
</P>
<P>
The Partership and Cooperation Agreement between Russia and the
EU was signed in June 1994 and came into effect on December 1,
1997.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the EU has become a major trade partner to
Russia. However, it has never recognized Russia as a market
economy nation.
</P>
<P>
Instead, it has adopted anti-dumping policies against various
commodities produced by Russia.
</P>
<P>
In response, Russia decided to impose a quota of 100 million
U.S. dollars on EU carpet exports starting from this year. The EU
then decided in March to postpone its discussion on the status of
Russia's market economy.
</P>
<P>
On March 30, after three years' negotiations, the two sides
signed an agreement on the mutual lifting of textile import
quotas, which facilitated the EU's move to remove Russia from the
"non-market economy list".

</P>
<P>
The shipwreck happened when the network was taking 17

<P>
The illegal workers had been charged six thousand U.S. dollars
to be taken from Ecuador to the United States. Half of this was
handed over at the beginning of the trip, and the rest was to be
settled when they reached their destiny.

<HEADLINE> Former FBI, CIA Director to Review IRS Division </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Amid harsh criticism of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Clinton administration on
Tuesday appointed former FBI and CIA Director William Webster to
review the practices of the agency's criminal investigation
division.
</P>
<P>
The Senate Finance Committee is holding hearings this week
focusing on the division, which has been accused of abuses of
power, including armed raids of taxpayers' homes and businesses on
flimsy pretexts.
</P>
<P>
Webster, at a news conference announcing his appointment,
promised to complete his review by the end of the year. It is to
begin by mid-May and cover the division's standards for enforcing
criminal laws, the relationship between the division and senior
IRS managers, the impact of its investigations on taxpayers'
rights and its management practices.
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and IRS Commissioner Charles
O. Rossotti said they would take Webster's recommendations
seriously.
</P>
<P>
"We have an intense focus on doing what needs to be done to
reform the IRS into the kind of IRS the American people deserve,"
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Webster, 74, a Missouri Republican, a former federal judge,
took over at the FBI in 1978 and served during the Carter and
Reagan administrations before moving to the CIA during the Reagan
and Bush administrations.
</P>
<P>
Webster said he had no judgment yet about the validity of the
complaints against the IRS and promised an impartial review.
</P>
<P>
Webster's task force, which will draw aides from other law
enforcement agencies, including the FBI and the Secret Service, is
part of a package of initiatives designed to improve the IRS
criminal investigations division.

<HEADLINE> Explosion in Gas Field Panic in Bangladesh Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Residents in Sylhet, northeast
Bangladesh, were in a great panic following an explosion on
Tuesday night in a gas field about four kilometers north from the
town, press reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Local people said they heard a bang at about 7:30 p.m. local
time and then felt offensive smell and eyestrain.
</P>
<P>
The district administration had drawn up an emergency plan to
evacuate the local people fearing a great fire incident after the
explosion. No casualties were reported so far.
</P>
<P>
The Jalalabad gas field in Lakkhatura was operated by the
Occidental, a U.S. oil company.
</P>
<P>
A company official was quoted as saying that the accident might
have occurred due to malfunction of the instruments used for
drilling, and that measures had been taken to stop possible fire
from the leakage.
</P>
<P>
The leakage of gas was first noticed Tuesday morning, but the
Occidental company did not take measures then, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
People in the city area, who began feeling the smell of
condensed gas in the afternoon, became panicky and started leaving
their houses. All shops were closed down.
</P>
<P>
Local government was warning people about a great danger,
possibly a fire in the area, and the police and fire brigade,
fencing the gas-leaking spot, asked people to take refuge in safe
places. The national airlines, the Biman, also canceled its last
flight to and from Sylhet.
</P>
<P>
This was the second accident involving the Occidental within
less than one year in the country.

<HEADLINE> Italy Adopts New Measures to Cut Traffic Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Time shares in "green" cars and
company managers in charge of workers' commuting arrangements are
being considered by the Italian government to cut pollution in the
country's cities.
</P>
<P>
Italy's environment, transport and health ministries have put
forward the ideas for a possible law to reduce the number of
petrol-powered cars on the roads.
</P>
<P>
According to the proposals, city councils in high-pollution
areas will promote "multi-ownership" of electric or gas-powered
city cars.
</P>
<P>
The scheme will encourage people to buy a "time-share" in the
green automobiles, in the same way that many people buy two weeks
a year in a villa by the sea.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of the Environment, which will provide most of the
financing for the plan, also intends to introduce incentives
encouraging the public to buy electric mopeds and thus further
reduce exhaust emissions.
</P>
<P>
The scheme will also reduce the number of cars which carry only
one person to and from the work-place.
</P>
<P>
Companies and public agencies with more than 300 employees in
high-congestion areas will have to prepare yearly home-to-work
commuting plans for their workforces.
</P>
<P>
A special manager would be needed to oversee workers' commuting
arrangements and companies would have to organize timetables to
allow as many people as possible to give each other lifts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile all sections of government and public administration
that have cars at their disposal will have to gradually replace
petrol-powered ones with non-polluting ones.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of "green" cars used by the state should thus
start at five percent this year and rise steadily to 50 percent by
the end of 2003, according to the plan.
</P>
<P>
The scheme also requires all regional governments to adopt a
clean-air plan by the end of June next year.

<HEADLINE> Villagers Pin Prosperity Hopes on Knowledge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Six villagers in
Liuxinzhuang Village are at present engaged in the study of
postgraduate courses in the conviction that knowledge will bring them
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The village, situated on the outskirts of this capital of north
China's Hebei Province, has become relatively well off in recent
years as a result of the introduction of advanced technology and
skilled people.
</P>
<P>
The village, which used to rely on state relief funds, earned a
total net income of 260 million yuan last year, with the per
capita annual income reaching 5,000 yuan. The villagers attribute
this success to the country's reform policy.
</P>
<P>
Yin Bingxu, secretary of the village committee of the Chinese
Communist Party, said, "With the gradual shift of rural
enterprises to high-tech industries, we were plagued by the fact
that we could not effectively handle the situation, as a result of
a lack of technical knowledge."
</P>
<P>
Yin became a correspondence student of the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences last June and now majors in business management.
</P>
<P>
"The study of business management has broadened my vision,"
said Yin, who now often impresses foreign business people with his
negotiation skills.
</P>
<P>
Influenced by Yin, five other villagers have also taken up
postgraduate courses.
</P>
<P>
Yin Jian, director of a local enterprise, led his company out
of a dilemma last year by bringing down production costs by over
one million yuan, thanks to the advanced managerial expertise he
learned from a correspondence course.

<HEADLINE> Aborigine Leader Warns of Desertification in Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Peru's native populations are under
threat and hundreds of thousands of hectares of jungle are turning
to desert because of colonization, a native leader warned on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Deforestation since the early 1980s has destroyed at least 1.5
million hectares of jungle land in central Peru while the
provinces of Chanchamayo, Satipo and Oxapampa were rapidly
becoming deserts, said Guillermo Naco Rosas, president of the
Ashaninka Emergency Commission.
</P>
<P>
"Entire forests are disappearing," he said, adding that
Ashaninka aborigines may also disappear with the alteration of
their natural environment.
</P>
<P>
Naco Rosas noted that in Satipo alone, half a million hectares
of jungle land has turned to semi-desert.
</P>
<P>
In the department of Junin, a large number of trees along the
Perene river were felled by settlers in a move authorized by the
Ministry of Agriculture, said Naco Rosas.
</P>
<P>
"To settle in a specific place and to create crop fields,
settlers cut trees indiscriminately destroying several types of
timber and medicinal herbs which are not easy to replace," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that many varieties of timber such as mahogany are
being devastated due to exploitation concessions authorized by the
Ministry of Agriculture.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Suggests Reduction of Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela suggested on Tuesday
other oil producing nations to reduce their production by 500,000
barrels a day to prop up the falling international oil price.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela, Mexico and Saudi Arabia signed an agreement in March
to reduce their production by 200,000 and 300,000 barrels per day
respectively to cope with the outbreak of an oil pricing crisis.
</P>
<P>
The production cut once stabilized the market, but 500,000
barrels per day is the amount required by the market, said
Minister of Energy and Mines of Venezuela Erwin Arrieta.
</P>
<P>
He said Venezuela will have to decrease it's production by 10
percent to reach that amount.
</P>
<P>
New cut may be agreed upon by the countries before the
conference of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) in June, the minister said.

<HEADLINE> CIS Economic Unification Too Early, Kuchma Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
says it is "too early" to build up a unified economic zone within
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).
</P>
<P>
In a news conference here on Tuesday, the president's news
secretary, Alexandr Maidannik, said the president favored the
buildup of a unified zone first within individual economic fields
such as agriculture, transport and energy.
</P>
<P>
Maidannik said Ukraine viewed the CIS as a "mechanism for
multilateral consultation and negotiation", which should be
enriched by bilateral contacts.
</P>
<P>
He said it was the president's point of view that the CIS
should give play to its functions in settling free trade and
production cooperation issues. Military cooperation, however, was
best carried out in a bilateral manner.
</P>
<P>
Peace-keeping actions, the president believed, should firstly
follow the guidelines put forward by the United Nations and the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The news secretary said Ukraine was also against creating a
unified information or ecological space within the CIS. But it
intended to back the suggestion by Kazak President Nursultan
Nazarbayev for holding a meeting on reform of the CIS.
</P>
<P>
President Kuchma and Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko flew
to Moscow on Tuesday afternoon for the April 29 summit attended by
CIS state heads.

CARACAS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's foreign reserves fell
from 15.02 billion U.S. dollars to 14.67 billion dollars in less
than two weeks, a drop of 2.33 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new figures showing the country's reserves on Monday as
compared to April 17, were released by the Central Bank of
Venezuela (BCV).
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that by the end of March, foreign currency
reserves reduced by over 1.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The decline in reserves has been attributed to the payment of
Venezuela's foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
The BCV has come under strong criticism for applying a
mechanism which depresses the rate of exchange.
</P>
<P>
Financial analysts have declared that if the BCV maintains the
nominal depression of the exchange rate, it will eventually
trigger an overvaluation of between 50 and 60 percent by the end
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
If the forecast is correct, a strong devaluation in the first
quarter next year is expected.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Ties Aid to Manila to Banking Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) has made it
clear to the Philippine government that it is prepared to cut its
financial assistance to the country if the government fails to
implement reforms in the banking sector.
</P>
<P>
In a country assessment report published here Wednesday, the
World Bank indicated that it would cut down to just 750 million
U.S. dollars its assistance to the Philippines from the pledged
level of 1.25 billion dollars if the country fails to undertake
banking reforms attached to an earlier WB banking reform loan.
</P>
<P>
A World Bank mission is expected to arrive here Wednesday to
negotiate with the Philippine government on conditions for the
release of the 300-million-dollar Bank Sector Adjustment Loan.
</P>
<P>
Among the conditions are an amendment of the country's Bank
Secrecy Law and a reserve requirement on foreign deposit units.
But they were opposed by the Central Bank of the Philippines,
leading to a delay in the release of the loan.
</P>
<P>
According to the WB report, any failure or lapse on the
Philippine government's part to implement policy reforms will
result in an even further drop in WB assistance to the country to
a low of 200 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Finance Secretary Salvador Enriquez admitted earlier
that negotiations for the banking reform loan have hit a snag
following the reluctance of the central bank to agree to reforms
being pushed by the World Bank.

</P>
<P>
In her forecast as chief economist with the federation, former
Swedish finance minister Anne Wibble added that inflation is
expected to rise to 0.9 percent this year. She said that Sweden
will stay on a plateau for a while and then growth will be
dampened anew.
</P>
<P>
Anne Wibble said that her forecast was " relatively optimistic"
and could easily turn gloomier if Japan failed to fix its
financial woes on time.
</P>
<P>
According to the forecast, Swedish households' disposable
income would continue to rise this year, boosting private
consumption by 2.4 percent in 1998 and 1.8 percent in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Ronaldo Gets Two-game Suspension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Inter Milan star Ronaldo was given a
two-game suspension Tuesday by the Italian League for criticizing
the referee who worked his club's controversial loss at Juventus
of Turin.
</P>
<P>
Inter Milan coach Luigi Simoni and Brazilian midfielder Ze
Elias are both out for the rest of the league season with
three-game suspensions while Chile's Ivan Zamorano will sit out
two matches.
</P>
<P>
The disciplinary committee's rulings came two days after some
questionable refereeing in a match that likely decided the league
champion. Juve's 1-0 win gave it a four-point standings lead over
No. 2 Inter with three games left.
</P>
<P>
In the second half of the Sunday's match, referee Piero
Ceccarini failed to whistle a clear foul on Ronaldo and then
awarded a penalty to Juve's Alessandro Del Piero at the other
end. Ceccarini then turned to eject Simoni, who ran onto the
field to argue.
</P>
<P>
Ze Elias was expelled from the game with 11 minutes left for
throwing an elbow at the head of Juventus midfielder Didier
Deschamps.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Veto UN Payment Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
will veto the bill approved by Congress, which would pay nearly
one billion U.S. dollars in back dues to the United Nations, but
is tied to abortion curbs.
</P>
<P>
The Senate voted 51-49 to gave final congressional approval to
the measure that would authorize an array of State Department
programs, including the U.N. dues arrearage.
</P>
<P>
A provision of the bill, which was passed by the House in
March, denies aid to international family planning organizations
that support abortion, even if they use their own funds for
abortion efforts.
</P>
<P>
"By including this controversial family planning measure in
the bill Congress has left the president no choice but to veto
the bill," White House spokesman Barry Toiv said.
</P>
<P>
"The family planning issue should be dealt with separately and
it should not be allowed to hold up a bill that's essential to the
conduct of our nation's foreign policy," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Before the Senate vote on Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott urged Clinton to think twice about vetoing the long-delay
legislation, suggesting it might be the only chance he has this
year of getting the money for the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, this is it," Lott said. He said a veto "would
be a big mistake for our foreign policy apparatus."
</P>
<P>
The legislation would provide 819 million U.S. dollars to pay
the U.N. debts the U.S. owes and forgive 107 million U.S. dollars
in U.N. payments owed to the United States. This would be
contingent on U.N. reforms and a lowering of U.S. dues.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said recently that the debts
the U.S. owes to the United Nations has reached 15 billion U.S.
dollars up to date.
</P>
<P>
Speaking shortly before the Senate voted, Clinton complained
about Congress' failure to send him money for the U.N. back dues
with no strings attached, and for not acting on 18 billion U.S.
dollars he requested for the International Monetary Fund to help
ease the strains of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"In this new era, the health of our economy will be deeply
affected by the health of the world economy, and the security of
the United States is clearly affected by the security of the rest
of the world," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"Failure to act on these matters will put at risk both global
economic stability, which will affect our own, and the prosperity
that has widened the opportunity that we have enjoyed in this
country," he said.

CANBERRA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- A mountain of 11,000 stranded ship containers is choking
Australia's docks, locking up an estimated 320 million U.S.
dollars in cargo and pushing out delays at picket-free wharves to
four days, as the 22-day-old nationwide dock labor dispute began
to bite.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- More than 120,000 motorists in the state of New South Wales,
Australia, are about to have their drivers' licenses canceled and
motor vehicles deregistered as the state government steps up moves
to recover a decade's worth of unpaid traffic and parking fines.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- The fate of 1,400 sacked dock workers in Australia remained
in the balance Tuesday night after a day of legal wrangling during
which the High Court, the nation's supreme court, became impatient
with the workers' employer Patrick over questions of financial
solvency.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- A policy shift by the U.S. Federal Reserve towards higher
interest rates appears to have ended the extraordinary rally in
world stock prices, with analysts expecting markets to flatline
for the rest of the year.

<P>
OTTAWA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government won a
House of Commons vote Tuesday over an opposition party motion of
compensation for all the people infected with hepatitis C through
tainted blood.
</P>
<P>
The government of Prime Minister Jean Chretien defeated the
motion by a vote of 154 against 140 in favor.
</P>
<P>
Chretien, who was back just in time for the vote from his Cuba
visit, defined the vote as one of confidence, which means his
government could fall if it lost.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's vote was on a motion by the Reform Party, the
official Opposition in the House of Commons, that all hepatitis C
victims be compensated, not just those who were infected with the
virus between 1986 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
The government has offered 1.1 billion Canadian dollars (770
million U.S. dollars) in compensation to about 20,000 people who
were infected between 1986 and 1990 due to government negligence.
</P>
<P>
Yet, it will not compensate the estimated 60,000 victims
infected by tainted blood before 1986, when there was no test
available to screen donated blood for the hepatitis C virus.
</P>
<P>
As to calls for compensation for all blood victims, the
government replied that there will be serious financial
implications if it must compensate all people infected with the
virus.

Adola Mapunda, TTCL Director General, explained that WILL is a
latest technology which uses radio communication system to
replace wires.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that the technology is introduced in the
Tanzanian mainland, he said. However, the technology has been in
existence in Zanzibar isles for a year on trial basis.
</P>
<P>
In the Tanzanian mainland, he said, the project will cover
Arusha, Kilimanjaro, Dodoma, Morogoro, Tanga and Mara regions.
While in Zanzibar isles, it will benefit the twin islands of
Unguja and Pemba.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, communications in the country will be more
reliable and less congested, said Mapunda.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the project will resolve problems associated with
thefts of wire, complicated landscape and long distances which
affected the efficiency of the telecommunication system, he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the same function, Mitsubishi's Deputy General
Manager Masahiko Nakagawa said that his company will strive to
meet the set standards and timetable stipulated in the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Mapunda said that so far 80 percent of the TRP
program have been accomplished, and his company had managed to
increase the telephone exchange capacity by 70 percent, from
106,258 lines in 1991 to 180,379 lines last January.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, he said, the direct exchange lines have increased
from 76,369 lines in 1991 to over 109,476 last January, a rise of
44 percent.

<HEADLINE> Outgoing S. African Army Chief Defends Himself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Retiring South African
National Defense Force (SANDF) chief, General Georg Meiring,
Tuesday defended himself over the controversial coup report.
</P>
<P>
General Meiring said that he still thought he had done the
correct thing by presenting a military intelligence report
detailing an imminent left-wing coup to President Nelson Mandela
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a public engagement at the Johannesburg Press
Club, Meiring said "I did what I thought was best."
</P>
<P>
"I spoke about the report in detail with the president
(Mandela)... I reported to my commander-in-chief. In this case,
the president," Meiring said.
</P>
<P>
Meiring announced early this month his decision to resign,
saying it was related to a military intelligence report about a
plot to overthrow the government.
</P>
<P>
Mandela accepted Meiring's resignation after the report he
received from Meiring was found fraudulent.
</P>
<P>
The report claimed that a handful of senior African National
Congress (ANC) members, including SANDF chief of staff Lieutenant
General Siphiwe Nyanda, were plotting a coup.
</P>
<P>
The ANC is a ruling party in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Meiring was authorized by the Government of National Unity
headed by Mandela to take military power in 1994 which witnessed
the first non-racial general elections in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of his retirement, Meiring said that he did not know
what he would do in his retirement. He also said that he did not
think his leaving was "premature at this stage of my career".
</P>
<P>
Meiring will retire at the end of May. He declined to
speculate over who his successor would be.

<HEADLINE> Euro Bank Chief Row Stands after Blair-Kohl Consulation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The row over who will be first
European Central Bank (ECB) president remains unresolved after
British Prime Minister Tony Blair telephoned German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl early Tuesday in a bid to break the deadlock.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that most of the European Union's (EU)15 member
states support Wim Duisenberg, the Dutch president of the European
Monetary Institute, to head the ECB, while France has insisted
that Jean-Claus Trichet, Bank of France Governor, become the first
ECB chief.
</P>
<P>
A Downing Street spokesman told reporters Tuesday afternoon
that Blair and Kohl had discussed the issue, but "the position
hasn't changed since this morning."
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman repeated his indication that the British
government, the current EU president, would be able to broker an
agreement at this weekend's special EU summit in Brussels by
saying: " It doesn't have to be resolved this weekend but it would
be desirable."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman confirmed early Tuesday that Prime Minister Blair
spoke by telephone to French President Jaques Chirac and Dutch
Prime Minister Wim Kok over the row on the future ECB president.

<HEADLINE> ANC Team to N. Ireland to Be Impartial: Delegate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The African National
Congress (ANC) delegation to the Northern Ireland peace talks
would support the peace process as a whole rather than the
interest of any individual party, one delegation member said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
South African Constitutional Affairs Minister Valli Moosa, one
of the four-member delegation, was reacting to criticism from
Northern Ireland's Ulster Unionists and South Africa's National
Party that an ANC-only delegation could be biased and would
hamper the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released hours before his scheduled departure
on Tuesday night, Moosa said that the delegation was composed of
only ANC members because Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams made such a
specific request to the ANC, South African Press Association
reported.
</P>
<P>
Adams had said that interaction with South African leaders
with negotiating experiences would make a positive contribution
to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Moosa and former ANC Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa leaves
for Northern Ireland Tuesday night to join two other members of
the delegation, Transport Minister Mac Maharaj and Mpumalanga
Premier Mathews Phosa.
</P>
<P>
The latter two are already overseas and would travel to Dublin
later.
</P>
<P>
Moosa said that during a workshop held in Arniston with nine
parties from Northern Ireland in May last year, the ANC had
indicated to all parties its preparedness to further contribute
to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The delegation would respond to requests rather than play an
interventionist role, Moosa said, adding that it would also meet
the British and Irish governments.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the ANC said that the four men, who formed the core
of the ANC's negotiation team during the peace talks leading to
the 1994 democratic election, are scheduled to discuss the issue
of IRA prisoners with all the political parties involved.
</P>
<P>
They would also visit the political prisoners in their cells
to talk about the importance of implementing the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The National Party, South Africa's biggest opposition party,
earlier said the delegation should include representatives of all
political parties.
</P>
<P>
Inviting only Adams to the Freedom Day celebrations at the
South African High Commission in London, and sending an
exclusively ANC deputation to Dublin raised doubts about South
Africa's impartiality, the party said.

<HEADLINE> Food Production Drops Sharply in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The staple production dropped
by about 50 percent in January 1998 as against the same period of
the last year, the daily Curierul National informs on Tuesday,
citing the National Committee for Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The daily says that the hog meat production reached only 11,500
tons in January, against the same month of 1997, when it was
21,500 tons. The same has happened with the beef meat
production which scored only 1,600 tons in January, against
3,600 tons during the same month in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Milk and diary production also dropped but by 10-20 percent
only. Such a production decrease triggered out a 20 percent price
rise for food products as against December 1997, under
circumstances when the average wages in the economy were striving
to fall in February 1998 as compared with January of the same
year.
</P>
<P>
The food industry experts explain the fact that the Government
was leading a fiscal and customs policy allowing unfair
competitiveness of the imported products as against the domestic
ones. They suggested a couple of steps the Romanian Government
were to take, aimed at putting the agriculture decline to a halt
and at allowing to cut the VAT and the taxes for basic products,
revisions of the customs taxes.
</P>
<P>
The daily stresses that these measures would lead to a decrease
in food products' prices and would give equal chances to the
domestic producers and the importers and diminish the customs
fraud, and would significantly contribute to Romania's budget.

<HEADLINE> US Senate Ties Abortion Curbs to UN Payment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate narrowly
approved on Tuesday a legislation that would pay nearly one
billion U.S. dollars in back dues to the United Nations, but tie
abortion curbs to it as the House did.
</P>
<P>
The Senate voted 51-49 to give final congressional approval to
the measure that would authorize an array of State Department
programs, including the U.N. dues arrearage.
</P>
<P>
A provision of the bill denies aid to international family
planning organizations that support abortion, even if they use
their own funds for abortion efforts.
</P>
<P>
The legislation would provide 819 million U.S. dollars to pay
the U.N. debts the U.S. owes and forgive 107 million U.S. dollars
in U.N. payments owed to the United States. This would be
contingent on U.N. reforms and a lowering of U.S. dues.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said recently that the debts
the U.S. owes to the United Nations have reached 15 billion U.S.
dollars up to date.
</P>
<P>
Urging Congress to approve his request for paying the U.N.
arrears, the Clinton administration threatened to veto legislation
if it is tied with abortion issues.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the White House said it would veto the bill if it
included the anti-abortion provisions, which bar international
family planning agencies that receive U.S. aid from lobbying
foreign governments to change their abortion laws.
</P>
<P>
"That language is unacceptable to us and the President would
veto that language," White House spokesman Barry Toiv said.
</P>
<P>
But before the Senate vote on Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott urged Clinton to think twice about vetoing the
long-delay legislation, suggesting it might be the only chance he
has this year of getting the money for the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, this is it," Lott said. He said a veto "would
be a big mistake for our foreign policy apparatus."
</P>
<P>
Speaking shortly before the Senate voted, Clinton complained
about Congress' failure to send him money for the U.N. back dues
with no strings attached, and for not acting on 18 billion U.S.
dollars he requested for the International Monetary Fund to help
ease the strains of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"In this new era, the health of our economy will be deeply
affected by the health of the world economy, and the security of
the United States is clearly affected by the security of the rest
of the world," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"Failure to act on these matters will put at risk both global
economic stability, which will affect our own, and the prosperity
that has widened the opportunity that we have enjoyed in this
country," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs on Tuesday appealed to the
international community to provide urgent humanitarian aid to
Southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is deeply concerned by the humanitarian
situation in Southern Sudan, especially in the Bahr el Ghazal
region where an estimated 350,000 people are in need of urgent
humanitarian assistance, and in the area of Bentiu in Unity state,
where an estimated 22,000 people are in need of assistance, and
malnutrition rates are reported to be as high as 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
Operation Lifeline Sudan has been attempting to deliver food
and relief supplies to the affected population in those areas.
</P>
<P>
The Office requested donors to respond urgently and generously
to the 1998 United Nations consolidated appeal which is seeking
109.3 million U.S. dollars to meet the food and non-food needs of
war and drought-affected Sudanese.

NEW YORK, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street were

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Confidence Rebounds in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Americans' confidence in the
economy surged to almost a 29-year high in April, according to a
report issued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On Wall Street, meanwhile, stocks rallied after Monday's big
loss but then retreated during the late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The New York-based Conference Board reported that its index of
consumer confidence rose to 136.7 in April from a revised 133.8 in
March. The April figure was higher than Street analysts expected.
</P>
<P>
The index reached 137.4 in February, its highest level since
June 1969.
</P>
<P>
Consumer confidence is important because consumer spending
accounts for two-thirds of the nation's overall economic activity.
</P>
<P>
The report comes amid concern that if the economy does not cool
off to a more sustainable growth rate, the Federal Reserve will
raise interest rates to slow it down.
</P>
<P>
The consumer confidence index, calculated since 1985 from a base
of 100, is derived from responses to questions sent to 5,000
households nationwide. The survey asks people about such matters as
job availability and home-buying plans.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
and the World Health Organization (WHO) pledged here Tuesday to
reinforce their collaboration on health issues in Asia and the
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
At a joint ADB/WHO seminar held one day before the ADB annual
meeting, participants tried to explore the experience of
developing Asia, to examine the major challenges facing
governments, public institutions and the private sector, to
identify opportunities that will allow further improvements in
health, and to describe the efforts of the ADB and the WHO to
promote better health in the region.
</P>
<P>
"The seminar today represents a milestone for our continued
joint work to promote and reinforce health development in Asia and
the Pacific," said WHO Assistant Director-General Fernando
Antezana.
</P>
<P>
"Returns on investment in the social sector are enormous,
although not easily quantifiable," he said. "They include peace
and security, sustainable development, and improved health and
quality of life for all, which in turn will stimulate economic
growth."
</P>
<P>
In her keynote address, WHO Director-General nominee Gro Harlem
Brundtland outlined three specific battles, against tuberculosis,
HIV and AIDS, and tobacco, that must be fought throughout Asia by
the countries, the communities, but also by organizations such as
WHO.
</P>
<P>
"Building a healthy economy helps ensure a healthy people," the
former Norwegian prime minister said. "And controlling disease is
in itself a powerful cure for poverty."
</P>
<P>
"Both are fundamental to economic and social development," she
said. "Both are about the empowerment of people."
</P>
<P>
"It is important to acknowledge the successes that have been
accomplished over the last 35 years." Benjamin Loevinsohn, a
senior health specialist, said on behalf of the ADB.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, there remain serious challenges to confront,
adding that the ADB is ready to be an active partner in meeting
the challenges and seizing the opportunities.

</P>
<P>
During 1997, China's demand for petroleum products increased
9.4 per cent and reached nearly 3.7 million barrels per day.
Consumption was 2.6 million b/d in 1992 and 3.4 million b/d in
1996.
</P>
<P>
On the supply side, China's domestic crude oil production
reached 3.2 million b/d in 1997, up from 2.8 million b/d in 1992
and 3.1 million b/d in 1996. The production growth rate during
this period was in average of 2.5 per cent.
</P>
<P>
For 1998 and 1999, however, overstock of refined products and
cooling down of the Chinese economy in late 1997 and early 1998,
coupled with the financial crisis in Asia mean that the high oil
demand growth in 1997 cannot be maintained, Fesharaki said.
</P>
<P>
On outlook for China's oil demand, supply and trade to 2010, he
said, future oil demand growth remains strong in China, but given
the uncertainties facing many countries in the region amid the
financial crisis, China's oil demand growth in 1998 could be
considerably lower than the demand growth in 1997.
</P>
<P>
For the period from the beginning of 1998 to the end of 2000,
China's petroleum product demand is forecast to increase at an
average annual rate of 5.4 per cent, reaching 4.2 million b/d by
2000.
</P>
<P>
By 2005 and 2010, China's petroleum product consumption is
forecast to reach 5.4 and 6.6 million b/d, respectively, according
to Fesharaki.
</P>
<P>
As China is now joining the ranks of other Asian oil importers
searching for large amounts of oil imports, Fesharaki said
"China's role in the Asian oil market will become even more
important".

<HEADLINE> World Bank Backs Telecommunications Reform in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved here
Tuesday a 30 million U.S. dollar loan for the Telecommunications
Reform and Privatization Support Project in Romania.
</P>
<P>
The project aims to assist Romania in reforming the
telecommunications sector, including privatization of existing
public sector telecommunications facilities, providing the
necessary infrastructure to enable the General Inspectorate of
Communications (GIC) to maximize the productive use of the radio
frequency spectrum, as well as improving frequency assignment
criteria for further expansion of wireless communications
services.
</P>
<P>
Total cost of the project is some 44 million dollars. Apart
from the World Bank loan, the GIC will provide 12.2 million
dollars. The Romanian government and the European Union will share
the remaining cost for the project.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, the World Bank commitments to Romania total 2.6
billion dollars for 19 projects.
