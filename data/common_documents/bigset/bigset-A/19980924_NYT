SEATTLE'S `HOUSE OF HORRORS' AWAITS RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The celebration will begin at the Kingdome
should the Rangers win the American League West.
</P>
<P>
   The scenario reflects irony at its best.
</P>
<P>
   The Kingdome remains the Rangers' ``House of Horrors,'' and yet
that facility will serve as the site for their four remaining
regular-season games with the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   One other matter: The division title will be at stake, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a tough place for us to play,'' Rangers right
fielder Juan Gonzalez said. ``I don't have any answers, and I can't
explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   No one can.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers will enter tonight's game with only six victories
during their past 32 games at the Kingdome, and that includes the
Mariners' sweep of a two-game series there July 13-14.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' troubles at the Kingdome so troubled manager Johnny
Oates that he sought professional help during the 1997 season from
Dr. Don Beck, a sports psychologist for Denton's Human Values
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Beck suggested the Rangers create a different atmosphere at the
Kingdome, Oates recalled. Beck recommended that players change
lockers with one another, listen to different music in the
clubhouse and alter their menu at the stadium in an attempt ``to
change the routine,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   The manager opted for none of the above.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in that stuff,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Why seek Beck's advice then?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to see if he would say anything I agreed with,''
Oates replied. ``You know how stubborn I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Scott Bailes, who joined the Rangers during August
1997, continues to be puzzled by the amount of attention their play
at the Kingdome receives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's happened in the past is so overblown here,''
Bailes said. ``Teams change so much from year to year with free
agency now that you can't put any validity on what's happened in
the past.''
</P>
<P>
   History, though, continues to repeat itself there, and Oates
pinpoints one reason for the Rangers' repeated failures at the
Kingdome. The Mariners' lineup includes shortstop Alex Rodriguez,
center fielder Ken Griffey Jr., designated hitter Edgar Martinez,
first baseman David Segui and catcher Dan Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been able to get them out,'' Oates said. ``We
haven't gotten that lineup out in Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, though, will draw two breaks this time in Seattle.
The Mariners traded one noted Rangers pest _ second baseman Joey
Cora _ to the Indians earlier this summer, and right fielder Jay
Buhner underwent season-ending surgery Sept. 9 to repair his right
elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, that will make a difference,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers do not embrace discussing their lack of success in
Seattle and often dismiss it as meaningless history.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happened in the past is in the past,'' second baseman
Mark McLemore said. ``You can't rely on that. You can't. You just
can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Can't also describes the Rangers' ability to win at the
Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I refuse to believe that,'' McLemore said. ``All of it means
absolutely nothing.''

SPORTS COLUMN: KEEPING AN EYE ON THE TV 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Late in the afternoon, long before a spare
outfielder named Brant Brown made a bid to initial Bill Buckner's
legacy, Al Leiter didn't see the point in wasting time with the
Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   The amazing Sammy Sosa had already caught Mark McGwire by
homering twice. The Brewers were trailing, 7-0, and seemed deep
into the process of post-season dispersal. Leiter was making hasty
arrangements to get his wife and daughters out of Fort Lauderdale
and up to Atlanta before the airports in southern Florida closed
for a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looks like they'll win,'' he said, motioning to the bank of
televisions suspended from the Mets' clubhouse ceiling, in the
middle of the room. ``But think about it, what's the point of
watching? What can you control? You can control tonight. You can
control Friday night in Atlanta. Forget what they're doing over
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Get to Atlanta, physically safe, mentally sound, before some
dreadful act of nature strikes, the way a tailing fly ball to left
field, the sun field, hit the Cubs on Wednesday like the weight of
90 championship-less years. The Mets, however, couldn't control
Wednesday night any more than they could hit a rookie pitcher, Carl
Pavano. They couldn't beat the Montreal Expos, again, losing by
3-0, failing to score after having the bases loaded with nobody out
in the seventh inning, and leaving two more runners on in the
eighth. The Mets go to play the Braves now, with no margin of
error, still tied with the pinching-themselves Cubs, the Giants
suddenly one loss behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two teams of destiny,'' Turk Wendell, the Mets' hyper
reliever, had called the Mets and Cubs before the game. After
Wednesday, who would swear they aren't destined to lose?
</P>
<P>
   The Braves would love to knock the Mets out so that they can
avoid San Diego in the first round. That this September happening
concludes with the Mets in Atlanta is deliciously fitting, another
twist in a season we can't take our eyes off. The Mets fight for
survival now against the ruler of their division, a team supposedly
out of their league.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Mets won on Wednesday night, accepted Brant Brown's
gift, they might have gone to Atlanta on Thursday thinking it was
their destiny to be this year's Marlins, who clouded the Braves'
confidence last September by winning three of four in Atlanta
before eventually leaving them awash in playoff tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see some similarities here, but to compare this club to the
Braves isn't fair,'' said Leiter, one of the many emigres from the
Marlins' 1997 World Series champions. ``They've done it and we
haven't. We've got to go down there now and be completely focused
on ourselves, not get caught up in all of this.''
</P>
<P>
   He made another sweeping motion with his left pitching arm,
without looking back at the screen, where the Brewers were in the
process of pushing across four runs to get back in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I want the Cubs to lose, but I'm pitching Saturday
and, in my mind, I'm already working the Atlanta lineup,'' Leiter
went on. ``I'm thinking about Ozzie Guillen, Michael Tucker,
Chipper, Galarraga. Looking at who's doing what recently, looking
for anything that will get me an edge. If every player can focus on
their position, on what they have to do, that's the issue. That's
the only issue; all this scoreboard stuff isn't going to help you
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when it comes to playoff-race baseball, we are all
kids at heart, staring at the scoreboard, fiddling with the radio,
bracing for the bad news while praying for the good.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Mets Manager Bobby Valentine looked, distracted and
nervous, as he chatted with reporters near the Mets' dugout during
batting practice, the Brewers' Geoff Jenkins batting in Milwaukee
against Rod Beck with the bases loaded and two out in the ninth. A
30-year-old fan from Union, N.J., Michael Adler, held a radio to
his ear and offered play-by-play from the first row, courtesy of
WFAN's drive-time hosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy dropped the ball!'' Adler screamed, after Brown made
what was, for a few hours, an error for the ages. Valentine turned,
looking into the face of the fan who was now telling him the Cubs
had, incredibly, lost. When he turned back, his eyes were teary.
His voice was choked. His body was charged. Word spread quickly to
the field. And then, from the tunnel leading to the clubhouse,
bounding up the dugout steps, came one Met who believed he was
delivering headline news.
</P>
<P>
   ``They lost, Cubs lost,'' cried Al Leiter, who now had to admit
that the point of watching every part of what is once again a
three-team race is that you simply must. &QL;

NO SLOWDOWN FOR BOWDEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Florida State was coming off a three-year period
of futility when Bobby Bowden showed up on the Tallahassee campus
in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   When Bowden finally leaves Tallahassee, the program will be in
much better shape, to say the least. But when will Bowden, who
turns 69 on Nov. 8, take his whistle and head home?
</P>
<P>
   After hearing the question, for what was certainly not the first
time, Bowden took a second to chuckle before predicting that it
could be 5, 10, 15 years before he's ready to quit worrying about
X's and O's and start working on the household chores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have the desire, anxiety and enthusiasm I've always
had,'' said Bowden, whose Seminoles play host to USC on Saturday.
``I have no desire to retire. I'd just as soon die out on the field
than pulling weeds in my wife's garden.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida State was 4-29 in the three seasons before Bowden took
over and 5-6 in his first season. The Seminoles haven't finished
below .500 since. In his 22 years at FSU, Bowden is 210-52-4, and
his 1993 team won the national championship. The Seminoles have won
at least 10 games every year since 1987 and were ranked in the top
four in the final national poll each season during that span.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great coach,'' linebacker Lamont Green said, ``but what
I should say first is he's a great man. What stands out most is
he's a role model for the college athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-one of Bowden's players have been selected All-American
and 70 have been picked in the NFL draft, including 17
first-rounders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always watched Florida State when I was growing up,'' said
USC safety Rashard Cook. ``I watched Charlie Ward, Warrick Dunn
(and) guys like that. They were always fun games to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook saw Florida State up close last year when the Seminoles
visited the Coliseum for a 14-7 season-opening victory over USC. On
Saturday, the Trojans visit Tallahassee's Doak Campbell Stadium,
where Florida State hasn't lost since Nov. 5, 1991.
</P>
<P>
   And Bowden says this Florida State team ``may have more speed
than we've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   That's saying something when you consider this is the same
program that produced players like Deion Sanders and Dunn.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a choice of fast or slow, fast wins nine times out of
10,'' FSU defensive end Tony Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   The team speed is spread all over the field and both sides of
the ball. Receiver Peter Warrick is this year's Seminoles Heisman
Trophy candidate and sophomore running back Travis Minor is a
bigger, just as speedy version of Dunn. Green is a
sideline-to-sideline talent at linebacker and the defensive
backfield is full of sprinters.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles also already have a loss _ a shocking 24-7 setback
to North Carolina State on Sept. 12. That defeat, only the second
Florida State loss in the ACC in six years of conference
membership, caused the Seminoles to slide out of the top 10 for the
first time in 61 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Florida State, you are allowed one error,'' said Bowden,
whose team fell to No.11 after the loss. ``With one error, you
might still win the big one. This is the first time we've lost this
early in the year since (1989). The thing you have to do when you
lose is not look down the road. You have to look at the next
Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   Waiting to the next Saturday, at least last week, made for a
long seven days.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the five years I've been here,'' Green said, ``it's
probably the toughest week I've had. We didn't think a team like
North Carolina State should beat us. We know we can't slip up any
more the rest of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles used the week full of bad feelings to whip up
enough anger to pound Duke 62-13 on Saturday. Sophomore quarterback
Chris Weinke, who threw six interceptions against N.C. State,
rebounded to hurl three touchdowns passes and no interceptions
against Duke.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The N.C. State loss) shows they are beatable,'' Cook said.
``But that means nothing to me. We didn't do it. If anything, it
may make them play harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, though, Bowden is worried about getting his team
healthy. Weinke is one of 10 players hit with the flu.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 10 players that couldn't practice today and eight of
them were receiving IVs during practice,'' Bowden said
``Practically the whole offensive line and Weinke are out.''
</P>
<P>
   And the gardening duties will wait.

ANGELS USE SCREAM THERAPY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Several Anaheim Angels players came to the
defense of pitching coach Marcel Lachemann on Wednesday, saying his
reported outburst Tuesday was nothing more than strong words of
encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   Lachemann and pitcher Chuck Finley took turns talking to the
team after Tuesday's 9-1 loss to the Rangers. And though the noise
level was significant, none of it was to rip the players or put
them down, players said.
</P>
<P>
   Angels closer Troy Percival said too much was made of the
postgame events, and that Lachemann reminded everybody that in 1995
the Angels rallied from a three-game deficit with five to play,
forcing a one-game playoff with Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Lachemann said his comments were meant to make the players
believe in themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Terry Collins was speaking with reporters in a separate
room when some of the yelling was going on. When he found out it
was Finley, Collins was happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I liked about (Tuesday) night was that we've got a
guy who really cares,'' Collins said. ``I don't care if Chuck
Finley tore the clubhouse up. This guy really cares. You want to
find 25 guys who care so much, everything else is secondary. If
everybody's on the same page and cares that much, you're going to
win a lot of ballgames.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Left-field shuffle: Outfielder Gregg Jefferies told Collins
that he could play Wednesday, but Collins started Todd Greene in
left field instead. Jefferies had to come out of Tuesday's game
when he aggravated his strained right hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `If I only get you for one at-bat, I'll pick my
spot for that,' '' Collins said. ``He plays the game real hard.
He's been a great addition, but his leg's in bad shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferies, who has hit .352 in 18 games with the Angels, also
has a sprained right ankle and a bruised right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Collins' decision to start Greene in left field over Orlando
Palmeiro left the Angels without a leadoff hitter. So Collins put
Garret Anderson in the top spot, the second time he's hit leadoff
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we need a leadoff hitter and Palmeiro's done a good job
for us,'' Collins said. ``But one thing we need is someone to drive
in runs. We've got this guy (Greene) sitting here and we had been
waiting for him all year. He's got power, so let's get him in the
lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Closing time: Percival had not been in any of the previous
four games between the Angels and Rangers, simply because the
Angels haven't had a ninth-inning lead. But he says it's not
driving him crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the game,'' he said. ``My job is to go in when
we've got a lead. I want the ball as bad as anybody, but it's not
my job unless we're winning.... But I want to be on the mound when
we win this thing.''

<P>
   MIAMI _ As Hurricane Georges bore down on Cuba, the 80,000
residents of the Florida Keys began evacuating their vulnerable
island chain on Wednesday and a hurricane watch was issued for the
four million residents of Miami and the rest of South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The storm has already made a shambles of much of Puerto Rico,
the Dominican Republic and Haiti, leaving more than 110 people
dead. At least 70 people were reported killed in the Dominican
Republic alone, and more than 40 others died elsewhere, according
to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dominican Republic, President Leonel Fernandez said 70
people were killed, and 27 people were officially reported killed
in Haiti, which the storm struck on Tuesday. But, the actual toll
appeared likely to rise much higher.
</P>
<P>
   In San Cristobal, a Dominican town 20 miles east of the capital,
Santo Domingo, the Nizao River overflowed and knocked down a part
of a school used as a shelter, reporters said, leaving 5 dead and
31 missing.
</P>
<P>
   In the shanty neighborhood of La Cienega, the swollen river
invaded thousands of homes, covering some up to the roofs in fetid
water. Residents swam out to their houses to try to retrieve their
belongings, some using empty gallon water jugs tied to their arms
to help them float.
</P>
<P>
   In Havana, the Cuban capital, President Fidel Castro put his
Cabinet on alert and said the country's armed forces would help get
medicine, food and other help to hurricane victims.
</P>
<P>
   By late Wednesday, authorities had already evacuated 200,000
people from their homes in Cuba's eastern provinces.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one will be forgotten in this new battle by the Cuban
people. We are a nation that has overcome adversity with unity,''
Mexico's official Notimex news agency quoted Castro as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The storm was on a trajectory that could send it crashing into
the Florida Keys by late Thursday or early Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, fearing that the storm could become the most ruinous
to strike Florida since Hurricane Andrew in 1992, Gov. Lawton
Chiles also declared a state of emergency for central and southern
Florida, allowing him to mobilize the National Guard. Schools were
ordered closed on Thursday and Friday in Miami-Dade County, and all
but essential county employees have been ordered to stay home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other evacuations, from Palm Beach to Tampa Bay, could start
tonight or Thursday morning,'' depending on the course the storm
takes, the Florida Department of Community Affairs warned in a
statement late Wednesday afternoon. At the same time, the National
Weather Service predicted ``storm surge flooding of four to six
feet above normal tide levels, accompanied by large and dangerous
battering waves'' in coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
   Since beginning its deadly march across the Caribbean last
weekend, the storm has killed more than 100 people people and
inflicted widespread destruction, including more than $1 billion in
property damage in Puerto Rico alone. The Insurance Information
Institute said most of the claims expected in the Caribbean would
come from commercial properties like hotels and resorts.
</P>
<P>
   With sustained winds of 115 miles an hour, the storm has moved
on a course from the northern Leeward Islands west and north across
the Dominican Republic and Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Weather forecasters predicted that the storm, which slowed
Wednesday and lost enough wind strength that it was temporarily
dropped to a Category 1 storm from a stronger Category 2, would
strike late Thursday somewhere in South Florida. The precise path
remained uncertain, which led the National Hurricane Center here to
declare a hurricane watch for both the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic
coasts of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Officials were waiting for a better sense of the storm's
trajectory before ordering evacuations or directing residents to
shelters, said John Joyce, a spokesman for the state Emergency
Operations Center. ``Because of the large swath of this storm, if
you move people, you might have to move them again in another
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   But from Key West to Key Largo, the northernmost island in the
Keys, a steady stream of cars and sport vehicles towing boats moved
north on U.S. 1, the two-lane road that links the low-lying
120-mile-long chain of islands to mainland Florida. At 5 p.m., the
highway was closed to all southbound traffic, and the authorities
said that residents who remained behind were on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our first mandatory evacuation in memory,'' said Cindy
Peryam, a spokeswoman for the Monroe County sheriff's office, ``so
we have no way of knowing how people will react. But since
Hurricane Andrew, people are much more cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   People leaving the Keys were directed to the main campus of
Florida International University, just a stone's throw from the
National Hurricane Center's headquarters west of Miami. But, Ms.
Peryam said, ``we're not going to be able to fit everybody there,
so this is one of those no-win situations where you hope people
will go north.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hurricane Andrew struck Miami with winds of 150 mph in
August 1992, almost 90 percent of Miami-Dade County's two million
residents had never experienced a tropical storm. But memories of
that experience have remained vivid, and people have moved promptly
to get emergency supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were lines before we even opened the store today,'' said
Victor Chin, manager of a Home Depot store in Kendall, the Miami
suburb that was one of the areas hardest hit by Hurricane Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   Chin said lines were ``maybe three or four hours deep,'' with
customers stocking up on batteries, plywood, flashlights and
shutters.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Andrew was the most costly natural disaster in
American history, inflicting more than $25 billion in damages,
which led several large insurance companies to abandon the state
and forced others into bankruptcy. The Florida state insurance
commissioner, Bill Nelson, said here Wednesday that an $11 billion
hurricane damage compensation fund had been created, but added that
he expected to have to draw only on a small part of it.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with 1992, Nelson said, ``we are looking at much
stronger structures to endure hurricane force winds.'' Building
codes throughout the state have been tightened, he said, and
enforcement has been stepped up.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Florida, residents have been shaken by the death and
devastation that Hurricane Georges has left in the Caribbean.

DODGERS REPLACE FARM DIRECTOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Charlie Blaney, the longtime Los Angeles Dodgers
farm director who oversaw the development of rookies of the year
Eric Karros, Mike Piazza, Raul Mondesi and Todd Hollandsworth,
stepped down Wednesday as part of general manager Kevin Malone's
front-office reshuffling.
</P>
<P>
   Blaney's ouster was the first of many moves expected from
Malone, who will hold a staff meeting today to discuss the future
of key positions, including manager Glenn Hoffman and his coaching
staff and scouting director Terry Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are very sensitive issues and the answers will not come
out of that meeting,'' Malone said. ``But it is important to let
everyone know where they stand and we will do that as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Those announcements are expected Monday or Tuesday. Blaney, who
was given a three-year personal services contract last winter when
Fox purchased the club from the O'Malley family, learned his fate
Wednesday. He officially accepted an early retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very proud of what I accomplished here and proud of what
the Dodgers have done in the minor-league department,'' Blaney
said. ``Kevin and I had discussed doing some special projects in
the future. I look forward to helping any way I can.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to replace Blaney with his own man was one of
Malone's top priorities when he took over two weeks ago. Bill
Geivett, hired last week as an assistant to the general manager,
will take over Blaney's responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Geivett has unique talents and expertise in the area of
player development,'' Malone said. ``We can now use those talents
in strengthening our minor-league system as we prepare to take this
organization to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   Blaney, who worked for the Dodgers since 1966, became farm
director in 1987, replacing Bill Schweppe. He was recognized as a
talented administrator and the Dodgers' minor-league system was
consistently graded among the best in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned so much from Charlie about the organization it takes
to run things,'' said Hoffman, who was Blaney's minor-league field
coordinator and Triple-A manager before his promotion last June.
``His attention to detail was unsurpassed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a string of five consecutive rookies of the year (Hideo
Nomo was not developed in the Dodgers farm system), Blaney's
undoing came from not being an evaluator of talent. That is one of
Geivett's strengths. Blaney also received criticism for twice
attempting to release Piazza early in his minor-league career.
Piazza, a 62nd-round pick in the 1989 draft, went on to become the
club's top player before getting traded last May.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only one out of 10 players make the major leagues,'' Blaney
said. ``I am glad to have known the other nine, the coaches and the
scouts. It was an honor to work with so many dedicated people.''

HELLING PUTS ASIDE THE BUBBLY, AND THE INJURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ There's something about the fragrance of
champagne in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   That's especially true when it's the stale stench of bubbly that
thoroughly soaked into your clothes 10 hours earlier during the
delirium of a championship celebration.
</P>
<P>
   It stings the eyes, chills the skin, and, when taken orally,
enhances the giddy feeling of an agonizing mission finally
accomplished. Given a few hours to ripen, it can turn a brand new
golf shirt into a reeking souvenir in need of serious fumigation.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the champagne belongs to Rick Helling, that is.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, an hour after a commanding performance had
carried the Rangers to a huge 9-1 victory against the Angels and
Helling to his 20th victory of the season, a magnum of bubbly lay
on its side in a stainless steel bowl of melting ice in front of
his locker.
</P>
<P>
   It was a gift from Helling's appreciative teammates to mark the
occasion. It was a nice gesture, even though the 27-year-old
right-hander doesn't drink alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I'm going to do with it,'' Helling said.
``Maybe I'll save it and give it to someone, I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, there's a lot of bottles (of champagne) spraying
around in here in the next couple of days, or whatever locker room
we're in. That'll be the sweetest champagne anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't misunderstand. Helling is all about winning and he knows
that, by winning 20 games, he has crossed the invisible Rubicon and
into the realm of pitching glory. He is only the third pitcher in
Rangers history to win 20 games _ Ferguson Jenkins and Kevin Brown
were the other two _ and becomes just the third pitcher in the
majors to win 20 this season, joining Roger Clemens and Tom Glavine
in that select company.
</P>
<P>
   But if ever a 20-win season was the product of an entire team,
this one is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the team I play with,'' Helling said graciously. ``If I
was pitching for a lower-echelon team, a team below .500, then I
wouldn't have 20 wins. I've pitched some good games this year, but
you've got to give all the credit to this team and the way it
scores runs and plays defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not all the credit. Helling, with his burr haircut and
broad, square-jawed face, doesn't just bear a striking resemblance
to a bulldog, he pitches like one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen it all year,'' manager Johnny Oates said. ``Rick
pitches to whatever level he needs to. If we've scored six, he
might give up four. But if we've scored one, he won't give 'em
any.''
</P>
<P>
   That was exactly the case Tuesday night, when Helling held the
Angels in check for seven innings, protecting a 1-0 lead. He didn't
allow a run until the Rangers had blown it open with eight more
runs in the seventh and eighth innings.
</P>
<P>
   It was a point of pride for Helling that he did it despite a
sharp pain between his shoulder blades that has persisted for
almost a week now. Rangers trainers suspect a possible stress
fracture in one of his ribs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main goal (Tuesday night) was to just go out and pitch the
game and let whatever happens happen,'' Helling said. ``I wasn't
going to let the pain stop me. I was able to focus it out a little
bit better than I did at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Unable to concentrate because of the pain, Helling lasted less
than two innings against the Angels last week in a game the Rangers
rallied to win, 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   If you were watching on television, you may have seen him
sitting alone in the dugout after he was pulled from the game,
holding his head in his hands, rubbing a hand over his bristly
hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking, `What a night to have my worst game of the
year.' It was the first time I've ever pitched in pain like that,''
Helling said, ``and I'm thinking, `Why does this happen now?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was feeling a little sorry for myself, sitting on
the bench, thinking, `This can't be happening.'''
</P>
<P>
   The worst, though, was hearing the whispered suggestions that
maybe the pressure was too much for him. Pressure? This was the guy
who'd once stared down the Cubans in the '92 Olympic Games when he
was just 20 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear the little mumblings, `He's not a big-game pitcher;
he's never pitched in a game like this before. That had nothing to
do with it,'' Helling said, ``but everybody wants to figure out why
I pitched a bad game.''
</P>
<P>
   The important thing was that it didn't happen Tuesday night,
when his dominating performance helped the Rangers extend their
American League West lead to two games.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, the magnum of champagne sat in Helling's locker,
still unopened, destined to eventually find its way to his trophy
case.
</P>
<P>
   But consider this fair warning: The next bottle he gets his
hands on ... well, you might not want to come around unless you're
wearing a raincoat.

TEXAS A&AMP;M LOSES RUNNING BACK, FORFEITS VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M officials declared fullback De'Andre Hardeman
academically ineligible for the 1998 season yesterday and announced
that the Aggies will forfeit a Sept. 12 victory against Louisiana
Tech in which he participated and scored three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a clerical error in the posting of grades at the
registrar's office, school officials said Hardeman was improperly
cleared to play after completing summer school courses on Aug. 14.
The error, which was made outside the athletic department, was
discovered last week, said A&AMP;M athletic director Wally Groff.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Hardeman already had played in a 23-14 loss to
Florida State on Aug. 31, as well as the 17th-ranked Aggies' 28-7
victory against Louisiana Tech. Hardeman, who is ineligible under
NCAA satisfactory progress rules, was held out of last week's 24-6
victory against Southern Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Groff has written a letter to Louisiana Tech officials informing
them of A&AMP;M's plan to forfeit. School officials said last night it
is unclear how the forfeit will factor into bowl scenarios or alter
the Aggies' 2-1 record.
</P>
<P>
   Under rules of the NCAA and the Big 12 conference, the forfeit
will not change the Aggies' record unless school officials
volunteer to take that course of action.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a situation where there is a forfeit, we do not
require an institution to go back and change its record,'' NCAA
spokeswoman Jane Jankowski said yesterday. ``If the school wants to
do that, it can do so. But there is no requirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Big 12 bylaws would not require A&AMP;M to alter its
record. League officials cited Rule 7.4.4, which governs forfeiture
of nonconference games. It states: ``Responsibility for offering to
forfeit nonconference contests and the reporting of any acceptances
rests with the athletic director of the member institution.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Rule 7.4.3 in the Big 12 bylaws says forfeits
``shall be noted by an asterisk or footnote'' in the league record
book. But there is no mandate to alter records.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M players could not be reached for comment last night, but
several spoke earlier this week about the possibility of a forfeit.
Quarterback Branndon Stewart said players would not be bothered by
a forfeit to Louisiana Tech because it involved a nonconference
game and the Aggies could still win a Big 12 championship.
Cornerback Jason Webster concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's something we have to do, we just do it and move
on,'' Webster said. ``I don't think it would be a distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum said he was disappointed that Hardeman
would be lost for the season. A senior who has not been redshirted,
Hardeman could return in 1999 if granted an extra year by the NCAA
eligibility committee.
</P>
<P>
   NCAA Bylaw 14.2.6 allows a player to petition for reinstatement
of a lost season that resulted from ``a good-faith, erroneous
formal declaration of eligibility'' by his school. A&AMP;M officials
said last night they would push for such a waiver on Hardeman's
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a loss for our team, and a big disappointment for this
young man,'' Slocum said. ``We lose a good back and a guy with lots
of experience. Hopefully, he can turn this into a positive by
rededicating himself in the classroom and regaining his eligibility
for next season.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardeman could not be reached for comment last night. In two
games, he carried 24 times for 105 yards and scored four of the
Aggies' six rushing touchdowns.

ALLEGED ABUSESAT FAMILY CLINICSPUR CRACKDOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file) 
BY LEE CONDON AND PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ State health officials said Wednesday they are
toughening oversight of a family planning program, which an
L.A.-area clinic is accused of falsely billing for exams conducted
on children as young as 9 without parental consent.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic, located in the suburb of Paramount, is under
investigation on allegations that it recruited more than 100
youngsters a day on the streets of South Los Angeles and nearby
communities, luring them with money, cigarettes and beer, and then
took blood tests or gave them condoms.
</P>
<P>
   The Paramount Medical Center's doctor, Candace Chang, is
suspected of child endangerment, health care benefit fraud and
conspiracy to commit those offenses, according to a search warrant
request obtained Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the process of developing a monitoring program that
identifies overexpenditures and overbilling. That's in the works,''
said Department of Health Services spokeswoman Lea Brooks on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents, Chang denied to the investigators
that she had done anything illegal. No one answered the phone
Wednesday at the Paramount Medical Center, and Chang could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The department's 2-year-old Family Planning Access Care and
Treatment Program has not encountered any similar allegations,
Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new program and this is the first complaint we have
had. This isn't a widespread problem,'' Brooks said. ``Any
insurance provider has to trust doctors. There's going to be bad
seeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, children do not need a parent's consent to get
family planning services. There is no minimum age set, but children
are eligible when they are mature enough to reproduce _ a
determination made by a doctor with no oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a minimum age. Under the age of 12 is very
unusual, but it is possible,'' Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   In Superior Court documents filed in a search warrant request,
investigators said the Paramount clinic solicited children as young
as 9 in order to submit bills to the state.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks said the health department is investigating Paramount for
their Family PACT and Medi-Cal billings, adding that the clinic's
alleged recruitment efforts were unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine that being an acceptable practice,'' Brooks
said. ``I would think that if a lot of claims came in with 9- or
10-year-old kids it would definitely be a red flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's deputies received a tip in late August from a man who
said six girls between 9 and 14 were offered $10 to go to the
clinic, nine miles away from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The six girls were crammed into a compact vehicle that had
neither enough seating or seat belts for all the passengers,''
investigators said in court papers filed in support of a search
warrant request.
</P>
<P>
   Chang is accused of employing about a dozen ``runners'' who
would drive to low-income areas in search of children, court papers
said. One runner told a detective he made from $80 to $500 per day.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said in court papers that the children were
enticed with money and other gifts, such as cigarettes and beer, so
they could be brought to the clinic ``to inflate medical bills for
procedures not performed.''
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents, patients were routinely asked to
lie about their ages and names, and instructed not to tell their
parents about the incidents.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 4, according to court records, Chang came to the
Paramount sheriff's station and admitted that drivers had offered
to buy beer and cigarettes for underage patients. But she said she
only found out after interviewing patients.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives told the judge in court papers that ``we saw drivers
escorting youthful patients to a nearby liquor store.''
</P>
<P>
   Detectives interviewed at least two groups of children before
asking for a search warrant. The second group comprised four boys
from Paramount, ages 12 to 17, who were recruited by a runner.
</P>
<P>
   While the six girls had blood drawn and were asked if they
wanted a pap smear, investigators said the boys were asked to fill
out a five-page form, were offered a handful of condoms and then
released.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy John McBride of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department said detectives are continuing an investigation. ``Other
than that, we're not putting out any information because it might
jeopardize the investigation,'' McBride said.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Sasaki, president and chief executive officer of Planned
Parenthood of Los Angeles, said Paramount's recruitment efforts
were way out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an appalling way to treat people and to run a
business,'' Sasaki said. ``We are definitely opposed to any types
of coercive efforts. Family planning needs to be an individual's
choice.''

LUCKY FERTILITY TICKET YIELDS QUADRUPLETS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY YVETTE CABRERA  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
LOS ANGELES _ For three years, Tony and Shawna Brino tried just
about everything, from home remedies to fertility treatments, to
get pregnant. But in the end, the secret to their success was a
door prize.
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Wednesday, as his daughter and three sons curled and
stretched their tiny bodies in their incubators at the hospital's
neonatal intensive-care unit, Tony Brino recalled how their journey
to life began.
</P>
<P>
   Shawna Brino, 29, gave birth to healthy quadruplets Monday at
Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in the L.A. suburb of Woodland
Hills almost a year after the couple, from Rosamond, Calif., landed
the winning raffle ticket for one free in vitro fertilization
cycle.
</P>
<P>
   His wife tricked him by inviting him to attend what he thought
was a real estate seminar, he joked. Instead, the meeting was a
fertility seminar at the Antelope Valley Fertility Institute in
Lancaster. At the door, everyone was handed a ticket for a free
chance at an $8,500 procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell, I didn't even know what in vitro fertilization was,''
quipped Tony, 40, an avionics technician for the government. ``All
I knew was the old-fashioned way.''
</P>
<P>
   When the winning number was called, Shawna jumped for joy,
knowing they had won a chance at having children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at our ticket and asked: What do we get? A TV?'' Tony
said. ``She said, No, even better. The rest is history.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that when he learned exactly what he and his wife had
won, he laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I didn't realize that it would come to this,'' he
said, smiling as he watched over Nikolas, Lorenzo, Zachary and
Myrinda, who were born by Caesarean section with no complications.
</P>
<P>
   For Shawna, the raffle ticket was the couple's salvation for a
procedure they had considered, but could not afford. Typically, in
vitro fertilization is not covered by medical insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure is used when there is an impediment to the union
of sperm and egg in the uterus. The process involves giving hormone
treatment to the mother-to-be to produce several eggs, removing the
eggs from the ovaries and mixing them with sperm until a blastocyst
_ an embryo in its early stages _ is formed. The blastocyst is then
implanted in the mother's uterus and the pregnancy proceeds
normally.
</P>
<P>
   While the number of children born in multiple births is rising
nationwide, quadruplets remain relatively rare in Southern
California. For instance, 11 sets of quads were born in 1992 in Los
Angeles, according to the most recent statistics from the county
Department of Health Services.
</P>
<P>
   Ecstatic at her luck that night, Shawna Brino rushed home and
began calling friends and family with the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going into debt hundreds of thousands of dollars wasn't
something we really wanted to do,'' said the new mother, who worked
as a cashier at Sears before entering Kaiser Permanente in June for
full-time supervision. Dr. Patricia Schmidt helped her make it
through the pregnancy, which lasted almost 34 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Brinos learned early on that they would have multiple
babies, but they were shocked when they were told of the
quadruplets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was astounding,'' said Shawna. ``I didn't even know what to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband said the quads would be in keeping with their
houseful of pets, which includes five dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's no big deal,'' he said. ``We have a lot of fish,
we have a lot of dogs, we have a lot of kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we'll be able to handle it. We're overwhelmed, sure.
But we'll just have to go through a period of adjustment. No more
tennis for me.''
</P>
<P>
   As his children came into the world Monday afternoon within a
span of two minutes, Tony Brino was left speechless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually I have things to say in my life,'' he said, ``but in
that moment I had nothing to say. I was in a state of awe.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple won't be alone in caring for their brood. Shawna's
mother is on her way from Colorado to stay with the family. And
Antonio, Tony's 16-year-old son from a previous marriage, already
has been designated as part-time nanny.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be our helper now, whether he knows it or not,''
Tony said. ``I told him: Get a few girlfriends. You have my
permission now.''
</P>
<P>
   Housing the quadruplets will be a challenge for the couple, who
have sold their three-bedroom home and are searching for a bigger
one.
</P>
<P>
   As news of their babies spread, the couple began receiving gifts
like bassinets, car seats and other baby products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even people that didn't like me called me up saying, I have
this for you,'' Tony said. ``People reach down into their hearts.
I've been so overwhelmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Donations can be sent to St. Mary's of the Desert Catholic
Church, 3100 15th St. Rosamond, CA 93560. Or call (805) 256-4505 on
Wednesday through Friday from 3 to 6 p.m. &QL;

DO EITHER THE CUBS OR THE METS WANT THE WILD-CARD SPOT? 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Milwaukee Brewers had just wiped out more than
half of the Chicago Cubs' 7-0 lead and had runners at first and
second with only one out. Felipe Alou, the Montreal Expos' manager,
sat in the visiting manager's office at Shea Stadium and didn't
take his eyes off the small television set.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the game in Milwaukee, Sammy Sosa had electrified the
County Stadium crowd by slugging his 64th and 65th home runs,
catapulting himself into a tie with Mark McGwire for the running
home run record and sending a message to the Mets, who would have
to beat the Expos later in the day to match what looked like a sure
Chicago victory and maintain their wild-card tie with the Cubs. But
now, in the seventh inning, the Cubs led, 7-4, and Alou was
intrigued with the development.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they blow this game,'' the veteran manager said, ``they
don't win another game. This is a game of momentum. Everybody's
celebrating two home runs by Sosa and suddenly you get beat, it
takes two weeks to recuperate. And they don't have two weeks to
recuperate.''
</P>
<P>
   In his homeland, the Dominican Republic, Alou is called
``profeta,'' the Spanish word for prophet. He is known as a deep
thinker, and his pronouncements are taken seriously. The Mets were
ready to believe.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs got two fly balls and escaped the inning with their
shrunken lead. But before long, the game was in the ninth inning,
the lead was down to two runs and the Brewers had the bases loaded
with one out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we were talking about,'' Alou said to his
visitor, who had returned to watch the denouement. ``You lose a 7-0
lead and you have to take a four-hour plane ride to Houston. It
would be devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs got the second out on a foul pop and appeared to have
the victory in hand when Geoff Jenkins lofted a seemingly routine
fly ball to left field. Brant Brown went back toward the warning
track, circled the ball, came in a couple of steps and put his
glove up for the game-ending catch. Clank.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the ball that hit in the glove and popped out was
rolling away, and all three Milwaukee runners were scampering to
the plate. Without a play there, all three scored and the Cubs,
dazed and stunned, walked lifelessly off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Could the wind have carried the ball just far enough away from
Brown to cause that incredible finish? Shaking his gray-topped head
no, Alou said simply, ``Pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, thinking of the game ahead, he said, ``That should be a
lift for this team.''
</P>
<P>
   But Alou's Expos wound up giving the Cubs a lift instead. Just
when a Mets victory could have inflicted additional psychic damage
on the Cubs, irreparable damage perhaps, the Mets inexplicably
cowered before mighty Montreal and lost, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way a team in the Mets' advantageous position should
lose a game like this, but the Mets found a way. Just as they did
when John Franco squandered a lead on the threshold of victory in
Houston last week, the Mets squandered a chance to take the
wild-card lead on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The lead was theirs to take, and they did not take it. Did
someone say pressure? This failure might have been worse because
the Cubs handed the Mets the opportunity of a September. Failing to
capitalize on it, the Mets, despite thier recent rash of
late-inning heroics, have to question their desire, their character
and their ability. This was their eighth loss to the Expos in 12
games. The Expos played 10 other teams this season that have
winning records. But the Expos don't have a winning record against
any of those other teams.
</P>
<P>
   Brian McRae was asked why the Expos played so well against the
Mets this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't like us,'' the Mets' outfielder said. ``Their
coaches don't like Bobby. They don't care too much for us. Not only
do they want to beat us just to beat us, but they don't like our
manager. That gives them incentive. They like to beat Bobby. They
enjoy beating us. You can tell. You talk to players on other teams
and you hear a lot of things.''
</P>
<P>
   McRae wouldn't say what the Mets hear or why the Expos don't
like Bobby Valentine, though Valentine is probably one of the least
liked managers in baseball. But Alou denied that he harbored any
ill feeling toward Valentine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Valentine very much,'' he said. ``I don't talk to all
of the managers. He's one guy I talk to. I owe him favors for use
of their facilities. He asks about a number of players. I give him
my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou felt the explanation for the Expos' mastery over the Mets
lay in the pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had some well-pitched games against them,'' Alou had
said, ``and when you have well-pitched games, you have a shot at
winning the game.''
</P>
<P>
   This latest one was pitched so well it took six Expos pitchers
to complete the game. The platoon of pitchers held the Mets to
three hits. Do not look for any of the pitchers' names on any
future Hall of Fame roster.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' effort was as dismal as that of their fans, whose
reaction to them has been as inexplicable as their inability to
beat the Expos. The attendance was 29,728 for the final home game _
final regular-season home game? _ meaning Shea had more than 20,000
empty seats. If the Mets' enthusiasts have no more enthusiasm than
they demonstrated by their absence on Wednesday night, maybe they
don't deserve playoff games anymore than the Mets do.  &QL;

DEMOCRATS   CLOSING RANKS   WITH CLINTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

(Daily News Staff Writer Terri Hardy contributed to this report.) 
By Rick Orlov   and Jesse Hiestand  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Phone calls to Los Angeles-area members of
Congress are showing a swing toward President Clinton since
broadcast of his taped grand jury testimony and Democrats have
turned upbeat about his fund-raising visit to California that will
start Friday.
</P>
<P>
   With the boost for Clinton, Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, the Democratic
gubernatorial nominee, has decided to join the president at
fund-rasing efforts after all. And Republican Gov. Pete Wilson said
Wednesday he believes the GOP should spare the country further
turmoil by finding a punishment short of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Republican and Democratic congressional offices in the area
reported Wednesday that the public attitude toward the president
has changed noticeably since Monday's broadcast of his four hours
of testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The district office of Rep. Elton Gallegly, R-Oxnard, a House
Judiciary Committee member, received about 1,000 calls from people
weighing in on the president last week _ about 700 favoring
impeachment and about 300 opposed _ but since Monday, those two
sides are in a dead heat, said administrative assistant Joel
Kassiday.
</P>
<P>
   Added David Foy, a spokesman for Rep. Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon,
R-Santa Clarita: ``People who want him out are very adamant'' but
have dropped from 87 percent of callers last week to about 65
percent this week.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Tom Waldman, press secretary to Rep.
Howard L. Berman, D-Mission Hills, also a member of the House
Judiciary Committee that is reviewing material from Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr, said there has been a backlash against
Republican tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority (of callers) are not pleased with the release of
the videotape,'' he said. ``The general tone was that this was
taking things too far, that it was an effort to get the president
and was beyond the scope of the charges and more of a personal
attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Those trends, as well as public opinion polling, are giving
Democrats more confidence that the president and first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton's fund-raising events in the state Friday and
Saturday will help the party's candidates in November and spur a
higher Democratic voter turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been popular in California _ he was the first
Democrat since President Johnson in 1964 to carry the state _ and
he is going to two past bastions of support in the Silicon Valley
and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm hearing is, What's the fuss?'' said Rick Reidy, an
investment banker and former Democratic Party official. ``It seems
to be much ado about nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, California is a lot further removed from the
Beltway, both geographically and psychologically, in terms of
lifestyle. The fact he committed adultery is not quite as shocking
out here.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS.)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reidy said he believed the videotape of the president's
testimony will help Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave him a short boost, but in the long run it helps
because there was not one question about Whitewater, Filegate or
Travelgate. It was all about sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican consultant Dan Schnur said he believes the swing for
Clinton will be short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a measure of how far this president has fallen ... the
fact there are no new embarrassments is a cause for celebration,''
Schnur said. ``What's more telling is the fact he is keeping such a
low profile this trip. Normally, the president brings not only
money, but attention. This trip, he's doing a lot more privately.''
</P>
<P>
   All three fund-raisers he is attending _ Friday in Silicon
Valley, and Saturday in San Diego and Los Angeles _ are private.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles event has a price tag of $5,000 a person, with
proceeds going to the Democratic National Committee. It is being
held at the Westside home of Haim Saban of Saban Entertainment Co.,
which produces ``The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' TV show.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton, in contrast, is going to be highly visible at
an open event for Democratic U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, who is
running for re-election Nov. 3 in a close race against Republican
state Treasurer Matt Fong.
</P>
<P>
   California Democratic Party political director Bob Mulholland
believes this is the start of yet another political comeback for
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The polling that has been released over the past couple of
days shows voters think this was done by Republicans for political
purposes,'' Mulholland said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the president's fund-raising events have sold out,
showing the depth of support for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president said a couple of weeks ago that adversity brings
out your friends,'' Mulholland said. ``Well, he's got a lot of
friends in California.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who received Clinton's help in raising about $3million
recently, also is coming around for him. Aides said Davis, who
initially indicated he was not sure whether he would attend the Los
Angeles event, now say he will be at the fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, a longtime Clinton critic, offered a tempered view.
</P>
<P>
   In Culver City, where he signed education legislation into law,
the governor said censure of the president ``probably would be
preferable'' to impeachment and called for other Republicans to
stop their push to oust Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to spare the country that,'' said Wilson, who served
in the U.S. Senate before he was elected governor. Although Clinton
has ``weakened and demeaned'' his presidency, Wilson said, his GOP
colleagues should look to ending the turmoil over the scandal. &QL;

GOVERNOR SIGNS BILL TO ENFORCE RULES FOR CHOOL SOCIAL PROMOTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY TERRI HARDY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Gov. Pete Wilson has signed into law a bill that
will stop California schools from promoting failing students to the
next grade, calling the practice a massive deception by the
education system.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law that will first apply in the 1999-2000 school
year, students who are not performing at grade level at the end of
the term will have to attend summer school or take other remedial
tutoring. If they do not progress, they will be held back, Wilson
told a crowd of children during the bill's signing Wednesday at La
Ballona Elementary School in Culver City, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   California schools have in the past participated in a ``massive
deception where they graduate high school students that are
functionally illiterate,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Wilson, ``Yes, some children will be held back and that
can be painful. But, it is nowhere near the pain they will suffer
being held back from a good job or a college education.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly how many students are passed on every year
even though they are performing below grade level. Los Angeles
Unified School District officials estimate anywhere from 20 percent
to 80 percent are permitted to advance even though they do not meet
academic standards.
</P>
<P>
   An LAUSD task force, already examining the elimination of social
promotion, welcomed the governor's action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're prepared and ready to move forward,'' said Brad Sales,
an LAUSD spokesman. ``Recommendations will be brought to the
superintendent next month. And, we're looking at resources and how
to align them to begin ending social promotion.''
</P>
<P>
   The LAUSD immediately will begin to offer more remedial programs
and might decide to retain students as early as the end of this
school year.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson also signed legislation Wednesday that would provide
additional funds for summer school or other tutoring programs _ for
a total of $155 million to be made available to California schools.
</P>
<P>
   But LAUSD officials have said the money they could expect, some
$18 million, will not begin to fund the amount of remedial classes
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Board of Education member David Tokofsky, who said he believes
as many as 80 percent of Los Angeles students are not performing at
grade level, said the task will require Herculean efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to need a focused, intense, singular effort with
the mission of improving literacy,'' Tokofsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Tokofsky said the district must totally re-examine the way it
spends its federal money for underprivileged children, and divert
much of it to remedial programs.
</P>
<P>
   Sales said the district also could seek additional legislation
to provide more money to fund the remedial programs.
</P>
<P>
   The law states that a student's performance will be gauged on
grades and scores on the Stanford 9 standardized test, which is now
given to every child in California in grades 2-11.
</P>
<P>
   Districts will be required to hold back poor performing students
in grades 2, 3, 4 as well as the grades between elementary and
middle school, and middle and high school. In the LAUSD, those are
grades 5 and 8.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers will have more authority to determine whether a child
should not be held back, but must provide an achievement plan to
improve the student's grades.
</P>
<P>
   Marni Anderson, a third-grade teacher at La Ballona said she
welcomes the mandatory remediation efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've offered summer school in the past, but a lot of parents
don't take advantage of it,'' Anderson said. ``This law will put
pressure on the families to give children the help they need.'' &QL;

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
ST. LOUIS _ While Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa compete for one of
baseball's most revered individual accomplishments, the Astros
reached a team benchmark Wednesday night.
<TEXT>
<P>
   They joined the Century Club.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros won their 100th game of the season with a 7-1 victory
over the St. Louis Cardinals at Busch Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros are the third team this season to reach 100, joining
the New York Yankees (110) and Atlanta Braves (103).
</P>
<P>
   Since 1962, only 18 National League teams have won 100 games in
a season. Before this season, the closest the Astros had come was
96 victories in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, when you talk about the really fine teams, you don't
talk about teams that won 99,'' manager Larry Dierker said. ``I
think this reaffirms what we believed _ that we're as good a club
as there is around.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros had to be at the top of their game Wednesday because
Randy Johnson needed some help. Johnson won his seventh straight
decision, despite allowing a first-pitch home run to Pat Kelly and
six walks, tying a season high.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the walks were to McGwire and drew loud boos from the
crowd of 38,997.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way you can say he was tenacious, and another way you
could say he was lucky,'' said Dierker, whose club won for just the
fourth time in its past 10 games. ``He just really didn't have good
control, and at the beginning he didn't have very good stuff, for
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the innings went on, he began to pick up velocity, but he
never did really find his control.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Astros found their bats, which had been missing in a
4-0, five-hit loss to St. Louis on Tuesday. They needed only 10
batters to reach that total Wednesday, staking Johnson to a quick
3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you can get runs early in the game, it makes a
pitcher's job that much easier,'' said Johnson, who allowed eight
hits and struck out eight in seven innings in his final tuneup for
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's Sosa tied McGwire earlier in the day with home runs
No. 64 and 65 at Milwaukee. The Astros kept it that way, but just
barely.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire went 1-for-3 Wednesday with a single and two walks. But
in his last two at-bats, his long, high fly in the seventh inning
was caught at the warning track, and he went deeper _ but in the
wrong direction _ in flying out to the center-field track in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire went 1-for-7 with two strikeouts in the two-game series
with the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``I struggled all night with my mechanics and control,'' Johnson
(10-1) said. ``Not only did I walk him (McGwire) twice, but I
walked four other guys. I walked the pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans obviously wanted to see him hit a home run. I wasn't
trying to walk him. I always relish an opportunity to pitch against
someone like him. That's how you base your performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he was aware that each time McGwire stepped to the
plate, a special ball, stamped in the event of a home run, was
used.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would take my warm-up pitches when he was on deck, and when
he came to the plate they would switch the balls,'' Johnson said.
``You warm up with a ball, and all of a sudden you get another ball
and it's not rubbed up. You have to make a little adjustment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros sent St. Louis starter Darren Oliver out early,
scoring three runs in the first inning and another in the second as
the Cardinals had their six-game winning streak snapped.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hidalgo was 3-for-4 with a pair of doubles, and Moises
Alou had three singles.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who beat St. Louis for the second time in 11 days,
improved to 7-0 with a 1.16 ERA in his last seven starts. He has
allowed only seven earned runs in his last 54 innings.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis had the bases loaded twice against Johnson and had two
runners on base on five occasions. But each time the Cardinals
threatened, Johnson answered.
</P>
<P>
   One-hundred victories was a special occasion for the Astros _
and Johnson has accounted for one-tenth of the total in his short
stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes to show you what type of pitcher he is,'' Craig Biggio
said. ``He really never gives in and makes quality pitches when he
has to. That's one thing I noticed when he came over here. He's not
a thrower; he's a pitcher. He throws 96 to 97 mph, and he pitches.
It's kind of nice to have on your side.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might not have had his best stuff, but he gave us a
chance.''

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Texas A&AMP;M fullback D'Andre Hardeman was declared ineligible
Wednesday, forcing A&AMP;M to forfeit a win over Louisiana Tech and
sending the Aggies' bowl contention into a confusing jumble that
could become an NCAA test case.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hardeman, a senior from North Shore, was ruled out for the
season because of a clerical error in which the wrong grade for a
summer course was recorded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a posting error in the grades over the summer,'' Texas
A&AMP;M athletic director Wally Groff said. ``It was discovered once it
came up in a computer. He would have been ineligible if it was
discovered in August, but it wouldn't have been near as
embarrassing to him, his family and his teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   It also wouldn't have caused the potential ramifications to the
A&AMP;M season.
</P>
<P>
   If A&AMP;M wins seven games on the field this season but the forfeit
reduces the Aggies' record to 6-6, A&AMP;M would not qualify for a
bowl, said Mark Jones, an NCAA enforcement director and liaison to
the NCAA football certification subcommittee. With the forfeit, A&AMP;M
is 1-2 (Hardeman was held out of Saturday's 24-6 victory over
Southern Mississippi) and must win six of its remaining nine games
to qualify for a bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The language is six wins and a winning season,'' Jones said of
the bowl-qualification requirements. ``On the face of the rule
itself, if there is a forfeiture it's designed to say we're giving
up this victory, and then it wouldn't satisfy the rule. If you end
up 6-6 by virtue of a forfeiting, you wouldn't be a `deserving
winning team' as required by the rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forfeiture is supposed to mean just that. It could be
something that is appealed, or subject of a request for
interpretation. I don't think this has ever happened. A school in
this spot might want to test that rule and see what is really
intended.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said it would not be considered relevant that one of the
A&AMP;M losses was in an extra game, the Kickoff Classic against
Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   But there is language in the NCAA Manual to allow for exceptions
to the ``winning season'' requirement. A conference may request a
waiver if its champion does not have the required six Division I-A
wins or a winning record, and its league has only one guaranteed
bowl spot. The Big West earned such a waiver last season to allow
Utah State to play in the Humanitarian Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Also, many teams have forfeited games after accepting bowl bids
and have been allowed to compete. More often, forfeits are
announced after the season (including Big 12 members Texas Tech and
Colorado last season) and have no bearing on bowl ramifications for
the teams forfeiting games or winning in a forfeit.
</P>
<P>
   Big 12 senior associate commissioner Donnie Duncan said it was
too early to know if the Big 12 would, if necessary, request such a
waiver for A&AMP;M because the entire league membership would have to
vote on such a request by A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to just win at least six of them and make it a moot
question,'' Groff said. ``It might be something to pursue at a
later date.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Hardeman, a senior, never has redshirted, A&AMP;M could
request an additional season of competition should he regain his
academic eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am disappointed to learn that Tiki Hardeman will be
ineligible this season,'' A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum said. ``This is a
loss for our team and a big disappointment for this young man.
Hopefully, he can turn this into a positive by rededicating himself
in the classroom and regaining his eligibility for next season.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardeman had rushed for 105 yards and four touchdowns in the
first two games of the season, including three touchdowns against
Louisiana Tech. The 5-10, 232-pound fullback has been one of A&AMP;M's
all-time most prolific scorers with 30 career touchdowns, including
18 in 1996, one shy of the school record. His 95-yard run that
season is the longest in school history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I presented to the team a best-case scenario and a worst-case
scenario,'' Slocum said. ``The worst-case scenario is we know Tiki
will not be with us in the games and that (the forfeit) would be a
loss in the eyes of the bowls and the polls. We know we have to win
six more games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best-case scenario is if we continue to win and (the NCAA
certification subcommittee) would consider this, even though it's a
forfeit, like it's a win.''

 By ALAN TRUEX  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ Joe Torre, his leathery face a visage of affability and
composure, is not the complaining type. His favorite word is an
approving ``Wow.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   TorreBut last week the low-key manager of the New York Yankees
delivered a stern lecture to his players. The themes he emphasized
were sloppiness and waning concentration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can just turn it on,'' he said. ``You always want to
stay focused, to stay sharp.''
</P>
<P>
   In mid-August, baseball's most mythologized franchise was on
pace to break the major-league record for victories in a season.
It's a record many people assumed the Yankees, with their
pin-striped pantheon of Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, Mantle and Maris,
possessed.
</P>
<P>
   But it's one of baseball's ironies that the 116 wins were
accomplished _ in 1906 _ by those enduring symbols of futility, the
Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs' standard survives only because the Yankees have been
curiously average over the past month and a half. They have won
only 18 of their past 36 games.
</P>
<P>
   They put away the American League East on Sept. 9 _ the earliest
clinching by a Yankees team since divisional play began in 1969.
After the champagne shower, Torre expected ``a falloff _ but not
the sort of fall-down we've had.''
</P>
<P>
   He was happier Wednesday night, after his team won 8-4, its
third consecutive victory over the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The four-game series in Yankee Stadium might have been a preview
of the AL Championship Series, although it was no indicator of team
strength. Torre and Cleveland's Mike Hargrove were ``hiding'' their
best pitchers and resting star players.
</P>
<P>
   As Torre said, ``I think Mike and I are doing the same thing,
asking players when they come into the clubhouse, `Do you want to
play?'''
</P>
<P>
   But even if Wednesday's game resembled spring training (the
starters were Jason Jacome and Mike Jerzembeck), it had historic
value. It was the Yankees' 110th victory, which tied the club
record set in 1927.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' Torre said. ``That's Babe Ruth's team. If that's the
only record we get, being mentioned in the same breath as the 1927
Yankees, I'll take it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have four more games to reach their next goal, which
is the AL record of 111 wins, set by the 1954 Indians _ in 154
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing with enough intensity right now,'' Torre said.
``Since our team meeting last week, I've felt better about our
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, questions linger about the pitching rotation. Torre
hasn't decided who will be in it and in what order.
</P>
<P>
   David Wells, 18-4 with a perfect game and a 3.48 ERA, is the
obvious ace. But the round-bellied lefthander is undergoing back
therapy, and he looks more suited to leading the pitching staff to
the buffet line rather than into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Torre has hinted that Orlando ``El Duque`` Hernandez, 11-4 with
a 3.18 ERA, could start No. 1 because he can be counted on to
bounce back and pitch a second time in a five-game series, if
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Wells a health risk, so is David Cone. Torre wants
to take it easy with the big-game specialist who has won 19 this
season but has a history of arm ailments. Cone will pitch only once
in the best-of-five opening round.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest concern with this team is Andy Pettitte, the
dimple-chinned lefty from Deer Park. Pettitte is 16-11, but in his
past seven starts he's 2-5 with 33 earned runs allowed.
</P>
<P>
   His velocity has slipped from 90 mph to 86-87, and his sinker,
curve and changeup are hanging like a dark cloud. His ERA has
fattened to 4.30.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN analyst Harold Reynolds, a former major-league second
baseman, attributes Pettitte's demise to ``flinching'' and
shortening his follow-through _ a habit Reynolds says developed
after the pitcher was bruised by a line drive.
</P>
<P>
   Other theorists say Pettitte is throwing too many cutters and
not enough curves and fastballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's so smart and got it all figured out,'' Pettitte
said, understandably weary of this topic.
</P>
<P>
   Torre, who thinks Pettitte is ``worrying too much about his
mechanics,'' has refused to affirm the pitcher's starting status
for the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I don't have confidence in Andy,'' Torre said.
``But let's give it a couple of games.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of games were all it took for Hideki Irabu to return
from oblivion and force his way into the playoff picture. Irabu
(13-9) has had an up-and-down season. His ERA rose from a
league-leading 2.47 in July to 4.40, before he chopped it back to
3.99 by allowing no earned runs in his past two starts.
</P>
<P>
   Given that Irabu is a favorite of omnipresent owner George
Steinbrenner, the Japanese righthander conceivably could edge
Pettitte for the fourth and final turn in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   If Torre goes with Wells, Cone, Hernandez and Irabu, then
Pettitte, the hero of the 1996 World Series, could be excluded from
the postseason roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't see myself helping us much out of the bullpen,''
Pettitte said.
</P>
<P>
   But he also said he would be shocked if he's not in the
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've won more games in the last three years than anyone in
baseball,'' he said. ``So I don't think it's an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the resurgence of Irabu, it is an issue.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, any manager would welcome Torre's problems, which are
caused primarily by a surfeit of talented athletes. Consider that
rookie Shane Spencer, the team's sixth outfielder, has seven home
runs and a .423 batting average in 52 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does Torre have six pitchers with double-digit wins, he
has nine hitters with at least 10 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Five Yankees are in double figures in homers and stolen bases.
Derek Jeter, Bernie Williams, Paul O'Neill, Scott Brosius and
Bellaire's Chuck Knoblauch combined to set that major-league
record.
</P>
<P>
   But even with all the Yankees have accomplished, their erratic
final quarter-season has fans fretting, muttering about the
possibility of a postseason meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   By most measures, the Yankees are having a remarkable season.
But over the past few weeks, it has acquired a taint of
bittersweetness. And anything short of a World Series championship
will be considered a tragedy. If the Yankees can't surpass the
past, they will be haunted by it.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE BREWERS THAT MADE SOSA FAMOUS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 2nd graf for updating about McGuire)  (af)  
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ There was a time when the familiar slogan in this
bratwurst burg bragged about ``the beer that made Milwaukee
famous.'' But in baseball's year of the Great Home Run Race,
Milwaukee is now known for the pitching staff that made Sammy Sosa
famous.
</P>
<P>
   With his two homers here Wednesday for a total of 65, Sosa had
hit 12 against the Brewers' staff this season. More importantly, he
had tied Mark McGwire for the major league home-run lead. McGuire
went 1 for 3 with a single and two walks on Wednesday night against
the Houston Astros in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   When Sosa was hitting four home runs in three days against the
Milwaukee Brewers nearly two weeks ago, the Cubs slugger was asked
what he thought of the Brewers' transfer to the National League
this season after nearly three decades in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   With his trademark smile, Sosa replied, ``I think it was a very
good move.''
</P>
<P>
   Very good for him, certainly.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wednesday's game, Sosa had been in an 0-for-21 slump
since he had tied McGwire with his 63rd homer, a grand-slam in San
Diego a week ago. McGwire had hit two more since then, and with
only several days left in the season, the competition that had
riveted fans throughout the summer appeared to be over.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly Sosa energized the race, slugging home runs in the
fifth and sixth innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think Mark will finish in front of me,'' Sosa said.
``I have to give up and sacrifice myself to get on base. Mark don't
have to go to the playoff. When you try to go to the playoff, you
never think about home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came back today and hit the ball; it's part of the game,''
he said. ``It's a good sign. I feel great today. I feel patient.
When I play like that, I have a better chance. Yesterday I use
three bats, today I use one _ the good one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say this is my lucky team,'' he said later, alluding
to the Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   But as a group, Sosa and the Cubs weren't feeling lucky. They
lost, 8-7, in the ninth inning when three Brewer baserunners
suddenly scored as left fielder Brant Brown dropped a fly ball that
should have been a routine final out.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to Brownie can happen to everybody,'' Sosa said.
``What happened today, just forget about it and keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's first homer, off Rafael Roque in the fifth inning,
floated into the right-field stands at County Stadium, 344 feet
away. His second, off Rod Henderson in the sixth, soared over the
center-field fence, 410 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would trade the two homers for a victory, Sosa said:
``Definitely. I care about winning. I care about the team.''
</P>
<P>
   But the loss, like Sosa's two homers, are in the book now. His
12 homers against the Brewers average one for each of the 12 games
between the teams this season _ the highest per-game homer ratio
against one team in major league history.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Gehrig, the Iron Horse first baseman of the Yankees, hit 14
homers against the Cleveland Indians' staff in 1936 for the major
league record.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Adcock of the Milwaukee Braves and Hank Sauer of the Chicago
Cubs each hit 12 against one team in one season for the National
League record _ Adock against the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1956, Sauer
against the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   But in those eras, teams played 22 games against each other team
every season. Sosa hit his 12 against the Brewers in 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's homers also gave him 155 runs batted in. It's the fourth
highest total in NL history, behind Hack Wilson's major league
record 190 for the Cubs in 1930, Chuck Klein's 170 for the 1930
Philadelphia Phillies and Wilson's 159 in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   But the number Sosa seemed more concerned with were the eventual
number of dead and injured from Hurricane Georges in the Dominican
Republic, where he grew up and where he returns each off season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard anything,'' he said. ``When we get to Houston
tonight, I will make some phone calls and try to find out. It is
bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``But maybe this,'' he said, speaking of his two homers, ``helps
them feel a little better.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Cubs departed for Houston and Friday night's opener of
their season's concluding three-game series, Kerry Wood, their
21-year-old right-hander who struck out 20 Astros on May 6 to tie
the major league record, was almost as much a part of their
storyline as Sosa and Brown's error.
</P>
<P>
   Wood hasn't pitched since Aug. 31, when he sprained a ligament
in his right elbow. Now he may or may not return as a starter
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kerry threw the ball very well,'' said Jim Riggleman, the
Cubs' manager, after Wood fired fastballs and a few curveballs for
about 10 minutes before Wednesday's game. ``We'll see how he feels
tomorrow, but I'd say it's 50-50 at best that he'll pitch in
Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   After his brief workout, Wood said, ``I feel OK, it's up to
them.'' But even with the wild-card berth at stake, Riggleman and
Ed Lynch, the Cubs' general manager, might decide not to risk
reinjuring the golden arm that represents the future of the Cubs'
pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Tapani (19-8) will open for the Cubs against Mike Hampton
(11-7). Terry Mulholland (6-5) is scheduled for Sunday against
Shane Reynolds (19-8) unless he's needed in relief before that. The
Astros won't use Randy Johnson until next Wednesday's division
series opener.
</P>
<P>
   If Wood doesn't return Saturday, Mark Clark will start against
Jose Lima, who has surrendered two of Sosa's three homers against
the Astros this season.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter who pitches for the Cubs in Houston, their chances
will depend on Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we make it to the playoff, yes, I will be happy with this
season,'' he said. ``But if we don't, I got to go home and sing the
blues.''

   CLINTON-LEGAL-THINKING (Washington) _ In the Watergate era, the
misdeeds of lawyers provoked a national discussion about whether
``legal ethics'' was an oxymoron. In recent days, President
Clinton's troubles have spurred a new and broader debate about the
role of lawyers in American society. This time, the issue is not
whether they broke any laws but whether lawyers and their way of
thinking have become so pervasive in America that legalistic
gamesmanship is dominating politics _ and, perhaps, everyday life.

GONZALEZ WORTHY OF MVP

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Juan Gonzalez was set on being a social worker
before he signed his future over to baseball. Maybe he hasn't
changed the world as he once dreamed he would, but he is leaving a
big imprint on the American League-West pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, the Texas Rangers' rangy right fielder, has been
hotter than a Texas jalapeno all season but particularly since
bidding adieu to August. He brought a loaded 35-ounce bat into
Wednesday's battle at Edison Field, otherwise known as Anaheim's
last stand.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had every reason to run for cover when Gonzalez came
to the plate; he was batting .395 for the month at the night's
start. In four previous games against the Angels in that span he
had struck for seven hits and four RBI in 16 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   That would make him more dangerous than lightning, which rarely
hits the same place twice. Without question, he has charged the
Rangers down the stretch as they've gained 5{ games on the Angels
since Sept. 1 to take a three-game division lead with four games to
play.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez is so electrifying, he belongs right up there in this
year's baseball Mount Rushmore alongside Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa
and Ken Griffey Jr. In a season that has seen more than one
monolith toppled, Gonzalez has wielded his bat like a chisel with
the best of them.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, the Yankees' Derek Jeter and Boston's Nomar Garciaparra
are all having fine seasons, and Cleveland right fielder Manny
Ramirez has been generating more buzz of late than the new
television drama ``Felicity.'' But we'd be happiest to see Gonzalez
win his second American League MVP award in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Who else has carried a contending team with all the patience and
diligence of a woman with child? Gonzalez has distinguished himself
as only the 12th player in history to hit 40 home runs in five
seasons while driving in more runs (157) than any player in the
major leagues since 1949.
</P>
<P>
   He had an incredible 101 RBI at the All-Star break and people
wondered if Hack Wilson's 68-year-old record of 190 wasn't headed
the way of Roger Maris' 61 home runs. Wilson's record is safe for
at least another season. But Gonzalez, 28, has gone where neither
Willie Mays nor Mickey Mantel tread in RBI land and is closing in
on Ted Williams and Lou Gehrig, who finished with 159 RBI in 1949
and 1937, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Goodness gracious, Gonzalez has been averaging an RBI every 3.8
at-bats. We should all be so productive.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball insiders have been gaga over Gonzalez since he belted
43 homers in 1992 at the age of 22 and added 46 for an encore in
1993. When former Cincinnati Reds great Joe Morgan penned his
recently published book, ``Baseball for Dummies,'' he listed
Gonzalez among the game's top players. To Morgan's mild surprise,
his collaborators, all of them baseball fans, called him on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had these baseball people asking me, `Why Juan Gonzalez?'
Morgan, an ESPN baseball analyst, said before the game. ``I told
them, `This guy is the most consistent RBI guy in the league.' Of
course, he's made me look like a prophet this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has had a heavy cross to bear since hitting twice his
age in homers in 1993, his third full season in the majors. He felt
a lot of pressure to produce and the stress left him susceptible to
injuries. It didn't help that Gonzalez insisted on playing winter
ball in his native Puerto Rico, where he is widely idolized.
</P>
<P>
   He essentially played for free, giving all of his paychecks to
charities that helped HIV-positive children in his homeland. But
he'd pay a price every September when his body would inevitably beg
for rest and rebel if it wasn't forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   His ambitious offseason schedule nearly cost him and the Rangers
dearly in 1996. Gonzalez led the team to the brink of its first
division title, then batted .246 in September to turn a foregone
conclusion into a cuticle-biting race to the finish. In the end,
the Rangers held off Seattle and Gonzalez held off the Mariners'
Alex Rodriguez for MVP honors in the closest finish in AL history.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has bypassed winter ball the past two years but hasn't
stopped giving money and his time to charities in Puerto Rico and
his adopted city of Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great when I'm helping people,'' Gonzalez said. ``I see
a lot of poor people. A lot of people who are suffering. I feel
happy in my heart when I can do something for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing would give Gonzalez more bliss right now than to have
his season extended well into October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is talking about the MVP (award), but right now it's
more important to me for my team to win the division and try to get
to the World Series,'' Gonzalez said. ``I'm trying the best I can
to be patient and have concentration because I want to finish
strong.''

GRIFFEY, A-ROD ENOUGH TO KEEP MARINER INTEREST UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Tuba Man, God bless his soul, was still playing.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Kingdome Wednesday night _ with the Mariners on the
eve of their final series of this long, lost season _ the plaintive
puffing of The Tuba Man could be heard all down King Street and
around the corner to First Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lonely sound, too, since the crowds have dwindled to
pre-Miracle of '95 proportions. About 15,000 bothered to come down
for Wednesday's game against Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   The din and clatter and crowd cacaphony surrounding a team
headed for the post-season can be deafening. Remember '95 and '97?
But all is quiet on this most Western front, except for our boys
who seem all but destined for the Hall _ Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darn, am I still in the line-up?'' Griffey joked Wednesday
when he saw manager Lou Piniella's lineup card get posted.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you are, Junior. And thank goodness, since Griffey and
Rodriguez are still homering and driving in runs at a rate that is
making Cooperstown call for bats or balls and whatever will serve
as ever-lasting proof that at least two notable M's were alive and
kicking in '98.
</P>
<P>
   In such a disappointing season, you have to figure it's a good
thing that the reigning AL MVP Griffey and 1996 AL Player of the
Year (and shoulda been MVP) Rodriguez have made these final days of
September worth something here in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey tagged home runs 54 and 55 Tuesday, with No. 54 giving
him and his dad, Ken Griffey Sr. a combined 500 career homers.
Number 55 gave Griffey 140 RBIsthis season _ making him the only
player besides Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth to have three consecutive
seasons with 140 or more RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey said Wednesday he did not bother to track down the No.
55 home-run ball _ pretty unusual in this Mark McGwire/Sammy
Sosa-inspired frenzy about retrieving important home-run balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only one that mattered was No. 54 because that's the one
that got me and my dad the 500,'' Griffey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked the police officer to try and get the ball. The guy
who caught it was great. Gave it right back. His name was Mike. He
just said `Here, you've worked hard all season for this and I
didn't do anything.' I just ran into the clubhouse, got him a bat,
signed it and that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey did say that since reaching 50 homers, his bats have
become very hot property.
</P>
<P>
   ``I signed the bat I hit 51 with for Marzie _ (catcher and team
goodwill ambassador John Marzano.) Number 52 went to Alex, but
that's because he hit his No. 40 with it. Number 53 went to the
Hall of Fame (after a request was made for a bat from the AL's
leading home-run king.) And I'm keeping the one I got 54 and 55
with,'' Griffey said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rodriguez _ with a wondrous 40/40 under his belt _
also tagged home run No. 41 Tuesday, making him the home-run
hittingest AL shortstop in history. Wednesday night he bolstered
that total by ripping No. 42. With that homer, Griffey and
Rodriguez have combined for 97, making them major league baseball's
third all-time leading homer duo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting for me. People said after '96 that I would have
a hard time putting up those kinds of numbers again. The thing that
drives me is consistency,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was not willing to conceed that his 40/40 was that
much less of an accomplishment than hitting 61 homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's pretty close to being as challenging. I mean, how
many people have hit 61 homers or more in a season now? Four? And
how many players have hit 40 homers and stolen 40 bases? Three. So,
you know ...''
</P>
<P>
   To prove his point, we get the feeling Mr. A-Rod just might like
to have a go at hitting 61 or 67 homers. But that's in the future.
And let's hope all of Rodriguez's future _ and Griffey's _ is in
Seattle, even though it's going to take a ton of Microsoft and
Nintendo cash to pull off that dream.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey suggested a plan for keeping both All-Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just going to hold Seattle hostage,'' he said, giggling.
``We want a package deal. If he goes, I go. And vice versa.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there was any jealousy or competition between the two
superstars, Griffey said no way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on totally two different pages. He's young, single. He
doesn't have to worry about certain things. Besides, he gets to hit
in front of me. One day, I'd like to hit in front of me, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said he would like to believe that the two All-Stars
have a mutually beneficial effect on each other.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the awesome achievements of these two players
bittersweet is that 1998 MVP votes won't be cast for Griffey and
Rodriguez, since any chance for the M's to contend in '98 was lost
in the Randy Johnson disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite his absence for in homer derby, it is nice to see
Griffey end the season with such a bang. Same for Rodriguez. It's
too bad it has to end so soon.
</P>
<P>
   Lost was any chance for baseball's biggest 1-2 punch (or 2-3
punch as the case may be) to showcase themselves, their team, this
city in the post-season. What a shame, since Rodriguez and Griffey
are two of the reasons why 1998 was one of baseball's greatest
seasons ever.

<P>
   MIAMI _ Hurricane Georges, which left at least 110 dead and
widespread destruction in the Caribbean, swept into Cuba on
Wednesday and took aim at South Florida, where the 80,000 residents
of the Florida Keys began evacuating their vulnerable island chain.
</P>
<P>
   The storm has already made a shambles of much of Puerto Rico,
the Dominican Republic and Haiti. At least 70 people were reported
killed in the Dominican Republic, and more than 40 others died
elsewhere, according to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dominican Republic, President Leonel Fernandez said half
the nation's power grid had been destroyed by wind, seventy percent
of the country's bridges were damaged or destroyed, and 90 percent
of its banana and other plantations were flattened.
</P>
<P>
   In Haiti, 27 people officially reported killed, but the actual
toll appeared likely to rise much higher.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the deaths in Haiti reportedly occurred when floodwaters
collapsed two homes in the capital, Port-au-Prince, where there
were no public shelters, the AP said. Four drowned in a suburb on
Wednesday afternoon. Deaths also were reported in Gonaives and in
Marmelade.
</P>
<P>
   In San Cristobal, a Dominican town 20 miles east of the capital,
Santo Domingo, the Nizao River overflowed and knocked down a part
of a school used as a shelter, reporters said, leaving 5 dead and
31 missing.
</P>
<P>
   In the shanty neighborhood of La Cienega, the swollen river
invaded thousands of homes, covering some up to the roofs in fetid
water. Residents swam out to their houses to try to retrieve their
belongings, some using empty gallon water jugs tied to their arms
to help them float.
</P>
<P>
   In Havana, the Cuban capital, President Fidel Castro put his
Cabinet on alert and said the country's armed forces would help get
medicine, food and other help to hurricane victims.
</P>
<P>
   By late Wednesday, authorities had already evacuated 200,000
people from their homes in Cuba's eastern provinces.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one will be forgotten in this new battle by the Cuban
people. We are a nation that has overcome adversity with unity,''
Mexico's official Notimex news agency quoted Castro as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The storm was on a trajectory that could send it crashing into
the Florida Keys by late Thursday or early Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, fearing that the storm could become the most ruinous
to strike Florida since Hurricane Andrew in 1992, Gov. Lawton
Chiles also declared a state of emergency for central and southern
Florida, allowing him to mobilize the National Guard. Schools were
ordered closed on Thursday and Friday in Miami-Dade County, and all
but essential county employees have been ordered to stay home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other evacuations, from Palm Beach to Tampa Bay, could start
tonight or Thursday morning,'' depending on the course the storm
takes, the Florida Department of Community Affairs warned in a
statement late Wednesday afternoon. At the same time, the National
Weather Service predicted ``storm surge flooding of four to six
feet above normal tide levels, accompanied by large and dangerous
battering waves'' in coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
   Since beginning its deadly march across the Caribbean last
weekend, the storm has killed more than 100 people people and
inflicted widespread destruction, including more than $1 billion in
property damage in Puerto Rico alone. The Insurance Information
Institute said most of the claims expected in the Caribbean would
come from commercial properties like hotels and resorts.
</P>
<P>
   With sustained winds of 115 miles an hour, the storm has moved
on a course from the northern Leeward Islands west and north across
the Dominican Republic and Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Weather forecasters predicted that the storm, which slowed
Wednesday and lost enough wind strength that it was temporarily
dropped to a Category 1 storm from a stronger Category 2, would
strike late Thursday somewhere in South Florida. The precise path
remained uncertain, which led the National Hurricane Center here to
declare a hurricane watch for both the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic
coasts of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Officials were waiting for a better sense of the storm's
trajectory before ordering evacuations or directing residents to
shelters, said John Joyce, a spokesman for the state Emergency
Operations Center. ``Because of the large swath of this storm, if
you move people, you might have to move them again in another
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   But from Key West to Key Largo, the northernmost island in the
Keys, a steady stream of cars and sport vehicles towing boats moved
north on U.S. 1, the two-lane road that links the low-lying
120-mile-long chain of islands to mainland Florida. At 5 p.m., the
highway was closed to all southbound traffic, and the authorities
said that residents who remained behind were on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our first mandatory evacuation in memory,'' said Cindy
Peryam, a spokeswoman for the Monroe County sheriff's office, ``so
we have no way of knowing how people will react. But since
Hurricane Andrew, people are much more cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   People leaving the Keys were directed to the main campus of
Florida International University, just a stone's throw from the
National Hurricane Center's headquarters west of Miami. But, Ms.
Peryam said, ``we're not going to be able to fit everybody there,
so this is one of those no-win situations where you hope people
will go north.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hurricane Andrew struck Miami with winds of 150 mph in
August 1992, almost 90 percent of Miami-Dade County's two million
residents had never experienced a tropical storm. But memories of
that experience have remained vivid, and people have moved promptly
to get emergency supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were lines before we even opened the store today,'' said
Victor Chin, manager of a Home Depot store in Kendall, the Miami
suburb that was one of the areas hardest hit by Hurricane Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   Chin said lines were ``maybe three or four hours deep,'' with
customers stocking up on batteries, plywood, flashlights and
shutters.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Andrew was the most costly natural disaster in
American history, inflicting more than $25 billion in damages,
which led several large insurance companies to abandon the state
and forced others into bankruptcy. The Florida state insurance
commissioner, Bill Nelson, said here Wednesday that an $11 billion
hurricane damage compensation fund had been created, but added that
he expected to have to draw only on a small part of it.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with 1992, Nelson said, ``we are looking at much
stronger structures to endure hurricane force winds.'' Building
codes throughout the state have been tightened, he said, and
enforcement has been stepped up.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Florida, residents have been shaken by the death and
devastation that Hurricane Georges has left in the Caribbean.

BURKETT DOMINATES IN 7-1 VICTORY AS RANGERS SWEEP ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Rangers relied on the most unreliable
member of their rotation to pitch this organization to the verge of
its second American League West title in three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander John Burkett, whom manager Johnny Oates recently
considered removing from the rotation, delivered during the
Rangers' 7-1 victory against the Angels last night at Edison
International Field of Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   The victory gave the Rangers a three-game advantage on the
second-place Angels in the AL West and reduced their magic number
to two with four games remaining. The Rangers will capture that
division title on any combination of their victories and losses by
the Angels that total two.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett, who surrendered one run on two hits in eight innings,
made the Rangers' precarious lead stand by outpitching Angels
right-hander Ken Hill (9-6).
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Todd Zeile and second baseman Mark McLemore
provided Burkett (9-13) a two-run advantage with a fourth-inning,
run-scoring single and a seventh-inning sacrifice fly,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've won 10 all year when we've scored three or less,'' Oates
said. ``We've got a chance to win some of those games with the way
we're pitching now.''
</P>
<P>
   Muscle spasms prevented Burkett from making his scheduled start
Sept. 15 against the Orioles, and that resulted in nine days' rest
before his start Friday against the Oakland Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett surrendered only one run through eight innings during
the Rangers' 3-1 victory Friday against the Athletics, and that
performance gave Oates the confidence to stay with a five-man
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Oates, who all along preferred staying with a five-man rotation,
entertained thoughts of removing Burkett from the rotation and
starting right-handers Rick Helling, Aaron Sele, Todd Stottlemyre
and Esteban Loaiza on three days rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became a blessing in disguise that he missed Baltimore and
Seattle and got bumped to Oakland and Anaheim,'' Oates said.
``Those are the two teams in the American League that he matches up
against best. His numbers say that, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Burkett entered last night's start 3-1 with a 3.16 earned-run
average in four career starts against the Angels, and delivered the
goods again despite little run support.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers entered last night's game ranked second only to the
Yankees in runs scored, but their lineup does not excel in the art
of manufacturing runs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the Rangers manufactured their first run without the
benefit of a base hit. Center fielder Tom Goodwin drew a five-pitch
walk from Hill and utilized his greatest asset _ speed _ to steal
second base with second baseman McLemore at-bat in the first
inning.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore advanced Goodwin to third base with a ground ball hit
to the right side of the infield, and left fielder Rusty Greer
drove home the game's first run with a one-out, sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, though, pulled even for the first time in this
series in their third inning. Switch-hitting catcher Chad Kreuter
laced an opposite-field, ground-rule double to left field for the
Angels' first hit and scored on the ensuing single by third baseman
Craig Shipley. Burkett, though, retired the next 14 batters the
Angels sent to the plate after Shipley's single.

PITTSBURGH'S COWHER A MAN OF STEEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ The jaw juts out on the NFL landscape like the
Matterhorn and is as solid as the Rock of Gibraltar.
</P>
<P>
   The glare can melt the face mask of the biggest, baddest
linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   The mouth can spew a venom-laced tirade, offer point-making
proposals or provide words of encouragement _ sometimes in the same
brief conversation.
</P>
<P>
   The gait is always deliberate but also can be unrelenting or
relaxed depending on where he is heading, and why.
</P>
<P>
   That is the anatomy of a football coach, and a very successful
one at that.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Cowher has been with the Pittsburgh Steelers since 1992,
when he was hired to replace Hall of Fame coach Chuck Noll. In
Cowher's first six seasons, the Steelers have been to the playoffs
each year, won five division titles and hosted the AFC Championship
game in three of the past four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers team that faces the unbeaten Seahawks at Three
Rivers Stadium on Sunday is owned by the Rooney family; run with
the guidance of director of football operations Tom Donahoe, who
interviewed for but was not offered the job of Seahawks general
manager in February; and filled with some players who are
redefining the way their positions are played _ center Dermontti
Dawson, quarterback Kordell Stewart, linebacker Levon Kirkland,
defensive back Carnell Lake and nose tackle Joel Steed.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake, the Steelers are Cowher's team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It starts from the top,'' said linebacker Chad Brown, who
played with the Steelers for four seasons before signing with the
Seahawks. ``Cowher is a very hard-nosed, players' coach. It sounds
kind of contradictory. But he's not so far removed from being a
player that he doesn't know what we're feeling and what's going on.
But at the same time, he insists upon and demands a hard-nosed,
aggressive style of football.''
</P>
<P>
   Insists? Cowher revels in it.
</P>
<P>
   Brown recalls training-camp practices, which were held under the
lights and in front of several thousand fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last drill was goal-line. It is a serious, 100-percent,
game-like drill,'' Brown said. ``Coach Cowher is standing behind
the linebacker like the umpire, slobbering and going at it. It is
frightening. It is absolutely frightening. Cowher's got the
whistle, and it's not coming early. They're running the option with
Kordell (Stewart). Kordell is getting hit. It is the real deal.
That hard-nosed attitude starts with the head guy and works its way
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowher, who turned 41 in May, says he doesn't like talking about
himself. But he is quick to point out that the guy you see stalking
the sideline each Sunday is not the same man who is married to a
former professional basketball player, Kaye, and father to three
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even then, I'm not one who's going to hide my emotions,''
Cowher said Wednesday. ``It's a lot more love at home than when you
see me screaming on the sideline. But I've just always believed
that's the way to be. It doesn't do any good to gunny-sack things.
I never thought that was healthy to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important that people know where you stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Make a mistake, and you will find Cowher and that jaw of his
right in your face. But if the attack comes from outside the
Steelers' family, that would be Cowher you see standing behind his
players.
</P>
<P>
   The latest and most visible example of Cowher on the defensive
came after Sunday's 21-0 loss to the Dolphins in Miami. Asked about
Stewart's 11-for-35, three-interception performance while
discussing the Steelers' on-going offensive problems, Cowher
whirled to face the questioner and erupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not point out Kordell Stewart. Maybe you may have tried
to put the words in my mouth. But I'm not. I'm not. I'm looking at
everybody,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a milder, more-controlled Cowher on the other end of the
telephone Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I try to do is be very up front with players
and be very up front with people,'' he said when asked about his
fiery reputation. ``I think the most important thing is that
everybody kind of knows where they stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people understand what you expect from them, they know what
their role will be. While they might not like it, I think the one
thing people will do is respect you if you can be up front.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowher and his team have the respect of Seahawks coach Dennis
Erickson. The Steelers are 2-1 and their offense ranks 28th in the
league after being shut out last week for the first time since
1993. But then, the Steelers have started 2-2 in four of their
first six seasons under Cowher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill is a fiery guy, a very emotional guy, and that's how they
play,'' Erickson said. ``Obviously they had disappointment last
week against Miami. But if you look back at Pittsburgh over the
last three or four years, some time early in the season ... that
happens to them. Then all of a sudden, they catch on fire and end
up winning the AFC Central.''
</P>
<P>
   This run of success has come despite yearly raids of Cowher's
players and assistants. In the past two offseasons, the Steelers
have lost half a Pro Bowl team to free agency _ Brown, cornerbacks
Willie Williams, Deon Figures and Rod Woodson, defensive end Ray
Seals and wide receivers Ernie Mills and Andre Hastings in 1997;
tackle John Jackson, wide receiver Yancy Thigpen and strong safety
Myron Bell this year. Assistant coaches Dom Capers, Dick LeBeau and
Chan Gailey also have left.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the correlation between the offseason losses and the
slow starts, Cowher offered, ``I like to think that's not the case.
But I think there's a degree of accuracy in that statement. When
you have new faces and you have new people involved in integral
parts of what you're trying to do ... it does take some time.''
</P>
<P>
   There really is a method to what could be perceived as Cowher's
madness.

STRIKE THREE FOR ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Just the other day, Gary DiSarcina said all
the pressure to win the AL West was on the Texas Rangers, not the
Anaheim Angels. After all, the Angels shortstop said, it was the
Rangers who made the big trades that were supposed to put them over
the top.
</P>
<P>
   And after Wednesday night's game, which the Rangers led, 7-1, in
the eighth inning, the Rangers were at the summit, looking down.
</P>
<P>
   A win Wednesday would give the Rangers a three-game sweep and a
three-game lead with four to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' magic number would be two, meaning even if the
Angels swept a four-game series in Oakland, the Rangers would need
only a split of their four-game series in Seattle to clinch the
crown.
</P>
<P>
   For the third night in a row, the Angels offense was nowhere to
be found. They were shut down by Todd Stottlemyre and Rick Helling
in the first two games, which is understandable. But Wednesday it
was John Burkett, who entered the game with an 8-13 record and 5.87
ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett looked like Roger Clemens the way he thoroughly
dominated the Angels' hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett retired the first six batters of the game before giving
up a double to Chad Kreuter and an RBI single to Craig Shipley. But
after Shipley's hit, Burkett retired 13 in a row before Darin
Erstad walked with two out in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels could not have asked for more from starter Ken Hill,
who pitched well despite a sore elbow. Hill gave up three runs (two
earned) and four hits in 61/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Angels defense, which had been so good for so long,
played poorly for the third night in a row, making two errors. And
the bullpen had another tough night. When Hill left, the score was
2-1. Troy Percival gave up three runs himself in the eighth inning,
two on Todd Zeile's home run.
</P>
<P>
   If the Angels didn't feel the pressure, it would be difficult to
understand what happened to them seemingly so suddenly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really feel that much pressure,'' DiSarcina said
Tuesday. ``We're not supposed to be here. Everybody knows we didn't
make a move before the break. Texas has pressure because they made
all the moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure I feel is we've had a great year, you don't want
to end it on a sour note. You battle through so many things,
overcome so many obstacles, I don't want it to end.''
</P>
<P>
   Like they did in the first two games of the series, the Rangers
scored before the Angels even came to bat. And they did it without
getting a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Goodwin led off the game with a walk, stole second, went to
third on Mark McLemore's grounder to first and scored on Rusty
Greer's sacrifice fly for a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett retired the Angels in order in the first two innings,
but the Angels got on the scoreboard in the third inning, the first
time this series they've scored before the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter opened the third with a double into the left-field
corner and scored when Shipley followed with a single to center.
Shipley was the Angels' third third baseman to start in the series.
The others were Paco Martin and Troy Glaus.
</P>
<P>
   If the Angels had gained any momentum at all after tying the
game, Hill allowed the Rangers to take it right back in the top of
the fourth. Will Clark doubled with one out and took third on Ivan
Rodriguez's flyout to deep right.
</P>
<P>
   After Lee Stevens walked, Zeile bounced a single up the middle
to score Clark for a 2-1 Rangers lead.
</P>
<P>
   Though it seemed many had given up on the Angels after they lost
the first two games of the series, Angels manager Terry Collins
insisted his players had not given up on themselves. Not when they
hadn't all season despite an inordinate number of injuries to key
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have players not willing to lay down,'' Collins
said. ``Players that are not going to give up no matter how bad the
situation is.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's helped that the guys who have come up to replace
injured guys have stepped up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels not only didn't give up, but they got angry. At least
pitcher Chuck Finley did. Finley's loud and vocal pep talk after
Tuesday's loss was just what the Angels needed, Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you've got to play angry,'' he said. ``We've got a
good clubhouse, guys like each other. But you don't need that to
win. The Oakland A's in the '70s hated each other. You want guys
who play mad. You've got to play the game (ticked) off.''

 UW's LOOKER GAINS RESPECT WITH RECEPTIONS, NOT CONNECTIONS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ He was ``Brock's Boy.'' He was allowed to come into
the University of Washington football program because he knew the
quarterback, was his primary receiver in high school. He was Brock
Huard's caddy.
</P>
<P>
   Or so some of the Huskies suspected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure people actually believed I wasn't Brock's Boy
until after that first game,'' Dane Looker says. ``I came to the
sidelines, and I started to get different looks from guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The legend of Dane Looker grows, even when he misses a game.
</P>
<P>
   He surprised Arizona State with 11 catches in the opener, tying
a UW record. And then, when he missed the Brigham Young game with a
bruised thigh, the Huskies struggled on offense. They'd like to
think some of those abortive runs on audible calls will be quick
flips to Looker on Saturday at Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having that H-back, that quick answer,'' said offensive
coordinator Scott Linehan, ``will help avoid unnecessary contact on
the quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington is either very lucky with receivers, or the program
casts a very long shadow. On the heels of accepting a transfer from
Acadia University in Nova Scotia, Jerome Pathon, the Huskies are
now home to a player who opted out of Western Washington, where his
sport was basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that we had any idea that he was going to be this
good,'' Linehan said.
</P>
<P>
   Join the crowd. Nobody had that notion when Looker was catching
18 touchdown passes from Huard in 1994 at Puyallup, except maybe
Looker. He ran a modest 4.7 40 then and was on the skinny side,
only 160 pounds. Oops, 159.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember being on the scale, and coach (Mike) Huard was
there,'' Looker said. ``It said 159. I begged him to write down
160. `Please, coach, it looks so much better.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He wrote down 159.''
</P>
<P>
   The receiver who caught Arizona State off-guard wasn't recruited
by the Pac-10, or even the Big Sky. Washington, limited by Pac-10
sanctions, had one scholarship earmarked for a receiver, and it
went to Gerald Harris.
</P>
<P>
   So Looker's recruitment was a death struggle between Central
Washington, Pacific Lutheran and Western Washington. He accepted a
partial basketball scholarship from Western.
</P>
<P>
   He played point guard for Brad Jackson's team, and he and the
coach had a great relationship. Looker reminded Jackson of himself
20 years ago, when Jackson was a fiery guard at Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day two years ago, Looker and Huard happened to be home
in Puyallup on a weekend. Huard, who had stayed in touch, gave him
a call. It was past 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Huard wanted to go down to the Puyallup High gym, where, Looker
says, ``He has a key.''
</P>
<P>
   The two began throwing a football, connecting once more.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' Huard said, ``you still have what it takes to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Looker began getting excited. He thought about a reunion at
Washington with Huard, a chance to play college football on the
rebound. He and Jackson had long talks that were more constructive
than prickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see it as a situation at all where he was letting us
down,'' Jackson says. ``I've enjoyed coaching almost all the guys
I've had, but every now and then, an athlete comes through that you
really connect with. We had not only a good professional
relationship but a good personal relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was torn.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington welcomed him, but with a disclaimer. He would be
walking on without a scholarship, living the hard life on the scout
team. There was nothing to suggest to the Huskies they had Antonio
Freeman on the hook.
</P>
<P>
   Says Jackson, ``I think a lot of people probably counseled Dane:
`You're crazy.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Looker loves it when somebody says he can't. He made the
transfer, arriving last fall, weighing close to 180. He made a
positive impression on the top Husky defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was anxious every day to prove I could go out there and play
against them,'' Looker says.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always liked to compete,'' says his dad, Dan. ``He'd much
rather have the opportunity to be the hero than not get the
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was still Brock's Boy. Indeed, there are three Looker
boys who caught passes at Puyallup from three different Huards.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the Looker kids, there was a lot of personal pride,''
says Mike Huard. ``They never backed down from any situation _
maybe even sometimes when they should have.''
</P>
<P>
   Looker, now 6-foot-1 and 190 pounds, certified his toughness
after a horrific hit in Washington's first fall scrimmage from
safeties Brendan Jones and Nigel Burton. A facemask sandwiched
Looker's hand against the ball, and when everybody got up, the hand
was a mess, lacerated in 11 places and swollen to twice its size.
</P>
<P>
   The longest 150 yards of his life were spent walking up the
tunnel to the trainer's room. Everybody was sure the hand was
broken, including Looker.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't. In what might have been the biggest stroke of fortune
this year for the Huskies, Looker had only broken blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Recalls Linehan, ``You knew you were dealing with one of the
toughest kids on our team when he came back (two days later), with
a lineman's glove on it, and he was reaching for the ball with his
hands, and catching it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson remembers that sort of fire in Looker when Western would
get ready to play Central Washington, clenching his fists, telling
the coach how great this was.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday, it's not Central, it's Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I hear, they're real susceptible to the pass,''
Looker said, recalling how Troy Edwards of Louisiana Tech ran up
record numbers against the Huskers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great athlete. As a receiving corps, we can do the same
thing, go out there and catch all kinds of balls. That's what we've
got to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Looker was irked to be held out of the BYU game, especially as
the Huskies struggled. The other side of him realizes the prudence
of having him ready for Nebraska and Arizona. He can see the big
picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way it's worked out has been incredible,'' he said. ``If
it ended tomorrow, it'd be more than I expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Looker wouldn't necessarily recommend the route he has taken.
Still, he says, ``You've got to chase your dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   The chase continues in Lincoln, having wound through Seattle and
Tempe, by way of Bellingham.

FRESHMAN GETS NOD AT LINEBACKER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If Cal State Northridge had a scholarship to
offer, freshman linebacker Lewis Blanton would get it. The coaching
staff thinks that much of him.
</P>
<P>
   However, none are available this year, so Blanton will wait
until 1999 for one. In the meantime, he expects to work his way
into this week's starting lineup as the Matadors (1-1) host
defending Big Sky champ Eastern Washington (0-2) at 3:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blanton gives us a very good athlete at the Mike (middle)
linebacker spot,'' CSUN coach Ron Ponciano said. ``He was a player
we got lucky with because he wanted to stay close to home.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if linebacker Quinton Reed gets the start, Blanton, who is
sixth on the team with 10 tackles, will see his playing time
extended markedly because of the loss of starter Cos Abercrombie
with a broken jaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even see myself playing up to Cos' level now, but
hopefully one day I'll get there,'' said Blanton, a Murphy High
graduate. ``He's like my mentor and he always calls me his prodigy.
I look up to him.''
</P>
<P>
   __ The word on Brady: Eastern Washington coach Mike Kramer said
he's received calls from numerous Big Sky teams about the exploits
of CSUN quarterback Marcus Brady.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to know how good he is because we've now seen him on
film,'' Kramer said.
</P>
<P>
   Brady pushed himself into the Big Sky limelight by going 20 of
26 for 236 yards and three touchdowns last week against Northern
Arizona, and he did so by demonstrating great scrambling ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's nasty on turf because he can really cut, but we haven't
seen him on grass,'' said Kramer, pointing out North Campus Stadium
has real grass. ``We've been trying to catch chickens, and we took
our most slippery athlete (defensive back Mario Sweet) and put him
in the backfield.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Date in Dallas?: It's a complex ordeal trying to fit a team
into one open date on the schedule, but the latest talks have moved
away from Wisconsin and toward Southern Methodist as CSUN tries to
secure a substantial guarantee to play against a Division I-A
opponent next year.
</P>
<P>
   However, instead of it being an early-September, premiere game
for SMU, not to mention a litmus test for CSUN, the game might be
played in November.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides have discussed it and agreeing on a guarantee
price could be the last obstacle. CSUN's other two nonconference
games next season are set to be at Southern Utah and home against
Southwest Missouri State, both return games from this season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Short yardage: Before the season the CSUN coaching staff held
its breath hoping that senior cornerback Steve Forte would be
eligible because the Matadors lacked depth there. But after Mel
Miller and Chazz Moore transferred in, Forte fell back on the
two-deep and didn't play the first two games. So Forte was moved to
safety Wednesday.... Ponciano said safety Hassan Abdul-Malik's
shoulder is better and he will play against Eastern Washington....
CSUN running back Melvin Blue and Eastern Washington
cornerback/return specialist Bashir Livingston played together at
Utah State last season.

YANKEES TIE CLUB RECORD FOR VICTORIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Miller Huggins, manager of the 1927 Yankees, weighed
140 pounds, small enough for Babe Ruth to dangle him from a moving
train. Huggins had been an average player, an average hitter who
relied on his speed. Joe Torre, manager of the 1998 Yankees, is
thickly built, a former Gold Glove catcher and winner of a most
valuable player award in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   The only apparent similarity between Huggins and Torre is that
both managers led their respective teams to 110 victories, a club
record. The Yankees reached that mark on Wednesday night, beating
the Cleveland Indians, 8-4, at Yankee Stadium with Shane Spencer
banging three hits, including his third home run in two days. Chad
Curtis also slugged a three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are 110-48, the most victories by a team since
baseball switched to a 162-game schedule in 1961. The '27 Yankees
won 110 games in a 154-game season. With one more victory, the
Yankees will tie the American League record of 111, set by the 1954
Indians, in a 154-game season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very special,'' Torre said. ``The '27 Yankees are the
standard all Yankee teams are compared to.''
</P>
<P>
   Questioned repeatedly about how he manages a team with one of
the best records in the 20th century, Torre responds with a
well-practiced line. ``I just stay out of the way,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Torre is telling the truth, in a sense. Derek Jeter hits and
Orlando Hernandez pitches; Torre stays out of the way. But he is
always prepared to get involved, when necessary. Torre is like a
professor overseeing an honors course _ those charged to him are
all talented and will generally thrive. But if they need a nudge, a
compliment, someone to talk to, someone to listen, Torre makes
himself available.
</P>
<P>
   While pitching erratically in May, David Cone passed Torre in
the dugout and said, ``Don't give up on me.'' The next day, Torre
walked past Cone in the clubhouse and said, ``You're just
frustrated because you know how good you're supposed to be.'' Cone
considered this, and Torre's words resonated perfectly in his
psyche.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Andy Pettitte pitched on Monday, with speculation
rampant that Pettitte might not start in the playoffs, Torre
stopped by the pitcher's locker and said: ``Just relax. Just go out
and pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   They were the words, Pettitte said the next day, that he needed
to hear _ at exactly the right time.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill boils with helmet-throwing intensity, and sometimes
Torre will say something light-hearted, something to ease his mood.
When David Wells pitched poorly and then complained in a
closed-door meeting with the manager that Torre did not demonstrate
faith in the pitcher, Torre began muting his slight criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   Torre doesn't call many meetings, either, but when he does, Cone
said, nothing is said unnecessarily, the tone is perfect.
</P>
<P>
   When Torre called a team meeting on April 7, when the Yankees
were 1-4, he asked Cone and O'Neill and others to speak. ``If
you've got anything to say, say it now,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   He called a meeting in August, after the Yankees had committed a
series of base-running mistakes. Torre was livid after the Yankees
drifted through a 7-0 loss to Tampa Bay last week and immediately
challenged their effort.
</P>
<P>
   But he trusts the players, with the expectation that they play
hard, concentrate and respect each other. If they do not, they will
get the Stare.
</P>
<P>
   Homer Bush, a rookie, got the Stare last week. He was on second
base when a ball was driven to deep center and Bush thought it
would be a home run, so he slowed slightly nearing third. But the
ball bounced off the top of the wall, a double. Bush knew Torre had
seen him slow down and would not be pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I had to walk by him in the dugout,'' Bush said. ``It was
trying to sneak into the house, by your mother, after you've stayed
out too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Raines, at 39 the oldest Yankee player, got the Stare last
week in Florida. It was late in the game, the Yankees were getting
wiped out, and Raines was joking in the dugout. He looked up into
the Stare. ``I sat on the bench the rest of the game and I didn't
say another word,'' Raines said.
</P>
<P>
   Torre doesn't stare often. Rather, he sits and watches,
outwardly calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look down there at the end of close games,'' Bush said,
``and I'm thinking, `Doesn't this guy see those cats are about
ready to come back?' But he looks so relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre is staying out of the way. &QL;

ST. LOUIS _ Back when, the hitter was ahead of the pitcher. Way
ahead. As college prospects, there was no comparison between USC
Trojans Randy Johnson and Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark was already hitting monster home runs when I got to
USC,'' Johnson recalls. ``As a sophomore, you sort of knew what he
was going to accomplish in his career. Me? I could throw real hard,
but about every third pitch hit the backstop on the fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was more physically mature, too. I was 6-10 and about 180
pounds, all arms and legs.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson weighs in at 230 these days, but with all due respect,
he still appears to be far more arms and legs than torso. The
obvious difference is his ability to pitch, which, coupled with his
formidable throwing, can reduce the best batters to a whimpering,
quivering state.
</P>
<P>
   He's human, though. He will make the occasional mistake. His
first pitch Wednesday night, for example. Pat Kelly, who came to
the plate with 62 fewer home runs than McGwire, parked it in the
left-field bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   Uppity runt.
</P>
<P>
   But all Kelly succeeded in doing was to harden Johnson's
resolve. Despite lacking his best stuff, or even decent stuff a
good bit of the time, the Big Unit had enough stuff to put away the
Cardinals. His velocity increased as the cool fall evening wore on,
and while his control never improved appreciably, his subsequent
135 pitches over seven innings yielded nary a run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy was either very tenacious,'' manager Larry Dierker said,
``or very lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of both, actually. And the Astros did give him six early
runs with which to play. Johnson won't come up short too many times
with such gracious support.
</P>
<P>
   Although he set down the former fellow Trojan horse McGwire only
once in four plate appearances (two walks, one single, one
stratospheric fly ball to Moises Alou on the warning track in
left), he wriggled free from several scary jams and thus did his
part to provide the Astros with a historic 100th victory. It took
them 37 seasons to reach the century mark, but, ah, who's counting?
</P>
<P>
   As for Johnson, he finishes the regular season 10-1 in an Astros
uniform, which fits his Giacometti-sculpted body like he was born
to wear it. But it's his remaining starts _ you hope there are at
least five _ that will be the ones for which he was reeled in only
moments before the trading deadline passed the night of July 31.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros have been to the playoffs. They've just never gone
anywhere, once there. It's hoped _ assumed, even _ that Johnson's
supporting cast is potent enough for him to go forth and contribute
to yet more important history-making.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker fretted over his team's lethargy of late during his
postgame comments, but he expects a ``renewed intensity and
aggressiveness'' when the second season kicks off Tuesday or
Wednesday. In the interim, he will ``manage to win'' against the
Cubs on the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Should Sammy Sosa prevail in the again-knotted home-run derby,
it won't be because the Astros gave it to him. If the Cubs somehow
survive to win the wild-card race, they'll have earned it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We owe that much to the game,'' Dierker said. ``And there's no
downside to our trying as hard as we can. I'll give a few of our
regulars a day off _ but not all at once. We need to take momentum
into the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago series might have been beyond huge if the Astros
hadn't, against impossible odds, pulled off the Johnson trade.
Ironically, it was exactly the same time a year earlier when the
Cardinals had acquired McGwire in an effort to put them over the
top, where the Astros stand instead today.
</P>
<P>
   For all his homeric feats, St. Louis is twice a non-factor
also-ran with Big Mac. In The Show, good pitching generally beats
good hitting. There's simply so much more of the latter than the
former.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference,'' Dierker said, ``is almost always in the
pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, favored by many to reclaim the Central Division
title the Astros wrested away in 1997, lost Andy Benes during the
offseason and found themselves buried early when they were without
Matt Morris, Donovan Osborne and Alan Benes.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros would themselves have to tell Darryl Kile goodbye,
then send Chris Holt and Ramon Garcia to the DL as well, a
potentially troublesome scenario. But, unlike St. Louis, they
rustled up a full complement of suitable replacements.
</P>
<P>
   When Johnson _ let's call him Mr. Coup de Grace _ joined them,
the magic-number countdown effectively began. With a 1.28 ERA, 116
strikeouts in 84 innings and four home shutouts in a row, he hardly
could have contributed more than he did. Except, OK, to get that
11th ``W'' in his other start at Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   His extreme early-season unhappiness in Seattle must feel like
it was part of a different lifetime, one closer in proximity
perhaps to his Trojan period even than the fun-filled here and now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long road,'' Johnson said. ``I've taken a lot of
lumps, but I'm very proud of where I'm at. As for tonight, I'm not
too satisfied with how I pitched, but I got an important win. I've
never played for a ballclub that won 100 games.''
</P>
<P>
   And we had never had one, either. A fine fit, this.

RED SOX JUST ABOUT THERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Strip away the possible playoff permutations and
coin-flip ramifications, Jim Corsi said.
</P>
<P>
   Set aside yet another record performance by closer Tom Gordon,
who saved his 41st straight game, and yet another big night for
shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, who wiped out a dubious error in the
top of the third with a three-run home run in the bottom of the
inning, then doubled and scored the deciding run two innings later.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, this is what Wednesday night's 5-4 win over the
expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays in the 158th game of the 1998 season
means to the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we don't have to look at scoreboards anymore,'' Corsi
said after the Sox ensured that their season will last beyond
Sunday by clinching at least a tie for the American League
wild-card playoff spot. ``Only our games matter now. We're in
charge of our own destiny. I'd rather look at our scoreboard than
somebody else's, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, when Pedro Martinez takes the mound against the
Baltimore Orioles, attention on Yawkey Way will no longer be
divided between the action on the field and the large white numbers
hung on the out-of-town scoreboard by Chris Elias, the kid inside
the Green Monster.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the Toronto Blue Jays, the team that remained in
desperate pursuit of the Sox Wednesday night with their fourth
straight win, a 6-3 decision over the Orioles, will not be in
action Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   And with the magic number for clinching a playoff spot down to
one, the Red Sox no longer have to concern themselves with Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Win once in their last four games and they return to the
playoffs for the first time since 1995, regardless of what the Blue
Jays do. A Toronto loss, of course, in its last three games would
accomplish the same goal. Lose all four while the Jays sweep three
from the Tigers in Toronto and there will be a one-game playoff in
SkyDome Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will clinch tomorrow,'' said DH Midre Cummings,
eavesdropping on Corsi's discourse. ``We will win.''
</P>
<P>
   While his manner conveyed as much confidence as Cummings's
declaration, Martinez was offering no such guarantees. But he also
assured his interrogators that he would have no trouble sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about talking, it's about doing,'' Martinez said.
``It could be a lot of fun tomorrow, but you can't drink a lot of
champagne because there will be another game the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big game? I have goals that are a lot higher. I dream of the
World Series, which is what this game is all about. This is just
one game to get us to the playoffs. I'll go pitch, but if I don't
do it, I have so much confidence in this team, I know somebody will
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   By 7:28 p.m., when Elias put a ``2'' next to ``Tor'' and a ``0''
next to ``Bal,'' the crowd of 23,240 had an inkling there would be
no party in the Fens Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   By 7:51, when a ``5'' was placed next to ``Tor'' and a ``1''
next to ``Bal,'' it was apparent that the Red Sox would be on their
own.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, charged with his 25th error because he refused to
eat Mike Kelly's grounder into the hole and bounced his throw past
first baseman Mo Vaughn, made amends for the three-run uprising
that ensued by following Vaughn's RBI single in the bottom of the
third with his 33d home run, a screen shot into a stiff wind.
</P>
<P>
   With one swing, Garciaparra produced as many RBIs as he had in
his last 20 games. He also presented a 4-3 lead to Steve Avery, who
was credited with his 10th win by going five innings. The
lefthander weathered Wade Boggs's two-run triple and Fred McGriff's
RBI single after Garciaparra's alleged misplay in the third. He
struck out Bobby Smith and McGriff to end his stint before yielding
to Derek Lowe, who pitched a scoreless sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon entered in the eighth, when an infield hit by Smith, an
infield out, and a single to center by Bubba Trammell against Corsi
made it 5-4. Trammell was thrown out stealing by catcher Scott
Hatteberg, an out that increased in magnitude when Aaron Ledesma
reached on an infield hit.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Corsi made his exit and Gordon struck out pinch
hitter Paul Sorrento to end the inning. He then struck out the
first two batters he faced in the ninth, Miguel Cairo and Mike
DiFelice, before Quinton McCracken singled and took second on a
wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   But Boggs, with boos ringing in ears that were Bostonized long
ago, grounded out to Vaughn at first to end it, giving the Sox
three wins in the four-game set against their expansion cousins,
whose arrival in these environs could not have been more
expeditious.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who already holds the record for most consecutive saves
in one season, now has 41 straight, which ties the record for most
consecutive saves shared by Rod Beck (over three years) and Trevor
Hoffman (over two).
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he expects to feel Thursday night should he save the
clincher, Gordon remained in low-key mode.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't thought about it,'' he said. ``I've never been in a
playoffs, never been in that situation. I wouldn't know what to
think.''
</P>
<P>
   He should know soon enough.

FISH DAY COMING

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Saturday marks not only California's biannual Free
Fishing Day, when an angling license _ normally a $27.55 charge per
year _ is not required to target state waters, but national and
state Hunting and Fishing Day.
</P>
<P>
   Local anglers can celebrate by taking part in a family fishing
derby and festival slated from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. at El Dorado Park
Lake, 7550 E. Spring St. in Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   More than 4,000 half-pound channel catfish will be planted by
the Department of Fish and Game, and volunteers will man
learn-to-fish stations and offer tips on technique and lessons in
fish biology. Loaners rods and reels are available; personal ID is
required. Complimentary bait, hooks and sinkers are also to be
provided.
</P>
<P>
   The festival will include nature exhibits, animal displays,
train rides and pedal boats.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, call (562) 570-1771 or (562) 590-4835. For
a list of additional lakes and streams that will be planted prior
to Free Fishing Day, phone the DFG's fish-stocking report, (562)
590-5020.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gov. Pete Wilson on Sept. 10 proclaimed Sept. 26
Hunting and Fishing Day to honor the contributions hunters and
anglers have made to the conservation of habitat and species
through the purchase of licenses and special taxes on equipment
they use. The fourth Saturday in September has been recognized as
National Hunting and Fishing Day since then-president Richard Nixon
designated it as such in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, one NHFD event (albeit a day late) is planned:
</P>
<P>
   __ The Santa Clarita Valley chapter of Quail Unlimited and
Claybuster Trap Club will host a fun shoot from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Sunday at the Oak Tree Gun Club, 23121 N. Coltrane Ave. in Newhall.
</P>
<P>
   Cost is $32 and includes a 100-target format, trophies for top
shooters and a barbecue lunch. Information: (805) 297-0876, ext. 3,
or (805) 259-7441.

HIKE INTO HISTORY AT SANTA SUSANA PASS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT PURDUE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There's not much ``new'' about California's newest
state park, which is exactly what makes it one of the San Fernando
Valley's hidden treasures. In fact, Santa Susana Pass State
Historic Park in Chatsworth is a unique window into Southern
California's past _ thousands of years worth.
</P>
<P>
   Designated by the state in January, its 670 acres of sandstone
ramparts, dense chaparral and riparian woodlands have long been
crisscrossed by wildlife, American Indians and early Californians
who traveled a famed stagecoach route through the area as late as
100 years ago. The footsteps of these diverse visitors are easy to
explore on the web of unsigned trails that lace the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much history and it's not just the (park's
signature) Stagecoach Trail, which was one of the main connectors
between San Francisco and L.A.,'' said Judy Garris, an avid hiker
and member of the Santa Susana Mountains Park Association. ``The
area was also a gathering place for three Native American tribes
and there's even a burial ground within the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been bobcat sightings and a mountain lion was
spotted not too long ago. It's the edge of a main wildlife corridor
and there are some very pristine areas there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the lobbying efforts of local conservationists that
led to state park status, hikers can enjoy this suburban slice of
wilderness. But until resources are found to maintain and mark
trails, a morning walk along the Stagecoach Trail _ a 2{-mile
round-trip _ and its optional 12/3-mile loop might prove a bit
confusing.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a closer look at the course:
</P>
<P>
   Begin the journey at the entrance to the park on the signed
Stagecoach Equestrian Trail. Follow this path around the edge of
the park for a quarter-mile, scanning for a gravel trail on the
left between a sign that reads ``CAUTION MOUNTAIN LIONS'' and a
water tank. Ascend the gravel path and turn right onto a paved road
for 100 yards, then turn left onto a fire road.
</P>
<P>
   Begin climbing steadily, keeping an eye out on the left for
large formations of blood-red sandstone resembling downtown
Bedrock. Turn right at the first fork onto a footpath, then turn
right again after another 100 feet, avoiding a section of deeply
eroded trail. Walking west-northwest on this wide, level road,
notice the gargantuan rocky ridge to the south, floating like a
sandstone battleship on a sea of chaparral.
</P>
<P>
   The park's crags are actually the Simi Hills; the Santa Susana
Mountains for which the park is named are located to the northeast.
Topping out at about 1,700 feet, the Simi Hills are geologic
youngsters, dating back about 5 million years.
</P>
<P>
   From this viewpoint, it's 200 yards to the junction with the
Devil's Slide, leading up to the left. Huffing up the huge blocks
of sandstone bedrock, it's easy to imagine coach drivers cursing
this route, which seems more like Satan's StairMaster.
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century, stagecoaches were lowered by hand here,
with passengers paying for first class if they rode, a cheaper fare
if they walked down and even less if they actually helped lower the
coach. An 800-foot climb leads to a sign commemorating the stage
road, which states the route was used from 1859 to 1890. By 1895,
an easier road was blazed over Santa Susana Pass, which today is
traversed by the Simi Valley-San Fernando Valley Freeway (Highway
118). Gaze south and east for head-spinning views of the
smog-cloaked Valley, indicating how far we've come _ unfortunately
(cough) _ in the last century.
</P>
<P>
   The road climbs another 600 feet, leveling off at a three-way
junction about 1\ miles from the trailhead. The main route _ the
``stick'' on the lollipop-shaped trail _ ends here. Turn around and
head back. Or continue straight toward a distant stand of dark
eucalyptus trees on the optional 12/3-mile loop _ the ``sucker'' of
the lollipop _ around the western corner of the park.
</P>
<P>
   Veer left at the next fork and spot the trees on the other side
of a gate. Crawl through, hike out to Lilac Lane, turn right and
walk 100 feet to a kiosk marked ``Historical Stagecoach
Trailhead.''
</P>
<P>
   The trail ascends a hill to the left, heading northwest, then
meanders through brushy swales. After a half-mile it abruptly ends
on the blacktop of Santa Susana Pass Road. Turn right, walk 200
yards and turn right again at a gated fire road. Walk past the
trash and graffiti-scarred rocks and ascend southeast along the
narrowing path carved into the hillside. Flora fans should keep an
eye peeled for the yellow flowers of the threatened Santa Susana
tarweed that bloom July through October and the rare maroon monkey
flower (March through July). After nearly a half-mile the trail
reaches a gentle hilltop and descends gradually. Look for a faint
trail on the right and follow it due south.
</P>
<P>
   This is where things get nasty. Thick chaparral clings at
clothing and scratches exposed skin as the trail loses altitude.
Step lively over a small gully and scramble around a laurel sumac
and scrub oak, then climb through a wall of coastal sage and
chamise as the pencil-thin path reaches another ridgeline. The
trail flattens out, then climbs to the crest of a knoll under a set
of power lines. The well-earned payoff is a stunning 360-degree
look at the Valley and the Simi Hills.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a breather, light out on a path going right and
after 500 feet take a left near an old wooden post. This fork soon
winds back to the top of Devil's Slide; retrace your steps down to
the trailhead.

GARCIAPARRA TIGHT-LIPPED ABOUT LATEST HEROICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ How exhilarating it must feel to hit for power in the
clutch, to erase a deficit and silence naysayers with one smooth
stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra is not the sort who will share such a
sentiment. It's not his way. That leaves one to only imagine what
it must have been like for the Red Sox shortstop to make up for a
third-inning throwing error _ which led to three unearned runs _
with a three-run home run in the bottom of the inning that
obliterated a 3-1 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   By feasting on Tampa Bay righthander Bryan Rekar's 3-1 fastball,
Garciaparra powered the Red Sox to a 5-4 victory Wednesday night at
Fenway Park that clinched at least a tie for the American League
wild-card playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   A candidate for the AL Most Valuable Player Award, Garciaparra
entered with just just three RBIs in 20 games since he hit a
game-winning grand slam against the Mariners Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough one (the error), and I was just trying to make
the play whenever I can. Then I just went out and tried to score
some runs,'' said Garciaparra, whose 33d home run was estimated at
380 feet and who is now batting .320 with runners in scoring
position. ``I was just patient. I managed to get a ball I could hit
and it just went out.''
</P>
<P>
   That's all the drama you'll get from a player who doesn't talk
much about his feats or their impact. Asked what a win Thursday
night would mean to him personally, Garciaparra responded, ``We
have to win and I will find out tomorrow. I just want to win to get
into the playoffs, and we'll go from there.''
</P>
<P>
   He was more expansive on other subjects. He praised winning
pitcher Steve Avery's effort. When asked about the team's ability
to come back, he said, ``We've done that all year. And it's nice.
We go out there and we do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too many people can talk about us anymore. We go out there
and we win. We're in a position right now (to clinch). We went out
there and proved it to everybody, and that's good.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for May, when he separated his right shoulder and had
eight RBIs in just 10 games, Garciaparra had knocked in at least 19
runs in every month until this one. But Wednesday night he regained
his clutch status, going 2 for 4; in the fifth inning, he doubled
down the left-field line and scored the decisive run on a single by
Troy O'Leary.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra said he didn't worry about the error _ on a hard
shot by Mike Kelly _ and he wasn't trying to make up for it at the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``What am I going to do?'' he said. ``I can either hold on to it
or I can throw it and try to make the play regardless and see what
happens. I'm going to take my chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had stuff like that happen all year. You go out there and
make the play and you go out there and force it. But if you hold on
to the ball, you never know what's going to happen. I'm just glad I
caught it.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Red Sox close in on the wild-card berth, it's apparent
Garciaparra won't deviate from the norm. That meant he didn't check
the score of Wednesday night's game between Baltimore and Toronto,
a Blue Jays victory that delayed a Red Sox clinch for at least a
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't looked all year,'' said Garciaparra. ``Why should we
look now? All we should look at is ourselves. That's all we need to
concern ourselves with. That's the way it's been until now.''

MARTINEZ CAN APPLY FINAL TOUCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ Pedro Martinez saw the reporter approaching, but he
wasn't interested in obliging.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox' 5-4 win over the Tampa Devils Rays Wednesday night,
coupled with the Blue Jays' 6-3 triumph over Baltimore, left Boston
one game away from clinching the American League wild-card playoff
berth.
</P>
<P>
   That means Martinez can do the honors Thursday night against
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't want to discuss it. ``It's too close to the
game,'' he said. ``I'm not going to talk about the game before I
pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jimy Williams understands. So does pitching coach Joe
Kerrigan. Their ace righthander wants to concentrate fully on this
start. He wants to make sure nothing gets by him. Most important,
he wants to shake off the September doldrums _ an 0-3 record in his
last four starts _ that have cost him a shot at his first 20-win
season and, in all likelihood, a chance to become the first pitcher
to win the Cy Young Award in each league in consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez has faced the Orioles once, dropping a 3-2 decision
July 10 in Baltimore in which he went eight innings, allowing five
hits with one walk and five strikeouts. He fell victim to his major
nemesis of 1998, surrendering homers to Mike Bordick and Eric
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Of more concern is the recent winless stretch, during which
Martinez has allowed 11 runs, all earned, in 21 1/3 innings against
the Blue Jays, Yankees, and White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had his stuff; he's been throwing well,'' Williams
said. ``He's had his good pitches against tough clubs. He's pitched
better than his numbers. He's pitched well. His overall numbers
speak for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan also believes no tinkering is necessary. He feels
Martinez's overall numbers _ an 18-7 record, 2.77 ERA, and 245
strikeouts _ are more relevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro's thrown the ball well the last three games,'' said
Kerrigan. ``We just haven't had enough runs for him, just seven
runs in those games.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Martinez probably won't wind up with a bookend for
the 1997 National League Cy Young Award he won when he went 17-8
with a 1.90 ERA and 305 strikeouts for Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been pitching to the level I can, even though I've
been doing an acceptable job,'' Martinez said of his last four
games. ``The runs haven't been enough to win games. And then there
have been the pitchers I've gone against _ David Cone and Orlando
Hernandez of the Yankees, Woody Williams of the Blue Jays, and John
Snyder of the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't do anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night he can.

 HALL OF FAME-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When Mary Carew Armstrong rose Wednesday night to
accept the Trailblazer Award from the New England Women's Fund, the
crowd of 800 rose with her. For many, it was undoubtedly the first
time they'd heard of her, but what they heard _ 84 years old,
Olympic gold medalist as anchor of the 4x100-meter relay at the
1932 Olympics, longtime fitness advocate _ they loved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We created it for her,'' said Ann Sanders, executive director
of the fund, which sponsored the Women's Sports Awards reception at
the Roxy. As the 3,000 ballots for the organization's new New
England Women's Sports Hall of Fame were being counted, an
unfamiliar name kept popping up as a write-in candidate for track
and field. ``I said, `I've got to find out more about this
woman.'''
</P>
<P>
   So Wednesday night the Medford native, who has long been out of
the spotlight, shared the limelight with Olympic swimming gold
medalist Donna de Varona (Pioneer Award), broadcaster Robin Roberts
(Media Award), and the gold-medal Olympic women's ice hockey team
(New England Today Award).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so old, nobody remembers anymore,'' Armstrong said
afterward, her bright smile competing with the Olympic medal she
wore around her neck. ``I'm delighted.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the special awards, 11 women became the first
class of inductees into the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Hall will consist of photos and biographies
displayed at the Square One Mall in Saugus, with hopes to expand
the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   The inductees _ all with ties to New England _ included:
</P>
<P>
   --Jane Blalock (golf): Won 29 LPGA tournaments during a 17-year
career; first woman golfer to earn more than $100,000 four years in
a row.
</P>
<P>
   --Maddie English and Mary Pratt (baseball): Both played in the
All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, English as third
baseman for the Racine Belles and Pratt as a pitcher for the
Rockford Peaches.
</P>
<P>
   --Tenley Albright (figure skating): Her gold medal at the 1956
Olympics was the first by an American woman in skating.
</P>
<P>
   --Rebecca Lobo (basketball): Led the University of Connecticut
to a 35-0 season in 1995 before becoming a 1996 Olympian and member
of the New York Liberty in the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   --Jenny Thompson (swimming): Five-time Olympic gold medalist in
relays at the 1992 and 1996 Games.
</P>
<P>
   --Joan Benoit Samuelson (track and field): Won the Olympic gold
medal in the marathon in 1984, the first time women were allowed to
compete at the distance in the Games.
</P>
<P>
   --Diana Golden Brosnihan (skiing): Gold medalist in the giant
slalom for disabled skiers at the 1988 Olympics; named Female Skier
of the Year by the US Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   --Kristine Lilly (soccer): 1996 Olympic gold medalist; has
played in more international matches than any other man or woman.
</P>
<P>
   --Barb Marois (field hockey): Two-time Olympian who played
internationally for a decade; captain of the 1996 Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   --Ernestine Bayer (rowing): Established first women's rowing
organization in the country back in the late 1930s after winning
over her husband, who insisted that women couldn't row.
</P>
<P>
   Bayer Wednesday night recounted that a friend of her husband's
told him that if he permitted her to row, she would get
tuberculosis and die.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived,'' said Bayer, now 89.

By RICH MARTIN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Martin Dugard's description of eco-challenge races
in ``Surviving the Toughest Race on Earth'' (Ragged Mountain
Press,$19.95) proves in its 200 pages that the bar in such
``extreme'' competitions has been raised. Now what's next?
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who wonders how anything could be more difficult than a
triathlon _ or a double triathlon, for that matter _ should read
Dugard's riveting account.
</P>
<P>
   He traces the evolution of such races, from marathons to the
Badwater 146, which wends its way through Death Valley in the
summer heat, to the Raid Gauloises, a notorious eight- to 12-day
contest over grueling terrain. His participation makes the reader
feel the pain of kayaking, rock climbing, canoeing, skydiving,
hiking and even spelunking through 200 to 300 miles of some of the
world's most inhospitable places _ dusty deserts, steamy jungles
and forbidding mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Raid Gauloises is not only an almost inhuman test of endurance.
It is, more than anything, a test of determination, teamwork and
map-reading. All five members of each team must finish for the team
to remain in contention. What's more, each team must pass
checkpoints and negotiate terrain, which means that the most studly
team will lose if members can't avoid getting lost _ an easy fate
to suffer because the Raid crosses vast wilderness that is often
poorly charted. And, as Dugard found out, a team with poor personal
chemistry will not stick together.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange County author, who left a marketing-executive post to
achieve his lifelong goal of becoming a freelance journalist, first
covers the Raid and then, seduced by the challenge, takes part in
two events. He is forced to quit one event in Patagonia, Argentina,
after tearing a knee ligament but finishes a later one in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Dugard does a fine job showing what it's like to be in the
event: the exhaustion, injury, stress, near-madness. And more.
Being lost and having to retrace steps when you're panting. Heat of
120 degrees. Walking for 24 hours straight. Sleep deprivation.
Contending with crocodiles, dirty water, blisters upon blisters
upon blisters.
</P>
<P>
   Some competitors hallucinate. Many are forced to choose between
continuing _ even risking death _ and quitting and feeling shame
and a sense of failure as tormenting as any of the pains felt in
the events.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Dugard writes, the event was a hallowed, almost
mystical experience: ``The Raid is about looking into your soul,
something modern man finds uncomfortable. We are distracted
constantly by telephones and television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spiritual serenity I have never witnessed in competitions
ever, anywhere.'' Our rating: three and a half stars. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   City dwellers want it both ways _ the rewards of country living
in the middle of a metropolis. It's hard to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most practical ways of enjoying nature in the
``concrete jungle'' is to lure birds to our homes, and Donald and
Lillian Stokes have done just this in ``Bird Gardening Book: The
Complete Guide to Creating a Bird-Friendly Habitat in Your
Backyard'' (Little, Brown and Co.; $12.95). In a succinct 94 pages,
the Stokeses, hosts of a television series on birding, reveal their
secrets of drawing 140 species of birds to their property in the
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The process involves more than just birdhouses, birdbaths and
bird feeders. It also helps to have tall grass shrubs, lawns,
berries, flowers; the book lists which birds to attract to each
type of flora.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its brevity, ``Bird Gardening Book'' _ one of many with
similar titles _ is an ideal guide for city slickers sick of seeing
only pigeons and crows. Our rating: two and a half stars &QL;
</P>
<P>
   National parks are not a big secret. They're easy to reach,
beautiful ... and often as crowded as L.A. freeways during rush
hour. Who needs a SigAlert when we're on vacation from such
stresses?
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't have to be that way. ``Beyond the National Parks: A
Recreation Guide to Public Lands in the West'' (Smithsonian
Institution Press, $19.95), edited by Mary E. Tisdale and Bibi
Booth, shows many of the best sites of the lesser-known Bureau of
Land Management.
</P>
<P>
   BLM employees and members of other participating outdoor and
conservation organizations list their favorite places, with the
location, description, directions and visitor activities (even dog
mushing) all listed. Nice stretches of California desert and
coastline are included. Also exhaustively detailed in the 394 pages
are any necessary permits and fees, accessibility and nearby
camping, lodging and food supplies. The book boasts gorgeous
photos, too.
</P>
<P>
   It's a suitable point of departure to reach unknown, uncrowded
areas. Our rating: three stars.

OAKLAND ANSWERS MARINER COMEBACK; RANGERS UP NEXT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Cases of champagne will be delivered to the Kingdome
sometime today, but the shipment is headed for the visitors'
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners will try to delay what appears inevitable: a
division-clinching party for the Texas Rangers, who open a
season-ending, four-game series here Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   On the one-year anniversary of their second American League West
Division title, the M's failed to secure a third-place finish,
dropping an 8-3 decision to the Oakland Athletics Wednesday night
before 21,182 fans.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time in Anaheim, Calif., the Rangers lowered their
magic number to two with a series-sweeping victory against the
Angels. Any combination of two Texas wins or Anaheim losses settles
the only undecided division race in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a year makes.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly 365 days ago Wednesday, Heathcliff Slocumb recorded the
final out in the Mariners' 4-3 victory over the Angels at the
Kingdome, giving the M's a week to prepare for the AL Division
Series, which they lost to Baltimore in four games. Wednesday
night, the right-hander surrendered the fall-behind run in the
eighth inning as the A's averted a three-game sweep and kept their
hopes alive for finishing higher than the M's.
</P>
<P>
   Any chance of a Mariner comeback Wednesday was squashed in the
ninth when three Seattle relievers _ Bobby Ayala, Steve Gajkowski
and Greg McCarthy _ combined for four walks, two hit batters and a
wild pitch to fuel a four-run Athletic uprising without benefit of
a basehit.
</P>
<P>
   Slocumb absorbed the loss, but any of the relievers were
deserving.
</P>
<P>
   Starter Ken Cloude worked the first 61/3 innings and entered the
seventh with a 3-2 lead, compliments of a two-run Mariner sixth
inning off Oakland starter Mike Oquist.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Rodriguez tied the game with his 42nd homer of the season,
Ken Griffey Jr. singled and later scored the go-ahead run when Raul
Ibanez grounded into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez also stole his 44th base of the season, making him the
most prolific 40/40 player in major-league history. He has as many
homers as Jose Canseco hit in 1988 and Barry Bonds in '96. But
Canseco and Bonds finished their seasons with 40 steals.
</P>
<P>
   Cloude finished his first full big-league season with an 8-10
record, winning one of his last six starts. Although the
right-hander doubled his win output from last season, his earned
run average climbed from 5.12 to 6.37.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pretty informative year, to say the least,'' he said.
``I expected it to be a pretty big learning experience in my first
full season in the big leagues. I actually expected to do a little
better than I did.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I learned enough that I can get to the point where I want
to be next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Cloude left Slocumb with a bases-loaded, one-out jam in the
seventh. The Mariners escaped without allowing a run, thanks to a
leaping catch by second baseman Giomar Guevara on a scorcher hit by
Jason Giambi and a Slocumb strikeout of Matt Stairs.
</P>
<P>
   But a one-out walk to Scott Spiezio, pinch-runner Rickey
Henderson's stolen base and Eric Chavez's two-out single to center
put Oakland ahead to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an ugly ninth inning,'' manager Lou Piniella said.
``It brought some memories of way back when. Basically, we have
been pitching pretty well, but that ninth inning, walks, hit
batsmen. I don't think they had a hit, did they?''
</P>
<P>
   On Cloude, Piniella said, ``I see him in the rotation next year.
He has a good arm. He gained a lot of experience this year. We feel
he'll be better with one (full) year under his belt.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The professional golf season might be winding
down, but that's hardly relevant to Southern California fans. This
is the time of year they get to attend most of their pro events.
</P>
<P>
   The stretch run starts with the Oct. 8-11 Nike Tour Inland
Valley Open at Moreno Valley Ranch, near Beaumont. Then comes the
Pacific Bell Senior Classic (formerly Ralphs Senior Classic), Oct.
26-Nov. 1 at Wilshire. That's followed by the Nov. 11-15 Franklin
Templeton Shark Shootout at Sherwood Country Club, the Nov. 16-22
LPGA Tour Championship at the Desert Inn Resort in Las Vegas, the
Nov. 28-29 Skins Game at Rancho La Quinta and Dec. 19-20 Lexus
Challenge at the La Quinta Citrus Course.
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Famers Chi Chi Rodriguez and Lee Trevino have committed
to the Pacific Bell senior event at Wilshire, joining a field that
includes two-time defending champion Gil Morgan and senior tour
rookie John Mahaffey, the 1978 PGA champion who turned 50 in May.
</P>
<P>
   Other top seniors expected to play include past Ralphs champions
Raymond Floyd, Dale Douglass and John Bland, 1996 Senior U.S. Open
champion Dave Stockton and former PGA superstar-turned-broadcaster
Johnny Miller. Miller could add serious interest to the event. In
1994, he stepped out of the broadcast booth to play in the PGA
Tour's Pebble Beach National Pro Am and won _ at age 47.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Nike update:!off! Former area stars David Berganio, Jason
Gore, Chris Zambri and Bob Burns will play in the Nike Inland
Valley Open.
</P>
<P>
   All rank in Nike top-10 statistical categories through this week
_ Berganio and Burns for scoring average and all-around play,
Zambri for sand saves and Gore for driving and eagles. Berganio
also leads the Nike Tour in total driving and is tied for sixth in
greens in regulation. With two events left before the season-ending
tour championship, Burns (13th), Zambri (16th) and Berganio (37th)
are all within reach of a top-15 season money finish that would
earn exemption to next year's PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   How tough is the Nike Tour? Consider this: Two players _ Notah
Begay Jr. and Doug Dunakey _ shot rounds of 59 this year and
neither won in that tournament. Another player, Chris Couch, is
averaging 302.1 yards off the tee and doesn't lead the tour in
driving _ Stiles Mitchell does, at 307.8.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty tough,'' said Dave Lancer, the Notre Dame High
alumnus who works as PGA Tour director of information. ``The
difference between players on the Nike Tour and PGA Tour is
marginal.''
</P>
<P>
   Qualifying tournaments for the Nike Inland Valley Open are
scheduled for today (amateur only) at Soboba Springs and for Oct. 5
(open qualifying) at Sun Lakes in Banning and Soboba Springs. Entry
fee for the open qualifiers is $225, with a deadline of Wednesday.
The top seven finishers in each open qualifier and the top amateur
in today's qualifier earn berths in the Nike event. Information:

   __ Shark sighting: Greg Norman, who missed most of this season
because of shoulder surgery, will return to competitive golf at the
Franklin Templeton Shark Shootout he hosts each November in
Thousand Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   The annual event at Sherwood Country Club, featuring 10 two-man
teams of top pros, was started 10 years ago by Norman and his wife
Laura to help raise funds to fight childhood cancer.
</P>
<P>
   __ A tournament worth winning: When Jeff Freeman of Tamarisk
Country Club in Rancho Mirage survived a final-round, 17th-hole
double bogey to win this year's Southern California PGA Section
championship last week, he came away with more than a trophy and
some atta-boys.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman, who finished 69-68-69_206 to win by two strokes over
Steve Sear of Jim McLean Golf School, also earned exemptions into
three PGA Tour events next year _ the Bob Hope Desert Classic in
Palm Desert, Nissan Open at Riviera and Buick Invitational at
Torrey Pines.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern California PGA is one of 41 sections of the PGA of
America and includes more than 1,500 men and women who work as golf
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   A field of 134 started the 54-hole section championship at
Mission Hills CC in Rancho Mirage, with 60 advancing to the final
two rounds. John Sanhamel of Oakmont led area finishers, tying for
25th at 219.
</P>
<P>
   Other area pros who made the cut included Roger Gunn of Lake
Lindero, Ted Lehmann of Westlake Village, Rick Garboski of North
Ranch, Don Fiala of Wood Ranch and regular-season money and points
leader Paul Holtby of Los Robles.
</P>
<P>
   __ Names in the game: Alice Cooper, Hootie and the Blowfish, Van
Halen ... and Grayson Taylor Eleftheriou? The first three are
rockers turned golfers. It's too early to know yet about No. 4, but
2-week-old Grayson Taylor, born Sept. 11, has the genes: His dad,
former heavy-metal bandsman and current Scholl Canyon head pro Ted,
is combining diaper duty with giving 60 to 70 golf lessons a week
and hopes to qualify for the Nike Inland Valley Open....
</P>
<P>
   Rich Contreras, who shares the course record of 9-under-par 51
at Scholl Canyon, is the man to beat in this week's final round of
the men's club championship at Verdugo Hills three-par course.
Contreras, a teaching pro at Verdugo Hills, shot 8-under par _
three shots off the course record _ in the second round of that
54-hole event and came within a lipped-out putt of shooting 6-under
on the back nine.

    WASHINGTON _ As cheers and applause echoed through the Capitol
Rotunda, President Clinton awarded Nelson Mandela the Congressional
Gold Medal Wednesday, making him the first African to receive
Congress' highest award.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The South African president, who met with Muhammad Ali and
Evander Holyfield earlier in the day, said the only accomplishment
that he regretted not achieving was becoming heavyweight champion
of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, I feel like the heavyweight champion of the world,''
said Mandela, who was an accomplished amateur boxer until he was
sentenced to life imprisonment when he was 43.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela became the 100th person to receive the award, which has
been granted to figures ranging from George Washington to Mother
Teresa. The event was filled with deep emotions, as politicians
from both sides of the aisle tried to draw on the lessons of
Mandela's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``No medal, no award, no fortune, nothing we could give him
could possibly compare to the gifts he has given us and to the
world,'' said Clinton, who appeared close to tears. ``The only true
gift that is true recompense is to continue the mission and to live
by the power of his profound and wonderful example.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich was also overcome by emotion and
appeared to cut short his speech to avoid breaking into tears.
``When you contemplate 27 years in prison, when you imagine walking
out of that isolation with your heart larger and not smaller,
President Mandela, you give every person on the planet a personal
witness to how valuable freedom must be, to be worthy of such a
life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During his speech, Gingrich singled out former Rep. Ron Dellums
of Oakland, Calif., for championing anti-apartheid legislation in
Congress for 15 years until it was finally approved by Congress in
1985. ``We should take just a moment to honor the member of this
Congress who I think without question did the most, day in and day
out, year in and year out, to maintain the fight to end apartheid,
our friend Ron Dellums,'' said Gingrich, as Dellums rose to a
standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   And as Mandela stood to acknowledge his award, Dellums bounded
up to the podium and embraced Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   The South African leader was accompanied by Graca Machel, whom
he married on his 80th birthday last month. Mandela will leave
office in May, and he has said that this will be his last visit to
the United States while president.
</P>
<P>
   The event marked the first time Clinton had been on Capitol Hill
since independent counsel Kenneth Starr sent his report on the
Monica Lewinsky scandal to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   There were only veiled references to the political crisis
gripping the capital. ``Politics in a free society is a very
rough-and-tumble business, involving at times great personal
pain,'' Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton said to Mandela, ``Americans as one today across all
the lines that divide us, pay tribute to your struggle and to the
inspiration you have given us to do better.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in the audience were the parents of Amy Biehl, the
26-year-old Stanford graduate who was stabbed to death by rampaging
youths outside Cape Town, nine months before South Africa's first
democratic elections in April 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through her, our people have also shared the pain of
confronting a terrible past as we take the path toward
reconciliation and healing of our nation,'' said Mandela. He also
paid tribute to the ``countless ordinary American citizens'' who
participated in the anti-apartheid movement. ``In all these ways,
the United States and its people have played a significant role in
the birth of our new nation.''

BOHANON PONDERS HIS FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (WRITETHRU) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Brian Bohanon took his ball and went home.
</P>
<P>
   Will he be back? Will the Los Angeles Dodgers look at the
journeyman left-hander who has put together the best 2{ months of
his nine-year career and decide he is worth the free-agent money he
can finally command?.
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon hopes so. He hopes games like Wednesday's 3-2
complete-game loss to the National League West-champion San Diego
Padres aren't forgotten during the Dodgers' offseason purge.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they are or not, Bohanon will always remember catching
Quilvio Veras' popup with two outs in the ninth that ended his
season. Bohanon walked off the mound clutching the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Although he went the distance twice in his last three starts,
and lost both times, Bohanon left with his head up. He came into
manager Glenn Hoffman's office to offer thanks for giving him a
chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought about the possibilities,'' Bohanon said. ``I
would love to stay here. They gave me the opportunity. I showed
people that I come to pitch every time out. I can give you 32-34
starts a year. Most of all, I have the confidence in myself to
close out games. That is important.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he was 5-7 in his 14 starts with the Dodgers, Bohanon
had a 2.40 ERA during that stretch. He pitched at least six innings
in 12 consecutive starts. All this from a guy who had a 7.77 ERA in
1996 when he pitched in relief for the Toronto Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confidence is the difference,'' said pitching coach Charlie
Hough. ``He has taken this opportunity and really taken off. He
knows and you know that when he goes out there it is going to be a
quality performance.''
</P>
<P>
   But what will it mean at free-agent time? Three years
guaranteed, two years and an option for more than $4-5 million. The
Dodgers will have a staff meeting today headed by new general
manager Kevin Malone to start addressing issues such as Bohanon's
future.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Bohanon started slowly, but he made only one mistake
in the final seven innings, a fifth-inning home run to Tony Gwynn.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres used five pitchers in relief of starter Andy Ashby
(17-9), who went six innings for his first victory since Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them pitched as a tuneup for the postseason, which
begins Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It might seemed like a waste of time for the Dodgers at the end
of a miserable season, but for the Padres it was critical.
Situation pitching is an important part of playoff baseball.
Longtime Angel Mark Langston, for example, is being asked to come
out of the bullpen after spending his entire career as a starting
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego also used top left-handed set up man Randy Myers with
two outs in the eighth after Dan Miceli walked Raul Mondesi. Myers
gave up a pinch single to Charles Johnson, putting runners at first
and third.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres turned to closer Trevor Hoffman, their sixth pitcher,
and he got the final out of the eighth when Mark Grudzielanek
popped out to first. Hoffman also pitched the ninth to get his 52nd
save.
</P>
<P>
   All the moves also were important because the Padres, who
clinched the NL West on Sept. 12 in San Diego, have not played well
in September.
</P>
<P>
   With Wednesday's victory, they are just 8-13 in the month,
ruining any chance of going into the playoffs with the league's
best record. If Atlanta keeps the best record and the New York Mets
win the wild card over Chicago, the Padres will play the Braves in
the first round.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cubs win the wild card, San Diego will open against
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``You probably saw a few more guys in there than normal,''
Padres manager Bruce Bochy said, ``but I wanted to prepare guys for
situations they might see in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   There won't be a postseason for Bohanon or the Dodgers. But both
hope there have been lessons learned this season that will get them
there in the future.
</P>
<P>
   For Bohanon, one of the turning points this season was a
suggestion from Hough that he focus more on his throwing between
starts. He would go to the bullpen and work on situations. He also
would hit the weights hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Preparation has been the key for me since I got here,''
Bohanon said. ``Throwing between starts became very important. I
learned there how to concentrate and how to pitch the seventh,
eighth and ninth innings. That has been the difference for me.''

ANCIENT FISH PRESENTS NEW MYSTERY 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID PERLMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A rare and primitive fish, famed as a ``living
fossil'' unchanged for millions of years, has been found in the
deep waters off a remote Indonesian island, nearly 6,000 miles away
from its only known habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery of a population of the fish so far from its known home
has astonished biologists, to whom it poses a fascinating puzzle in
the evolution and spread of a species. According to fossil records,
the fish must have thrived more than 350 million years ago _ and
today appears exactly like its ancient forebears.
</P>
<P>
   The oily, ugly creature with its snapping teeth and lobe-shaped
fins is a coelacanth (see-la-kanth), and scientists long thought it
had been extinct for at least 65 million years _ until the first
living example of its kind was caught off the coast of East Africa
60 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the coelacanth has been found only around the Comoro
Islands in the Indian Ocean, with a few strays from the Comoros
caught off Madagascar. It is so rare that it is protected as an
endangered species by international treaty.
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't protected the deep-water denizen from the nets
of fishermen, who catch it and sell it dried and salted in outdoor
markets.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Arnaz Mehta, the wife of a biologist at the
University of California at Berkeley, spotted one lying dead in a
fish market in the town of Manado on the northeast peninsula of
Indonesia's Sulawesi mainland. Her husband, Mark V. Erdmann, is
studying shrimp species there as a key to the ecology of the
region's abundant but threatened coral reefs.
</P>
<P>
   With support from the National Geographic Society, Erdmann
quickly surveyed local fishermen about what they knew of the
curious fish they called ``king of the sea,'' and last July, the
crew of one fishing vessel brought him a live specimen netted off
the tiny Sulawesi island of Manadotua. It was more than four feet
long and weighed nearly 65 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Erdmann quickly extracted a small tissue sample from the fish,
then preserved it temporarily in a deep-freeze. The importance of
the find is ``enormous,'' he said in an e-mail message to his
Berkeley colleagues, and added:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a humbling and exciting reminder that humans have by no
means conquered the oceans, and provides fodder for our imagination
about other, as-yet-undiscovered `sea monsters.' It underscores the
importance of protecting our oceans, lest we lose things forever
which we have not yet even discovered.''
</P>
<P>
   Another biologist, Susan Jewett, a specialist in fish
preservation at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, flew to
Indonesia this week to supervise the final preservation of
Erdmann's coelacanth and the extraction of tissues crucial to
establishing its genetic relationship to the creatures typically
found near the Comoros.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be absolutely shocked if there weren't other
populations of these fish in similar areas,'' said Roy L. Caldwell,
chairman of the department of integrative biology at UC Berkeley.
``We now know they live around active volcanic islands with deep
caves in the seawalls that plummet straight down for hundreds of
feet to a sloping bottom. So they may well be living in many other
similar habitats.''
</P>
<P>
   Erdmann and Caldwell, together with M. Kasim Moosa of the
Indonesian Institute of Sciences, are publishing a more formal
report on the discovery Thursday in the scientific journal Nature.
According to Caldwell and Erdmann, the Sulawesi specimen appears to
be the same species as the fish in the Comoros, although the skin
of Erdmann's coelacanth is brown with white flecks, and the skin of
Comoros fish is blue with white flecks.
</P>
<P>
   The eggs of these strange animals, which the fossil record
indicates should have become extinct along with the dinosaurs, are
fertilized inside the bodies of the females, who bear their young
alive after pregnancy _ unlike most other fish, in which sperm
cells fertilize the female's eggs in the open water and the young
fish hatch far from their mothers.
</P>
<P>
   The coelacanth's lobe-shaped fins actually have jointed bones,
somewhat like arms and legs, and many scientists have inferred that
they might have been the direct ancestors of the first land
animals.
</P>
<P>
   The preponderance of evidence, however, points to the primitive
tribe of lungfish as being more closely aligned to the ancestors of
land animals than coelacanths are, according to Erdmann.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the evidence now suggests that the coelacanths might have
been evolving in that direction millions of years ago, but they
just didn't make it, and remained the way they still are today,''
Caldwell said. &QL;

STUDY EXPLAINS HOW MARIJUANA KILLS PAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARL T. HALL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Researchers say they have identified a new way
to explain how THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, acts on the
central nervous system to kill pain.
</P>
<P>
   Laboratory experiments at the University of California at San
Francisco have revealed that tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) taps
circuitry at the base of the brain, modulating pain signals in much
the same way as morphine and other opiates.
</P>
<P>
   The findings seem to corroborate reports from some doctors and
marijuana users who claim that smoking pot helps keep pain under
control. Skeptics, however, still insist that marijuana's medicinal
value has yet to be proved.
</P>
<P>
   The UCSF experiments were conducted on rats given doses of a
synthetic form of THC _ one in a family of drugs called
cannabinoids. Led by Ian Meng, a postdoctoral fellow at UCSF
working in the laboratory of neurologist Howard Fields, the
researchers took precise measurements of electrical activity to
determine how the marijuana-like drug affected circuitry in the
brainstem and spinal cord.
</P>
<P>
   Pain responses were gauged by a standard routine that measures
how long the rats take to move their tails from a heat source. The
experiments were designed to keep THC's direct effects on movement
and coordination from masking the drug's analgesic effects.
</P>
<P>
   Results were detailed Wednesday in the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Meng and his colleagues Barton Manning and William Martin
focused on a region deep in the brain called the rostral
ventromedial medulla, or RVM _ a kind of relay station for pain
signals which Meng likened to ``the volume control on a stereo.''
</P>
<P>
   Both morphine and cannabinoids turn down the volume _ minimizing
the intensity of pain sensations reaching other parts of the brain
_ by switching on or off certain cells in the same region.
</P>
<P>
   Meng found that the marijuana-like drug acted on the same cells
as morphine, but through a different mechanism. Although
preliminary, that finding carries important implications for the
potential medical uses of cannabinoids.
</P>
<P>
   Opiates generally are much more effective than cannabinoids at
reducing pain symptoms. But the opiates also can cause nausea and
other unwanted side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Marijuana-like drugs tend to counteract nausea in many people
while at the same time stimulating appetite. Thus, Meng said, the
two types of painkillers might be used in combination, presumably
with reduced dosages of opiates needed to achieve the desired pain
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point would be to enhance the pain-suppressing effects of
the drugs while reducing the side effects,'' he said. ``The
potential is there to reduce some of the nausea you get with the
opioids.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ethan Russo, a neurologist in Missoula, Mont., who recently
concluded a detailed historical study of marijuana's therapeutic
role, said the new findings bolster the notion that cannabinoids
are ``genuine medicine with clear pharmacologic effects.''
</P>
<P>
   But skeptics said the mere discovery of a new brainstem circuit
adds little to the controversy surrounding the herb.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly interesting and praiseworthy to elucidate a
mechanism of action,'' said Dr. Peter Wolfe, an associate clinical
professor of medicine at the University of California at Los
Angeles. ``But it would be even more interesting to see how this
drug really stacks up against what's already available.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that morphine's side effects can be minimized by using
other drugs already on the market that lack the disorienting
effects linked to the cannabinoids.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Bring on Georges; this time we're ready
 &HT;    (For immediate release.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ In August 1992, neither our house nor the houses on
either side of us had hurricane shutters, a ruinous omission likely
caused by lethargy toward hurricanes rather than by financial
considerations.
</P>
<P>
   It took the monstrous winds of Hurricane Andrew to shatter our
roofs and windows and race destructively throughout our houses to
make us understand the power of a hurricane, a weather phenomenon
that had been absent from the Miami area for a quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   As Hurricane Georges roared across Puerto Rico, Hispaniola and
Cuba this week, those who recalled the days, weeks and months of
recovery just six years earlier moved almost by rote to prepare for
what this time was expected to be a minimal hurricane; certainly
minimal compared to Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   For me and my neighbors, no longer was there a need to rush to
the home supply store to purchase paneling to board windows. We
avoided the long, testy lines because we had properly constructed
aluminum shutters in place.
</P>
<P>
   We had learned our lesson.
</P>
<P>
   With local TV and the Weather Channel bleating at us about
Georges ever since it showed up as a zephyr off the west coast of
Africa, preparations for it have been methodic and without panic.
</P>
<P>
   (I don't know which was more of a video deluge: local hurricane
weather reports or the continuing soap opera surrounding the
president. For the most part, around-the-clock local TV coverage of
creeping hurricanes is as repetitious and non-revealing as were the
Clinton tapes.)
</P>
<P>
   The danger of Georges is not so much the damage it can inflict
on the U.S. mainland, having already been stripped of much of its
power over Hispaniola and Cuba, but the fact that it is not the
scope of an Andrew. For the many thousands who have moved to South
Florida in the past six years, a mild bump by Georges might create
a lack of fear.
</P>
<P>
   No hurricane, no matter how mild, will reinstill a lethargy in
those of us who barely survived Andrew. To us, the start of the
hurricane season each June 1 is a time to begin preparation,
whether or not anything has slipped off the African coast.
</P>
<P>
   It's all bought, then _ the water, canned goods, batteries,
paper goods, etc. The storm shutters are checked, and anything
having to do with a hurricane is put in working order by June 1,
not when a hurricane watch is being posted.
</P>
<P>
   We were complacent once, and we suffered the consequences. We
will never again be caught so off guard. In my neighborhood, and
with my family, we treat Hurricane Georges with the same awe as we
gave Andrew _ after it hit us.
</P>
<P>
   So prepared were we now that we completed whatever we had to do
by Wednesday night. As I write this on Thursday, I have nothing to
do _ it's all done.
</P>
<P>
   All that's left is to sit around and watch weather experts on TV
telling us how to prepare for a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   That must be for the people who weren't around for Andrew.

LOVE AMONG THE GREEK RUINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., Sept. 27)  
(JT) 
 By BENEDICT NIGHTINGALE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you sail toward the island of Naxos, your eye is caught by
a monument that not only looks strange and distinctive but is as
much a symbol or trademark of the island as the Statue of Liberty
is of New York. It's a giant portal, 21 feet high and 16 feet
across, that stands at the end of a natural causeway running out of
the port city of Chora. The Portara, as it's called, was put in
place around 520 B.C. by a tyrant named Lygdamis, and was to be a
suitably grand entrance to the greatest temple to Apollo in all
Greece. But Lygdamis was overthrown in 506, the temple was left
unfinished, and 2,000 years later it was still being plundered for
its marble. Today you can wander through the remnants of the place,
maybe musing on the pride of princes, the hubris of tyrants. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet the portal, which weighs maybe 100 tons in all, defied all
attempts at removal by the aspiring builders among the Venetians,
the Turks, the pirates and the others, foreign and Greek, who
occupied Naxos over the centuries. As a result, you can perch on
the shiny stone beneath its massive lintel, or stand a few yards
away, and look from or through it. You can look west at the
adjoining island of Paros, only five miles across the straits, as
the setting sun turns the light above its crags white, yellow, red,
purple, violet. Or look across at the shimmering whites of a port
town that's still topped by its brown 12th-century Kastro, or
castle area. Or look up at the nearest of Naxos' myriad hills and
mountains, with the creamy rectangles of the Monastery of St. John
Chrysostom tucked high on its gray-green slopes.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a mystery about the Portara and the islet of
Palatia on which it stands. My more literal-minded side may be
aware that this was the acropolis of Naxos in Lygdamis' era.
Indeed, divers or even ordinary folks with snorkels and goggles can
take a dip and, I'm told, see ruins that date back to archaic times
but are now hidden by the encroaching Aegean. But my less literal
self senses magic in the Portara. Especially when it's gently
lighted at night, it looks like a gate in a dreamscape by Dali, de
Chirico or one of the other great Surrealists. It leads nowhere,
absolutely nowhere _ and it also seems to time-warp you back to
prehistory. I don't know what Lord Byron, who wanted to settle in
Naxos, thought when he first saw it. The last time I stood on the
Portara, I felt I had only to shut my eyes, step through, and I
would be in a land of poetry and myth.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I suspect this is far from a unique reaction, for the
Palatia is where Ariadne is said to have been abandoned by the man
she trusted. Though versions of the tale vary, she was the daughter
of the tyrant Minos, fell in love with the great Theseus, and
helped him when he killed her omnivorous half-brother, the
bull-headed Minotaur. Ariadne fled with her hero to Naxos, where he
left her sleeping beneath what's now the Portara. As anyone who has
heard Richard Strauss' opera ``Ariadne auf Naxos'' will know, she
broke into terrible lamentations after his ship disappeared round
the rocky horn of Paros on what is still the main sea route to
Athens. But divine help was at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Dionysus had been seized by pirates who, unaware he was a god,
intended to sell him as a slave in Asia. He turned their oars into
serpents, transformed himself into a lion, and filled the boat with
so many phantom beasts that his captors jumped overboard in terror
and became dolphins. He then landed at Naxos, married Ariadne,
turned her bridal crown into stars, and had six children by her.
That's why the island was once known as Dionysia, a place that,
thanks to the god's love of the grape, became and remained famous
for its wine.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a much later peasant myth says that Dionysus was really
St. Dionysios, a saint who found a plant that he placed for
safekeeping inside the leg bones first of a bird, then of a lion,
then of an ass. When he came to Naxos, he buried it, but it kept on
growing. As you'll have guessed, it became the first vine ever,
producing a drink that made men sing like birds, then roar like
lions, and finally bray like asses. You can get the stuff, either
red or white, from the barrel in many Naxian tavernas today, and,
though I can't recall making zoological sounds at the time, I
myself found it irresistible. However, the most distinctive local
drink is kitron, a delightful liqueur distilled from lemons. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lemons, figs, peaches, oranges, melons, grapes, tomatoes: Naxos,
all 169 square miles of it, is the most fertile of the group of
Greek islands known as the Cyclades, as well as the largest and (as
Byron clearly felt) the most beautiful. It also has the tallest
mountain in fierce, jagged 3,284-foot Mount Za. Zeus was supposedly
raised there, in a cave that, until fairly recently, was the place
up to which anyone falsely accused of sheep-stealing would clamber
in order to protest his innocence. After all, an oath taken before
the altar in what had become a Christian as well as a pagan shrine
could hardly be disbelieved.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also large, fecund valleys in Naxos, especially
the Tragea region in the center of the island, that offer the
traveler old villages, Venetian towers, Byzantine churches and, six
miles out of Chora, one of the huge unfinished statues that are, as
far as I know, unique to Naxos.
</P>
<P>
   There's another, chunkier statue, a sort of archaic
Frankenstein's monster, that lies on its back amid the rocks above
Apollonas, in the extreme north of Naxos. But the one at the
island's core, at Melanes, is more delicate. You walk past abundant
wildflowers, through a lemon orchard, and there it is, one leg
fractured, its facial features not yet carved, but discernibly a
seventh-century B.C. kouros, or youth. Nearly 23 feet long, it has
the slim grace of a Modigliani; and no one knows why it and its
brothers were never completed. Maybe there were faults in the
stone. Maybe political turmoil interrupted the work. Maybe the
Apollonian statue was meant to stand on a clifftop welcoming or
deterring sailors. Perhaps the Melanes kouros was intended to be
sent to Delos, 40 miles to the north. After all, the Naxiotes made
many contributions to the holy isle, notably the line of stone
lions that are now the most striking of its remaining monuments.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you think of the myth that Naxos' first inhabitants
were Maenads,brought from Thrace by the son of the north wind to be
the wives of his companions, the inhabitants appear to have been
numerous, rich and prosperous from the earliest times. The museum
at the capital town of Chora has an exceptional collection both of
pottery and of surreal Cycladic figurines _ spacemen's heads,
triangular noses, folded arms, pointed breasts _ dating from 3200
B.C. onward and discovered in the north of the town, near Palatia.
Later, Naxiote seafarers helped the Athenians inflict a decisive
defeat on the Persians at Salamis. But the island's modern history
began in 1207 when a Venetian privateer called Marco Sanudo seized
it and divided it among his followers, launching a dynasty that
continued to rule even after the Turks took nominal control of
Naxos 300 years later.

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Reminders of Venice are all over the island: in the crenelated
tower-houses, part fortresses and part palaces, you find dominating
the landscape at Bellonia, Apalyrou and elsewhere; and especially
in the mini-city, the Kastro, at the top of Chora itself. You roam,
ramble and maybe get lost in streets and tunnels that are far too
narrow for any car and match those at Patmos for all-white
maziness. Up and up you wind, feeling like a character in a Lewis
Carroll dream. You pass tiny shops, mini-churches and houses
encrusted with flowers, until you reach an imposing round tower and
pass through the big, thick gate beside it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Inside, there's plenty to see too: mansions over whose doors the
coats-of-arms of Italian families are still carved; a somewhat
over-restored 15th-century Catholic cathedral with the same clans'
tombs on the floor and a fine, full-length icon of the Virgin Mary;
a large convent-school dating from 1739; and, now housing the
archeological museum, the 17th-century college of commerce where
Nikos Kazantzakis once studied.
</P>
<P>
   Kazantzakis, the author of ``Zorba the Greek,'' loved Naxos for
its ``sweetness and tranquillity,'' and when you drive through the
island, it is easy to see why. According to local lore, the Potamia
valley in the center is haunted by phantoms of bears, hogs and
lambs that can change shape into oxen; but to me it seemed a
peaceful place, one that merits its reputation as ``little Mystra''
because, like the abandoned Peloponnesian city of that name, it is
crammed with Byzantine churches.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, these are usually kept locked these days for fear of
theft, but I managed to inveigle my way into the most important.
Near Moni an intricate tangle of domes hides the impressive Church
of the Panagia Drossiani, or Dewy Virgin _ so called because an
icon of Mary supposedly seeps or weeps when danger threatens _ and
frescoes of Christian figures, some of which are said to go back to
the sixth century. A few of the murals in the Church of
Protothronos in neighboring Khalki, which I was also able to visit,
may be as old, and many are finer and better preserved. An
Annunciation is extraordinary in its chaste gravity. A Jesus with
flowing locks seems almost to float in the dome, and the saints
below his throne have individual enough faces for one to wonder if
their models weren't peasants who lived in the village when
Byzantium ruled Naxos 1,000 years ago. Khalki is itself worth a
wander, offering as it does maybe the most attractive of the
island's Venetian tower-houses in the tall, square, honey-colored
Gratsias mansion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But then several villages deserve a visit: Komiaki, where wise
householders keep their fires burning at Christmas, for legend says
that around that time snake-eating spirits rise from the underworld
and slip down chimneys; maybe Tripodes, beyond whose windmills lies
a crumbling, grass-encrusted fortress in which a princess, who
became a prophetess after her two suitors killed one another, is
supposed to have sat on the three-legged stool that gives the place
its name; and most certainly Apiranthos.
</P>
<P>
   If you walk along its marble-paved arcades and alleys _ Venetian
houses above you on one side, Mount Za on the other, women
peacefully working at their embroidery as you pass _ you may find
it hard to credit the village's supposed origins. This is that it
was founded by Barabbas, whom Pontius Pilate pardoned when he
condemned Jesus. The great thief went to Crete, was thrown out,
moved to Naxos and created a community whose descendants, according
to a legend still current earlier this century, have often been
bandits and pirates. All this probably means is that much of the
east of Naxos was settled by Cretans, and Cretan refugees were
never popular with islanders to the north.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the truth, you can drive safely round Naxos these days,
and cars can be easily rented in Chora. Even the roads, poor only a
few years ago, are pretty good; and there are rewards in abundance
for your serendipity. Almost by accident, I found myself driving
past the village of Sangri and there, on a knoll in a valley
between two mountains, was what appeared to an ancient Greek temple
not too far from completion. And in fact that's exactly what it was
and is. So much of the original marble is intact that what was once
a temple to Demeter is now being painstakingly pieced together by
archeologists and may already be visited. Bits of ersatz column and
lintel are, it's true, filling in the gaps; but, given time and
weather, maybe Naxos will succeed in its aim, which is to offer a
building to compare to the famous fifth-century temple of Aphaia on
the island of Aegina south of Athens.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the greatest pleasure is simply to stop beside the
road and look. Stop above the mountain village of Koronos and look
at the sea distantly lapping both east and west of the island. Or
stop and keep stopping on what must be one of the finest drives in
all Greece, the undulating coastal road from Chora to the tiny port
of Apollonas. Barely a mile short of your destination, there's a
medieval tower romantically commanding the heights and the depths.
Clamber up and look at its ruins. Far below, the waves are lapping
against a stone-and-green inlet. Far beyond you can see Mykonos,
Delos and Siros in ghostly silhouette. If the island's most famous
visitor wasn't here, he should have been. It's as Byronic an
experience as you can reasonably expect in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Getting There
</P>
<P>
   You get to Naxos from Piraeus either by regular ferry, which
takes seven hours, or by the much more chic hydrofoil, which takes
just over three hours. All boats stop at the island of Paros on the
way. There is also a tiny airport, which offers regular 30-minute
flights from Athens, though these tend to get booked up well in
advance, owing to the small size of the planes. Where to Stay
</P>
<P>
   The most attractive hotel in Naxos _ indeed, one of the most
appealing in the Cyclades _ is the small Chateau Zevgoli, (30-285)
22993 or 25201, which nestles beneath the Kastro in the old section
of Chora. In high summer season, a double room with bath will cost
about $90 a night; in low season, less. (Prices are calculated at
270 drachmas to the dollar.) The rooms are exceptionally pretty,
coming as they do with traditional furniture and authentically
Naxiote cushions, pillows and coverlets. If you are staying any
length of time, the owner may rent you a room in a 13th-century
mansion in the Kastro at similar prices.
</P>
<P>
   Two cheaper hotels worth considering are the Anixis, (30-285)
22112, and the Panorama, (30-285) 22330. Each is centrally placed
in Chora and offers reasonably comfortable rooms and fine views of
the sea at a cost of about $40 a night for a double in peak summer
season, less in low season.
</P>
<P>
   Where to Eat
</P>
<P>
   Most restaurants and tavernas in Chora offer standard Greek
food. You can, for instance, dine simply and well on fish or meat
at the  &QL; 
plain but decent Christos Grill,  &QL; 
(30-285) 23171, just behind the sea front. Apolaphasis, in an upper
room on the front itself, offers a wider choice of Greek dishes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you want more culinarily ambitious places, try the
French-influenced Elli, (30-285) 25476, near the Orthodox
Cathedral, or the Italian-influenced El Greco, (30-285) 26293,
again on the front. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most striking restaurant, however, is Lucullus,
(30-285) 24386, on Old Market Street, which justifies its claim to
have existed since 1908 by cramming the walls and ceilings with
traditional cooking and eating implements. Its dishes venture
beyond the usual, including rabbit stew, snail-and-onion stew, wild
pig, spicy cheese salad and a delicious veal in lemon sauce. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Out of Chora, tavernas are reasonably plentiful but pretty
predictable _ though I had a pleasant lamb casserole at the Apollon
Restaurant in Apollonas, (30-285) 67005. Two people can have dinner
with wine at any of these places for around $30.

INTEL GIVES $6 MILLION TO WHITNEY FOR A SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Intel Corp. has contributed $6 million to the
Whitney Museum of American Art to stage its mammoth overview of
20th century art and culture, which is scheduled to open next
April.
</P>
<P>
   The gift is thought to be the largest made to an art museum for
a specific exhibition and will be accompanied by the further
contribution of staff and technology for computer enhancements for
the show, ``The American Century: Art and Culture 1900-2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The show, the museum's signature offering to mark the end of the
century, will include more than 1,400 works _ paintings,
sculptures, photography, architecture and design _ and will present
related materials in music, dance, literature and film. The aim is
to explore the changing nature of American identity through the
eyes of artists across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The show will be presented in two consecutive parts and will
fill the Whitney's main Marcel Breuer building for nine months. The
first part, covering 1900 to 1950, will run from April 22 to Aug.
30; the second, covering the last half of the century, will run
from next October to February 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The show will then go to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art,
where it will be from May through September 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The gift comes as corporate giving for specific shows is
declining. Intel, the world's largest manufacturer of microchips,
said it was attracted by the opportunity to identify with the
educational aspect of the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology can give museumgoing a different dimension,'' said
Andrew S. Grove, chairman and chief executive of Intel. ``It has
been such a big part of the American century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``About this collaboration,'' he added, ``you could say all the
stars lined up in the right way.'' Among the features being
developed are an advanced Web site and computers at the exhibition
to give visitors access to information about specific artworks and
related topics.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney officials said the technology would offer the visitor
crystal clear three-dimensional images, several ways to quickly
call up audio and video information and customized programs
tailored to a viewer's interests and level of knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   The computers are to be in a room much like the reading rooms of
many exhibitions, where visitors can delve into catalogs and books
that provide more information than the wall texts do. ``We will
update the concept of the reading room as a marvelous pause in an
exhibition,'' said Maxwell L. Anderson, director of the Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   Intel executives said they were also experimenting with portable
computer devices to be used in the museum with access to the Web
site, which would also make most of the information available
outside the museum as well. The company is working with the museum
to develop an online curriculum for teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the company and the museum said they were sensitive
to concerns that computers could seem intrusive and that technology
would reduce the desire of visitors to focus on the art objects
themselves rather than representations on computer screens. They
said the computers were intended to enhance rather than substitute
for the museum experience.
</P>
<P>
   But Grove said that scanning a Web site from outside a museum
had its advantages. ``As a museumgoer, you don't have the ability
to zoom into things because you are always dodging heads,'' he
said. ``Being seen in a home or office without crowds or time
pressures will add a different dimension to the public.''

A STREET-SMART `GODOT' IN A CULTURAL WASTELAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (Production notes at end)  
(gm) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If ever a pair of Beckett clowns were made for each
other, it would have to be the Vladimir and Estragon who run amok
in Joy Zinoman's hip new staging of ``Waiting for Godot.''
</P>
<P>
   Played by a pair of elastic and dynamic actors, Thomas W. Jones
2d and Donald Griffin, they're so merrily in sync that it's easy to
see why they hang out together in perpetuity, waiting at the
appointed time and place for someone who never comes. (With a White
House itself in perpetual crisis, waiting seems a particularly apt
stage metaphor in Washington these days.)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in Ms. Zinoman's liberty-taking and immensely enjoyable
production, Godot is practically superfluous. Who needs the
intrusion from that metaphysical no-show? Didi and Gogo, as they're
more familiarly known, are happy to keep themselves occupied with
their own skills as performers, even if their performance space is
as experimental as they come: the middle of nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   The added value is that you'll be entertained, too. While
they're unable to avoid the occasional lapse into cuteness in this
revival by Ms. Zinoman's Studio Theater, Jones and Griffin are
agile showmen, the kinds of resourceful physical performers who can
get a laugh with a gesture even when the words don't always hold
up.
</P>
<P>
   They play Beckett's heroes as a pair of dancing fools, distinct
from one another and yet bound so tightly it's impossible by the
play's end to think of one without the other. They beautifully
execute a central theme of this work, that regardless of outward
circumstances, one's existence has no meaning unless it is
validated by someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zinoman, the longtime artistic director of the Studio
Theater, a 20-year-old subscription playhouse located off 14th
Street N.W., just north of midtown, infuses her ``Godot'' with an
up-to-the-minute urban sensibility. The play begins with a few
jazzy notes on a saxophone; the black actors who play the leads _
the supporting roles of Pozzo and Lucky are portrayed by whites _
perform bits of hip-hop and, in the kinds of improvisations that
would have driven Beckett up the wall, embellish the text with
caustic asides, resort to black slang and even flirt and banter
with the audience. ``What's wrong with white people?'' Jones ad
libs in mock-irritation at one point, when he fails to elicit the
desired response from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The actors charm their way through most of it, but making
``Godot'' interactive leaves some questions for the continuity
department: Are Didi and Gogo alone on that barren landscape? Or
are we out there with them? Either way, this is a ``Godot'' that
means to explore the relationship between the entertainer and the
entertained.
</P>
<P>
   The pleasingly simple set by Russell Metheny suggests the
symbolic edge of America's vast cultural wasteland: Didi and Gogo
hold their vigil on a bare tract behind a drive-in movie screen so
big it blacks out the sky, and the actors wear a trace of white
makeup around their mouths, hinting at their own theatrical
backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   You could imagine this Didi and Gogo one day in side-by-side
rocking chairs in an old-age home for over-the-hill hoofers; in the
meantime, they derive pleasure (and kill time) doing bits of stage
business, deftly juggling turnips, for instance, or running through
Abbott-and-Costello-style comedy routines.
</P>
<P>
   The warmth between them grows as the actors explore the nooks
and crannies of their companionship, and the dimensions of their
mutual admiration and dependence take shape. Griffin is the
stockier, earthbound yin to Jones' lighter-than-air yang: the
rounder of the pair is sadder, more reflective, the taller more
carefree and frenetic.
</P>
<P>
   Their felicitous bond, of course, is in bold contrast to the
perverse master-slave relationship of Pozzo (Michael Tolaydo) and
Lucky (Hugh Nees), who cross paths with Didi and Gogo for no
particular reason at all. Tolaydo's self-infatuated Pozzo is a
distant relation to the puffed-up Master Thespian character Jon
Lovitz used to play on ``Saturday Night Live,'' and Nees' Lucky,
tethered, as always, to the rope Pozzo controls, deftly navigates a
course between hapless prisoner and beast of burden.
</P>
<P>
   Had Jones and Griffin not been such attractive headliners, Nees
might have walked away with the play. His slobbering, stuttering
declamation of Lucky's long, run-on speech, consisting entirely of
non-sequiturs, is a show-stopper, funny and at the same time
utterly pathetic. It's the best of Beckett, a lover of both words
and the grotesque, and Nees' nimble rendition makes the spoken aria
an event unto itself.
</P>
<P>
   Showing off, after all, is what this production celebrates, and
the only drawback is that once the actors finish with all the
riffing, they have no recourse, no bridge to the play's darker
dimension.
</P>
<P>
   Everything is so show biz that the poignancy of Didi and Gogo's
lonely plight, the echo of the tragic element in all of human life,
has no chance to sink in. There's a feeling as the less satisfying
second act winds down that something deeper in the play has been
glossed over.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Zinoman and her excellent players have performed a
vital service, liberating ``Waiting for Godot'' from the
airlessness and pretension that often afflict productions of
Beckett. The Studio Theater revival is an enthusiastic vote in
favor of a great playwright's lasting relevance.

A MASTER STEEPED IN THE CORE WORKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The nine Beethoven symphonies are colossal works of
seminal importance to the classical repertory. No one worth paying
attention to disputes this.
</P>
<P>
   But they are also terribly familiar. Subjected to such
overexposure, the startling, inventive qualities of the symphonies
simply fade away. The challenge to musicians is to present these
works in a programmatic context _ alongside contemporary works, for
example _ that might help us hear them in fresh ways.
</P>
<P>
   There is no especially compelling reason for the conductor Kurt
Masur's current Beethoven symphony cycle with the New York
Philharmonic to be happening right now. All nine works are being
played in order in a series of five programs. If, say, the
orchestra at the Manhattan School of Music were doing this, it
would at least be a chance to experience the Beethoven symphonies
with young musicians playing them for the first time. Perhaps
Masur's target listeners are those classical-music neophytes who
have boxed-set recordings of the Beethoven symphonies, but have
never heard them performed complete in concert. Such audiences
members will likely be thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   But the main reason for this series would seem to be Masur's
desire to make a statement in repertory that he has a special claim
to through heritage, and that he has steeped himself in. Of course,
there is a well-documented legacy of similar statements from the
great conductors of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Masur is a fine Beethoven conductor, as his program on
Tuesday night of Symphonies Nos. 2 and 3 made clear. He conducts
this music with insight, energy and an exceptional sense of
structural cohesion, and he conducts it from memory. The musicians
responded with technically accomplished, supple and incisive
playing.
</P>
<P>
   I grew up with an old recording of the Symphony No. 2 conducted
by Sir Thomas Beecham that made it seem affable, humorous and
delightfully clever. Masur was more intent, it seemed, on making
the Second Symphony seem a warm-up for the Third, the mighty
``Eroica.'' This was a bold, big-gestured, sonorous performance.
</P>
<P>
   Some conductors highlight the burgeoning Romanticism in the
``Eroica'' Symphony. Masur treated it like a masterwork of high
Classicism. Structure and direction were paramount. The long
passage in the development section of the first movement _ a
buildup of offbeat, accented, increasingly dissonant chords _ was
handled as a bold structural block, not milked for dramatic effect.
Overall, this was a strong, vigorous performance.
</P>
<P>
   The only drawback to the program was that something more
adventurous was not happening instead. But Masur believes
passionately that the New York Philharmonic must maintain the core
classical masterworks. And he is well suited to the job.

CYBILL SHEPHERD: `MOUTHING OFF' AS ART, TO SAY NOTHING OF SONG 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``At this moment, I'm surgically uncorrected,''
Cybill Shepherd boasted from the stage at Tuesday's opening night
show of her two-week engagement at Rainbow and Stars. ``Who knows?
In five years, I could have my whole self done.''
</P>
<P>
   The blond 48-year-old star also boasted about her new
multimillion-dollar contract with Revlon representing Ultima 2 and
delivered an impromptu sales pitch. She rattled on cheerily about
her years of bad reviews, especially for her singing, and bragged
about the companies that went out of business after she recorded
for them.
</P>
<P>
   Yada yada yada. If you want to experience an uncensored close-up
encounter with a star who enjoys ``mouthing off,'' as she put it,
Ms. Shepherd's act may be your cup of tea. Mouthing off on Tuesday
meant touting her coming autobiography, ``Cybill Disobedience,''
which Ms. Shepherd promised would be the literary equivalent of
``turning over a rock and looking under it.'' Its revelations, she
promised, would include a description of Elvis Presley's anatomy.
</P>
<P>
   Her anecdotes also included stories about Bruce Willis (he
enjoyed mooning the cast and crew of ``Moonlighting'') and Orson
Welles (he was her house guest for five years when she was living
with Peter Bogdanovich, and once nearly set the place on fire with
a lighted cigar he left in his bathrobe).
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes. Ms. Shepherd also sang. Or tried to. Accompanied by a
mediocre quartet, she plowed through a program that included
everything from Gershwin (``But Not for Me'') to Memphis-style
rhythm-and-blues, all performed in the thin, wobbly voice of a
tone-deaf teen-ager blissfully unaware of her own lack of talent.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: DISCOVERING A COOL ESTHETIC FOR BURNING ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYONS, France _ Social protest and conceptual cool have come to
the fore in ``Mediterranea,'' the 1998 presentation of the Lyons
Dance Biennial.
</P>
<P>
   Diversity in a theme festival, which focuses this year on dance
from countries around the Mediterranean, could be expected.
Nonetheless, contrasts in the 14-year-old biennial, which closes on
Sept. 29, have been more than striking.
</P>
<P>
   The pain of Algerian choreographers, exiled from their country
because of civil strife, has been strongly expressed in works that
speak of violence, religious fundamentalism and the despair of
immigrants. But a distinctly post-modern esthetic has also made
itself felt, mainly in modern-dance pieces from Spain and Israel
and especially in a high-tech mixed-media super-spectacle presented
by the Lyons Opera Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the National Front, France's extreme-right
political party, have continued to rail against the biennial for
its multicultural theme. During a National Front meeting in Paris
last weekend, Bruno Gollnisch, ranked No. 3 in the party's
leadership, announced on national television that he would oppose
any subsidy for the next Lyons Dance Biennial, in 2000, ``if it
continues in the same direction.'' This year, pressure from the
National Front caused the cancellation of a regional subsidy for a
parade. Gollnisch added that he would also oppose the Contemporary
Art Biennial to be held in Lyons next year because the previous one
was ``ugly and dirty.'' So much for esthetics.
</P>
<P>
   The wonder of this year's dance festival is that politics has
not intruded on the choreographers and performers, who have been
judged on their own terms. Guy Darmet, the biennial's artistic
director, has again brilliantly created a fresh context to view the
familiar and the new.
</P>
<P>
   The festival has brought into relief a revealing connection.
Many of the choreographers have studied in the United States and
some, like Abou Lagraa, a 27-year-old French choreographer of
Algerian descent, have lauded their participation in the American
Dance Festival's International Choreographers Workshop in Durham,
N.C. Such workshops gave choreographers a springboard for their
work in countries where modern dance was just developing.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one in the biennial has imitated American dance, the
experimental choreographers (and that includes the protest genre)
exhibit a firm knowledge of international trends.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, ``Murs-Murs de la Mediterranee,'' which speaks of violence
and hopelessness among Algerian youth at home and in French
immigrant slums, has some affinity with works by black American
choreographers like Talley Beatty. Raza Hammadi, one of the
choreographers, was a longtime disciple of Matt Mattox, the veteran
American jazz-dance teacher who worked in France for 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   The piece, presented by Ballet Jazz Art Productions (a modern
dance group), and ``Faster than the Wind,'' a work in which Elhadi
Cheriffa, former artistic director of the National Ballet of
Algeria, creates images of exodus, are less illustrative than
abstract or symbolic. ``Murs-Murs,'' which incorporates hip-hop,
ballet, jazz and modern dance, is a series of vignettes, some
uneven.
</P>
<P>
   But it pulls no punches. By the end, a traditional but
relatively free society is taken over by black-robed
fundamentalists who rush in to pray repeatedly and mechanically. A
government official, symbolized by a uniformed man who becomes the
puppet of a fundamentalist, is not left blameless. The walls
(``murs'') of the title are screens moved around to change spatial
relationships. They symbolize North African architecture and the
walls of French ghettos, against which the young people beat their
fists.
</P>
<P>
   This is a strong, moving piece whose sophistication comes from
its team of collaborators, the Algerian film director Belkacem
Hadjadj; the company's co-directors, Hammadi and Cherif Chikh, and
two other choreographers, Brahim Arbia and Sadok Khechana. The work
could use some editing, but its raw verve expresses strong opinions
about issues that most Americans, at least, know little about.
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme is a double bill, ``EJM 1-EJM 2,'' created
for the Lyons Opera Ballet by Frederic Flamand, a Belgian who has
never been a dancer but has used movement in his multimedia
Conceptual spectacles in Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   This latest work, which has no Mediterranean connection but is
an excuse to include the Lyons Opera Ballet in the biennial, is
easier to admire than to like. The inspiration, albeit calculated,
comes from the movement analysis and early photographic experiments
of two pioneers with the same initials and the same life span
(1830-1904).
</P>
<P>
   Eadweard James Muybridge, an American, is best known for his
filmstrip motion studies of horses and nude men or women walking or
performing domestic tasks. Etienne-Jules Marey, a French physician,
used his knowledge of physiology in his photography and in
efficiency studies.
</P>
<P>
   Flamand's collaborators, the American architects Elizabeth
Diller and Ricardo Scofidio, have created a mixed-media
installation with a mobile video camera. The interplay of filmed
images and live dancers is a super-polished version of older
techniques. Part I of the work, ``EMJ1,'' performed by Flamand's
company Charleroi-Plan K, uses Muybridge's ideas as a springboard
to question the veracity of contemporary images. Yes, the camera
can lie.
</P>
<P>
   The camera tricks are fascinating but the choreography too
simple. However, Part II, ``EMJ2,''the Marey section, which will be
performed later independently by the Lyons Opera Ballet, is an
updated machine dance of the 1930s. This time, a giant computerized
figure on a screen orders an assembly line of dancers to imitate
its movements. The choreography was reportedly created by the
dancers. Hence its energetic and descriptive attention to detail. A
high-tech production that questions high-tech has its virtues, even
if it goes on too long.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the experimental Spanish choreographer Vicente Saez
used repetition too often but his essay on Spanish and Indian
mysticism, ``Lilah or God's Game,'' shows his sure touch in
structure and idiom.
</P>
<P>
   The mixed-bag approach was dominant in the work of Israeli
companies recently seen in the United States. Barak Marshall's
pieces were notable mainly for their high energy, and the Batsheva
Dance Company's ``Anaphase,'' by Ohad Naharin, has been the hit of
the festival so far.
</P>
<P>
   Tradition has been represented by La Tannoura, whirling
dervishes from Cairo. The flamenco dancers Antonio Canales and,
especially, Antonio El Pipa, have shown a creative edge. On to
``The Silk Road,'' the theme of the next Lyons Dance Biennial.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: SHALL THE PENITENT SINNER PASS?
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Sept. 27.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``None of us in this room are perfect,'' a grand
juror told Monica Lewinsky on Aug. 20, three days after President
Clinton had finally 'fessed up to what he termed ``inappropriate
contact'' with the young witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only difference between my age and when I was your age is
now I get up faster,'' the unidentified juror went on to say. ``If
I make a mistake and fall, I get up and brush myself off.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr's massive document dump to the Congress makes it
quite evident he was never of a mind to allow Clinton to get up,
brush himself off and serve out the final two years of his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, many Americans appear ready to give the
brush-off to the relentless independent counsel. When it comes to
Clinton, they may see some troubling ``misdemeanors,'' but no
genuine ``high crimes'' that would justify his ouster. Why?
</P>
<P>
   As some psychobabble artists would have it, Clinton, as the
nation's first Baby Boomer leader, gets off the hook because he
reflects a generation that lacks a clear moral compass. But, if
that's so, why is church attendance among Americans aged 40 to 60
on the rise?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps further revelations will make most folks, including
Boomers, only too glad to see Clinton go. Indeed, by the time
Congress completes a full inquiry, such a scenario could play
itself out.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, however, more than three out of five voters
agree with Clinton that ``it's time to move on.'' If those polls
stand up, and if the November elections focus on Starr's fierce sex
police, then Clinton could wind up lighting another cigar to mark
his escape from impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, precisely because Clinton remains in such big trouble,
he has, in the minds of some people, become more ``real'' _ and a
more sympathetic figure.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Clinton took the presidency by default, with a
plurality of the popular vote, because George Bush, his Republican
opponent, had run out of ideological gas after becoming political
road kill for Pat Buchanan and Ross Perot. In 1996, a time of peace
and prosperity, Clinton won re-election because most Americans
thought Bob Dole lacked a presidential aura.
</P>
<P>
   But neither those elections nor Clinton's cautious centrist
approach to governance won him the kind of devoted personal
following once enjoyed by such other multi-term presidents as
Franklin Roosevelt, Dwight Eisenhower or Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   It's simply amazing what a president can do to lift people's
attention spans by breaking a couple of biblical commandments. The
mainstream media, which not so long ago saw Clinton as a boring
figure in a boring capital, offers up intense coverage of his
imperiled presidency. On balance, viewers like what they see.
</P>
<P>
   As Starr's grand jury wound up its work with Lewinsky, the
forelady offered her ``a bouquet of good wishes that includes luck,
success, happiness and blessings.'' Whereupon, Monica began to sob.
</P>
<P>
   If, as one suspects, Clinton is looking for some good cards to
play, he could do worse than to similarly embrace the role of a
penitent sinner. Then, after a good cry all around, he might just
win yet another free pass.

 &HT;    UT dormitory offers substance-free option
 &HT;    By Rebeca Rodriguez
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Beginning this year, students entering the
University of Texas have a unique housing option: One that is
alcohol-, tobacco- and drug-free.
</P>
<P>
   The 10th floor of the Jester East dormitory has been declared a
substance-free floor, where students agree to live healthy, without
alcohol or smokes. The Wellness floor was inspired by students and
other residents who pointed out that not everyone comes to college
to get falling-down drunk, said Daniel Ostick, residence
coordinator. The program, which stresses mental and physical
health, is modeled loosely on programs at other schools, like the
University of Illinois and Indiana University.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in front of a laptop computer in one of the floor's
study rooms, freshman Cecilia Gonzales said the she likes not
having to live with the crazy rowdiness that permeates other
floors. She said she has made some good friends who share her
values of not drinking and concentrating on studies.
</P>
<P>
   Students who choose to live on the Wellness floor must sign a
form saying they agree not to smoke or drink, even if they are of
legal age. They also acknowledge that breaking the rules could lead
to disciplinary action. The university's standard policies toward
illegal substance use still apply.
</P>
<P>
   Ruston Taylor, a junior and the floor's resident assistant, said
he also tries to help students on the floor understand the value of
exercise, knowledge of other cultures and being healthy in all
aspects of life. ``It's a whole-person kind of thing,'' Taylor
said.
</P>
<P>
   About 92 students, mostly freshman, live on the floor. About 11
rooms on the floor contain students who have not signed the
Wellness floor agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which does not cost extra, is a way to give
students, especially freshman, some ground rules, said James Vick,
UT vice president for student affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Vick said the university plans to keep the program on the 10th
floor of Jester East next year, although a growing interest among
students could eventually prompt an expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Some students riding Jester's many elevators had never heard of
the Wellness floor, while others had only a vague notion. Erich
Gross, an aerospace engineering freshman, said he knows one
Wellness floor resident, but said it's not the lifestyle for him.
``I think it's extreme,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For freshman Nadeem Poonawala, the idea seemed extreme at first
too. ``It was my parents' idea,'' he said. ``It was either live
here or at home,'' said Poonawala, who is from Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I was hostile to the idea,'' said Poonawala, who quit
smoking while living on the floor, ``but now it's not so bad.''

 &HT;    Republicans &AMP; Democrats
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ With the Republicans and Democrats shamelessly
tearing at each other's throats in Washington, it's good to recall
the fundamental differences between these distinct political
species.
</P>
<P>
   The following list from the Sterling Bulletin was compiled long
before Bill Clinton invented New Democrats, which is makes
identification more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these identification hints need to be updated. Some are
still valid.
</P>
<P>
   _Democrats buy most of the books that have been banned
somewhere. Republicans form censorship committees and read them in
a group.
</P>
<P>
   (This one can be updated by noting that Republicans are the ones
who release prurient material for public consumption when the
prurience is committed by Democrats.)
</P>
<P>
   _Republicans consume three-fourths of all the rutabaga produced
in this country. The remainder is thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   (This hint is still valid.)
</P>
<P>
   _Republicans usually wear hats and almost always clean their
paintbrushes.
</P>
<P>
   (Only the part about the paintbrushes remains helpful today.)
</P>
<P>
   _Democrats give their worn-out clothes to those less fortunate.
Republicans wear theirs.
</P>
<P>
   (Now both parties give their worn-out clothes to the less
fortunate, but only Republicans take the tax deduction.)
_Republicans employ exterminators. Democrats step on the bugs.
</P>
<P>
   (Some things never change.)
</P>
<P>
   _Democrats name their children after currently popular sports
figures, politicians and entertainers. Republican children are
named after their parents or grandparents, according to where the
most money is.
</P>
<P>
   (A lasting difference.)
</P>
<P>
   _Democrats keep trying to cut down on smoking, but are not
successful. Neither are Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   (The difference now is that Republicans solicit money from Big
Tobacco, and the Democrats take it only when it is offered.)
</P>
<P>
   _Republicans tend to keep their shades drawn, although there is
seldom any reason why they should. Democrats ought to, but don't.
</P>
<P>
   (Now both Republicans and Democrats keep their shades drawn, but
never enough since both window-peep on each other and tattle.)
</P>
<P>
   _Republicans study the financial pages of the newspaper.
Democrats put them in the bottom of the bird cage.
</P>
<P>
   (Birds aren't as popular as they once were.)
</P>
<P>
   _Most of the stuff you see alongside the road has been thrown
out of car windows by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   (Still true, but most of the superfund cleanup sites were caused
by Republicans.)
</P>
<P>
   _Republicans raise dahlias, Dalmatians and eyebrows. Democrats
raise Airedales, kids and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   (Forget the dogs.)
</P>
<P>
   _Democrats eat the fish they catch. Republicans hang them on the
wall.
</P>
<P>
   (Democrats now own the most expensive bass boats.)
</P>
<P>
   _Republican boys date Democrat girls. They plan to marry
Republican girls, but feel they're entitled to a little fun first.
</P>
<P>
   (A truism.)
</P>
<P>
   _Democrats make up plans and then do something else. Republicans
follow the plans their grandfathers made.
</P>
<P>
   (An old mainstay.)
</P>
<P>
   _Republicans sleep in twin beds _ some even in separate rooms.
That is why there are more Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   (Republicans have done a lot of sleepwalking in recent years.)

 &HT;    West Palm Beach optometrist risked his life to help Afghan
people see
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Dr. Clifford Parker has come back to
West Palm Beach from Afghanistan with two stories to tell. One is a
thrilling adventure. The other is more important, an invaluable
lesson in culture clash that nearly cost him his life.
</P>
<P>
   Parker, 54, gave up his optometry practice here 25 years ago to
help some of the world's poorest people. He could perform what
seemed like miracles against glaucoma or cataracts or myopia, but
he could do nothing to stop the ancient distrust that finally
destroyed much of what he'd helped build.
</P>
<P>
   He is left now to think about a ruined hospital and ruined
lives, about friends taken by police. He knows the end could not
have been delayed much longer: Weeks after he and nearly every
other foreigner fled the capital of Kabul, America launched cruise
missiles at the Afghan headquarters of terrorist Osama bin Laden.
Now, Iran's army is massed along the border, threatening invasion.
</P>
<P>
   And still, Parker wonders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look back and think about whether we should have done this
or that,'' he says. ``We all made mistakes. So much of what happens
is just misunderstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   It is small comfort, but Parker knows Afghanistan and the world
have misunderstood each other for centuries. Poised at the center
of Asia, Afghanistan has endured attacks from the earliest days of
empire.
</P>
<P>
   Its languages and customs bear evidence of Doctor `knew it was
what God wanted me to do' invaders from Darius to Alexander to
Brezhnev. But although it has been often occupied, it has rarely
been conquered. It is the land that made the British army's stiff
upper lip quiver, where The Man Who Would Be King lost his head.
</P>
<P>
   More than one friend thought Parker had lost his senses when he
moved there in 1973. It was not a quick or casual decision.
</P>
<P>
   Raised a Baptist, Parker held no affiliation but kept strong
faith into adulthood. After graduating from an optometry college,
he spent two years treating evacuees from Vietnam at a Tokyo field
hospital and became intrigued by the idea of overseas charitable
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it was fear or wisdom, but I came back here
instead and opened a practice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But when an old contact brought news of an ambitious eye-care
project in Afghanistan, Parker felt certain of his course. ``I had
a sense of calling,'' he said. ``I knew it was what God wanted me
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He arrived in Kabul during a brief period of tranquility and
went to work for Christian Blind Mission International, an
organization founded by a German pastor in 1909 and now supporting
eye-care programs in more than 100 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital, large and modern, stood in contrast to nearly
everything else. ``Afghanistan was and still is medieval,'' Parker
said.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was to develop an eye-care system for a country that
had none. Patients traveled for days, often on foot: nomads,
farmers, shepherds. Parker examined them, treated them, made their
eyeglasses and acted as the hospital's chief administrator while
training local doctors and nurses.
</P>
<P>
   The International Assistance Mission, an umbrella organization,
brought help from 25 other countries. ``We had Irish nurses, Swiss
nurses,'' Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital's future was determined in Moscow. A Soviet-backed
coup in 1979 forced Parker and his colleagues to evacuate. The
Russians invaded later that year. Parker returned to work for the
friend who took over his practice and waited for another overseas
assignment. It was two years before he was dispatched to Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the States in 1991 and settled back into his West
Palm Beach townhouse and his old routine. He didn't hesitate when
the call came in July 1997 to help revive the Afghanistan project.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians were gone, but Kabul was far from tranquil. The
country was convulsed by a struggle between the Taliban militia,
drawn from Sunni Moslems of the south, and the Shiite's Northern
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Bombs had destroyed the hospital, but Parker and others
converted a house into a substitute. Parker shared a two-story
house with another hospital worker. The ground floor was surrounded
by sandbags.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the bullets fly, you go downstairs,'' Parker said. ``And
when the rockets come in, you go to the basement.''
</P>
<P>
   Attacks became daily annoyances.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be outside playing volleyball, and suddenly there'd be
an airstrike,'' Parker said. ``What you worry about is the
anti-aircraft fire. The shrapnel falling on you. So you'd run
inside. Like waiting for a rain cloud to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting supplies depended on which road was open, which faction
controlled the airport, as well as the temper of local officials.
``You might find that the way to get the medicine released is to
suggest that the man's family all come in for free checkups and
eyeglasses,'' Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   The most persuasive gesture was a job. The hospital needed about
70 workers but employed twice that. Parker had no doubt that
patients and trainees were thankful for the hospital, and he began
to feel that the goodwill was spreading.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Talibs strengthened their grip on the country, and on
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   There were new rules and dire warnings. The Talibs suspected
several forms of foreign subversion, from gunrunning to
proselytizing, and warned that all would be punished severely. Male
doctors could no longer examine female patients.
</P>
<P>
   Parker felt the Talibs didn't understand the hospital's goal and
would be less hostile if they did. Although he worked for an openly
Christian organization, Parker said there was no attempt to convert
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   But as official inquiries increased, he realized this would not
be cleared up by a friendly chat. ``To the Talibs, the year was
still 1377, and the Crusades happened the day before yesterday,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, he realized that Talib questions about politics and
corruption could have serious?Xrepercussions. What if the jobs
given to officials' relatives were seen as bribes?
</P>
<P>
   Parker began to feel fear for the first time when an Afghan
co-worker whispered, ``Some people are saying bad things about
you.''
</P>
<P>
   He began to think about all the people who didn't get jobs, or
who didn't get paid as much as they wanted. The ones he had to fire
or discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a country where thousands of people still gather for
public hangings,'' Parker said. ``I began to think about that.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also a country with no American embassy. Parker's only
guidance came from other foreign agencies' officials, sharing
thoughts in the lounge at the United Nations compound.
</P>
<P>
   One day in late July, the security police took seven of Parker's
Afghan colleagues. Then the religious police searched the offices.
A senior official ordered Parker to move his staff out of Kabul. He
decided it was time to leave the country and found that other
organizations were also packing. A rented van carried him through
the Khyber Pass to Peshawar, Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks his seven colleagues were released but can't be sure.
Some fellow missionary workers have already inquired about going
back, but Parker won't join them, at least for now. He doesn't rule
out a return some day, if the politics will ever let him
concentrate on the work he set out to do 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Parker said he doesn't resent the Talibs for doing what they
believe is right.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, they're honorable people,'' he said. ``Desperate
people do desperate things.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll probably rest a while and then take a new assignment in
Jordan or New Guinea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a death wish,'' he said. ``I don't even have a
discomfort wish. But it's a rush to have a blind person see and
know that if you didn't do it, it wouldn't happen.

 &HT;    Rules on Edwards Aquifer tightened
 &HT;    By Dylan Rivera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The state's top environmental agency recently
approved new rules intended to reduce pollution in the Edwards
Aquifer, a source of drinking water for 1.75 million people and
lighting rod for debate over growth and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
   The rules extend state regulation to thousands of acres from
Georgetown to San Antonio, and they have drawn fire from builders
who say the rules are too strict and will increase the cost of
housing.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists, on the other hand, have criticized the Texas
Natural Resource Conservation Commission for not including all the
land they say needs protection and for not regulating all types of
pollution that they say need to be mitigated.
</P>
<P>
   The rules are intended to protect the Edwards Aquifer, an
underground limestone formation that feeds Barton Springs and
supplies San Antonio with its only source of drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   Conservation Commission Chairman Barry McBee said that
development in the Austin area and elsewhere indicates that the new
rules will prevent pollution of the water source.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lessons to be learned from Central Texas and in
other places,`` McBee said. ``A lesson I don't want to have to
learn is that we didn't do the right things at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   The rules extend restrictions on development to the aquifer's
contributing zone, which contains rivers and streams that flow into
the aquifer's recharge zone. Previous rules applied only to the
recharge zone, where water seeps directly into the aquifer.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules contain a large range of requirements, which vary
depending on the type of development, whether certain exemptions
apply and other factors. Among the more controversial elements are
restrictions on how much sediment can be caused by construction and
requirements that subdivisions build and maintain retention ponds
to control runoff.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations are not as stringent as Austin's Save Our
Springs ordinance, but cover a vastly broader area.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Capitol Area Builders Association, which lobbied
against the rules, estimates that compliance will increase housing
costs from $800 to $3,000 per house.
</P>
<P>
   McBee conceded that the commission does not have a study that
shows specific evidence of water-quality degradation as a result of
development in the contributing zone.
</P>
<P>
   However, research on development in Central Texas and evidence
of degradation in other watersheds indicate that some new
regulations are in order, McBee said.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Mike Krusee, who represents most of Williamson
County, said the rules will increase the cost of housing and dense
development, for uncertain environmental benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to have any impact on someone building a
mansion on five acres, but in an apartment complex where you have
middle-class working people _ that's where it's going to have the
largest impact,'' Krusee said. ``Anderson Mill-type subdivisions
are now going to be more expensive to build and buy.''
</P>
<P>
   The rules take effect June 1. Krusee said he wants to question
environmental officials during the spring legislative session about
the financial impact of the regulations.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the commission added rules encouraging
developers to limit impervious cover _ the impermeable surfaces,
such as driveways and rooftops, that cover much of a building site.
That language adopts an approach long advocated by Austin's Save
Our Springs Alliance. The rules say that developments that restrict
such cover to 20 percent can avoid other requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who would advocate that we take an
S.O.S.-like approach and just lay down a flat
impervious-cover-oriented rule,'' McBee said. ``We are not for
that, but we did concede here that as one of many options that may
be made available for development that an impervious-cover
calculation does have its place.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't satisfy the Save Our Springs Alliance, however.
Grant Godfrey, staff attorney for the alliance, said the state
should set stricter limits on nitrogen or phosphorous, which can
diminish water quality.
</P>
<P>
   The restrictions will cover all areas inside or outside city
limits, but do not apply to the entire contributing zone _ a point
that irks both developers and environmentalists. The newly
regulated territory extends from the recharge zone to the county
line in eight counties, but excludes nine counties, including Bell
and Lampasas in the Austin area.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're regulating such a marginally larger area than they
were before, it is such a tiny step,'' Godfrey said. ``What this
step means is that they want to be able to say to the public that
they've been listening, but without actually doing anything that
the public has been asking them to do.''
</P>
<P>
   McBee said the commission excluded those counties because they
tend to contain less-sensitive parts of the contributing zone and
have had less dense development than areas closer to Austin. Those
counties also don't have the political support among local elected
officials for new regulations, McBee said.
</P>
<P>
   That decision has drawn heat from environmentalists who want the
entire contributing zone regulated. And then there are opponents
like Krusee who say that excluding other counties treats Williamson
County unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   Some people in Williamson County have a different view than
Krusee, said George Gregory, president of the Ethel Barnes
Association, a group of rural homeowners who depend on the aquifer
for well water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that it wasn't representing the people's best interest
_ (Krusee's) concern was more of a tax base concern, bringing more
revenues in,'' Gregory said. ``And that rubs me wrong.

 &HT;    Like zoo elephants, Portugal doesn't forget
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI, Ohio _ When Mark Portugal was in the employ of the
Cincinnati Reds in 1996, he wasn't one of CEO Marge Schott's
favorite people.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal was far down the list behind St. Bernards and zoo
elephants.
</P>
<P>
   In the magazine article that helped get her suspended for two
years, she was quoted as saying about Portugal, ``Look at him, we
pay him $3 million and he isn't worth a damn.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal smiled slyly when he heard about the quote, muttered a
few expletives and said, ``Tell her it's $4 million. . .she doesn't
even know how much she pays her players.''
</P>
<P>
   The soon-to-be 36-year-old right-hander, signed to a $2.2
million contract for this season by the Philadelphia Phillies, held
the Reds to one hit over five innings and ended up the winner in
recent a 4-2 Philadelphia victory in front of 13,376 in Cinergy
Field.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal, who spent considerable time on the disabled list this
year, won his 10th game, giving up two runs and four hits with four
walks and six strikeouts over 7 2/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Was it a coincidence that when Schott moved from her private
glassed-in box to her first-row blue seats next to the Reds dugout
that Portugal weakened?
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight was no different from any time I pitch against the
Reds. It's no secret. I'm going to be 37 next month. I've been hurt
and I'm getting old. It's also no secret that I can still pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds avoided a shutout by scoring twice in the seventh
inning on a pair of run-scoring hits by Dmitri Young and Aaron
Boone, but even then Portugal was put in trouble when third baseman
Scott Rolen made an error on Sean Casey's hard ground ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Portugal knows how to pitch,'' Reds manager Jack McKeon said.
``He changes speed a lot and that gives us trouble. If you wait on
him and his change-up, you can get him. If you don't be patient,
he'll get you.''
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati starter Steve Parris retired the first three
Phillies, but ran into second-inning problems that put him 3-0
behind.
</P>
<P>
   Rolen led with a single and Bobby Abreu walked. Kevin Sefcik
pushed two across with a triple to right field and Sefcik scored on
Desi Relaford's fly ball.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal helped himself in the fourth by leading the inning with
a double (he has a nine-game hitting streak) and later scored on
Doug Glanville's sacrifice fly to make it 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they lost, Pittsburgh also lost, assuring the Reds
they won't finish last in the National League Central.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never thought about finishing last,'' McKeon said. ``We had
people tell us we'd lose 100 games. We're in fourth place (out of
six) and we hope to stay there if we can get some pitching and
defense in our last three games against the Pirates.''

 &HT;    Photographer captures beauty of the manatee
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chronicle books has published Manatee ($14.95), a collection of
lovely photographs by Rei Ohara. The underwater photographs of the
sea cow have that melancholy beauty we all know and love, but Ohara
has some interesting shots where his lens is half-submerged in the
water, showing the manatees underwater on the bottom half of the
picture, and Florida cypress and pine trees on the top half. The
effect is similar to those kitschy prints of marine life advertised
in every Key West shop window, but more pleasing.
</P>
<P>
   The book also puts in an entirely appropriate plea for manatee
preservation.
</P>
<P>
   On a different note, Norton is re-publishing the novels of
Iceberg Slim in its Old School Books series. Slim (real name Robert
Beck) was a pimp with a vaguely literary bent, and his novels about
The Life, including Trick Baby, achieved great popularity in the
'60s and '70s as a corollary to blaxploitation movies.
</P>
<P>
   Mama Black Widow ($13), originally published in 1969, is the
story of Otis Tilson, a black drag queen living on the fringes,
slowly descending into madness and death.
</P>
<P>
   The works of the late Mr. Beck (he died in 1992) are lurid,
melodramatic, disreputable and the absolute antithesis of the
literary books about the black experience first established by the
Harlem Renaissance and Zora Neale Hurston. He's also the
best-selling black novelist of all time. Make of that what you
will.
</P>
<P>
   SOME THINGS TO LOOK FORWARD TO . . . I mentioned last week that
it was high time someone published the screenplay of Sunset
Boulevard. I'm still waiting, but Faber &AMP; Faber is bringing out a
couple of scripts nearly as good: The Apartment and Sweet Smell of
Success. The former is the classic Billy Wilder comedy; the latter
is the Burt Lancaster/Tony Curtis movie based on Walter Winchell
and written by Clifford Odets and Ernest Lehman. It's just about
the most savage thing ever written for Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   The scripts will be published separately and be available at the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   LIVES OF THE SAINTS . . . Penguin will be offering a new series
of short biographies starting this January. The first batch of what
is called Penguin Lives, out in January, offers Larry McMurtry on
Crazy Horse and Edmund White on Proust. Other pairings are Carol
Shields on Jane Austen and Peter Gay on Mozart. The books will be
small-format hardcover, top out at around 250 pages and sell for
$19.95 each.
</P>
<P>
   QUOTE UNQUOTE . . . ``Instead of having faith, which is a
virtue, and therefore nourishes the soul and gives it a healthy
life, people merely have a lot of opinions, which excite the soul
but don't give it anything to feed it, just wear it out until it
falls over from exhaustion.'' _ Thomas Merton

 &HT;    Port of Palm Beach remains open through storm
 &HT;    By Michael Utley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVIERA BEACH, Fla. _ The Port of Palm Beach will be the only
major port in South Florida to remain open as federal authorities
shut down the Port of Miami and Port Everglades as a Hurricane
Georges-related precaution.
</P>
<P>
   The closings aren't expected to create greater shipping traffic
at the Port of Palm Beach: Its channels are too shallow to handle
many of the giant cruise and cargo vessels that frequent the larger
ports in Miami and Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   Shutting down the two ports is necessary because large ships
that are tied to a dock are more likely to sink in a major storm,
said Petty Officer Scott Carr, in the Coast Guard's Miami office.
Only a few sunken vessels would paralyze the ports, he said, making
it impossible to ship emergency supplies to storm victims.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard ordered the Port of Miami and Port Everglades to
close at 6 p.m. on September 23. The facilities are expected to
remain closed to large ships until the hurricane threat subsides.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the displaced ships will anchor offshore or head to
larger ports in Cape Canaveral, Jacksonville or Savannah, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these ships will fare better at sea than they would in
port,'' Carr said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Port of Palm Beach in Riviera Beach, shippers were
cleaning up their yards and storing equipment, just in case Georges
heads this way. But there weren't many other disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're open for business as usual,'' said Martin Metz, deputy
port director for operations. ``When you have a hurricane like
this, the ships just divert around it.''
</P>
<P>
   The only tangible effect so far on the Port of Palm Beach, said
Metz, is that a weekly oil shipment from Houston has been delayed
until the storm path becomes clear.
</P>
<P>
   Tropical Shipping &AMP; Construction Inc., the port's largest tenant
and the biggest volume shipper to the Caribbean, said Wednesday
that its operations have been disrupted but that all deliveries are
going through.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ships had to be rerouted to avoid the storm,'' said
Richard Calcote, Tropical's vice president for finance. ``That set
them back anywhere from a few hours to a day and a half.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Tropical's clients are waiting to hear about conditions
in the Caribbean before they resume shipments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got 150 T-shirts waiting to go to St. Thomas, and I don't
even know if the customer exists anymore,'' said Neal Jain, vice
president of Riviera Beach-based Simply Tropics Inc., which sells
custom-designed shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise operators at the port have so far been unaffected by the
storm. The Palm Beach Princess is undergoing maintenance in South
Carolina until Oct. 2, and the Contessa is following its normal
schedule of two coastal cruises a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may get some strong winds, but I don't think it'll be that
bad,'' said William Nurthen, chief executive of Contessa
International Cruise Line. ``We will continue to evaluate the
situation, and if it looks like it will be an uncomfortable ride,
we will begin to cancel cruises.''

 &HT;    Residents eat and wait for Hurricane Georges
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ If the storm rolls in, how will John
Alfeo tell?
</P>
<P>
   His Hurricane Grill restaurant on 25th Street has the decor of a
full-force gale. The ceiling is hung with lanterns, stools, oars
and a Cabbage Patch doll in flight. A palm tree is frozen in
mid-bend. The shutters are askew.
</P>
<P>
   There's a storm tracking chart by the cash register, but it
shows Andrew's path.
</P>
<P>
   Georges, schmorges. ``It's not coming here!'' Alfeo says.
``What's the big deal?''
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Georges is nothing but a special on the menu. Spinach
salad with grilled chicken, bacon and balsamic vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
   Alfeo's only fear is the massive lines at Costco, where he goes
to restock.
</P>
<P>
   The floor of the Hurricane Grill is a swirl of green paint, and
on the walls are murals from 1947, when the place was a bar and an
artist named Phil Brinkman swapped work for free beer.
</P>
<P>
   Brinkman painted himself in one of them _ a man sitting at a
bar, holding his hat to his head as a house and boat blow by. The
mural's bartender, hair blown back, consults a barometer and rubs
his chin. A woman, smiling, fills a glass at the tap.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a hurricane-proof building,'' Alfeo says. ``I'm
willing to serve food until the end!''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. The place is in a flood zone.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane supply check on aisle three!
</P>
<P>
   Water, yes. Batteries, yes. Eight-ounce box of milk chocolate
truffles, of course. (It was the next-to-last box.)
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Burtoff doesn't know if she'll pass the storm in her
Palm Beach home or in a hotel, but at least she'll have the
truffles and a box of Pepperidge Farm Milano cookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``In time of stress, always have chocolate,'' she says at the
Publix checkout.
</P>
<P>
   As of 11 a.m. Wednesday, the store's supply of Whitman's
Samplers is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Burke of Palm Beach strolls the candy aisle, picking
out two bags of tiny Snickers and one of Nestle Crunch. She adds
them to the box of Fig Newtons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have to get the ice cream, too!'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Two boxes of milk chocolate Dove Bars. ``No vegetables for me!''
</P>
<P>
   Sprite. ``I'm not a healthy person.''
</P>
<P>
   Two containers of Haagen-Dazs _ vanilla and cherry vanilla.
Done!
</P>
<P>
   She's new to hurricanes. She summers in Connecticut. ``I just
got home too soon this time,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Other hot hurricane sellers? Paula Stankunas leans across her
counter, her hands cupped to her mouth. ``BOOZE!''
</P>
<P>
   She's the manager of ABC Liquors on Dixie Highway. ``I guess
they figure if you're stuck at home, you might as well drink.''
</P>
<P>
   John Cassandra, the manager at the Boynton Beach Publix, reports
the same. He can tell how Georges is going by watching the flow of
customers after storm warning updates. ``The next big one is at 11
a.m.'' he says. ``Then 5 p.m.''
</P>
<P>
   (FYI: The ingredients for a ``hurricane'' are iffy. ``It's
basically a rum drink, rum and fruit juices,'' says Gloria Gould,
bartender at The Hawaiian restaurant in South Palm Beach. ``I would
use light rum and dark rum, and pineapple juice, orange juice and
grenadine.'')
</P>
<P>
   Tom Travaglini understands the storm. But he doesn't understand
what the storm is doing to his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Paula is expecting their baby boy, Adam, in four weeks, but her
doctor told her to get ready now. The low barometric pressure
during the storm can induce labor, some say.
</P>
<P>
   The maternity ward at St. Mary's Medical Center is preparing for
at least two dozen women. During Andrew, 28 showed up with their
own food and blankets. They'll get the extra beds, says Valerie
Christian, assistant patient care manager. ``I'll probably sleep in
my office.''
</P>
<P>
   Most doctors just want to make sure their patients are near. But
it does seem that the low pressure causes water breaks, Christian
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they were kidding me,'' Travaglini says.
</P>
<P>
   He is the assistant bakery manager at the Palm Beach Publix.
</P>
<P>
   In other news, he says, apple turnover sales are brisk.

 &HT;    Summer heat still upon us
 &HT;    By Mike Kelley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ September 23, said the calendar, was the first
day of fall. The high temperature in Austin was 94. The only leaves
turning were those in classrooms and public libraries where air
conditioning insures that the first frost of the season comes in
May and lasts for months.
</P>
<P>
   The overflowing cornucopias of artists' imagination, which mark
the fall and harvest time, are today reduced to plastic pumpkins
painted to look like jack o'lanterns, advertising the still-distant
Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   A maple tree, surely, would be eager for the season's change and
the chance to dress in its autumnal glory. But at Lost Maples State
Natural Area, northwest of San Antonio, the park ranger says,
``It's way too early. It's way too hot yet.''
</P>
<P>
   And up in Winnsboro, in northeastern Texas, where Autumn Trails
tours are the big attraction, the lady at the Chamber of Commerce
says the sweet gums and oaks are ``still pretty green. Maybe in
another month.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the sweet smell of smoke from the cotton gins, which used
to signal the start of school and the long-awaited beginning of
football, no longer drifts over Texas in September. The smoke came
from burning hulls _ ``burrs'' _ which farmers today plow back into
the fields for compost.
</P>
<P>
   So, for anyone wondering, ``Where is fall?'' the answer is that
Texans are a judicious lot, don't like to be rushed into something,
and will have fall when it's time for it. For now, gone are the
100-degree days of summer, and the harshness of the sun. These days
are warm and breezy and soft. Soon enough, when snow has already
begun to fall in other climes, we will have our clear, winey days
and deliciously cool nights of October.
</P>
<P>
   And if, for some reason _ El Nin(tilde)o, La Nin(tilde)a _ the
meteorological norms are out of kilter, consider that the first day
of this year's second season came with a high temperature of 64
degrees. So we will have fall, even it takes until spring to get
there.

 &HT;    McGwire/Sosa fever over?
 &HT;    By Sean McClelland
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dan O'Kane isn't a collector or a memorabilia dealer, just a
Dayton salesman who happened to have two Mark McGwire 1985 rookie
cards lying around.
</P>
<P>
   Told such items were selling for $350 in some cases, he placed a
newspaper advertisement offering each for the more reasonable price
of $115, ``the true book value,'' he says. After six days, he still
has one left.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's supposed to be the hottest thing ever and I've had two
calls in six days,'' O'Kane said, amused but frustrated. ``Maybe
nobody looks at the classifieds anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe, despite reports to the contrary, the mania surrounding
all things McGwire and Sosa has reached its zenith. After Sammy
Sosa's two recent home runs in Milwaukee, he and McGwire are tied
at 65 with four days left to crown a new single-season king.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to get caught up in the excitement, but if someone
pays $200 for a card, they should be aware that it'll be down in
value by about $50 in a year,'' cautioned Jason Young, manager of
Maverick's Baseball Card Center in Kettering.
</P>
<P>
   Maverick's had six McGwire and four Sosa rookie cards for sale
as of Wednesday afternoon. Young said McGwire's is selling for
between $140 and $200, depending on the card's condition, while
Sosa's goes for about $80.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for bargains? Young suggested perusing the Internet.
Failing that, there's always the classified section of any major
newspaper. One ad, nestled among those for Beanie Babies in the
Akron Beacon-Journal, offered a collection of McGwire cards,
including the Topps rookie release, for $750.
</P>
<P>
   For a week after McGwire eclipsed Roger Maris' record of 61 home
runs, Maverick's fielded about 200 calls a day from people looking
to buy or sell. ``Now it's down to about five or 10,'' Young said.
``When it's over, the one who ends up with the record is going to
sell a lot better than the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, let the buyer _ and the seller _ beware.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think the value is going to skyrocket,'' O'Kane said,
still holding one card. ``But everything has its limit.

 &HT;    Dell to offer custom access to Internet
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In the latest sign of the Internet's growing
influence over the personal computer industry, Dell Computer Corp.
said recently it is joining Excite Inc. and AT&AMP;T Corp. to offer
customers simple and highly personalized access to the World Wide
Web.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which uses AT&AMP;T Worldnet Service as the access to
the Web and Excite as the initial site, or portal, for customers,
is perhaps the most detailed linkage of technologies in the rapidly
changing PC industry, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very much a convergence announcement between hardware,
telecommunications and media,'' said Henry Blodget, a stock analyst
at CIBC Oppenheimer.
</P>
<P>
   Accessing the Internet is cited as a primary reason for nearly
three-fourths of computer purchases, industry analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the program, called ConnectDirect, Dell was slower
than Compaq Computer Corp. and Gateway to create Internet linkages,
but Dell officials say their program goes farther than competitors'
packages.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Bell, senior vice president of Dell's home and small
business group, said Dell's build-to-order system allows the
company to customize the system before it is shipped to the
customer. That means, for example, consumers will see news,
weather, product reviews, their horoscope and other information
tailored to their requests when they first log on to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, AT&AMP;T Worldnet's software will be installed before
shipment, sparing customers of that task and speeding their arrival
on the Internet, Bell said. Other national Internet service
providers, such as GTE, will be available to customers by next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Dell, which has been the most loyal customer of Microsoft Corp.
among the major PC makers, also for the first time offered a free
Web browser other than Microsoft's Internet Explorer. The package
includes a simplified browser created for Dell that performs basic
Web browsing and e-mail but has fewer features than Internet
Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think most customers want IE, but we know from talking to
customers, (some) want less options,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that offering a simplified browser does not signal a
change in Dell's strategy of focusing on more sophisticated
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a recognition that we have a half-million customers and
they have a range of needs,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer sales account for about 10 percent of Dell's revenue
and the company is targeting that sector more aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to broaden our base, we need to grow in all
sectors,'' said Robert Langer, director of Dell's online program in
the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to revenue from increased business, each participant
in the agreement expects to benefit from the joint branding that
ConnectDirect offers when their names appear together on the
customers' screens, executives of the companies and analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   While terms of the agreements were not disclosed, Dell likely
will receive payments from the other companies for every Dell
customer that follows the ConnectDirect script, industry sources
said. They also said Dell may receive payments based on advertising
that Excite is able to sell on the customized pages.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to adding other Internet service providers to the
package, Dell will team with SBC Communications Inc. to push the
use of technology that allows existing phone lines to offer
data-moving speeds 30-50 times faster than a 56-kilobyte modem.
</P>
<P>
   Known as asymmetrical digital subscriber line, or ADSL, the
technology is not expected to be offered widely to SBC customers in
Texas until sometime next year, a spokesman for SBC Communications
said.
</P>
<P>
   In California, where the SBC-owned Pacific Bell already offers
ADSL, the service costs about $89 a month in addition to a one-time
installation fee of $324, the spokesman said.

 &HT;    Paralyzed father helps son push through injury
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like at every high or low point in his life, Lonnie Woodard
turned to his father the day his right leg was twisted into an
L-shape on the football field.
</P>
<P>
   Woodard's father, Lonnie Sr., remembers the day well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called me while he was sitting on the trainer's table,''
Lonnie Woodard Sr. said of his son, a Dunbar High School graduate
and reserve defensive lineman for No. 1 ranked Ohio State. ``The
first thing he told me was, 'Daddy, they're cutting these expensive
shoes off me _ and these expensive shorts.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, 'Lonnie, look: Like me, they aren't thinking about the
expensive equipment. They're thinking about you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Once the graveness of the injury _ three torn knee ligaments and
a dislocated knee cap _ struck the younger Woodard, his spirits
sank: ``I told him, 'You can come back from that,' '' his father
said. ``And he said, 'I'll never play again.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Woodard, a 6-2, 263-pound OSU sophomore, smiles at his father's
recollection of that devastating day 14 months ago. It's much
easier to smile now that the injury which kept him sidelined all of
last season is nearly healed and he's back on the football field.
</P>
<P>
   He only wishes his father's injuries could heal as quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Lonnie Sr. is severely paralyzed. He spends most of his time in
a hospital bed in the middle of the Woodard's dining room in their
West Dayton home. The only time he gets up or out, his family says,
is when an ambulance arrives to take him to the doctor or young
Lonnie comes home and lifts him from the bed and carries him to a
living room chair or onto the front porch for some fresh air .
</P>
<P>
   It's been this way for much of the last four years, Woodard's
wife, Betty said, since complications after a pinched nerve surgery
left him paralyzed. Insurance initially paid for homecare and
therapy but no more, she said. Now Betty must wake at 3 a.m. each
weekday morning to feed and medicate her husband and prepare his
lunch before she heads to her job in the shipping department at the
Veterans Administration Medical Center a few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   Until she returns home at 3 p.m., her husband often remains
alone. A television screen with a view of the Woodard's front porch
enables him to monitor the door and a larger-screen TV keeps him
entertained with music and shows. A telephone, tissues, various
medications and a list of important phone numbers sit within his
reach on a tray near his bed.
</P>
<P>
   Although remarkably pleasant and high-spirited, the senior
Woodard, a former Dunbar football player and Meadowdale Pee-Wee
coach, gets frustrated with his immobility, his family says. When
his son's 1984 white Corvette broke down during a visit home
earlier this week, for example, Woodard could only dispense advice
over the telephone rather than run out to help. And traveling to
Columbus to attend Ohio State games or just to have dinner with his
son is out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems content to watch (the games) on TV, but I know he'd
be thrilled to go see little Lonnie play,'' his wife said.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it was Woodard Sr. who encouraged his son to follow
his dream and attend Ohio State. An All-City offensive lineman in
high school, the younger Woodard received scholarship offers from
some Mid-American Conference schools and several service academies,
he said. Schools such as Ohio State and Michigan showed interest
but told him he was too small to play on the offensive line. If
he'd walk on as a defensive lineman, they said, he'd be welcome.
</P>
<P>
   As a walk on for the Buckeyes, Woodard does not receive athletic
scholarship money and spends each practice on the ``scout team,''
football's equivalent of the punching bag. It is the scout team's
job to simulate as best as possible the opponent's game plan for
the starters to face in practice.
</P>
<P>
   Woodard, who got a chance to play in OSU's 49-0 blowout against
Toledo Sept. 12, doesn't mind the job _ for now. His goal, of
course, is to earn a spot on the Buckeyes' starting roster. His
coaches say that's within his reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed at how he's come back,'' OSU defensive line coach
Jim Heacock said. ``Usually when you come back from an injury like
that, you're a little bit hesitant. But from the day we started
fall camp, he gave no indication of any fear or any hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real high on Lonnie. As a person, his effort and attitude,
they're as good as it gets. I wouldn't count him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodard said he would not have made it back without the support
of Heacock, OSU teammates Joe Montgomery and Jerry Redmond, both of
whom have suffered similar knee injuries, and of course, his
father.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was just my total inspiration,'' he said. ``All the
things he's been through? Compared to him, I've been through
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodard's own rehabilitation as well as his father's condition
have inspired him to consider pursuing a degree in physical
therapy. But Woodard also hasn't lost sight of trying to make good
on a prediction his father made a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father told me in high school that Ohio State would win a
national championship in my career,'' he said. ``He might be
right.''

 &HT;    Intel to open Austin chip center
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Now Austin really has Intel inside.
</P>
<P>
   Intel Corp., the world's largest and richest semiconductor
company, is opening a site in Austin where engineers will design
microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has has reported slower sales this year, Intel is
still the dominant maker of the chips that power personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Texas Development Center, the Austin operation will
be one of seven such Intel sites throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   Intel declined to say how many employees it would have at the
center. Design centers usually involve teams of engineers that can
be very small or range up to hundreds of people. Somerset, the
best-known chip design center in Austin, had peak employment of
more than 300 designers and other workers. Intel recruited Mark
McDermott to head the operation. McDermott was in charge of the
Somerset project, where IBM Corp. and Motorola Inc. design PowerPC
chips for Apple Computer Corp.'s Macintosh computers. Motorola took
sole control of Somerset earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott's first job will be to determine what the center will
work on and to hire engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's announcement comes as Motorola is expected to cut jobs
in its continuing efforts to regain profitability in its chip
business.
</P>
<P>
   Intel said one of the primary reasons for creating the Austin
center was the availability of McDermott, a well-regarded design
project leader. Others, however, noted that this appears to be a
good time for picking up Motorola engineers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, Austin is a very ripe source for any company that
wants to aggressively recruit to staff a complex logic design
center (for processors and other chips),'' said Kim Butler, a
high-tech job recruiter. ``It's no secret that Motorola is looking
at further cutbacks and it looks like they are going to be pretty
deep.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Zieber, president of Pathfinder Research, a San Jose,
Calif. semiconductor market research firm, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chip designers are a scarce resource when you are looking for
the really good guys and Austin has a lot of (good design)
people,'' he said, ``And it's not a bad area to live. It's a
natural place for Intel to expand. It's also a natural place to
raid Motorola.''
</P>
<P>
   Motorola, AMD Inc. and Cirrus Logic Inc. have substantial design
operations in Austin. In addition, more than a dozen satellite
design centers and start-up companies are designing chips in the
area.
</P>
<P>
   AMD's Austin operations are contributing to the design of the K7
chip, its next-generation competitor to Intel's chips. Even though
Austin may be one of the world's leading chip design centers
outside California's Silicon Valley, Intel's arrival gives it a
boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel is the biggest semiconductor company in the world,''
said Will Strauss, analyst for Forward Concepts technology market
research in Tempe, Ariz. ``This lends more prestige to Austin. You
could call it the Intel seal of approval.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides access to Austin's talent, the center brings it closer
to key customers Dell Computer Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp.,
Butler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something I've expected for a long time,'' Butler said
of Intel's move. ``I'm surprised it took them this long.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel has had its own problems this year. It has said it would
cut 3,000 jobs this year. On Wednesday, it cut 675 of its 1,600
workers at its plant in Hudson, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The company's shares closed up $3.50 to $87.06 1/4 on Wednesday.
McDermott will report to Albert Yu, Intel's senior vice president
for the microprocessor products group.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a super technology manager,'' Yu said of McDermott this
week. ``I am excited to have him on board.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a fun place to work,'' said McDermott, an
11-year veteran of Motorola, who also worked briefly for Cyrix
Corp. in the early 1990s. ``It will be a great place to work. We
will do state-of-the-art, leading-edge work. And no BS.''
</P>
<P>
   Yu said it may take a few months to determine the right role for
the Austin center. Intel operates processor design centers at its
Santa Clara, Calif., headquarters, in Portland, Ore., Folsom,
Calif., Chandler, Ariz., DuPont, Wash., and Haifa, Israel.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't Intel's first presence in Austin. When it acquired
Digital Equipment Corp.'s semiconductor business this year, Intel
also acquired Digital's small Austin design center for StrongARM
microcontrollers.
</P>
<P>
   Both StrongArm and the new design center will be at 5000 Plaza
on the Lake on Loop 360.

 &HT;    Insurance agencies stop new coverage for storm
 &HT;    By John Murawski
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like most major insurance carriers, State Farm Fire and Casualty
stops writing new home and auto policies when a hurricane watch has
been posted.
</P>
<P>
   Some Floridians didn't find out until it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a few people calling who haven't paid their bills,
and their policies lapsed a long time ago,'' said agent Doug Bohner
of State Farm, the state's largest home insurer with more than a
million homes covered.
</P>
<P>
   State Farm wasn't alone. If you live in an area where you think
you might need insurance within a few days, you probably can't get
it. Most companies stopped writing new policies in South Florida by
Sept. 23. And one company _ Nationwide Mutual, the state's
third-largest home insurer with about 240,000 policies _ suspended
writing new policies for the entire state on Sept. 22.
</P>
<P>
   But as the new-policies arm of the insurance industry ground to
a halt, emergency preparations went into full-throttle. Armies of
claims adjustors are getting ready to swoop into the state to
survey the damage left by Hurricane Georges. Major insurers set up
``induction units'' to handle the arrival of the adjustors and to
deploy mobile claims-processing centers in areas hammered by
Georges.
</P>
<P>
   The desperate few calling Bohner at his Boca Raton office were
slated to be transferred to the Florida Residential Property and
Casualty Joint Underwriting Association and the Florida Windstorm
Underwriting Association, the state-created insurers of last resort
commonly known as the JUA and the windstorm pool.
</P>
<P>
   But they were out of luck there, too. Those insurers stopped
writing new policies at 1 a.m. Wednesday, when Hurricane Georges
crossed into an area known as ``the box.'' When a tropical storm or
hurricane blows into the box _ stretching from the Gulf of Mexico
to the Dominican Republic and from North Carolina to Honduras _ the
JUA won't issue new policies.
</P>
<P>
   Allstate Floridian, the second-largest home insurer with about
625,000 policies, also freezes writing new policies during
hurricane watches and warnings, though most Florida homeowners
won't be affected. That's because neither Allstate nor State Farm
have written new policies in Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade
counties for years.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies, though, started amassing claims adjustors
Wednesday who'll assess the damage wrought by Georges once the
hurricane passes. State Farm's induction center near the Orlando
airport will handle adjustors from the company's 2,000-member
National Catastrophic Team.
</P>
<P>
   Allstate has put 1,000 adjustors on standby nationwide and has
sent an advance team of 100 to Miami and St. Petersburg to begin
making preparations. Allstate also is moving three mobile claims
centers to Orlando. From there, they'll be sent to areas damaged by
Georges.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of power failures, State Farm agents also are
making backup copies of their computer files and printing out all
policies on paper. Bohner's office started printing out 7,000
policies on Sept. 22.

<P>
   Karen Jacobs didn't panic in August 1992 when Hurricane Andrew
built up a running start in the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was walking around in a dream world, you know, baking
cakes,'' said Jacobs, 48, a resident of the Country Walk
subdivision southwest of Miami. ``What's the worst, you know, the
AC could go off?''
</P>
<P>
   The air conditioning did go off. So did part of the roof and one
wall.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, instead of icing cakes, Jacobs was covering windows
to prepare for Hurricane Georges. But oddly, only the windows on
the east side.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs partial reaction typefies, under one rebuilt roof, the
two currents of thought in Country Walk.
</P>
<P>
   Some homeowners have covered every opening but the front door.
Others, either for lack of time or interest, haven't touched a
hammer.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs also spoke for Country Walk back in 1992. Television's
Nightline program interviewed her family to put a human face on its
Andrew coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Country Walk's aerial profile _ street upon street of roofs
looking like scattered matchsticks _ became a familiar site to
Americans. But those ghostly photos had no people in them.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 1,000-plus homes in Country Walk were partially or
totally destroyed. Homeowners blamed the builder, Arvida, for
shoddy construction; the company later paid four-figure settlements
to each homeowner without admitting wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Jacobs' neighbor suffered the most damage on the
street, judging by Jacobs' photo collection. The same house had no
shutters or plywood on its windows Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The owner knows the risk. She was here in 1992, the owner's
brother said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said she's letting the insurance company take care of
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs said she assumed the strongest winds would come from the
east so that's where she put her shutters. Then Gary Putty, a
neighbor showed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a Category 3,'' said Putty, a contractor who lives
across the street, ``you're going to have to do the whole house.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The front, too?'' Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oy.''

 &HT;    Florida's Delray Beach Tennis Center named to host Davis Cup
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke and Chuck McGinness
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH _ Haul out the flags and practice the U-S-A
chants.
</P>
<P>
   The Delray Beach Tennis Center was named to host the loudest and
most emotional event in professional tennis: the Davis Cup final.
It's the only time tennis fans can let their passion override their
manners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not go, (John) McEnroe! It's go USA!'' said tennis center
manager Brahm Dubin. ``The chill you get ... it's unbelievable.
It's like the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   But first, the United States must beat Italy, and Sweden must
defeat Spain in this weekend's semifinals for the United States to
host the year's biggest international tennis event. Top Americans
aren't playing this round, but the U.S. remains favored. Spain and
Sweden are fairly evenly matched.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day final round will begin Dec. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can say this is the Super Bowl of tennis,'' said
Pam Gerig, executive director of the Palm Beach County Sports
Commission, which helped Delray Beach outbid New Orleans and Fort
Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Delray Beach was chosen _ despite submitting a bid just three
weeks ago _ because of its world-class tennis facilities, the
county's commitment and the business community's support, said Russ
Cline, Davis Cup producer for the United States Tennis Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bid and this enthusiasm that we felt from down there ...
There's no place we can be that would be better than Palm Beach
County and the Delray Beach Tennis Center,'' Cline said.
</P>
<P>
   USTA officials predict the final to bring $13 million to $15
million into the county, Gerig said. The county's Convention and
Visitor's Bureau has agreed to cover half of the $200,000 cost of
hosting it. City and county officials are looking for sponsors to
pay the remainder.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a fair amount of heat the last few years, and
this is the moment we want to enjoy for a few minutes,'' Dubin
said. ``I usually don't get overwhelmed, and I'm just
overwhelmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Tickets will not go on sale until about a week after this
weekend's results are known. Tickets will cost from $90 to $450 for
three-day passes. Single-day tickets will not be sold unless the
three-day passes to the 8,200-seat stadium do not sell out.
</P>
<P>
   Landing the Davis Cup final is the biggest thing to happen at
the tennis center, which opened five years ago to host the
now-defunct Virginia Slims of Florida tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's telling me we created a facility which has a reputation
that's noteworthy to tennis professionals, the tennis public and
tennis promoters,'' Delray Beach Mayor Jay Alperin said.
</P>
<P>
   The $5.8 million venue has lost money the past three years: In
1995, it lost $128,828; in 1996, $56,476; and last year, $127,447.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders said an event such as the Davis Cup finals will
help the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're going to have people here buying knick-knacks
and things in our stores, eating in our restaurants. You're going
to have people staying in hotels throughout Palm Beach County,''
said Bill Wood, president of the Delray Beach Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, three days of international television coverage on
ESPN and other channels could help the city attract other
tournaments and events to the center, local leaders said.

 &HT;    Alcohol deaths spur anti-drinking effort
 &HT;    By Christian Davenport and Rebeca Rodriguez
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Chad Connally remembers what partying at
Southwestern University used to be like.
</P>
<P>
   ``My freshman year you could walk into a place and there would
be beer and alcohol everywhere,'' said Connally, a senior who is
the student body president. ``We got hammered.''
</P>
<P>
   By its own admission, the administration looked the other way
when it came to much of the drinking on campus. Without fear of
getting caught, students partied to relieve stress, get drunk, and
have the kind of mindless fun that sharing a bunch of beers with
100 of your closest friends can provide after a week of pounding
the books.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at one of the state's oldest universities, that's all
changing.
</P>
<P>
   Like colleges and universities across the country that fear the
horrific tales of fraternity hazing and stories of students
literally drinking themselves to death, the administration at
Southwestern University is cracking down on drinking this year as
no time before.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us want to believe there is this magic glass bubble
over us,'' Mike Leese, Southwestern's vice president for
Residential Services, told a student meeting Tuesday. ``We did look
the other way for too long, and we can't do that any more.''
</P>
<P>
   A grand illustration of the administration's new dedication to
enforcing the law and its own policy came last week, when the Kappa
Sigma fraternity held its weekly ``Study Break'' party, a
university tradition that fraternity members said goes back 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   But this time there were several uninvited guests: eight law
enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
   In an unprecedented raid, police arrested one student, charging
him with providing alcohol to minors, cited 49 minors with
possession of alcohol, and set off a wave of student fury that
climaxed in a student-organized meeting Tuesday in the student
commons.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the campus' 1,200 students showed up to air their
concerns with what they thought was an illegal and unnecessary
crackdown at a small, cozy private college known more for its
staunch church spires and vaunted academic reputation than for its
parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much does the university care about its student body when
you're organizing sting operations?'' asked one student to
resounding applause.
</P>
<P>
   But university officials say that's precisely why they're
enforcing the drinking rules more than before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to let one of you go into an alcoholic coma and
die,'' said Deborah Brown, Southwestern's chief of police, at the
student meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a student at Louisiana State University died after a
night of drinking when he pledged Sigma Alpha Epsilon. His
blood-alcohol level was 0.588, nearly six times the legal limit for
intoxication. And last September a Massachusetts Institute of
Technology freshman died after a night of heavy drinking at Phi
Gamma Delta, an MIT fraternity which has since been shut down.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a wake-up call for people in student affairs,'' said
Sherri Babcock, Southwestern's dean of students. She said that last
year for the first time she can remember, two of her students were
hospitalized for alcohol poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   Death from drinking, while so harrowing and tragic that it grabs
the media's attention, is also relatively rare. What also worry
Babcock and other academics are the more common and less
talked-about problems: Drunken trysts that lead to rape or the
spread of sexually transmitted diseases, driving while intoxicated,
and lapses in judgment that spur normally responsible students to
jump off cliffs or ride on the top of speeding cars.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring a Southwestern student who had been drinking jumped
off a cliff into a swimming hole and drowned. In 1995, a University
of Texas student drowned in the Colorado River after a night of
drinking games.
</P>
<P>
   The mounting student death toll has prompted Southwestern and
other universities across the country to re-evaluate their alcohol
policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a trend nationwide,'' said Nancy Schulte, the
coordinator of drug education services at George Mason University
in Virginia. Referring to the John Belushi movie, she said, ``We're
trying to bury 'Animal House,' and that is going to take some
time.''
</P>
<P>
   That state's attorney general, Mark Earley, sent out brochures
to all freshmen at public schools detailing the dangers of alcohol
abuse, including the deaths last year of five Virginia students.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Southwest Texas State University in San Marcos, a
campus with more than 21,000 students, was known as a party school.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came here (24 years ago), that was the kind of
tradition and reputation the school had,'' said John Garrison,
assistant vice-president and dean of students. ``But that's not the
reputation we want.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, SWT president Jerome Supple sent a letter to all
faculty and staff outlining plans for a sweeping alcohol education
program to change that image. Beginning this fall, all student
leaders must attend workshops on alcohol education and pass that
information on to members. Officials also are distributing an
interactive CD-ROM called Alcohol 101 that teaches students how to
recognize their drinking limits and deal with peer pressure.
</P>
<P>
   In the classroom, faculty are being asked to help change the
school's Thursday-night drinking tradition by giving tests on
Fridays. And at the football stadium, the university is drawing up
a policy to regulate tailgate parties at football games, where
underage and excessive drinking frequently occurs.
</P>
<P>
   A more comprehensive campaign may not eradicate heavy drinking,
but it could help to avoid tragedies like the LSU and MIT drinking
deaths of last year, Garrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller schools, like Lutheran-based Concordia University, say
bigger campuses tend to have more problems with heavy drinking. Of
Concordia's 750 enrolled students, only about 230 live on campus.
When students do go drinking, they look after each other, said
William Driskill, vice-president of student services.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Concordia has no fraternities or sororities cuts
down on heavy drinking, Driskill said, but it still exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students at this age are in the experimental stage, no matter
what their background,'' he said. ``Somebody would be naive to
think a religious school will cure alcohol abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   At St. Edward's University, drinking is allowed only in private
rooms, not in the common areas of dorms, said Dennis Poust, a
spokesman for the university.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of the St. Edward's community plays a role in the
lowered incidence of excessive drinking. Of the 3,400-strong
student population, fewer than 1,000 live on campus. And for those
that do, there are no fraternities or sororities to throw wild
bashes at the Catholic institution.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no alcohol-related deaths or sexual assaults in
recent memory, Poust said. ``Our alcohol policies seem to be
working fairly well.''
</P>
<P>
   At Southwestern, officials in 1993 banned kegs, beer-filled
party balls, and ``trash can punch.'' Hard liquor is also not
allowed to be served on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Students are required to keep a guest list of all party
attendees, and parties where alcohol is to be served must get prior
approval from the dean of students. If approval is granted, the
hosts must ensure only those 21 or older are drinking alcohol, and
the hosts must provide nonalcoholic beverages for minors.
</P>
<P>
   All 378 first-year students were taken on an orientation retreat
where they were briefed on the university's strict policy, said
Dean Babcock. Chief Brown was there to hold a session on the
drinking laws. The chief also addressed the student government,
three of the four campus fraternities, and a council of fraternity
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We warned and warned them,'' Babcock said
</P>
<P>
   And last week's raid sent the message that the university is
serious about underage drinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fraternities are more concerned with not getting trouble,''
said Charles Boehm, a 20-year-old junior and a member of Phi Delta
Theta.
</P>
<P>
   While the enforcement of the rules may be stricter, he said, the
rate of students drinking remains the same. Only now, drinking has
moved off campus and is more clandestine, he said. ``The strict
rules are just making it more illicit.''

 &HT;    Killer cuisines
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A dark and stormy night. Glass breaking. A thud.
</P>
<P>
   A figure flees, leaving behind a plate of roast venison loin; a
body, and worse: a prized magnum of '28 Bordeaux shattered.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. The chef/caterer/gourmet is on the scene, solving
the crime _ and reciting a recipe for the venison's sauce, as well
as finding a new source for the Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
   That's the idea behind culinary mysteries, one of the hottest
genres to hit the whodunits in years, according to Otto Penzler,
owner of The Mysterious Bookshop in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Penzler, whose store specializes in crime stories, says the
books are the mystery-genre-du-jour. ``They sell wonderfully well _
almost relentlessly.''
</P>
<P>
   The books have chefs or other food pros somehow embroiled in a
crime, with lots of cooking as the plot twists.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Cut (Bantam Books), on The New York Times bestseller list,
was written by Diane Mott Davidson, a Colorado author considered
tops in the culinary mysteries. She has seven others to her credit.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of the other writers, who have a food writing
background, she came to the genre as a mystery writer. Her first
book, Catering to No One, however, took an unexpected food turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started writing my story in the Evergreen (Colo.) Cafe,
where I met this caterer. I put her in the story, and my critique
group liked her so much, they suggested I make her the
protagonist,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With a caterer as lead character, food had to follow, so
Davidson volunteered to work free with a local caterer to learn the
business. She had an interest in upscale cooking, but had never
worked in the business. ``It was very, very hard work. People have
no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldy Shultz, caterer cum sleuth, is now her main character. ``I
try to get across how tough it is'' being a caterer, Davidson said.
With each new plot, Davidson works with the real caterer, still at
no charge, cooking, serving at events _ and taking copious notes.
</P>
<P>
   The job is perfect for her protagonist, she said, since Goldy
can go into all kinds of settings. ``She's catering at a ski resort
in the one I'm writing now.''
</P>
<P>
   Other authors bring a food background to their writing.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Richman is the restaurant reviewer and food writer for
The Washington Post. Writing her witty 1997 book, The Butter Did It
(Harper Paperbacks), was a fantasy come true, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The book, about the death of a highbrow chef catering a Capitol
charity event, has inside foodie tidbits tossed in for spice. Savvy
readers can read about the chefs she favors in real life
(Jean-Louis Palladin, Patrick O'Connell and Robert Donna) and may
recognize the ones she doesn't (she won't tell). Her protagonist is
a sassy food reviewer, Chas Wheatley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd always wanted to write mysteries. I've been doing food
reviewing and food editing for 22 years,'' she said. ``People don't
realize how tedious it is to write about the same thing day after
day. One more `crisp and juicy' . . . The vocabulary gets so
tiresome. In the mysteries, I'm getting to use a whole new
vocabulary, or use old words in new way.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't fun being on the receiving end of a review.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a newspaper review in the Midwest that tore me to
shreds,'' she said. ``My first reaction was, this is personal _ a
personal attack. Then I thought, this is exactly the way a chef
feels when I review his restaurant. I know I'm not writing a
personal attack, but when it happens to you, well . . .''
</P>
<P>
   The foods she mentions are ones she's eaten in restaurants, and
the chefs are based on real-life chefs and restaurateurs, too, she
said. ``Fortunately, most of them didn't recognize themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Culinary mysteries have a history _ Rex Stout put his gourmet
detective Nero Wolfe to work in the late '30s, and Robert Parker
still has his Spenser tantalizing readers today. Virginia Rich was
first to include recipes in her Eugenia Potter books in the '80s;
now they all have them.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes range from the gourmet chocolate-hazelnut calzone in
Richman's book to the simple but tasty Boston baked beans in Tamara
Myers' book, Eat, Drink and Be Wary (Signet Mystery Books).
</P>
<P>
   Davidson says her publisher may take it one step further:
``There are whisperings about a cookbook collecting all the recipes
from my books, but they're just rumors right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Richman, always the critic, said she prefers recipes from fellow
food writer Lou Jane Temple, a culinary mystery writer from Kansas
City, Mo. She's author of Death by Rhubarb and Revenge of the
Barbecue Queens. ``I have the artichoke hummus from one of her
books in the freezer all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers includes several Pennsylvania-Dutch dishes at the end of
her books. The prolific writer with Amish parents sets her
mysteries in the country, peopled with Amish and Mennonite cooks
who are constantly whipping up mountains of sauerkraut, pickles and
rich cakes.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes have a French background in Cecile Lamalle's
culinary mystery, An Appetite for Murder, due out in a few months
from Mysterious Press. Lamalle was former food writer for The New
York Post.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought I'd like to write a mystery,'' she said. ``As
for the food angle, well, it's really all I know. I developed my
lead character, Charlie Poisson, to be chef and owner of a little
French restaurant in the Hudson Valley. He's loosely based on my
father _ who was a real character.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamalle grew up with French food served by her father, a
restaurateur, so most of the dishes in her books are classic
cuisine. ``But I've become a vegetarian, so I've added that in my
next book. There's a young sous chef who does tae kwan do, and he
becomes a vegetarian,'' she said. It also gives her an angle to
include Asian recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Readers, primarily women, want to discuss the recipes from the
books at book signings, or critique the foods, Davidson said.
``They're great. Occasionally, I've asked the readers to help with
a mystery of my own. Once when I couldn't find the right malt to
make a malted milk chocolate cake, I asked the readers to help and
they sent all this malt! I had mail-order, health-food and every
other kind of malt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cake never did work out _ you have to have too much milk
to make it work,'' she said. ``But it was fun trying!''
</P>
<P>
   Here are recipes from some of the culinary mysteries.

</P>
<P>
   Coppi's chocolate hazelnut calzone (with peanut butter
variation)
</P>
<P>
   For the dough:
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup warm water (110 degrees, or slightly warm to touch)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup warm milk
</P>
<P>
   1 envelope ( 1/4-ounce) active dry yeast
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   3 cups flour, more if needed
</P>
<P>
   For the filling:
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup Nutella chocolate-hazelnut spread
</P>
<P>
   OR:
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup smooth peanut butter
</P>
<P>
   Confectioner's sugar
</P>
<P>
   Make the dough: Put warm water and warm milk in a large bowl,
and sprinkle in yeast. Let stand 3 to 4 minutes, then stir to
dissolve. Stir in the salt and 2 cups flour. Gradually stir in
about 1 more cup of flour, using only enough to form a soft,
slightly sticky dough. Knead 5 to 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Lightly oil the bottom of a clean bowl, and roll dough into it
to coat with oil. Cover with a towel and set in a warm spot _ 80
degrees to 100 degress _ to rise for 2 hours, or until doubled in
bulk. Punch down and knead for 1 minute. After rising, dough can be
used immediately or formed into a ball, wrapped tightly in plastic
and refrigerated for a few days before being brought to room
temperature for baking.
</P>
<P>
   If not using Nutella for filling, make peanut butter filling: In
a medium saucepan, stir the sugar and cocoa powder until blended.
Gradually stir in the milk. Bring to a boil over medium heat,
stirring constantly. Lower heat and simmer for 2 minutes. Remove
from heat and let cool for at least 5 minutes. Add the vanilla and
peanut butter, stirring until smooth. Cool thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   Make calzone: About 45 minutes before serving, preheat the oven
to its highest temperature, up to 500 degrees. If you have a pizza
tile, heat it in the oven.
</P>
<P>
   Divide the dough into six pieces. Roll each piece into a circle
6 to 7 inches in diameter, about 1/4-inch thick. Spoon 2
tablespoons chocolate-peanut butter filling or the Nutella in the
center of each piece. Fold dough into a half-moon over the filling.
Pinch the edges together and fold bottom edge over top, crimping to
seal well.
</P>
<P>
   Place on an ungreased cookie sheet, leaving 2 inches between
each calzone. Bake until well browned, 12 to 20 minutes, depending
on your oven.
</P>
<P>
   Remove from oven and sprinkle with confectioner's sugar. Serve
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 calzones.

 &HT;    Instead of outrageous, 'Pecker' is just cute
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Waters puckishly calls his latest movie Pecker, after the
nickname of his main character, a guy with a reputation for picking
and pecking at his food. Why, did you think it referred to some
other attribute?
</P>
<P>
   The attention-getting title is merely a prank, but an amusing
one. The first movie in four years from the master of the
outrageous, however, rarely rises above the level of cute. What
might be considered very promising from a first-time filmmaker has
to be viewed as a limp disappointment from the director of such
cult classics as Pink Flamingos and Polyester.
</P>
<P>
   Yikes, has Waters gone and matured on us while we weren't
looking?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, only by Waters' own standards could Pecker be deemed
as low-grade offensive. After all, it includes an extreme close-up
of female genitalia and shots of male strippers gyrating at a gay
go-go club. Pecker's ventriloquistic grandmother uses a Virgin Mary
statue for her dummy, and his sugar-craving little sister has to be
sedated with Ritalin. Forrest Gump, it's not.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these walks on the tasteless side, Waters has come up
with one of his most accessible, audience-friendly films, a playful
sendup of the New York art world.
</P>
<P>
   Pecker (a well-cast, sweetly naive Edward Furlong) is a
Baltimore shutterbug, merrily roaming his blue-collar neighborhood,
capturing everyday oddities on film. When his perceived artistic
talent is discovered by a New York gallery owner (Lili Taylor) at
his Sub Pit sandwich shop solo show, Pecker becomes the toast of
the Manhattan art scene.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Apple sophisticates just adore his ``art is everywhere''
snapshots. In an amusing sendup of those overnight success
montages, Pecker gets featured on the cover of every important art
magazine. He even is offered a show at the Whitney Museum of Art
(``A Peek at Pecker'') but cancels it in a fit of pique when media
pressures get too intense for him. As Dorothy Gale once observed,
``there's no place like home,'' so Pecker decides to return to
Baltimore. But wherever he goes, the art-adoring Beautiful People
follow him there.
</P>
<P>
   Waters has become a low-rent Woody Allen, able to attract a
stellar cast of independent film actors. In addition to
wheeler-dealer Taylor, there is the omnipresent Christina Ricci as
Pecker's Baltimore-loving girlfriend who works at the nearby Spin
'n' Grin laundromat. Mary Kay Place is strictly apple pie as
Pecker's adoring mom, and a shrill Martha Plimpton shows up under a
dark wig as his sister, toiling industriously at the Fudge Palace.
</P>
<P>
   Actual photography artist Cindy Sherman appears as herself,
fuming with jealousy over Pecker's acclaim. She clearly has a sense
of humor, but, alas, no acting ability. And Waters film veteran
Patricia Hearst _ yes, formerly of the Symbionese Liberation Army _
glides through a few scenes, typecast as a wealthy art patron. Stir
well, and you have an amusing but hardly scabrous stew.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Pecker comes off as amateurish, but that has always been
true of Waters' movies. As with Pecker's photographs, if you find
art in Pecker, then it's art. But don't rule out the possibility
that it is just one person's well-meaning put-on.

 &HT;    What's in the briefcase? 'Ronin' wants you to care
 &HT;    By Gary Schwan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ronin is a curious action-thriller for the post-Cold War era,
when nearly everyone seems world-weary, including writers of
action-thrillers.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe not directors. Veteran John Frankenheimer gasses up
the genre by providing more action, more atmosphere, more shady
characters and more double-crosses than a library of John le Carre
novels.
</P>
<P>
   To what purpose, however? It is hard to tell whether this movie
is a postmodern goof, or the case of a done-that director _ one who
has taken his lumps from critics _ pulling out all the
old-fashioned stops: ``Watch this, you pups.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer? Probably a bit of both. But trying to answer this
while keeping track of the plot is exhausting. Better to just enjoy
the low-life action and set aside the highbrow musings for later.
</P>
<P>
   As the film opens, some rough characters circle each other
suspiciously in a seedy Paris bistro. This tense, neatly
choreographed scene reminds us that Frankenheimer cut his teeth on
the tight ``stage'' of live television.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out these folks are ex-spies and military specialists from
around the world. They don't know each other. They're at loose ends
with the Cold War over. But they've been offered a job and have
come to the bistro to meet their contact, Deirdre (Natascha
McElhone).
</P>
<P>
   They learn that their mission is to recover a heavily guarded
metal briefcase. Never mind how. Never mind what's in it.
</P>
<P>
   Sam (Robert De Niro) is a former CIA operative. There's also an
ex-KGB iceman (the Swedish actor Stellen Skarsgard); a skittish
Brit (Sean Bean); a wary Frenchman (Jean Reno); and an American
wheelman (Skip Sudduth). Shadowing the gang is a mysterious
character whose allegiance and motives are unclear (Jonathan
Pryce).
</P>
<P>
   So the game's afoot, and it leads from Paris to Nice to the
ancient Roman amphitheater at Arles. They are shootouts and setups,
skulduggery and assassinations. And long, breathtaking car chases
through the tunnels of Paris and the narrow streets of the south of
France.
</P>
<P>
   All this in order to acquire that mysterious briefcase. Despite
the twisting, overcharged plot, there is only one crucial surprise.
But what if there's a different sort of surprise at work? A kind of
cerebral surprise? What if the audience is left to wonder whether
there really is anything at all in that briefcase? Maybe it's an
empty grail for which people are willing to scheme, cheat and die
to acquire.
</P>
<P>
   Then that would be irony (or commentary on international
intrigue). And that leads us to Richard Weisz. Turns out that is a
pseudonym for the fine playwright David Mamet. He cowrote the
screenplay with J.D. Zeik, and it bears Mamet's characteristic
terse, circular dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   It's a kind of dialogue suited to De Niro, and you wonder why he
has never appeared in a Mamet play. He brings his familiar
hard-nosed gangster persona to his role as a CIA tough guy,
although he's not quite as bonkers as he usually seems. It largely
works, although De Niro doesn't seem to have to work very hard to
pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   The film itself works intermittently. Some scenes depicting the
pensive interaction of these men are intriguing _ these specialists
with different personalities who pride themselves on their skill,
even if that skill is put to dubious ends. Frankenheimer (The
Manchurian Candidate) always has a neat touch for psychological
thrillers.
</P>
<P>
   A good stretch of the plot, however, seems as elliptical as
Mamet's dialogue. That may be the point. But Ronin _ the Japanese
name a type of ex-samurai warrior _ is best enjoyed as a
straightforward action picture. Just go along for the ride. Leave
the briefcase for later.

 &HT;    Floridians calm in face of Georgess
 &HT;    By Noah Bierman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eleven-dollar pieces of plywood gained new value as local
residents competed with Broward, Miami-Dade and Monroe county
residents to buy storm supplies.
</P>
<P>
   But most Palm Beach County and Treasure Coast residents remained
calm, figuring the brunt of Hurricane Georges wouldn't come this
far north.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really concerned, I just want to be ready,'' said Mike
Cundiff, a West Palm Beach resident who wheeled 30 jars of baby
food and ten gallons of water in his grocery cart at a West Palm
Beach Publix.
</P>
<P>
   Still, water, wood, batteries and flashlights were selling fast
as delivery trucks hustled to refill shelves. Space at animal
shelters was scarce. And electrical generators were not available
at all, most merchants said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stopped in West Palm Beach, but there was no plywood to be
found,'' Kendall resident Robert Hill said Wednesday afternoon as
he loaded a van with 25 sheets at Home Depot in Jensen Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now heading north to Fort Pierce to find a couple
generators,'' he said. ``They're out of them here.''
</P>
<P>
   Salesman Robert Brown said the Lake Worth Home Depot sold more
than 1,000 sheets of plywood in an hour and 15 minutes. When that
ran out, customers bought weaker waferboard for $10.75 or more
expensive wood siding for $19.80.
</P>
<P>
   Sales clerks limited customers to 15 sheets to keep people from
hoarding. For the same reason, store employees wouldn't say which
stores generators were being shipped to or from or whether any
would be available.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to protect people from scalpers and it's a tough
thing to do,'' said Kenny Nevad, who works in the hardware
department.
</P>
<P>
   Grocery store managers have not been limiting water sales,
though Scott Bates had a few questions for a group from Miami that
bought 15 cases of water Tuesday night. Bates said he was satisfied
they were bringing the scarce supply to friends and family and not
reselling it.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Mayhew, an investigator for the Florida Attorney General's
economic crimes office in Fort Lauderdale, spent Wednesday posting
notices at home-supply stores, supermarkets, police stations and
other locations in Palm Beach County. The notices reminded
potential gougers they faced civil fines of $1,000 per incident, up
to $25,000 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General Dan Stermer said he had already
received calls from across South Florida Wednesday but not from
Palm Beach County or the Treasure Coast. Most gouging occurs after
a storm, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Don Harrison, a spokesman for Home Depot's Southeast region,
said 125 truck drivers, each carrying 750 sheets of plywood, were
descending on South Florida. Although stores keep a seven-week
supply on hand, all of it disappeared Tuesday and Wednesday, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The company monitors the storm constantly, trying to keep
delivery ahead of its path. ``Like everyone else in South Florida,
we went to school and saw what happened during Hurricane Andrew,''
he said, referring to the 1992 storm.
</P>
<P>
   In Publix stores in Palm Beach County and across South Florida,
the hottest commodity is water, said Carmen Millares, community
affairs manager for the Miami division, which covers from Vero
Beach to Key West.
</P>
<P>
   The chain's Deerfield Beach center, the main water bottler for
the Miami division, is operating around the clock. She wouldn't
give production figures, citing competition concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Like many customers at the Publix on Southern Boulevard, Maxine
Browlee grabbed a few jugs from boxes marked ``storm stock, for
emergency use.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will need water regardless of the wind and the rain,'' said
Browlee, who survived two hurricanes in the '30s and '40s.
</P>
<P>
   Reservations from worried pet owners had already filled
veterinarian Ken Simmons hurricane-safe clinic in Greenacres by
Wednesday, Simmons said. Most of the owners were told to bring
their animals to the clinic sometime Thursday to avoid the worst of
the storm.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic will actually be more than full when all the animals
arrive, Simmons said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were boarding these animals for luxury vacations, we'd
be full right now,'' he said. But he's willing to keep some of the
animals in pet carriers and put several together in a cage _ with
the owners' permission _ to make more room for the short duration
of the storm.
</P>
<P>
   Staff writers Eliot Kleinberg, A. Scharnhorst and Pat Moore
contributed to this story.

 &HT;    Star gives sitcom tender touch
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine this scenario on Married . . . With Children.
</P>
<P>
   Hot, dim-bulb Kelly Bundy (Christina Applegate) meets a hot,
broad-shouldered hunk. Before you start crooning Love &AMP; Marriage,
trashy Kelly's steaming up the back seat with the hot hunk.
</P>
<P>
   OK, fast-forward to 1998 and Applegate's new sitcom Jesse.
Single-mom, but still pretty hot, Jesse meets Diego (Bruno Campos),
her hunky next-door neighbor. But, instead of fogging up the car
windows, the responsible Jesse takes things slow. She even turns
down the poor guy's date request.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, folks, Applegate is all grown up. Clearly the former
Married . . . With Children star yearned to shed her sexpot image.
Mission accomplished. In Jesse, Applegate is Jesse Warner, a
harried single mom who works in her dad's bar while raising her
10-year-old son, caring for two goofy brothers (one dreams up
get-rich-quick schemes, the other refuses to talk) and fighting off
guys who call her ``sweet cheeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Jesse is light on laughs (it's not Frasier),
Applegate's character is a winner and one with whom many single
moms should identify. Like most unmarried moms, Jesse puts
everyone's priorities ahead of hers. She deserves happiness _ and
that square-jawed neighbor _ but just doesn't know it. Expect her
to strike an Ally McBeal-like chord with women viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Applegate and Campos are sweet in there their scenes together,
especially when doing laundry on their first date. Least appealing
are Jesse's dad (George Dzundza) and her brothers. That non-talking
guy routine gets old fast.
</P>
<P>
   Once you strip away the kooky family and time-worn cliches,
you'll find a tender sitcom.

 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    After tens of millions of Americans watched President Clinton
defend himself on TV this week, his approval ratings largely
remained unchanged or even rose a bit. Why?
 &HT;    According to William J. Bennett's landmark new book, ''The Death
of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals,'' the
president's corruption has corrupted the nation.
 &HT;    ''Once in a great while a single national event provides insight
into where we are and who we are and what we esteem,'' he writes.
''The many Clinton scandals ... reveal insights into how we view
politics and power; virtue and vice; public trust and respect for
the law; sexual morality and standards of personal conduct.''
 &HT;    The picture of the American people is not a pretty one, because
too many of us have bought the rationalizations Clinton and his
sympathizers are peddling. Bennett's breakthrough is that he takes
those arguments seriously and systematically reveals their moral
corruption.
 &HT;    --''If the president's wife forgives him, why shouldn't we?''
 &HT;    Bennett says the core of this argument is that Starr's
investigation is just about sex, and ''sexual misconduct is none of
our business.'' However, Clinton's own attorney general asked Starr
to investigate ''credible evidence of criminal wrongdoing by the
president of the United States -- possible perjury, obstruction of
justice, and job offers for silence -- not accusations of
presidential philandering,'' he writes.
 &HT;    Viewers could see multiple examples of Clinton's perjury in his
testimony. In his opening statement he claimed that oral sex ''did
not constitute sexual relations.'' When it was noted that his
attorney, Robert Bennett (Bill Bennett's brother) claimed there
''absolutely no sex of any kind in any manner, shape or form,''
Clinton said, ''I wasn't paying much attention to this
conversation.'' And in more than 140 instances, this man with a
photographic memory could not remember.
 &HT;    --Because the economy is good, presidential character and
conduct don't matter.
 &HT;    Yes, unemployment and inflation are the lowest in decades.
However, a nation founded on ''self-evident'' truths has had a
''moral purpose defining our highest goals and highest
achievements,'' Bennett writes. We proudly ended slavery in one
century and embraced the civil rights revolution in our era in a
campaign for justice.
 &HT;    Polls show that 87 percent of the public fear something is
fundamentally wrong with America's moral condition.
 &HT;    The person who is privately corrupt will make publicly corrupt
decisions. Clinton could have avoided the danger of impeachment,
had he confessed his sin in January. Instead, he lied in court, to
his friends and employees who defended him in public and helped
find her a job to shut her up.
 &HT;    Bennett recalls that ''Reelection avarice appears to have
compromised national security by permitting the transfer of
sensitive satellite technology to China'' in order to raise illegal
''soft money'' for the campaign.
 &HT;    --They all do it. Presidents and politicians are expected to
engage in corruption or sexual misconduct. Franklin Roosevelt,
Eisenhower and Kennedy are accused of adultery (though Ike's family
denies it).
 &HT;    According to a University of Chicago study, only 21 percent of
men and 11 percent of women have ever committed adultery. Within
the past year, only 3.6 percent of men and 1.3 percent of women did
so. And ''only a small percentage of those who commit adultery are
serial adulterers,'' writes Bennett.
 &HT;    ''Most presidents do not commit illegal acts or lie under oath
or thumb their nose at the law. Most presidents do not chronically
deceive, obfuscate and stonewall federal investigators.''
 &HT;    --''Judge not, lest you be judged.'' Another Scripture often
used: ''He who is without sin cast the first stone.''
 &HT;    But in this case of the woman caught in adultery, Jesus told her
to ''Go and sin no more.'' And the woman ''did not deny the charge,
stonewall or lie to cover it up,'' Bennett asserts.
 &HT;    Jesus clearly did judge others. He called the Pharisees a
''brood of vipers'' full of hypocrisy and wickedness. Bennett says
the person forgiven ''should still be held accountable for his
acts.'' The pope forgave the man who shot him, but did not suggest
he be freed from prison.
 &HT;    The danger of this rationalization is ''that we are giving
license not only to Clinton's corruption but possibly to our own as
well.''
 &HT;    There IS objective right and wrong. Proverbs Chapter 5 warned
3,000 years ago:
 &HT;    ''For the lips of an adulteress drip honey,
 &HT;    and her speech is smoother than oil;
 &HT;    but in the end she is as bitter as gall,
 &HT;    sharp as a two-edged sword.
 &HT;    Her feet go down to death;
 &HT;    her steps lead straight to the grave.''

 NEW YORK: in 30 countries.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unlike world leaders, weavers understood each other _ by
watching. Cloth was like an early map.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Larsen's great love is home, which is largely Longhouse
Reserve, completed in 1992 in collaboration _ their 30th _ with
Charles Forberg, an architect. It is an imposing house on stilts,
suggested by the Shinto shrine in Ise, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   His collections of ancient and contemporary crafts, including
textiles, ceramics and furniture, have followed him there, and
continue to grow, as does the garden with its own art collection.
There is also an arboretum _ Larsen collects trees. Last year, he
sold Larsen Inc. to Cowtan and Tout, a fabric and wallcoverings
company, but he remains a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I finished the house, I wanted to put an epitaph on it,''
he said. ```To The Manor Died' _ I wasn't to the manor born.''
Larsen, leading a brisk tour through the garden _ the briskest
takes about 45 minutes _ was debating the offer of a gift of
Italian cypresses made to the foundation that morning. Past an
allee of cedar trunks painted red, his parents' ashes under a fir
leaf birch, and a Buckminster Fuller open-air dome, loaned this
summer by his daughter, Larsen moved his small group toward
Longhouse, a 180-foot-long building hovering above manmade dunes.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Larsen did a quick walk-about in the living room,
beneath its 65-foot skylight. Much of the foundation's loan
collections are on display here. Then he strode the length of the
house, past the center A-frame stairwell, with its two-story Dale
Chihuly lizard-green glass pendant _ it was Larsen who urged
Chihuly, then a weaving student, to take glassblowing lessons after
seeing a project of strips of woven glass _ to the smaller, more
intimate sitting room in Larsen's private quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The peaked room is tented, in the style of Napoleon, in a Larsen
fabric, ``Canterbury,'' a jacquard weave of Egyptian linen designed
in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hoped this tented ceiling and fabric walls would become a
national trend,'' Larsen said. ``It didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign-style room is neatly, snugly enfolded in Larsen's
own personal collections.
</P>
<P>
   There is a Swedish ceramic stove, with two ebony Philippine
armchairs before it. To the side is an 18th-century painted-cloth
Iranian camp table that displays a box turtle shell found on the
property and a 19th-century American patent ladder, which is used
as bookshelves. There are five uncharacteristically delicate Edward
Wormley tables and a good representation of pieces by Wharton
Esherick, the dean of American craft furniture makers, including a
side chair with a puzzle of miners' hammer handles fitted together
to form the base. A pretty varnished rolling table was his
mother's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody made it in the Navy yard in Seattle, for cribbage,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the interior walls at Longhouse are sliding panels,
stretched with fabric, a device based on a Japanese architectural
element, the paper-panel fusama, which creates rooms and conceals
storage. An opaque, woven leather cloth in the bedroom conceals
clothes and bath towels; a sheer linen threaded with hand-clipped
Thai silk floats to showcase, in silhouette, shelves of ceramic
collections. Other panels, rolled aside, reveal a short history of
ceramics _ Yi-xing wine pots, Han Dynasty heads, a Dansk design of
Larsen's and a vase by Dame Lucy Rie, the British studio potter,
and a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Larsen picked the vase from the shelf, turning the milky ceramic
in his hands as though it were a face he was trying to revolve into
view.
</P>
<P>
   ``She became like an abbess, always in white,'' he said.
``Frail, almost like blowing dandelion down.''
</P>
<P>
   Larsen keeps his influences, experiences and memories on a shelf
_ behind him, for others to admire. Weavers live for surprise _
that burst of firsts when paths intersect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I maintained the fantasy, until I was about 34, that I wasn't
really working,'' Larsen said. ``It occurred to me that I spent
more hours doing what I did than anyone I knew. Other people would
call it work,'' he said, composing a salad for lunch _ beets for
color, walnuts for texture, string beans for structure and lettuce
greens for form. ``But I'm just playing very hard.''

   The eagles that live in the canyons of Colorado use a special
kind of stick to build their nests. A female eagle will sometimes
fly 200 miles to find a branch from an ironwood tree.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are the ironwood sticks as strong as their name
suggests, but they also have thorns that allow them to lock
together so the nest can set securely on a ledge high up in the
canyon.
</P>
<P>
   After building the nest, the eagle pads it with layer upon layer
of leaves, feathers and grass to protect future offspring from the

   In her preparations, the female eagle goes to great lengths to
promote the survival of the birds she will hatch. This interest in
their survival extends well beyond their birth, although the
expression of that interest changes.
</P>
<P>
   As the young eagles grow, they begin to fight for space in the
nest. The chicks' demands for food eventually become such that the
mother eagle is unable to fulfill their needs. She instinctively
knows that in order to survive, her brood is going to have to leave
its nest.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage the young eagles to fend for themselves, the mother
pulls the padding out of the nest so the thorns of the ironwood
branches prick the young birds. As their living conditions become
more painful, they are forced to climb up on the edge of the nest.
The mother eagle then coaxes the young eagles off the edge.
</P>
<P>
   As they begin to plummet to the bottom of the canyon, they
wildly flap their wings to brake their fall, and end up doing what
is the most natural thing in the world for an eagle -- they fly!
</P>
<P>
   As human beings, we may often find ourselves in a similar
situation. When our lives can no longer provide us with the growth
we desire and change must take place, we may need to leave safety
and familiarity behind and journey into unknown territory.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the baby eagles are reluctant to leave the nest, we may
also resist change. Even though conditions may not be pleasant, we
sometimes make an effort to tolerate the increasing discomfort
because we're afraid of the unknown.
</P>
<P>
   But if your ship is tied up at the dock, it doesn't matter how
you turn the rudder -- that ship isn't going anywhere!
</P>
<P>
   Many times unpleasant conditions in our lives tell us that we
are ready to move on and experience new areas of our potential.
While our fear of the unknown might temporarily increase our
tolerance of an uncomfortable situation, life's circumstances may
likely get thorny enough that, like the growing eagles, we'll be
coaxed into moving on. We can trust life and move ahead into new
experiences with confidence because, in a wonderful way, we live in
a friendly universe -- a universe designed to support us and our
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Irving Oyle recognized this when he said, ``The universe is
not opposed to our best interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever said to yourself, ``I've wanted to do something
like this, but never quite had the courage?'' Take a look at the
urge within your being that may be prompting you to step forward.
</P>
<P>
   When the time comes to venture out and accept new challenges,
remember that everyone has an innate ability not only to survive
but to prosper. We are designed, by God, with the possibility to
achieve high levels of success and to enjoy fulfillment and
satisfaction in life.
</P>
<P>
   This means we do not have to settle for less than we're capable
of, unless that is our choice.
</P>
<P>
   The following quote taken from the Association for Humanistic
Psychology Newsletter was written by an 85-year-old woman. Take a
moment and reflect on the wisdom shared through her observations:
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had my life to live over, I'd dare to make more mistakes
next time. I'd relax. I'd limber up. I would be sillier than I've
been this trip. I would take fewer things seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would take more chances. I would take more trips. I would
climb more mountains and swim more rivers. I would eat more ice
cream and less beans. I would perhaps have more actual `troubles,'
but I'd have fewer imaginary ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see, I'm one of those people who live sensibly and sanely
hour after hour, day after day. Oh, I've had my moments, and if I
had it to do over again, I'd have more of them! In fact, I'd try to
have nothing else!''
</P>
<P>
   So often, we have within our grasp a whole new way of life and
fail to explore it. Why? Could one reason be that we may not be
secure enough in who and what we are to release the pioneering
spirit?
</P>
<P>
   An interesting thing is that we do have our life to live over.
Every day, life comes for us to live a new experience. Over and
over, around the calendar, 24 new hours present themselves to us.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we could ask ourselves, regardless of our age, ``Have I
really lived all my years, or has each year been one day lived over
and over again?''
</P>
<P>
   Within each of us are resources that can be realized only when
we climb to the edge of the nest, slip off into the air -- and fly!

WILDLIFE ABOUNDS IN LOUISIANA'S GREAT OUTDOORS

<P>
   NEW IBERIA, La. _ The ``fais do-do'' isn't the only wildlife to
be found in Cajun Country.
</P>
<P>
   With its diverse habitats and mild winters, southwest Louisiana
brims with natural wonders, both flora and fauna.
</P>
<P>
   Trust us, gators aren't the only critters here.
</P>
<P>
   Near New Iberia at Spanish Lake, a shallow lake with just five
miles of shoreline, more than 240 species of birds have been
spotted.
</P>
<P>
   From airboat tours to bird sanctuaries, opportunities for
exploring nature abound. Here are some places to start:
</P>
<P>
   _ The floodwaters of as many as 38 states find their way each
year to the Atchafalaya Basin, which covers more than 70 miles of
south-central Louisiana, roughly from Simmesport to Morgan City.
Its continually changing maze of bayous, streams and lakes is a
complex flood control system under the direction of the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Of interest to visitors is the beauty and diversity of the
basin, which features dense stands of cypress, oak, willow and
other trees that provide a habitat for deer, rabbits, squirrels,
turtles, birds, snakes and alligators. The basin is home to 300
species of birds, 65 species of reptiles and 46 species of mammals.
More than 90 species of fish live in its dark waters, and each year
the swamp gives up millions of pounds of crawfish to commercial
fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Allemond and his family offer tours of the Atchafalaya
Basin daily from February through December. The open-air boat tours
give visitors a chance to peek at not only the secrets of the swamp
but also the lifestyle of the Cajuns who depend on the basin.
</P>
<P>
   Houseboats and stilt houses dot the swamp, as do egrets and
gators. While snaking around the basin, the boat captain offers a
continuous narrative of life on the swamp, including its history as
home to the Chitimachas Indians and as a hiding place for pirate
Jean Lafitte. Logging and the oil industry also have left their
mark on the basin.
</P>
<P>
   The Atchafalaya Basin Tours depart from McGee's Landing in
Breaux Bridge. After the tour, you can feast on crawfish, catfish
and other Cajun fare at the McGee's Landing restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cajun Country is a bird lovers' dream. For the purist, swamp
tours provide many opportunities to see and photograph migrating
species. For the rest of us, attractions such as Jungle Gardens and
Bird City are great places to flock.
</P>
<P>
   Jungle Gardens was the brainchild of Edward Avery McIlhenny,
whose father, Edmund, developed Tabasco sauce. The gardens are
about six miles outside New Iberia on Avery Island. The island is
where Edmund Avery cultivated the pepper crops and mined the salt
that are still used in the production of Tabasco.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Avery McIlhenny was a naturalist and conservationist who
wrote several books, including ``Autobiography of an Egret'' and
``Life History of the Alligator.'' A world traveler, he began
bringing back exotic plants from around the globe to his burgeoning
gardens.
</P>
<P>
   A driving trail winds around lagoons, pools and wooded tracts.
Along the drive, visitors can see a world of vegetation: soap trees
and junipers from India, finger bananas and wisterias from China,
lotus and papyrus from the Nile region of Africa and papayas from
the tropics.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can drive through, but to appreciate the scope of the
gardens, you need to take advantage of the walking trails, which
lead to Bird City and the Chinese Garden with its centuries-old
Buddha statue.
</P>
<P>
   Bird City is a heron and egret sanctuary created by McIlhenny.
</P>
<P>
   McIlhenny heard the story of a prince in India who had built
bamboo cages to hold his collection of exotic birds, which had been
gathered from all over India. When the prince died, the cages were
neglected and rotted away. But the winged creatures, descendants of
the prince's original birds, remained in their nests.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired, McIlhenny built a wire cage over a small lake on Avery
Island in 1892. Then he captured seven young snowy egrets in the
swamps. Around that time, the egrets were becoming increasingly
endangered because of plume hunters.
</P>
<P>
   McIlhenny cared for his birds for a year, and then when the next
migratory season came around he dismantled the cage. The birds
headed south. The next spring, as in the Indian story, McIlhenny's
egrets returned.
</P>
<P>
   Now each spring, this scene is repeated, but today as many as
20,000 egrets, herons and other migratory birds call on Bird City.
There are so many birds that the McIlhenny family has built piers
of bamboo to accommodate the nesting masses.
</P>
<P>
   The egrets and herons begin returning in mid-February, and the
families begin their migration with the first blast of cold wind.
Some birds _ the old and stubborn _ make Bird Island their home
year-round.
</P>
<P>
   _ On Jefferson Island, about a 15-minute drive west of New
Iberia, Rip Van Winkle Gardens _ previously known as Live Oak
Gardens _ is situated on 25 semitropical acres. Flowers abound, and
the property also includes a small bed-and-breakfast, a restaurant
and the 1870s home of actor Joseph Jefferson. Self-guided walking
tours, home tours and boat tours are available.
</P>
<P>
   _ Another stop on this nature tour of Cajun Country is the Zoo
of Acadiana, located on Highway 90 about 10 miles south of
Lafayette.
</P>
<P>
   The pretty little zoo is home to more than 750 exotic animals,
including zebras, leopards, camels and Bengal tigers. A raised
boardwalk offers terrific views of ostriches, muntjacs, cranes and
mangabeys.
</P>
<P>
   Since this is Louisiana, it's no surprise that the biggest
crowds are found at the alligator exhibit.

CAJUN FOOD HAS A CHARACTER LIKE NO OTHER IN THE WORLD

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAFAYETTE, La. _ Think Cajun food, and the prevailing images for
many people are blackened catfish, gumbo, boudin, jambalaya and
spicy fried shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   You can find the best of each in southwest Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   But the regional cuisine has evolved into a much more complex
bill of fare, with innovative and well-skilled chefs concocting new
Cajun-accented adaptations of classic dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Care for veal piccata cooked in wine and butter, laced with
Louisiana crawfish tails and shiitake mushrooms sauteed in a
roasted garlic, capers and herb ``beurre blanc''?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe a filet mignon surrounded by French mushrooms sauted in a
roasted garlic veal demi-glace, on Cajun potato hay and laced with
Creolaise sauce?
</P>
<P>
   Or a king-cut tuna steak seasoned with cracked peppercorn mix
and roasted garlic, pan-seared medium rare on a bed of sauteed
julienned red onions and peppers in a herbed ``Cajun Power'' garlic
sauce?
</P>
<P>
   These are among chef-owner Ken Vernon's specialties at
Lafayette's Cafe Vermilionville (phone 318-237-0100), a stellar
restaurant that maintains a tradition established in 1818 with the
opening of an original inn on the property.
</P>
<P>
   Even Vernon's appetizers represent a mouthwatering adventure:
Oregon black truffle slices sauteed in a champagne and herb butter
sauce with lobster claw meat on garlic croutons; alligator
medallions with Dijon mustard sauce; crawfish eggrolls with honey
mustard. And who could resist a crawfish Caesar salad?
</P>
<P>
   Desserts include bananas Foster cheesecake and homemade pecan
pie.
</P>
<P>
   A half-hour's drive to the south at leRosier Country Inn and
Restaurant (888-804-7673 or 318-367-5306) in New Iberia, Hallman
Woods III has earned national acclaim for his ``New Acadian''
cuisine, including recognition by Food &AMP; Wine magazine as one of
America's Best New Chefs.
</P>
<P>
   Woods uses the freshest local ingredients _ among them sweet
shrimp, mirlitons, okra and Creole tomatoes _ in beautiful and
delectable presentations. He does wonders with duck, lamb, veal and
beef; pan-roasted tilapia is a favorite; and on special occasions,
Woods has been known to serve gourmet dinners that include crawfish
in every course: perhaps crawfish spring rolls with ginger and
``beurre blanc''; marinated crawfish salad with spicy creole
mustard dressing; even crawfish strudel.
</P>
<P>
   A bonus is that bedrooms in the modern, comfortable inn are only
steps away from the 50-seat restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Catfish corn bread topped with fresh fish lures diners to Cafe
Des Amis (318-332-5273), situated in historical downtown Breaux
Bridge east of Lafayette. Other specialities include duck glazed
with hot corn syrup and pepper jelly.
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast is an institution here: Try couche couche, an old-time
Cajun staple made with cornmeal, or ``pain perdue'' (French bread)
made with bread, eggs, sugar, milk and salt. Or start your day with
crawfish etouffe served atop biscuits or eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Among other leading area restaurants: Mulate's (800-422-2586 or
318-332-4648), also in Breaux Bridge; Pat's Fisherman's Wharf in
Henderson (318-228-7110); Catahoula's (318-662-2275) in Grand
Coteau; and Enola Prudhomme's Cajun Cafe (318-896-3646), Prejean's
(318-896-3247), Randol's (318-981-7080) and the original Don's
Seafood and Steak House (318-235-3551), all in or just north of
Lafayette.
</P>
<P>
   Prejean's menu can be mind-boggling:
</P>
<P>
   Starters include a mini-eggplant wheel, fried and topped with
three garlic shrimp and draped with a creamy au gratin sauce; a
``Whistling Dixie venison'' tenderloin mesquite-grilled, set in
brown butter shiitake wine sauce and sprinkled with oven-roasted
pine nuts; and popcorn crawfish tails dipped in sherry wine sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Entrees include pepper-crusted Colorado elk served in an
Andouille and chanterelle mushroom sauce and white alligator tail
meat wrapped around crab and shrimp and served with macque choux
and dirty rice.
</P>
<P>
   It's a challenge saving room for Acadian bread pudding served
with Jack Daniel's butter sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Favorites at Enola Prudhomme's Cajun Cafe include catfish
courtboullion, eggplant pirogue and low-fat entrees _ among them
chicken tomato basil, shrimp fettucine and grilled or sauteed
catfish fillet _ featured in cookbooks authored by Paul Prudhomme's
sister.
</P>
<P>
   The Lafayette Convention and Visitors Bureau can supply
brochures that point the way to these and numerous other
Cajun-oriented eateries. Or to restaurants that focus on French,
Italian, Chinese and other cuisines. Call 800-346-1958; or access

   The eagles that live in the canyons of Colorado use a special
kind of stick to build their nests. A female eagle will sometimes
fly 200 miles to find a branch from an ironwood tree.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are the ironwood sticks as strong as their name
suggests, but they also have thorns that allow them to lock
together so the nest can set securely on a ledge high up in the
canyon.
</P>
<P>
   After building the nest, the eagle pads it with layer upon layer
of leaves, feathers and grass to protect future offspring from the
sharp thorns of the ironwood.
</P>
<P>
   In her preparations, the female eagle goes to great lengths to
promote the survival of the birds she will hatch. This interest in

 UNDATED: his fee.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ms. Nicholson began her shopping on line two years ago by
calling up a search engine and typing in ``real estate.'' While
that provided her with an overwhelming number of sites, few sites
at that time offered anything in Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   The process was also time-consuming because it required
following a number of links. While Ms. Nicholson had the most
success with Realtor.com, numerous sites have been added since
then. And there are now many ways to search for a home, tailoring
the listings according to the desired city, price range, house size
and special features, like fireplaces and swimming pools.
</P>
<P>
   But sorting through those options can be mind-boggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a pile of clutter,'' said Barbara Corcoran, founder
of the Corcoran Group real estate company in Manhattan. Speaking of
the company's Web site, she said: ``We build bridges everywhere we
can. The more bridges we have, the more traffic we have.''
</P>
<P>
   To attract and retain visitors to the Web site, Ms. Corcoran
relies on what she calls ``bells and whistles'' _ 360-degree
virtual-reality walk-throughs, for example, a feature that is
generally available only for a handful of more expensive
properties.
</P>
<P>
   One useful feature of Corcoran's site is its inclusion of
addresses (but no apartment numbers) for most properties it
advertises on the Net. But many real estate agents disapprove of
that practice, saying it could jeopardize homeowners' security, and
do not list addresses on Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Corcoran has seen her company's Internet-related sales _
sales that followed an initial contact with the company through
e-mail _ grow to $60 million in 1997 from $4.9 million in 1995,
when the site began.
</P>
<P>
   The company has also found that its Web site helps many
customers find what they want more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of Corcoran buyers found that the clients who had used
the Internet had spent only a quarter as much time house-hunting as
had other clients.
</P>
<P>
   The clients who did not use the Web spent about four months with
a realtor, on average, and looked at about 21 homes, while the
``Webheads,'' as the survey called them, spent an average of only
one month with a real estate agent and saw only 5 properties before
buying.
</P>
<P>
   The Web can make brokers and sales agents more visible. At
Corcoran, Sarah Bond, a vice president at the company, made a
valuable contact with a British client who saw a profile of her on
the Internet and selected her because she rode a vintage bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Frankovic, an associate broker with Windermere Real Estate
in Spokane, Wash., has taken on the persona of Garlic Bob on his
Web site. Frankovic, who was forced to eat garlic sandwiches as a
child in the hopes of keeping polio at bay, now grows acres of the
stuff. His Web site includes a photograph of him on an old red
tractor, and he will happily provide information on garlic as well
as on real-estate listings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a goofy picture,'' he said. ``But even if you don't like
me, you'll remember me.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankovic's site was among a dozen that attracted Larry Barnes
when he was looking for a new realtor to sell a house he had left
350 miles behind in Spokane after moving to Whidbey Island, outside
Seattle. Faced with the option of driving back to Seattle or
calling long distance to find a realtor, Barnes turned to the
Internet, narrowing his search by state and city and then looking
at his options.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had I not been on Realtor.com, he would not have found me,''
Frankovic said, noting that his commission on the house had been
well worth the less than $1,000 he spends a year to operate his
Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   Realtor.com, which has been in operation for more than two
years, has the backing of the National Association of Realtors.
Many of its listings come directly from multiple listing services.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Keller, vice president for marketing at Real Select,
which operates the Realtor.com site, says it has a vast database
and takes a direct approach. ``What we're really about is
convenience,'' he said. ``You go to the grocery store more often
than not to pick up milk. That's what we're about, milk.''
</P>
<P>
   While a variety of companies have top-notch sites, most
observers see a battle shaping up between Realtor.com and Home
Advisor, which at this point is lagging behind in listings.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Morris, the lead product manager for Home Advisor, the
Microsoft site, played down the fact that the site is behind
Realtor.com in listings, pointing out that Home Advisor opened with
a preview only in July. He said Microsoft was providing a
comprehensive guide to home buying that helped consumers figure out
how much they could afford and offered neighborhood information and
loan and closing assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said Microsoft was in the business to generate money from
loan origination fees paid by mortgage brokerage companies
associated with the service. ``It allows us to provide a great
service to consumers for free,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With such competition, the bottom line seems to be that realtors
can jump in or face being left out. ``Things are changing,''
Frankovic said. ``The Internet is the way people like to do
business. It's the way I like to do business. You don't have to go
knocking on doors.''

<P>
   ST. MARTINVILLE, La. _ Come hear the stories of this little town
on Bayou Teche.
</P>
<P>
   Some of its tales are fact, others merely myth. Many likely are
a combination of the two. All are worth sharing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ACADIAN MEMORIAL &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the newest attractions in Louisiana's sixth oldest city _
situated about a 30-minute drive southeast of Lafayette _ is the
Acadian Memorial, where a plaque reminds visitors that ``a people
without a past are a people without a future.''
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of this memorial is a 12-foot-by-30-foot mural
by Robert Dafford titled ``The Arrival of the Acadians in
Louisiana.''
</P>
<P>
   The mural recalls one of the happier-ending tales of pioneer
America: the Acadians' _ or ``Acadie,'' as they called themselves _
first settlement in the French colony of Louisiana after being
ousted by the British from their rich farmlands in what is now Nova
Scotia, Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands among the exiled died on overcrowded ships. The
survivors became outcasts in cities along the Atlantic coast. Many
fled back to France, where as defiant refugees from a strange land
they were even more unwelcome.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually they began gathering in Louisiana. The first group
arrived in 1765, having begun their journey in Nantes, France.
</P>
<P>
   The mural depicts scores of immigrants arriving into a promising
world of moss-laden trees and life-giving waterways. Among the
crowd are 39 figures who represent actual Acadians. The mural takes
liberty with history, though, depicting many who arrived years
apart and settled throughout the area. In many cases, direct
descendants of the Acadians modeled for Dafford.
</P>
<P>
   Among the figures represented: Jean Baptiste Semer and Joseph
Semer, father and son who were separated for more than 30 years;
Olivier Terriot, a shoemaker in Nantes who recruited more than
1,500 Acadians to travel to Louisiana; and Olivier Benoit, whose
off-course ship made him one of the first ``Texas Cajuns.''
</P>
<P>
   An exhibit lists about 3,000 Acadian refugees whose names have
been culled from early Louisiana records. The memorial's research
center hopes to be a starting point for people interested in
genealogical information.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
EVANGELINE OAK &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One story that came from the early days of Acadian immigration
to Louisiana is that of the Evangeline Oak.
</P>
<P>
   According to legend, a young ``Acadie'' named Evangeline was
separated from her betrothed during ``Le Grand Derangement.'' After
years of searching, she finally found her betrothed, who had in her
absence married another. Evangeline died of a broken heart while
sitting beneath the huge oak.
</P>
<P>
   That's the legend. The real story is just as tragic.
</P>
<P>
   Emmeline Labiche and her fiance, Louis Arceneaux, were placed on
separate ships during the exile. Both eventually made their way to
Louisiana, but Emmeline arrived _ still toting a wedding gown _
three years after Louis. Her appearance was greeted with news of
Louis's marriage to another. Exhausted and brokenhearted, Emmeline
died just a few months after arriving in St. Martinville. She is
believed to be buried in a plot behind the nearby St. Martin de
Tours Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   This story might have died with the early Acadians had it not
been the inspiration of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's long narrative
poem ``Evangeline.'' In Longfellow's version, Evangeline arrives in
St. Martinville just a day behind her lover, Gabriel. She sets out
to find him but is sadly unsuccessful. The two are finally united
years later when Evangeline, now a nun, and Gabriel share an
embrace as he dies of the plague.
</P>
<P>
   Its huge branches stretching in all directions, the Evangeline
Oak is one of the most popular stops in Acadiana. A small visitors
center is located in the park that surrounds the tree. Nearly every
day, those who pause beside the Evangeline Oak are entertained by
the Romero Brothers. Lennis Romero is 81, and his accordion-playing
brother Ophe, also known as Bebe, is in his late 70s.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers perform traditional French music in the park six
days a week. They work for tips and genuinely enjoy the attention
of camera-toting, hand-clapping tourists.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PETIT PARIS MUSEUM &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to separate fact from myth in some of the tales at
the Petit Paris Museum.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the small museum is a splashy collection of
elaborate Mardi Gras costumes and the story of a rich, eccentric
plantation owner named Jerome Charles Durand.
</P>
<P>
   There are many stories about the colorful Durand, an extravagant
man who married twice.
</P>
<P>
   His first wife died after bearing him 12 children. In his grief,
he erected a monument that showed him crying beside his wife's
tomb; an inscription vowed that he would never love again. But
Durand married his second wife within the year. The second Mrs.
Durand bore him 12 children as well, because he felt it was
important to be fair to both his wives.
</P>
<P>
   That story is well-known, but the most-oft-told tale about
Durand is that of the Spider Web Wedding.
</P>
<P>
   In 1870, two of Durand's daughters accepted marriage proposals
from fine young men. Durand immediately made plans for an elaborate
double ceremony at his sugar-cane plantation.
</P>
<P>
   The plantation had a three-mile alley of pine and oak trees,
which Durand had planted years earlier. Several days before the
wedding, plantation hands released large spiders into the trees.
For days, the spiders wove enormous webs, many of which linked the
trees.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of the wedding, the workers used bellows filled
with gold and silver dust to ``paint'' the cobwebs. A shimmering
canopy awaited the wedding guests. There were dancing and long
tables covered with food under the trees until dusk. Fireworks
capped the expensive celebration.
</P>
<P>
   A re-creation of the Spider Web Wedding is the main exhibit at
the Petit Paris Museum. Each year the St. Martinville Rotary Club
hosts a Mardi Gras Ball. The Spider Web Wedding was the theme for
Mardi Gras in 1984, and the elaborate, handmade costumes created
for the ball are presented here.
</P>
<P>
   Adjacent to the museum is St. Martin de Tours Catholic Church,
established in 1765. The building, which features French
chandeliers and a replica of the Grotto of Lourdes, was completed
in 1844.
</P>
<P>
   In front of the church is a statue of an American Indian, who is
wearing a skirt. Not a loincloth but a skirt.
</P>
<P>
   It's just another St. Martinville story.

LAFAYETTE, La.: into their cars.'''
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was, and is, no Big Boudin amusement ride. But we discover
a Cajun Haven or Cajun Way or Cajun Mart in almost every southwest
Louisiana hamlet. Swamp tours promise close-up encounters with live
alligators; Prudhomme clones _ some highly skilled, others mere
imitators _ deliver alligator on a plate. Other tours provide
insight into the making of Tabasco at Avery Island, Tony Chachere's
seasonings in Opelousas and Konriko Rice in New Iberia. Almost
every weekend, a festival celebrates Cajun cuisine, Cajun arts and
crafts, Cajun music or Cajun humor.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's clear that these Acadians, both as cordial hosts and
savvy entrepreneurs, have figured out what to do with us. But not
without a period of adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   When tour buses began arriving, Ancelet says, ``The first
question people would ask was, `Where do I go to meet some Cajuns?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say, `Oh, I don't know, maybe you could go get your hair
cut or your flat fixed. You find us in the normal places people go
in their everyday lives. We don't have a zoo for us yet.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We had all these people suddenly coming here from New York and
New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and they had no idea what to do. So
the tour bus took them to a dance hall, and they loved the music
and had a good time. And the dance-hall owner thought it was great,
too, because the place was full and the tourists were buying a lot
of beer.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the regular customers _ the people who had been coming to
the dance hall every week for years _ were pushed against the wall.
Then, the next week, the tour bus wasn't there, and the regulars
weren't there either because they didn't have such a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, residents and tourists mingle easily on dance floors at
Randol's and Prejean's restaurants in Lafayette and at scores of
other establishments throughout the region. But there is a
significant lesson in this learning process, suggests Ancelet:
</P>
<P>
   ``Cultural tourism comes at a price,''he says. ``People are no
different from our natural forests in that we have to be very
careful not to trample what we come to visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, when we talk about cultural tourism, one thing
we've learned is that we are dealing primarily with smart people.
They've usually read in advance about the things (and people) they
visit. They are eager to engage in intelligent conversations, eager
to learn. They are not cultural polluters, especially if they're
well-guided.''
</P>
<P>
   And, says Ancelet, ``We want them to have a good experience.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
RESPECT FOR TRADITION &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Certainly any ``good experience'' incurred here can be
attributed in large part to the Cajun philosophy of living every
moment to the fullest. ``Laissez les bons temps rouler,'' people
proclaim. Let the good times roll.
</P>
<P>
   But just as Acadians' savor the present, their respect for
tradition is unwavering.
</P>
<P>
   Conque makes a living telling Boudreaux-and-Thibodeaux jokes:
``Ralph Boudreaux is a good friend of mine, and he told me that any
time I'm in his hometown of Maurice to come see him day and
night,'' Conque tells audiences. ``So I knocked on his door at 2
o'clock in the morning, and his wife answered and I said, `Ma'am, I
know it's late, but is this where the great Ralph Boudreaux lives?'
And she said, `Yeah, if he's drunk again just bring him in and lay
him on the couch.'''
</P>
<P>
   Not all Boudreaux are fictional, though. ``I was driving down
the street the other day and saw a sign that read, `Boudreaux and
Son Lumber Yard,''' Conque says, ``and it struck me that I don't
often see that kind of family recognition today in other places I
go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cajun family life is special. Our family bonds and our
friendships are close-knit, and again I think it goes back to our
forefathers. They had to stick together; it's all they had. We
still value that sense of togetherness.''
</P>
<P>
   Cajuns still value the language, too. More than 260,000
Louisianans speak a form of French either brought to New Orleans by
French nobility or to the bayous and prairies by Acadians.
Speculation is that Cajun French has survived, albeit with
linguistic changes, largely because of years of isolation and low
economic status and the family structure.
</P>
<P>
   Several venues provide rich insight into the Cajun heritage.
Among them:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve's
Acadian Cultural Center in Lafayette features extensive exhibits
and artifacts. A 40-minute video chronicles the deportation from
Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nearby, Vermilionville _ the original name for Lafayette _
authentically re-creates an 18th- and 19th-century Cajun and Creole
village with a series of dwellings, some dating back 200 years.
Costumed guides direct tours that introduce spinners, a quilter,
wood carvers, basket weavers and a blacksmith. Cooking schools and
musical entertainment are other features.
</P>
<P>
   _ Acadian Village, a folk-life museum surrounded by gardens and
woodlands on the outskirts of Lafayette, also displays homes,
stores and other landmarks of original Cajuns and Creoles.
</P>
<P>
   _ The University Art Museum and Alexandre Mouton House-Lafayette
Museum each provides diverse cultural exhibits. Small but
informative museums and workshops are found in many other
communities.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday evenings in Eunice, northwest of Lafayette, the
Liberty Theater, a 1924 movie house, is home to a live
French-speaking radio and television show hosted by Ancelet.
</P>
<P>
   The show features two hours of Cajun and Zydeco music (though
Cajuns favor both, each has distinct characteristics, with Zydeco
emphasizing a ``frottoir,'' or washboard) and humor in the Grand
Ole Opry style.
</P>
<P>
   Next year Francofete '99 will commemorate 300 years of French
influence, with considerable emphasis on Acadian history and
culture. Events are scheduled throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Cajuns hardly need an excuse to party. To dance. To
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have another friend named Pistache Babineaux, the lawyer,''
Conque is still regaling his luncheon audience, ``and Pistache got
a phone call the other day from a man at Angola State Prison who
said, `Mr. Babineaux, I'm on death row, and in one hour they're
going to execute me in the electric chair.
</P>
<P>
   ```You got some advice for me?'
</P>
<P>
   ```Yeah,' Pistache said. ``Don't sit down.'''
</P>
<P>
   Pistache could well have added, ``Lache pas la patate.'' Never
give up.

THE THONG SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
  By BRUCE GOTTLIEB 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There has been much discussion of Monica Lewinsky's thong
underwear.
</P>
<P>
   The Starr report says: ``In the course of flirting with
(President Clinton), (Lewinsky) raised her jacket in the back and
showed him the straps of her thong underwear, which extended above
her pants.''
</P>
<P>
   We called a local Seattle lingerie boutique and was assured that
thong bikini straps--unlike traditional bikini straps--often
continue above the waistband of a woman's trousers. (We also called
his local Victoria's Secret, but the manager thought us a pervert
and hung up.) In other words, Monica was surely being saucy, but
she didn't do anything more than raise her jacket and blouse flaps
to reveal her lower back.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a good reason she didn't disrobe. Contrary to the
Starr report, Lewinsky's newly released testimony suggests that
there were other people in the room! (The room was Leon Panetta's
office, the occasion was a pizza party for a staffer's birthday.)
</P>
<P>
   Her Aug. 11 testimony says ``no one else in the room could have
seen (the thong); this was something that Lewinsky learned to do
when she was having an affair with Andy Bleiler.'' (Bleiler, in
case you've forgotten, is the married high-school drama coach with
whom she dallied.)
</P>
<P>
   In other words, showing the thong isn't a prudish way of saying
that Lewinsky stripped for the president. Showing the thong was a
lewd trick Lewinsky knew, something just slightly more salacious
than a suggestive wink.

A FINE MESS!
</HEADLINE>
  By BRUCE GOTTLIEB 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some people are looking for a way to punish President Clinton
that's tougher than censure but not as tough as impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   On ABC's ``This Week,'' former Clintonite George Stephanopoulos
proposed a fine--Clinton should reimburse the government for the
cost of the Lewinsky portion of Starr's investigation (the part for
which his dissembling was responsible).
</P>
<P>
   Is this suggestion serious? Is it kosher?
</P>
<P>
   Stephanopoulos certainly meant to be serious and subsequent
articles from the New York Times, Baltimore Sun, and the Associated
Press treated his proposal respectfully. A financial penalty might
assuage outraged voters in a way that Clinton's many apologies have
not.
</P>
<P>
   There is precedent. In 1997 Congress fined Newt Gingrich
$300,000 as punishment for lying about ethics violations. Speaker
Gingrich agreed to accept a loan from Bob Dole, who was by then
employed by a Washington lobbying firm. Many pundits pronounced
this deal a conflict of interest, even though Dole pledged not to
lobby his well-connected debtor. Coincidentally, on Monday Gingrich
announced he doesn't need Dole's money since the latest Gingrich
book is selling better than expected.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with the fine idea is how Clinton could be expected
to pay it--on top of his lawyers' bills, etc. The fine
Stephanopoulos proposes would be something like $4 million. It's
hard to think of any way the president, or even the ex-president,
could raise that kind of money without controversy and objection
from the very critics the fine is supposed to assuage.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, a fine can only work as part of a plea bargain.
Clinton must agree to it. If Congress attempted to impose a fine
against his will, Clinton could call it a ``bill of attainder.''
That is a law imposing punishment on an individual without trial,
and it is prohibited by the Constitution. But Bill Clinton is the
only person with the legal standing to dispute a fine levied
against Bill Clinton. If he goes along, no one else can object.

 &HT;    ``Hey! Y'all got a flat tire?''
 &HT;    ``Naw, we were just riding around, and them other three swole up
on us.''
 &HT;    _ Acadian humorist Murray Conque
 &HT;     
 
By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   LAFAYETTE, La. _ Our travels are inspired by diverse pursuits:
an appreciation for natural wonders and wildlife, a passion for
music and the arts, a quest for adventure, a desire to step back in
time.
</P>
<P>
   All these objectives _ and more _ are easily satisfied, too,
amid the murky swamps and bayous, the historical homes and gardens,
the spirited dance halls and food parlors of southwest Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt, however, what the single most-defining
characteristic within this fascinating slice of Americana is:
</P>
<P>
   It's the people. A people with an unfailing zest for life. Men
and women who treasure a rib-tickling joke, even if it's at their
own expense; who cherish a lovingly prepared meal accented by
conversation as free-flowing as the wine and as well-seasoned as
the crawfish gumbo; who step sprightly into the wee hours,
intoxicated by the beat of an accordion or fiddle.
</P>
<P>
   A people forever determined to infuse that elusive ``lagniappe''
_ signifying ``a little something extra'' in the distinct Cajun
French dialect _ into every element of their existence.
</P>
<P>
   But also a proud people whose heartfelt affection for each other
and genuine warmth toward guests is borne in large part by
generations of oppression and sacrifice and hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lache pas la patate,'' they tell us. The literal translation:
Don't let go of the potato. The meaning here: Never give up.
</P>
<P>
   This is Cajun country. There is no other place quite like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our food is different; our humor is different; our people are
different,'' says Murray Conque, part-time insurance salesman,
part-time major-league baseball scout and a past champion in the
annual International Cajun Joke-Telling Contest in Opelousas.
</P>
<P>
   ``My home town of Carencro is so small that our phone book only
has one yellow page,'' Conque delights a luncheon audience
assembled from all over North America. ``But we're finally getting
our first traffic light,'' he continues. ``Everybody in Carencro is
so excited; they've already picked out the colors.''
</P>
<P>
   Much later, far removed from the crowd, Conque reflects on the
roots of his humor. ``Our forefathers were thrown out of France and
thrown out of Canada,'' he says. ``They came down here with nothing
except their pride and love of family and their ability to laugh at
whatever life threw at them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like them, we work hard. We play hard. But we never forget how
to stop and laugh with and at each other. And we love sharing our
laughter with our guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you know, the stories we tell could almost be true.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter where we pause _ on a guided boat excursion through
the Atchafalaya basin, at a Friday night Downtown Alive!
celebration in Lafayette, mingling with ``ghosts'' at beautiful
Chretien Point Plantation B&AMP;B in Sunset, feasting on crawfish
touffe at a re-creation of an early Acadian village _ good humor
pervades.
</P>
<P>
   And locals and visitors mesh almost as if they have been friends
forever.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, cultural tourism, as travel industry professionals label
this phenomenon, thrives today in Cajun country. Especially for
those who take the time to learn about the rich Acadian heritage.
And about how we came to appreciate each other.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A TRAGIC HISTORY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Acadians' long and tragic path to southwest Louisiana dates
to 1604 when they began migrating from rural homes in western
France to Acadie, now Nova Scotia in eastern Canada.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a century, they prospered as farmers and
fisherman. But in the early 1700s, Britain gained control of Acadie
from France, and the Acadians were trapped in a power struggle
between two strong nations. Ordered to declare allegiance to
Britain, they refused.
</P>
<P>
   In 1755, the British, in what became known as ``The Grand
Derangement,'' began removing Acadians from their adopted homeland,
dispersing them to British colonies along the East Coast and in the
Caribbean and Europe. Six thousand Acadians put out to sea in small
boats; almost half perished from typhoid, smallpox or other
diseases. Hundreds more escaped deportation by hiding in the woods,
only to die of starvation. Those who arrived in the colonies were
unexpected and _ as devoted French Catholics _ unwelcome. They
languished in misery.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, survivors set sail again, bound this time for a
new Louisiana territory then under Spanish rule. They brought few
material possessions _ only a blossoming culture and language that
blended French, Celtic, Scotch-Irish and American Indian
influences.
</P>
<P>
   Joining other displaced descendants of Africans, West Indians,
Europeans and American Indians known as Creoles, they settled in
the wetlands west of New Orleans, fishing and hunting for survival,
and on prairies where they raised cotton, rice, sugar cane and
cattle.
</P>
<P>
   Some eventually returned to Canada, where another Acadian
culture now thrives on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia. But their
Louisiana numbers continued to expand.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even as they emerged into a respected and important
segment of the Louisiana population, most Cajuns _ as the name
evolved _ lived happily and modestly in relative obscurity until
the past few decades.
</P>
<P>
   Until Justin Wilson began spinning yarns on national television.
Until Cajun music became a hit at venues nationwide. Until Paul
Prudhomme and Emeril _ ``Bam! Let's kick it up another notch'' _
Lagasse started cooking. Until New Englanders began dribbling
Tabasco sauce on their lobster.
</P>
<P>
   And until the construction of Interstate 10 provided millions of
travelers easy access over the Atchafalaya swamp and into the heart
of Cajun country.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, Gov. Edwin Edwards signed a bill designating a
22-parish (county) area as Acadiana, with Lafayette at its
geographic heart.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Ancelet, professor of French and folklore at the
University of Southwestern Louisiana in Lafayette, remembers well
the outside world's initial mass discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early '80s, we began stressing what we called our
cultural system,'' Ancelet says. ``All of a sudden, people weren't
coming here to Louisiana just to see geysers or forests; they were
coming to see us. And we started to realize that when they find us,
we ought to try to figure out what to do with them so they don't
end up in our living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people wanted to start a Cajunland theme park,'' Ancelet
says. ``I just shook my head and said, `Yeah, let's put it at the
corner of Interstates 10 and 49 (the area's busiest intersection).'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `When people are ready to leave Cajunland, we'll just
put them on a ride called the Big Boudin that will squeeze them
through a giant tube and into their cars.'''

the boat. By JONATHAN BALCOMBE.

   PENNY-PINCHERS (Albany, N.Y.) _ Money 2000 is a modest Cornell
Cooperative Extension program that helps participants nationwide
set a goal of saving $2,000, or reducing their debt by that amount,
by the year 2000. Money 2000 methods are purposely simple and
realistic, participants in the program say. By MICHAEL LOPEZ.

   LIFESTYLE/FEATURES (``l'')
</P>
<P>
   MAKEUP (San Francisco) _ Makeup is the form that follows
fashion. And fashion this fall is very, very gray and luxuriously
textured. Cashmere on suede. Crushed velvets. Menswear stripes with
lace. Sequins glinting quietly under organza. The clothes are also
deceptively simple, mostly linear takeoffs on American sportswear,
gussied up in luxury fabrics. By CYNTHIA ROBINS.
</P>
<P>
   FASHION (San Francisco) _ San Francisco designer Jessica
McClintock has come a long way from dimity-and-lace empire hippie
dresses like the one Hillary Rodham was married in. But her focus
has remained the same _ romantic dresses for young women. By
CYNTHIA ROBINS.

   MAGIC-CRUISE (Aboard the Disney Magic) _ When it comes to the
family Caribbean cruise, Disney is, well, Magic. The ship Magic has
the look and feel of the great ocean liners of the 1930s.
Reportedly, a classic look was demanded by Disney chairman Michael
Eisner _ and he got it. Yet there are disappointments, including
the food and service. By JULIE COOPER.

<P>
   MOUNT-KATAHDIN (Mount Katahdin, Maine) _ Since early times,
artists and writers have sought to capture the mystique of this
great mass. Unlike native Americans who respected the mountain
spirits and stayed away, 19th-century white men set foot on
Katahdin, then encouraged other adventurers to join them. By FRED
STETSON.

<P>
   CAJUN-LAND (Lafayette, La.) _ A look at Cajun life and its
people. A people with an unfailing zest for life. Men and women who
treasure a rib-tickling joke, even if it's at their own expense;
who cherish a lovingly prepared meal accented by conversation as
free-flowing as the wine and as well-seasoned as the crawfish
gumbo; who step sprightly into the wee hours, intoxicated by the
beat of an accordion or fiddle. By HARRY SHATTUCK (Photo available

</P>
<P>
   CAJUN-DINING (Lafayette, La.) _ Think Cajun food, and the
prevailing images for many people are blackened catfish, gumbo,
boudin, jambalaya and spicy fried shrimp. You can find the best of
each in southwest Louisiana. By HARRY SHATTUCK (Photo available on
NYT photo service)
</P>
<P>
   CAJUN-WILDLIFE (New Iberia, La.) _ With its diverse habitats and
mild winters, southwest Louisiana brims with natural wonders, both
flora and fauna. By SYD KEARNEY (Photo available on NYT photo

</P>
<P>
   CAJUN-EVANGELINE (St. Martinville, La.) _ Come hear the stories

   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Thanks to the
Clinton-Lewinsky-Starr-Drudge-CNN-MSNBC gang, this nation is one
big hostile environment. Out at Candlestick on Wednesday a guy kept
telling the jokes of the moment, including one about President
Clinton wearing a pair of panties on his sleeve. A reporter asks
why, and Clinton says it's like the patch _ he's trying to quit. By
ROB MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   MATTHEWS-COLUMN (Washington) _ Like a prisoner scraping X's on
his cell wall, the president of the United States would check off
the calendar days he could not be with ``other women.'' This
graphic picture of Bill Clinton's dual life is among the more
arresting of 2,800 pages of material collected by the independent
counsel and released by the House Judiciary Committee. By
CHRISTOPHER MATTHEWS.
</P>
<P>
   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Ever since 1972, when I was a
new reporter at Sports Illustrated magazine and the annual swimsuit
issue came out, I have wished I had a huge button to wear on
certain occasions. The button would say: I DON'T MAKE POLICY, I
JUST WORK HERE. This past Monday, a giant sandwich board would have
been more in order. By STEPHANIE SALTER.
</P>
<P>
   HUMANE-TREATMENT (Washington) _ In the Humane Society's view,
requiring students to engage in practices harmful to animals is
unfair to students and inhumane to animals. Change, especially when
it involves an established tradition like dissection, doesn't come
easily. But it doesn't come at all until someone is ready to rock
the boat. By JONATHAN BALCOMBE.

A to F.
</P>
<P>
   Air Bud: Golden Receiver G
</P>
<P>
   If you're younger than 8, this ``Bud's'' for you. In this sequel
to ``Air Bud,'' Buddy, the hoop-shooting Golden Retriever, and his
boy, Josh (Kevin Zegers) trade basketball for football. Scriptwise,
it's little more than a glorified after-school special, but there
hasn't been much around for younger kids recently and it handles
its messages well. And so what if the movie is essentially a series
of Stupid Pet Tricks? In his K-9 jersey, pads and helmet, Buddy
looks more athletically heroic than Bruce Willis. 1 hour, 31
minutes. (ER) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Armageddon PG-13
</P>
<P>
   While ``Deep Impact'' treated a similar let's-save-Earth story
with sobriety, ``Armageddon'' never lets the threat of global
annihilation get in the way of fun. It's a space-cowboy movie, with
Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck saving the world for Liv Tyler. As a
summer popcorn movie, it's more enjoyable than that big-lizard
flick ``Godzilla.'' And you'll see the reported $165 million budget
onscreen in the impressive effects and mammoth sets. But is the
movie good for you? Probably not. Rated PG-13 for sci-fi disaster
action, implied sex and profanity. 2 hours, 24 minutes. (SM) Grade:
C
</P>
<P>
   The Avengers PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Visually, this update of the '60s TV series pays witty homage to
the original's vein of Carnaby Street surrealism. In between sips
of champagne and civilized quips, agents John Steed (Ralph Fiennes)
and Mrs. Emma Peel (Uma Thurman) foil criminals plotting against
the British government. But there are two problems: a half-baked
script and Thurman, who's trumped by the cool, feline memory of
Diana Rigg, who originated the role. (SM) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Blade R
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't cut it. Wesley Snipes stars as the half-vampire,
half-human hero who can handle sunlight but also has a taste for
blood. Armed with an arsenal of sci-fi gadgets, a really cool
leather coat and Kris Kristofferson (a kind of high-tech Gabby
Hayes), Blade is devoted to wiping out all vampires. Especially a
strutting bloodsucker played by Stephen Dorff. Alas, all the
non-stop slash 'n' gnash action becomes more repetitive than
anything else. Rated R for extreme violence and strong language. 2
hours. (ER) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Dance With Me PG
</P>
<P>
   A guilty, quick-stepping pleasure. Vanessa L. Williams plays a
Houston dance instructor who hopes to recapture past dance
competition glory with the help of a Cuban newcomer (Latin music
star Chayanne). Original it isn't, but ``Dance'' is great fun. It's
the first film that lets Williams show off her knockout dancing,
and in his first Hollywood flick, Chayanne goes for the summer's
heartthrob title. 2 hours, 6 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Dead Man on Campus R
</P>
<P>
   Some passable laughs, but it doesn't make the honor roll. Two
college students (Tom Everett Scott and Mark-Paul Gosselaar) hope a
kamikaze frat boy (Lochlyn Munro), will share their dorm suite.
And, preferably, kill himself in one of his misadventures. That's
because an odd clause at their college gives students an automatic
4.0 average if their roommate offs himself. Rated R for drug use,
language and crude sexual humor. At metro theaters. 1 hour, 36
minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Deep Impact PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The impact here is human, which is pretty gutsy since, going in,
we all know this is about a comet hurtling toward Earth. Showing at
area discount theaters, director Mimi Leder's thriller shows that
catastrophes can be measured one life at a time. The strong cast
includes Tea Leoni as an
</P>
<P>
   ambitious reporter and Robert Duvall as an aging astronaut sent
to blow the comet to bits. 2 hours, 3 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Disturbing Behavior R
</P>
<P>
   Disturbingly lame. This teens-in-peril flick is a high-concept
pitch with zero follow-through _ it's ``The Stepford Teens'' with a
touch of ``Invasion of the Body Snatchers.'' James Marsden plays a
newcomer to a small-town high school who encounters a band of
frighteningly clean-cut students. With the help of the school
psychiatrist (Bruce Greenwood), these fascist Archies ``recruit'' a
new classmate into their group every few days. Rated R for
profanity, violence and sex. 1 hour, 23 minutes. (SM) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dolittle PG-13
</P>
<P>
   This raucous but uninspired Eddie Murphy vehicle has almost
nothing to do with the old Rex Harrison musical. Murphy is John
Dolittle, a busy doctor who has neglected his wife (Kristen Wilson)
and his two daughters. One day, all kinds of animals start
pestering him vocally. Despite the zing of some nuttier moments,
the lame plot keeps dragging the movie to the ground. 1 hour, 30
minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Ever After PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Happily, this ``Ever After'' proves you can teach an old doll
new tricks. Re-inventing the Cinderella story in a way that targets
``Titanic''-loving teens more than Barney grads, the movie stars
Drew Barrymore as its spirited heroine, Anjelica Huston as her
scheming stepmother and Dougray Scott as a prince who's more than
just another trophy husband. Jeanne Moreau, doyenne of the French
New Wave, contributes a classy cameo. Rated PG-13 for emotional
situations (death of a father) and some violence. 2 hours. (ER)
Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Everest NR
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' This
44-minute documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm
that killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' Cameraman David Breashears
fills the screen with awesome vistas, but discreetly avoids the
piles of discarded oxygen tanks, human waste and frozen bodies that
now litter the trails of the mountain. This is a film whose cruel
beauty manages to celebrate the spirit of the climbers, while
making you question their sanity. 44 minutes. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   54 R
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan nightclub Studio 54 was a late-'70s blast of
neo-Roman decadence where everyone could be fabulous.
Unfortunately, writer-director Mark Christopher gives us a tired,
creaky fable about a small-town stud (Ryan Phillippe) who gets
seduced by the limelight, almost loses himself, but gets saved by
the right girl. The movie is as meek as Studio 54 was outrageous.
Rated R for sexuality, profanity, drug use. 1 hour, 33 minutes.
(SM) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Firelight R
</P>
<P>
   This Gothic romantic drama set in the 1830s could use a little
more fire and a lot lighter touch. Still, it burns with
intelligence, craft and pyschological resonance. A Swiss governess
(Sophie Marceau) agrees to bear a child for an aloof English
aristocrat (Stephen Dillane), then disappear from his life. But
their ``business'' arrangement is complicated by feelings both
romantic and maternal. A quiet, emotionally assured film that
respects its characters and its audience. 1 hour, 44 minutes. (ER)
Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Godzilla PG-13
</P>
<P>
   He's back. He's big. He's boring. There was probably no way this
extravagant update of ``Godzilla'' could live up to its yearlong
hype. What's depressing is how far it falls short of being even
solid summer escapism. Bikini atoll resident Godzilla comes to nest
in Manhattan when it's time to think of family matters. Matthew
Broderick is a biologist on the monster's trail. 2 hours, 19
minutes. (SM) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Halloween: H20 R
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Lee Curtis returns in this unsurprising 20th anniversary
sequel to John Carpenter's 1978 frightfest ``Halloween.'' Now,
she's a single mom to 17-year-old John (Josh Hartnett). Also back
is Michael Myers, the maniac who stalked Curtis all those years
ago. You can easily guess who'll survive and who'll get cut out of
the picture, literally. But when Curtis pulls a Sigourney Weaver, a
la ``Aliens,'' stalking Michael instead of fleeing him, the movie
finally gets some juice. Rated R for profanity, violence, gore,
alcohol use. 1 hour, 22 minutes. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   How Stella Got Her Groove Back R
</P>
<P>
   The screen version of Terry McMillan's novel tries to distract
us from its lack of plot with visual opulence. Angela Bassett plays
a fortysomething investment banker who takes a trip to Jamaica with
her best pal (Whoopi Goldberg), where she falls for a 20-year-old
local (Taye Diggs). Luckily, Bassett roots the picture with a
glowing performance, sharing with us Stella's unexpected moments of
emotional rediscovery. Rated R for sexual situations, nudity,
language. 2 hours, 4 minutes. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Knock Off R
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Claude Van Damme returns in _ surprise! _ an action movie
about an American salesman working in Hong Kong who becomes aware
of a terrorist conspiracy. Directed by Hong Kong action auteur Tsui
Hark. Not reviewed. Grade: NR
</P>
<P>
   Lethal Weapon 4 R
</P>
<P>
   The latest in director Richard Donner's cheerfully chaotic
blow-'em-up series re-pairs Mel Gibson's hothead cop Riggs, and
Danny Glover's long-suffering partner Murtaugh. Shaggy and amiable,
Number 4 hardly bothers to get its real plot going for its first
hour. More than ever, the film is an excuse to give its crack
supporting cast, including Joe Pesci and Chris Rock, a series of
comic riffs. Rated R for violence and profanity. 2 hours, 5
minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Madeline PG
</P>
<P>
   This is a faithful and fun adaptation of the series of
children's books about a precocious redheaded orphan living in a
girls' school. Set in the relatively uncomplicated 1950s and
breathtakingly filmed in Paris, it's fast-paced enough to appeal to
kids (even boys should take to the scooter-riding rascal Pepito)
and nostalgic enough for adults. 1 hour, 29 minutes. (Jill
Vejnoska, c. 1998 Cox News Service) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   The Mask of Zorro PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Derring-do done right. Our men in black are Anthony Hopkins and
Antonio Banderas, who double our swashbuckling pleasure and double
our fun as dual Zorros, saving California and Hopkins' beautiful,
spirited daughter (Catherine Zeta-Jones) from the evil schemes of
one Don Rafael (Stuart Wilson). It's an expert blend of panache,
romanticism and supple, tongue-in-cheek humor. 2 hours, 16 minutes.
(ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Mulan G
</P>
<P>
   The best Disney animated feature since ``Beauty and the Beast''
and ``The Lion King.'' Based on a 4th-century legend, it's about a
young girl who pulls a National Velvet, i.e., disguises herself as
a boy and goes to battle in her elderly father's place. This isn't
just a grand family film; it's a grand film, period. As Eddie
Murphy's little red dragon says, ``Mulan, you the man!'' 1 hour, 28
minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   The Negotiator R
</P>
<P>
   In this crisply acted thriller, Samuel L. Jackson plays a
hostage negotiator for the Chicago police department who is framed
for embezzlement and murder. Desperate to clear his name, he takes
four members of the department hostage, then asks another
negotiator (Kevin Spacey) to act as a mediator between himself and
his fellow officers. The film's main kick is the engrossing duel of
bluffs and counterbluffs between Spacey and Jackson. They make us
believe in the high stakes of the situation. Rated R for violence
and profanity. 2 hours, 15 minutes. (SM) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Next Stop, Wonderland R
</P>
<P>
   A small wonder in its own modest way. This charming low-budget
romantic comedy about the relationship travails of a Boston nurse
(Hope Davis) is stronger on character nuance than on plot; in fact,
filmmaker Brad Anderson loads it with too much plot. But by
applying a naturalistic independent-film sensibility to a vintage
glossy-Hollywood predicament, he comes out ahead. Think of a film
where John Cassavetes shares pillow talk with Doris Day. Rated R
for vulgar language and sexual situations. 1 hour, 36 minutes. (ER)
Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   One True Thing R
</P>
<P>
   Strikes too many false notes. Renee Zellweger plays a career
journalist who goes home to care for her dying homemaker mother
(Meryl Streep). Streep's performance is terrific, but the movie
suffers from generic slickness. 2 hour, 7 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   The Parent Trap PG
</P>
<P>
   Wisely, deviates little from the plot of the 1961 Disney film
that made 15-year-old Hayley Mills a star. This time Lindsay Lohan
plays the dual role of separated-practically-at-birth twins who
meet and switch identities in the hopes of reuniting their divorced
parents. Young kids may fidget at the length and several kissing
scenes. (Jill Vejnoska) 1 hour, 45 minutes. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Pecker R
</P>
<P>
   Edward Furlong plays a Baltimore kid whose grainy photos bring
him New York art-scene fame in John Waters' new comedy. Like all
Waters' films, it's a very mixed bag of raunch and sweetness, smart
satire and dumb comedy. 1 hour, 27 minutes. (ER) Grade C+
</P>
<P>
   Permanent Midnight R
</P>
<P>
   Permanent vanity production. This true-life story of a
successful sitcom writer (Ben Stiller) trying to kick his heroin
habit could use some time in movie rehab. Though it pretends to
explore the lower depths, Hollywood-style, it's actually a
self-serving, give-us-a-break ego trip that uses its shooting-up
scenes as shock tactics and its ``insider'' Hollywood talk as an
audience-flattering distraction. Stiller stays the course, but it's
all in vain (or in vein). 1 hour, 27 minutes. (ER) Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   Ronin R
</P>
<P>
   The title suggests a close friend of Rodan or Godzilla, but it
actually refers to shamed samurai who, having lost their master,
are for hire. Robert De Niro and Jean Reno lead some modern-day
``ronin'' _ Cold Warriors without a war _ hired to snatch a
mysterious suitcase. Veteran John Frankenheimer (``The Manchurian
Candidate'') and an unbilled David Mamet (``The Spanish Prisoner'')
bring a cool professional touch to this crackling
action-suspense-thriller that's fun and smart. 1 hour, 58 minutes.
(ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Rounders R
</P>
<P>
   Director John Dahl (``The Last Seduction'') has a couple of very
hot aces up his sleeve _ Matt Damon and Edward Norton _ in this
nifty movie about the addictive lure of high-stakes poker. Damon is
a former card sharp who's managed to kick the habit and concentrate
on his law studies. Norton is his old friend, fresh out of jail,
who lures him back. A pungent, character-rich picture that's a lot
less about where it goes than how it gets there. Rated R for nudity
and language. 2 hours. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Rush Hour PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Karate king Jackie Chan and fast-talking comedian Chris Tucker
play two cops whose clashes go way beyond cultural differences.
Thrown together by FBI agents who don't want either mucking up
their search for a kidnapped child, the pair drive each other
crazy, at first. You'll howl as Chan and Tucker learn to work
together, in part by imitating (sometimes badly) how the other one
works. 1 hours, 37 minutes. (Jill Vejnoska) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Saving Private Ryan R
</P>
<P>
   Part gung-ho heroism, part in-your-face horror show, Steven
Spielberg's superb film shows us World War II as we've never seen
it before. Tom Hanks leads a courageous squad (and excellent
ensemble cast) on a mission to find a private (Matt Damon) whose
three brothers have already been killed in combat. Hanks'
performance is a miracle of decency and subtle emotion, but kudos
all around here. And the opening D-Day sequence is the most
powerful combat footage ever created on film. Rated R for extreme
violence and some vulgar language. 2 hours, 50 minutes. (ER) Grade:
A
</P>
<P>
   Simon Birch PG
</P>
<P>
   A little movie with big problems. In the early 1960s, a
pre-adolescent dwarf named Simon Birch (Ian Michael Smith) is
convinced he will one day be a hero while his best pal (Joseph
Mazzello) tries to solve the mystery of his real father (Ashley
Judd is Mazzello's closemouthed mom). The movie is clearly a labor
of love; alas, it's also a labor to sit through. Rated PG for
violence (a scary bus accident) and sexual innuendo. 1 hour, 50
minutes. (ER) Grade: D-
</P>
<P>
   Six Days, Seven Nights PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Think ``Romancing the Stone'' only without the romance or the
adventure in this movie. Harrison Ford is a gruff charter pilot and
Anne Heche is a New York magazine editor. They wind up stranded on
an island near Tahiti _ an abandoned place, except for some
pirates. The pair bicker, bond and kick some pirate butt. 1 hour,
41 minutes. (SM) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Slums of Beverly Hills R
</P>
<P>
   A vivid, very funny look at coming of age on the fringes. Vivian
Abramowitz (Natasha Lyonne) is the odd girl out in a post-divorce
family led by a father (Alan Arkin) who, every three months or so,
skips out on rent and moves his brood to another fleabag on the
edge of Beverly Hills. Director Tamara Jenkins re-creates the daily
humiliations of adolescence with wince-inducing accuracy. And
Lyonne is terrific at navigating the waters of teen angst. Rated R
for nudity, profanity, sexual situations. 1 hour, 31 minutes. (SM)
Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Snake Eyes R
</P>
<P>
   Oscar winner Nicolas Cage and Brian De Palma are always worth
gambling on; while they don't come up total winners here, they're
hardly losers either. Cage plays a crooked Atlantic City cop who
finds himself in the middle of an assassination plot during a
heavyweight boxing match. Part detective story, part
action-thriller, the picture loses steam near the end, but De
Palma's wired camerawork and Cage's strutting energy help hold it
together. Rated R for violence and language. 1 hour, 42 minutes.
(ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries R
</P>
<P>
   Family matters and more are examined in this thoughtful
adaptation of Kaylie Jones' semi-autobiographical book about
growing up in the '60s and '70s (her father was writer James
Jones.) The scattered, vignette-ish approach may bother some _ the
movie is like a personal memoir divided into three separate but
equal short stories _ but the film's sense of memory as an
emotional tapestry made up of many people and incidents rings true.
2 hours, 4 minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   There's Something About Mary R
</P>
<P>
   Rude, crude and hilarious. Ben Stiller plays Ted, a nerdy high
school senior who suffers a bathroom mishap that keeps him from
attending his prom with the class golden girl (Cameron Diaz).
Thirteen years later, the still-obsessed Ted hires a gumshoe (Matt
Dillon) to track her down. The movie is liberating in its
scatological, slapstick way. But the easy-to-offend should find
something more polite to watch. 1 hour, 58 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   The Thief R
</P>
<P>
   This Russian fable of fathers and sons will steal into your
heart. In 1952, as Stalin inflicts his style of `'paternalism'' on
the Soviet Union, a 6-year-old boy and his young widowed mom are
wooed by a charming soldier (Vladmir Mashkov) who isn't what he
seems. As allegories go, this one's pretty transparent. But the
film's considerable strength lies in its poetic vignettes, telling
visual details and three wonderful performances. A 1997 Oscar
nominee for best foreign-language film. Rated R for sex, nudity and
language. Subtitles. 1 hour, 30 minutes. (ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   The Truman Show R
</P>
<P>
   Jim Carrey's excellent performance is the centerpiece of this
provocative social satire. It's about a cheerful insurance salesman
who slowly realizes his entire life has been a TV show and all the
people he knows are actors. Peter Weir directs this dazzlingly
executed concept and the strong cast includes Laura Linney and Ed
Harris. 1 hour, 44 minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Un Air de Famille NR
</P>
<P>
   No one does it to you like your own family. That's the message
in this acerbic yet amusing film about a French family's weekly
get-together to exchange grievances, insights, insecurities,
grievances, whatever. Much of what goes on is funny, but not
laugh-out-loud funny. More remorseful funny. Like in most families.
Subtitles. 1 hour, 47 minutes. (ER) Grade: B

   Urban Legend R
</P>
<P>
   Alicia Witt and Jared Leto star in the latest knockoff of
``Scream'' and ``I Know What You Did Last Summer.'' The
college-campus, teen-kill thriller is slickly made, well played,
instantly forgettable. 1 hour, 39 minutes. (SM) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Why Do Fools Fall in Love R
</P>
<P>
   This dark, dramatic biopic stars Halle Berry, Vivica A. Fox and
Lela Rochon as the women who were married to doo-wopper Frankie
Lymon, and whose court fight over his royalty ``estate'' clues us
to the singer's sorry life. Boasting some great late '50s and early
'60s rock sounds, this film, unfortunately, spins back and forth
narratively. Rated R for language, se scenes and drug use. 2
hours, 3 minutes. (The Hollywood Reporter) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Your Friends and Neighbors R
</P>
<P>
   Neil LaBute, who did the lacerating ``In the Company of Men,''
suffers a sophomore slump of sorts in this black comedy about sex
games and power plays among six thirtysomething urbanites. Rated R
for sex and language. 1 hour, 45 minutes. (ER) Grade: C+

THE UNJUST WAR THEORY 
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM SALETAN 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the videotape of his Aug. 17 testimony before the Lewinsky
grand jury, President Clinton finally laid out a moral theory to
explain his evasions.
</P>
<P>
   He believes he is the target of an unjust war, a series of
illegitimate investigations against which he is entitled to defend
himself and others by any technically legal means.
</P>
<P>
   Here is Clinton's moral theory, point by point, as expressed in
his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   _ His initial motives for covering up his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky were personal, not legal. First, he was embarrassed
by his behavior. Second, he was trying to protect his family.
Third, to the extent that he was trying to prevent the affair's
exposure, he thought the threat was posed by journalists, not by
prosecutors. ``I certainly didn't want this to come out, if I could
help it,'' said Clinton, explaining his efforts to help Lewinsky
hide their affair. ``I was embarrassed about it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The questions Jones' lawyers asked Clinton about Lewinsky were
illegitimate, because the Clinton-Lewinsky relationship wasn't
sexual harassment. ``Even if you look at the facts here in (the)
light most unfavorable to me,'' Clinton argued, ``no one has
suggested that there was any sexual harassment on my part.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Clinton exploited legal technicalities to frustrate the Jones
lawyers and was morally entitled to do so, because their lawsuit
against him had become an unjust political war. ``They knew they
had a lousy case on the facts. And so their strategy, since they
were being funded by my political opponents, was to have this
dragnet of discovery,'' said Clinton. ``They proceeded to cross the
country and try to turn up whatever they could. ... What they
wanted to do and what they did do and what they have done by the
time I showed up here was to find any negative information they
could on me, whether it was true or not. Get it in a deposition,
and then leak it, even though it was illegal to do so. ...(They
tried) to get any person in there, no matter how uninvolved with
Paula Jones, no matter how uninvolved with sexual harassment, so
they could hurt me politically.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton accused the Jones lawyers of a ``gotcha game,'' said
they ``were trying to set me up and trick me,'' and even accused
them of not being ``lawful in their conduct vis-a-vis me.''
Therefore, Clinton argued, ``in the face of their repeated illegal
leaking, it was not my responsibility to volunteer a lot of
information.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The video is an extension of Kenneth Starr's unjust war. This
is Clinton's masterstroke. Knowing the video would be released, he
planted a bomb in the hope it would blow up in Starr's face. Toward
the end of his testimony, he looked at the camera and said,
``There's a videotape being made of this, allegedly because only
one member of the grand jury is absent. This is highly unusual. ...
So I think I am right to answer all the questions about perjury but
not to say things which would be forever in the historic annals of
the United States because of this unprecedented videotape (that)
may be leaked at any time.''

POLITICIANS AND PRIVACY: A DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  By MICHAEL KINSLEY and THOMAS NAGEL 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   From: MICHAEL KINSLEY
</P>
<P>
   To: Thomas Nagel
</P>
<P>
   Dear Professor Nagel,
</P>
<P>
   I have been arguing about this (with myself, among others) for
two decades. My argument has been that the private lives of
politicians are often fair game for three reasons:
</P>
<P>
   First, hypocrisy. Politicians don't really attempt to keep their
private lives private. They don't say: ``Stay away from my wife.
Don't take pictures of me playing with my kids or talking to the
minister on my way out of church. My private life is nobody else's
business.'' They do not insist on the importance of maintaining
separate public and private spheres, as you do in your article.
Instead, they present an image of their private lives that may or
may not be accurate. If it is not accurate, they are in essence
lying to the voters. And if they'll lie about one thing, they'll
lie about others--which is something voters are entitled to know.
</P>
<P>
   Second, exploitation. The typical ``politician's private life''
story involves a married male politician carrying on with a much
younger woman in a relationship that basically trades use of her
body for a brief sharing of his aura of power or glamour. Even if
the particular woman involved is perfectly satisfied with the
bargain--even if both women, the wife included, are satisfied with
their bargains--this behavior suggests that the politician has a
crass (are we still allowed to say ``unliberated''?) view of women.
And more: It suggests by implication an exploitative attitude
toward people in general.
</P>
<P>
   A willingness to use people like this--and to use your official
position to use people--is also something voters are entitled to
know about.
</P>
<P>
   Third, democracy. Never mind what I think--or even what you
think, professor. The proper test for a journalist trying to decide
whether to publish some information about a politician's private
life is not whether it is politically relevant in his or her own
judgment but whether it is politically relevant in the judgment of
his or her readers. (Not merely interesting--that's too easy--but
politically relevant.)
</P>
<P>
   And my assumption for most of the past two decades has been that
most people do find a politician's adultery a legitimate factor in
casting their votes, even if I and my friends might believe it
doesn't matter. In fact (I have often asserted), people who believe
that this stuff should stay private are motivated more by other
people's interest than by their own indifference. They want to deny
people information because people will use it to reach the wrong
conclusion. And that's anti-democratic.
</P>
<P>
   As for Clinton, let's take my three points one by one. First,
it's too bad that he'll be best remembered for lying about
adultery, since he actually, for a while, came closer than any
national politician ever has to saying, ``I make no great claims
about my private life, so don't call me a hypocrite for failing to
meet my own standards.'' In the '92 campaign, he admitted to a
``flawed'' marriage and, implicitly, to screwing around.
Unfortunately, he also implied the flaws were repaired. (And I
believed him!)
</P>
<P>
   Second, in terms of what a style of sexual activity says about a
person's attitude toward women and people in general, Clinton looks
very bad. It's tempting to say that his exploitative sexual habits
expose his famous human empathy as a complete fraud. But I think
that's too hard: Don't forget, life is complicated. Still, for an
admirer, it's dismaying.
</P>
<P>
   On Point 3, I seem to have got it utterly backward. My notion
was that we media sophisticates and inside-the-Beltway types could
shrug off private sexual indiscretions like adultery, but we had no
right to deny information to the masses of people ``out there'' who
did not shrug it off.
</P>
<P>
   With Flytrap, though, Outside the Beltway is where folks are
shrugging it off, and Inside the Beltway is aflame with righteous
moralism. And I suppose that if most people really don't care about
it, it's no longer elitist and anti-democratic not to tell them
about it.
</P>
<P>
   Over to you.
</P>
<P>
   From: THOMAS NAGEL
</P>
<P>
   To: Michael Kinsley
</P>
<P>
   Dear Michael,
</P>
<P>
   Let me react to your three objections in their strong form,
which you later qualify--since they present an important view.
</P>
<P>
   Hypocrisy: Strictly, this means professing values you do not
hold and denouncing others for conduct that you engage in yourself.
To answer your first question, that kind of hypocrisy deserves
exposure, even if it means publicizing the sex lives of moralistic
evangelists and politicians. Helen Chenoweth got what she deserved.
</P>
<P>
   But you include under hypocrisy something else, which is also a
problem of American politics--the standard presentation of the
candidate as human exemplar and glowing family ideal. I agree with
you that this has provided an opening for media intrusiveness, and
think we would be much better off if politicians never dragged
their families into the limelight. But they are now stuck with the
practice, whether they like it or not, and the public-private
boundary has to be drawn at a different place.
</P>
<P>
   If it is generally recognized that the familial frame in which
politicians are presented is a convention, there is no point in
exposing it, any more than there is a point in exposing the social
conventions of politeness as dishonest. Kennedy was packaged as a
devoted family man. Do you think the public interest would have
been advanced by his sexual exposure?
</P>
<P>
   You suggest a blanket requirement of truthfulness, but anyone
who has been around for a while knows that the unvarnished truth at
full volume is tolerable only in limited doses and that a great
deal is better left unsaid or covered up. Perhaps you wouldn't
trust someone who lied about his sex life. I wouldn't trust someone
who didn't, some of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Exploitation: This is precisely one of those issues that is
forced on us when intimate relations become public, but which there
is no reason to settle publicly. My view is that while people often
behave badly in sexual relations of any kind, as they do in
familial relations, no generalizations about who in such cases is
exploiting or maltreating whom are worth anything.
</P>
<P>
   But the real point is that our different responses to this kind
of story, strongly opposed as they may be, are irrelevant to
political judgment, yet they crowd out what is relevant. Visceral
feelings of either sympathy or outrage with the sexual couplings of
middle-aged statesmen and their breathless groupies are just
personal reactions and will take us nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Only a pathological communitarianism would insist that we come
together as a society to arrive at a collective conclusion about
the right attitude to such an episode. As with truthfulness, you
suggest that there is a single vice called ``using'' people, which
generalizes across contexts. But people are more complicated than
that, and we already have enough on our plates in trying to
evaluate the public conduct of public figures.
</P>
<P>
   Democracy: As you say, the general public seems in the present
case more sensible than those people who modestly call themselves
the ``elites,'' with respect to the political relevance of sexual
information. But you pose a difficult question about the role of
the press in a different climate. If puritanism is culturally
dominant, should the press still adhere to the convention, one that
serves the interest of all parties, that private embarrassments
will not be aired for political gain? Of course a puritan climate
will help sustain that convention by directly inhibiting the press.
</P>
<P>
   I don't have a theory of the ethics of journalism, but if you
propose to evaluate journalistic practices by their contribution to
democracy, I think there is a good case against giving prominent
and relentless coverage, and against allocating large investigative
resources, to material that is a) irresistibly gripping and
salacious; b) of negligible intrinsic political importance; and c)
likely to drastically reduce the choice of available candidates on
trivial grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The destructive effect on the space of public discourse of the
introduction into it of such material was predictable in advance by
anyone with any imagination at all, but now it has been established
empirically. The effect is out of all proportion to the importance
of the facts even in the estimation of people who think they matter
politically.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary people understand this, but many journalists have a
professional interest in being blind to it, apparently. At the time
of Gary Hart's exposure, I saw an exchange on television between a
reporter and a woman he stopped in the street. He asked her whether
Hart's adultery would make it impossible for her to vote for him,
and she said yes. He then asked whether she was glad to know about
it, and she said no, she wished she hadn't been told. She was not
being irrational.
</P>
<P>
   My respects,
</P>
<P>

DISNEY MAGIC DOESN'T ALWAYS LIVE UP TO ITS NAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE COOPER  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOARD THE DISNEY MAGIC _ Maybe the best thing about this
brand-new, 85,000-ton, 2,400-passenger ship is the cabin bathroom,
er, head.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there are gleaming teak decks, the ESPN sports bar, Palo's
adults-only restaurant, a colorful comedy and Western-themed dance
club and, of course, Mickey Mouse's likeness.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``bath and a half'' in my cabin made a lasting
impression. The two-room john with a toilet/sink and
sink/shower/tub combination can be found in most of the 875 cabins
on the $350 million Magic. The generous bathroom space is unusual
in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention that the cabins also are 25 percent bigger than
industry average, and 75 percent are outside cabins.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the family Caribbean cruise, Disney is, well,
Magic.
</P>
<P>
   The ship Magic has the look and feel of the great ocean liners
of the 1930s. Reportedly, a classic look was demanded by Disney
chairman Michael Eisner _ and he got it.
</P>
<P>
   Even the music that wafts through the ship takes you back. Any
minute you expect Fred and Ginger to come gliding by. Then Kenee
Ledford in the Sessions lounge plays ``Night and Day'' on the grand
piano, and the mood is sealed.
</P>
<P>
   While adults enjoy the popular hangout, one of several on the
ship, the kids can immerse themselves in Disney's Oceaneer Club
(3-to-8-year-olds) or the Oceaneer Lab (9-12).
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty on board to keep the kids busy. This is Disney,
after all.
</P>
<P>
   Activities for the 3-12 set begin around noon and last until
midnight. Teens can enjoy the run of the ship or enjoy music videos
and games in Common Grounds, a coffee and music bar. Pagers are
provided so parents can keep in contact.
</P>
<P>
   At Mickey's Children's Pool on Deck 9, a lifeguard named Mary is
watching the kids come down the water slide. Only small fry _ ages
4 to 12 _ can use the slide, and the water is shallow. There also
are Goofy's Family Pool and the Quiet Cove Adult Pool.
</P>
<P>
   While the kids are kept busy in organized activities, Mom and
Dad can wander the ship. Finding the way around isn't too hard, not
like the new class of megaships that other cruise lines are
churning out.
</P>
<P>
   Guests get a ``Magic Passport'' and a ``Guide to Magic'' that
answers questions and includes maps. A ``Personal Navigator'' is
provided with a daily list of activities on board.
</P>
<P>
   Want to see a first-run movie or play bingo for prizes? How
about checking out the shops or watching a big-big screen game in
the ESPN Skybox? Tough choices, especially on a short cruise.
</P>
<P>
   For entertainment, there is a wide variety found on Beat Street.
Off Beat has a coed improv troupe from the Midwest and a 1970s
retro decor. The Rockin' Bar D rotates live rock 'n' roll with
country music for the dancers. Jazz fans will gravitate to the
Promenade Lounge, where a stylish trio mixes it up with a vocalist.
</P>
<P>
   The whole family can dance to top-40 tunes at Studio Sea, which
doubles as a TV game show set for daytime entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Three Broadway-type musicals take turns on stage at the Walt
Disney Theater, three times a night. ``Hercules _ A Muse-ical
Comedy,'' ``Voyage of the Ghost Ship'' and ``Disney Dreams'' are
all G-rated. The swashbuckling hero-meets-the-princess story of
``Ghost Ship'' has special effects, but not enough to keep the
small ones glued to their seats or the older folks from yawning.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the Disney feeling is too much, such as when the
ship's horn blasts the opening lines to ``When You Wish Upon a
Star.'' You don't want to be sitting around the pool deck when it
blows because it is LOUD.
</P>
<P>
   While Mickey's physical presence is limited _ having a picture
taken with embarking passengers and joining Minnie for a stroll
around deck _ his likeness is found in many places, from the soap
in the cabin baths to the mouse-ear shape on walls and light
fixtures. Just as at Walt Disney World, there are a multitude of
tie-ins with other Disney products and films.
</P>
<P>
   Lumiere's, the main dining room, has a ``Beauty and the Beast''
theme complete with roses under glass on the tables. The
restaurant's motto may be ``A dinner here is never second best,''
but neither the service nor the food was very impressive. The menu
of seafood platters, ravioli, lamb and sirloin was uninspiring and
sometimes inedible. It certainly wasn't the ``exquisite continental
cuisine with a French flair'' touted in the publicity materials.
</P>
<P>
   The Animators Palace restaurant was praised for the quality of
the food and the special effects; the black-and-white room
eventually comes to life as a color palette.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   At Parrot Cay, the theme is Caribbean, and Jimmy Buffett music
permeates. Palo's, a Northern Italian restaurant for adults only,
requires reservations and you can't make those in advance of
sailing. A $5 per person charge is added for Palo's dining.
</P>
<P>
   Rotation dining guarantees that you will sample three of the
dining rooms, and the wait staff moves with you. (This makes it
easy come tipping time.) For casual dining or lunch, there is the
buffet at Topsiders, Pluto's Dog House, Pinocchio's Pizzeria (it
tastes like frozen pizza) and Scoops Ice Cream. There also is
24-hour room service with a menu limited to eight items.
</P>
<P>
   Another adult experience is the Vista Spa &AMP; Salon. Passengers
aboard the first few cruises stampeded the spa, snapping up the
reservations the minute they boarded, so now the reservations desk
opens at 3 p.m. Offerings include massages, aromatherapy, sauna,
steam room and facials (all treatments cost extra).
</P>
<P>
   The first stop for Magic is Nassau, where there is an abundance
of real Bahamian excursions to sample _ casinos, fishing,
snorkeling, scuba tours, the Straw Market, Crystal Cay Marine Park
and the beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Castaway Cay, the private Bahamian island that Disney has
developed, is the last stop on the cruise. The island might have
been the brainchild of Gilligan, if only he had been an idea man.
It's Sea World's Lost Lagoon, only bigger _ 1,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Disney Imagineers came up with the idea that a crew of
oceanographic explorers chasing a giant whale settled on the island
with their families. There's an air of 1940s nostalgia, with old
prop planes on the landing strip.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Durham, senior development manager for Disney Imagineering,
developed 55 acres on the island.
</P>
<P>
   The island, which houses 30 to 35 full-time Disney employees,
will be a model eco-resort with recycling or ``clean''
incineration.
</P>
<P>
   Durham's favorite spot? ``Heads-Up Bar, you get to see
everything else,'' Durham says.
</P>
<P>
   During a typical eight-hour stop at the island, visitors can
rent a bike ($5), a Kargo Kart or stroller ($5), a float ($5) or
just lie on the sandy beach. There also are sailboats, kayaks,
paddle boats, rafts and inflatable motorboats for rent. Eventually,
fishing charters will be added.
</P>
<P>
   Castaway Cay is divided into family, teen and adult beach areas.
Parents will be happy to see so many lifeguards on duty, both on
shore and out in the water on floating lifeguard chairs/stands.
</P>
<P>
   Beach-side bands play island music _ heavy on the Buffett songs
again _ and dining is buffet-style with sheltered picnic tables at
Cookie's Bar-B-Q. There also are beach bars and roaming wait staff
selling water ($1.95) and sodas ($1.50).
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who missed a massage at Vista Spa &AMP; Salon might want to
book one in one of the cabanas at Castaway Cay (massages do cost
extra).
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry about carrying cash on board the Magic or at
Castaway Cay; there is a plastic guest card (the Key to the World
card) that not only serves as cabin key, but works as a credit
card. Luckily, parents can put a dollar limit so the kids don't OD
on sodas or video games. The card works the same way at Walt Disney
World resort as part of the seven-day cruise/land package.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney Magic, which departs from Port Canaveral, Fla., is
sailing at 100 percent capacity, says Amy Foley, manager of public
relations, but travel agents are holding many blocks and
re-selling.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ On the day the U.S. news media lost their
collective mind, I made a brief stop at my office, ran out the
door, jumped into my car and tried to get as far away from
journalism as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Like every other mainstream newspaper and every large radio and
TV network in this country, my newspaper had prepared for the day
as though World War III had begun: Strategy sessions. Extra
personnel. Early starting times. Staff on red alert.
</P>
<P>
   But of course, it was not World War III. It was instead the
public airing of a 4-hour-and-3-minute videotape of the president
of the United States testifying before a grand jury about an
extramarital affair he had with a woman over the age of consent.
</P>
<P>
   Heading across the Golden Gate Bridge, I listened on my car
radio to the last 20 minutes of the president's testimony. When it
was over, two reporters talked about how he hadn't blown up, lost
his cool or stomped out of the room as had been widely rumored _
and reported. When legal ``analysts'' began to dissect the
testimony, I switched to a classical music station.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, a treasured friend and I sat down at an outdoor
table, overlooking a picturesque little town square. When our
waitress asked, ``How are you folks today?'' I said, ``We're great.
We're not watching any videotapes.''
</P>
<P>
   The waitress narrowed her eyes and put her hands on her hips.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got up today, I turned on the TV like I always do while
I'm getting ready for work,'' she said. ``But I had only two
choices: That video or `Sesame Street.' I picked `Sesame Street.'
God, the media make me sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the effect it might have on poverty, homelessness,
cancer research, relations with China, teen suicide, gender pay
inequities, the disintegrating ruble, the disappearing ozone layer
or public schools if the nation's entire news media focused solely
upon that one subject for four straight hours on a weekday morning.
</P>
<P>
   But, no. As if all life and freedom depended upon it, mainstream
journalism chose to spend four hours _ uninterrupted by commercials
_ on a married man's account of a half-baked affair.
</P>
<P>
   After my lunch, in which my friend and I turned our backs on
Monica and Bill and talked of such trifles as Kant, Catholicism,
God, compassion and love, I drove a few miles to visit another
treasured friend. A retired editor, this man knows more about
journalism than any 50 people in any American newsroom today.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, how much do you miss the biz on a day like this?'' I
asked.
</P>
<P>
   The man cackled and began an angry but erudite diatribe that
lasted nearly 30 minutes. One by one, he shot down every offered
rationale for the wild excess of news coverage we have witnessed
over the last several months.
</P>
<P>
   His best shot was this: ``They keep saying, `We're not covering
this because of the sex but because he's the president and he
lied,''' the editor said. ``The lying makes it a big story. OK.
Fine. Let me ask you this: Let's say Clinton's doctors tell him he
shouldn't eat any more cheeseburgers. They're bad for him and
they'll make him fat. Clinton stands up and gives a big speech
vowing never to eat cheeseburgers again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, along comes Monica. She says, `Hey, you know you love
cheeseburgers. Go ahead. Just once in awhile. I'll make them for
you. Nobody ever has to know, it's just between us.' Clinton starts
eating cheeseburgers, but any time he's asked, he lies and says he
isn't. You still interested in that story? You going to put it on
A-1? Is Sam Donaldson going to stand up at every news conference
and ask the president about cheeseburgers? Why not? This story is
big because of the lying, not the sex, right?''
</P>
<P>
   As I said, the editor is retired from journalism. On Monday
night, that status never looked more attractive to me.

BILL CLINTON'S CHECKERED COUNTDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHRISTOPHER MATTHEWS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Like a prisoner scraping X's on his cell wall, the
president of the United States would check off the calendar days he
could not be with ``other women.''
</P>
<P>
   This graphic picture of Bill Clinton's dual life is among the
more arresting of 2,800 pages of material collected by Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr and released this week by the House Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president told Lewinsky that it was difficult for him to
resist being with other women ... that he kept a calendar on how
long he had been good. The president explained that during his life
he had been two people, and kept up two fronts, that starting in
the third or fourth grade he was a good boy with his mother and
stepfather, but also began telling stories and leading a secret
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The question for the U.S. Congress this autumn of discontent is
whether that ``secret life'' can ever be truly separated from the
public life of the president or the country. Can we entrust Bill
Clinton, commander in chief, to send men to their deaths in battle
overseas knowing his deceit on a matter so close to home? Can we
trust Clinton's ``secret life'' not to jump out and scuttle, as it
has these past nine months, his on-camera performance?
</P>
<P>
   Bill and Hillary Clinton argue we can. History argues otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that the minute there was no longer any contact, she
would talk about this. She would have to. She couldn't help it. It
was ... part of her psyche.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I put myself at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the president sharing with grand jurors his dread
premonition that the young West Wing employee with whom he'd struck
up a relationship would one day loom before him as a terrifying,
real-life antagonist straight out of ``Fatal Attraction.''
</P>
<P>
   But if he sensed from the outset that Monica would ``talk,'' why
did he risk it? Why did he begin an affair so dangerous that he
would feel compelled to lie about it under oath?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's advocates will say that he was simply unlucky _
unlucky to become involved with someone who would tell at least 11
people about her presidential affair, unfortunate to face
adversaries so ruthless they would tape Monica telling her story,
an independent counsel so goody-two-shoes that he'd nail him for
perjury in a sex matter.
</P>
<P>
   But what a streak of bad luck! First, Gennifer Flowers goes to
the Star _ a tabloid in this case _ with her hot story of Little
Rock love. Then came Paula Jones with her lawsuit. Then came
Kathleen Willey with an account of Oval Office harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Why, we have to ask, does Clinton's sex life merge so
continually with his public life? If he wanted to keep affairs away
from the office, why has he continued to forge ahead with them at
the office? If he believes his sex life is none of our business,
then why does he so predictably make it part of his?
</P>
<P>
   ``Humpty Dumpty had a great fall,'' goes the nursery rhyme,
``and all the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't put
Humpty together again.''
</P>
<P>
   The question before us now is whether we can ever pull the two
Bill Clintons _ the official and the ``secret'' _ apart again.

PROGRAM HELPS PEOPLE LIVE WITHIN THEIR MEANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL LOPEZ  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In a country where Americans carry an average of
five credit cards in their wallets, with a standing monthly balance
of almost $3,000, and where we grudgingly pay about $4 for a
typical lunch instead of bringing it to work, it is a little
difficult to believe there are people out there like Susan Cotner.
</P>
<P>
   Cotner has just two infrequently used credit cards. When she
paid off her $250 monthly car loan last year, she continued to pay
herself, saving that amount for the time when she will have to buy
another car.
</P>
<P>
   If all of this saving and budgeting sounds confining, Cotner
finds that, on the contrary, living within her means imparts a
certain freedom. ``Setting a budget can be liberating,'' Cotner
said, ``because you know you can live within this certain amount.''
</P>
<P>
   She joins a cadre of similarly budget-minded folks, spread
throughout the nation, who have calculated that making a turkey
sandwich at home costs about $1.18 _ with chips and a soda _
compared with spending almost $4.25 for the same lunch at a
cafeteria or deli. They are forgoing magazine subscriptions,
instead reading them at the public library, and taking their turn
at car-pooling just once a month.
</P>
<P>
   These people have made a significant leap _ from knowing these
common-sense tips will save money to actually practicing these
habits _ through Money 2000, a modest Cornell Cooperative Extension
program that helps participants nationwide set a goal of saving
$2,000, or reducing their debt by that amount, by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Money 2000 methods _ from advice on skipping the morning
indulgence of coffee and doughnuts to detailed tracking of every
expense _ are purposely simple and, hopefully, realistic.
</P>
<P>
   If such steps are so obvious, why is there is need for a program
of personal finance?
</P>
<P>
   Simply, for the same reasons we write ourselves notes or make
to-do lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been proven that if you have a goal in mind, and
transfer it to paper, you're going to increase your chances of
success,'' said Lisa Verstandig, the Cornell Cooperative Extension
agent who oversees Albany County's Money 2000. ``It's there, it's
in front of you. It's flashing in your face.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimming expenses, too, is a bit like losing weight, Verstandig
reasons; we all know that sound nutrition and exercise are keys to
weight loss, but joining a gym or finding a work-out partner can
provide the incentive to get off of the couch.
</P>
<P>
   For $10, participants receive a workbook, instructing them how
to keep track of savings and debt, set financial goals and devise a
spending plan. Quarterly newsletters support clients with articles
on loan consolidation, for instance, ways to make your car last and
columns about on-line services for finding discount airline tickets
or frugal living. Members also can attend free seminars, such as
one on budgeting for the holidays. In some areas, they meet with
budget counselors.
</P>
<P>
   Based on subscribers' own input, Money 2000 recently reported
some eye-opening ways that savings can add up: making that turkey
sandwich at home, rather than spending $4.24 for lunch at work, can
save $750 yearly; reading four popular magazines at the library can
save about $160 in subscriptions, or almost $400 if you buy them at
the newsstand.
</P>
<P>
   A strong economy by no means implies that Americans are
debt-free. A 1995 survey by the Federal Reserve showed that
respondents carried an average outstanding monthly balance of
nearly $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can join Money 2000, regardless of income or their
savings goal.
</P>
<P>
   Do not expect a lot of hand-holding. Cooperative Extension asks
for just two progress reports a year and counselors realize that
people will put as much or as little effort as they want into a
savings plan.
</P>
<P>
   Cotner, for example, is the first to admit that she does not use
some of Money 2000's more detailed worksheets on savings and debt.
Still, Money 2000 has forced her to think more specifically about
making the most of her money.
</P>
<P>
   She set goals for saving for an IRA, for her next car and for
the installation of a second bathroom in her home. ``I probably
would not have made such a concrete goal of saving for another
car'' without enrolling in Money 2000, she said.

 &HT;    THE MORAL AUTHORITY TO LEAD: COULD CLINTON HAVE SPOKEN AT
GETTYSBURG?
 &HT;    DUPLICATION ALERT: Moving in (k) commentary and (w) Washington
categories.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON The year was 1863, the nation was torn by civil war
that had already claimed more than 100,000 lives and the president
was struggling against virulent political forces eager to abandon
the fight against a rebellion that had split the country in two.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, in a three minute speech, Abraham Lincoln rallied a
war-weary people around the cause of freedom through union and
refined the purpose and identity of the nation, in what may be the
single greatest use in American history of the sheer weight of one
man's character and the authority of the office he holds.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred and thirty five years after Lincoln's Gettysburg
Address, the nation is a house divided once more, this time by the
leader himself, who's own moral authority is at the center of a
battle raging in Congress and the American public over whether
President Clinton is fit to serve.
</P>
<P>
   To ask the question as a historian might, imagine for a moment
that on Nov. 19, 1863, Lincoln's own moral authority were somehow
comparable to that of Bill Clinton's today.
</P>
<P>
   Could such a man have gone to Gettysburg?
</P>
<P>
   Could he have stood on that hallowed and haunted ground, where
just months before 50,000 Americans, North and South, had been
killed, wounded, or went missing?
</P>
<P>
   Could he have called on the memory of that incalculable
sacrifice to ask his bleeding nation to carry on the fight for as
long as it would take so that, in Lincoln's own words, ''...these
dead shall not have died in vain; that this nation, under God,
shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the
people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the
earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Could Lincoln have done that on the moral currency Clinton now
commands?
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course not,'' said Lincoln scholar Gabor S. Boritt,
director of the Civil War Institute at Gettysburg College.
''Lincoln had substantial moral authority, and it was central to
his administration.''
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the republic does not rest on the outcome of the sex
and deception scandal hanging over Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The country he governs, for better and worse, is vastly
different from the land Lincoln fought to hold together.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton's own fortunes will be decided more by
constitutional rulings and raw politics than by the judgment of
ethicists or historians.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton's troubles with Monica Lewinsky have posed
profound questions about the nature of moral authority, and the
role it plays in the modern presidency.
</P>
<P>
   There are basically two ways that presidents impel others to
make sacrifices or take risks for the good of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The first is through the constitutional powers vested in a
president by the awesome voice of the voters, in the only political
act the country performs as one _ the quadrennial election of the
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   There was no question, for instance, about President Truman's
constitutional authority to sack Gen. Douglas MacArthur for
insubordination to the commander in chief during the Korean War,
even though MacArthur had become an American icon whose own moral
authority rivaled, if not surpassed, that of Truman's in the public
mind.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution, however, provides presidents with only a bare
bones job description.
</P>
<P>
   ''The constitutional blueprint tells us very little about how a
president will be able to govern, or whether a president will be
able to govern. It's a set of possibilities,'' said government and
constitutional law expert Carol Nackenoff, who chairs the political
science department at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania. ''A great
deal depends upon the political skills, the judgment, the credit
that a president is able to build.''
</P>
<P>
   The second way a president leads is through moral authority
trust, largely. That imbues a president with the power to use the
bully pulpit to mobilize public opinion at home and abroad, to be
the decisive force in high stakes negotiations or to persuade
reluctant legislators, bureaucrats or heads of state to embrace the
uncertainty that often accompanies change.
</P>
<P>
   It is, in other words, essential to the effective leadership of
the last remaining superpower in a world of opportunity and peril.
</P>
<P>
   If moral authority enables a president to lead as much by who
they are as by the office they hold, there is no one path to
attaining the empowerment it brings, nor is there always agreement
as to precisely what constitutes moral authority.
</P>
<P>
   There is, for instance, personal stature, what Americans
sometimes regard as the key ingredient in a natural leader.
</P>
<P>
   In a nation whose beginnings, and much of its continuing
strength, rest largely on military achievement, it's no surprise
that a long string of generals George Washington, Robert E. Lee,
Dwight D. Eisenhower and Colin Powell spring quickly to mind
command moral authority of the highest order in the minds of most
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Jefferson's legacy of moral authority stems more from
intellectual and creative horsepower perhaps unsurpassed in the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   For standing strong in the face of adversity, few could rival
the record of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who confronted the Great
Depression and the only truly global conflict in history, though
certainly John F. Kennedy is remembered for soldiering through,
however imperfectly, some of the darkest days of the Cold War,
while challenging the intransigence and hostility of his own
countrymen in the Civil Rights struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Personal fortitude, of the sort represented by Martin Luther
King Jr., has been another source of moral authority for American
leaders, as has the powerful example of a disciplined life lived as
a force for good, as exemplified by Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Hero-making, however, is a trade that must bear the burdens of
history, and moral authority is best viewed through the eye of the
beholder.
</P>
<P>
   To the 13 percent of Americans who trace their ancestors to the
tragedy of American slavery, Washington and Jefferson, slaveholders
both, are hardly the revered pillars of ethics they represent to
American whites.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for many black Americans, who have stood hard by Clinton
during his trial by scandal, his relationship with Monica Lewinsky
matters far less than the positions he's taken on matters of race.
That's an issue Clinton has worked, through policies and dialogue,
to keep on the front burner of national concerns, much as he's done
with health care, education, crime, Social Security and the need to
balance the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   That helps to explain, in the minds of Clinton's backers at
least, why the majority of Americans continue to support him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do think that Americans have a moral compass, and if 60
percent of them are approving of him, at some level he still must
exert, on some issues, moral authority,'' said Geri Denterlein, a
media consultant who listened to Clinton at a glitzy
$1,000-per-plate Democratic fund-raising dinner in Boston earlier
this month. ''He has an ability to lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a wounded political warhorse waging one last campaign,
Clinton is fighting to regain his moral credibility, largely by
reminding constituents like Denterlein of how well he represents
their aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   That can help him, Nackenoff said, if it's combined with a
larger strategy that also includes high profile diplomacy such as
Clinton's appearance last week at the United Nations, where he drew
a standing ovation from some 1,100 diplomats and heads of state.
Similarly, she said, ceremonial opportunities such as awarding
South African President Nelson Mandela with the Congressional Gold
Medal as he did last week in the Capitol Rotunda can help showcase
his ample rhetorical gifts. ''Rhetorical skills can convey moral
authority, as in the case of Lincoln,'' said Nackenoff. ''This
ability to use your rhetorical skills to tell stories about what
America is, who we are, what we have been and where we're going...I
think he (Clinton) has a feel for telling those kinds of stories
and making those stories about middle America or about our values
as a nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Clinton had been elected on the basis of his moral
credibility, many analysts contend, the blows to his leadership
might well be mortal.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bill Clinton was elected with people clearly knowing he had
moral failings, so this isn't a great shock,'' said Frank Newport,
editor in chief of the Gallup Poll. Its national surveys
consistently show that while many Americans 49 percent, according
to Gallup's latest poll of 631 adults taken Sept. 21 claim they
don't trust Clinton, a large majority 66 percent believe he's doing
his job well.
</P>
<P>
   That's the explanation for the gap between the personal
confidence the public claims to have, or not have, in the
president, and the polls suggesting that 66 percent, according to
Gallup, say he should remain in office.
</P>
<P>
   In a perfect world, these polls suggest, Americans would like to
believe in their president, though many appear willing to accept
competent management from Clinton, in good times at least, so long
as they think he means well.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a reasonable person,'' said political scientist Terry
Sullivan. ''He is a likeable guy, he appears to be sincere and
genuine and he does tell us what is right and what is wrong and he
does tell us what we need to do as Americans, what we ought to be
doing if our better angels were running our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton exemplifies, ''leadership which is moral in intent it's
intent is to accomplish good things,'' said Sullivan, an associate
professor at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. ''I
think that kind of moral leadership has a powerful influence on
most Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all that a nation asks of its leader, there may be no more
less forgiving a requirement than that they mirror those ''better
angels'' to which Sullivan refers. As Clinton has demonstrated,
perhaps even learned, Americans don't elect leaders to remind us of
our many shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, is it fair, is it even meaningful, for this country, a
sometimes morally-disoriented television nation largely inhabited
by an anything-goes culture that looks mostly to the Dow as a
measure of its collective worth, to hold Clinton to the gold
standard of presidential leadership?
</P>
<P>
   Or are we as nation simply fooling ourselves into believing that
personal character can truly be separated from the job of leading a
country that was, after all, founded upon a set of ideals, embodied
in the documents that bind us as one, enshrined in the faith of
generations now gone, and sanctified by the sacrifice of those who
gave, in the words of Abraham Lincoln, ''the last full measure of
devotion...that that nation might live.''

comparable to that of Bill Clinton's today.
</P>
<P>
   Could such a man have gone to Gettysburg?
</P>
<P>
   Could he have stood on that hallowed and haunted ground, where
just months before 50,000 Americans, North and South, had been
killed, wounded, or went missing?
</P>
<P>
   Could he have called on the memory of that incalculable
sacrifice to ask his bleeding nation to carry on the fight for as
long as it would take so that, in Lincoln's own words, ''...these
dead shall not have died in vain; that this nation, under God,
shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the
people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the
earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Could Lincoln have done that on the moral currency Clinton now
commands?
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course not,'' said Lincoln scholar Gabor S. Boritt,
director of the Civil War Institute at Gettysburg College.
''Lincoln had substantial moral authority, and it was central to
his administration.''
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the republic does not rest on the outcome of the sex
and deception scandal hanging over Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The country he governs, for better and worse, is vastly
different from the land Lincoln fought to hold together.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton's own fortunes will be decided more by
constitutional rulings and raw politics than by the judgment of
ethicists or historians.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton's troubles with Monica Lewinsky have posed
profound questions about the nature of moral authority, and the
role it plays in the modern presidency.
</P>
<P>
   There are basically two ways that presidents impel others to
make sacrifices or take risks for the good of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The first is through the constitutional powers vested in a
president by the awesome voice of the voters, in the only political
act the country performs as one _ the quadrennial election of the
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   There was no question, for instance, about President Truman's
constitutional authority to sack Gen. Douglas MacArthur for
insubordination to the commander in chief during the Korean War,
even though MacArthur had become an American icon whose own moral
authority rivaled, if not surpassed, that of Truman's in the public
mind.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution, however, provides presidents with only a bare
bones job description.
</P>
<P>
   ''The constitutional blueprint tells us very little about how a
president will be able to govern, or whether a president will be
able to govern. It's a set of possibilities,'' said government and
constitutional law expert Carol Nackenoff, who chairs the political
science department at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania. ''A great
deal depends upon the political skills, the judgment, the credit
that a president is able to build.''
</P>
<P>
   The second way a president leads is through moral authority
trust, largely. That imbues a president with the power to use the
bully pulpit to mobilize public opinion at home and abroad, to be
the decisive force in high stakes negotiations or to persuade
reluctant legislators, bureaucrats or heads of state to embrace the
uncertainty that often accompanies change.
</P>
<P>
   It is, in other words, essential to the effective leadership of
the last remaining superpower in a world of opportunity and peril.
</P>
<P>
   If moral authority enables a president to lead as much by who
they are as by the office they hold, there is no one path to
attaining the empowerment it brings, nor is there always agreement
as to precisely what constitutes moral authority.
</P>
<P>
   There is, for instance, personal stature, what Americans
sometimes regard as the key ingredient in a natural leader.
</P>
<P>
   In a nation whose beginnings, and much of its continuing
strength, rest largely on military achievement, it's no surprise
that a long string of generals George Washington, Robert E. Lee,
Dwight D. Eisenhower and Colin Powell spring quickly to mind
command moral authority of the highest order in the minds of most
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Jefferson's legacy of moral authority stems more from
intellectual and creative horsepower perhaps unsurpassed in the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   For standing strong in the face of adversity, few could rival
the record of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who confronted the Great
Depression and the only truly global conflict in history, though
certainly John F. Kennedy is remembered for soldiering through,
however imperfectly, some of the darkest days of the Cold War,
while challenging the intransigence and hostility of his own
countrymen in the Civil Rights struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Personal fortitude, of the sort represented by Martin Luther
King Jr., has been another source of moral authority for American
leaders, as has the powerful example of a disciplined life lived as
a force for good, as exemplified by Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Hero-making, however, is a trade that must bear the burdens of
history, and moral authority is best viewed through the eye of the
beholder.
</P>
<P>
   To the 13 percent of Americans who trace their ancestors to the
tragedy of American slavery, Washington and Jefferson, slaveholders
both, are hardly the revered pillars of ethics they represent to
American whites.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for many black Americans, who have stood hard by Clinton
during his trial by scandal, his relationship with Monica Lewinsky
matters far less than the positions he's taken on matters of race.
That's an issue Clinton has worked, through policies and dialogue,
to keep on the front burner of national concerns, much as he's done
with health care, education, crime, Social Security and the need to
balance the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   That helps to explain, in the minds of Clinton's backers at
least, why the majority of Americans continue to support him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do think that Americans have a moral compass, and if 60
percent of them are approving of him, at some level he still must
exert, on some issues, moral authority,'' said Geri Denterlein, a
media consultant who listened to Clinton at a glitzy
$1,000-per-plate Democratic fund-raising dinner in Boston earlier
this month. ''He has an ability to lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a wounded political warhorse waging one last campaign,
Clinton is fighting to regain his moral credibility, largely by
reminding constituents like Denterlein of how well he represents
their aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   That can help him, Nackenoff said, if it's combined with a
larger strategy that also includes high profile diplomacy such as
Clinton's appearance last week at the United Nations, where he drew
a standing ovation from some 1,100 diplomats and heads of state.
Similarly, she said, ceremonial opportunities such as awarding
South African President Nelson Mandela with the Congressional Gold
Medal as he did last week in the Capitol Rotunda can help showcase
his ample rhetorical gifts. ''Rhetorical skills can convey moral
authority, as in the case of Lincoln,'' said Nackenoff. ''This
ability to use your rhetorical skills to tell stories about what
America is, who we are, what we have been and where we're going...I
think he (Clinton) has a feel for telling those kinds of stories
and making those stories about middle America or about our values
as a nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Clinton had been elected on the basis of his moral
credibility, many analysts contend, the blows to his leadership
might well be mortal.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bill Clinton was elected with people clearly knowing he had
moral failings, so this isn't a great shock,'' said Frank Newport,
editor in chief of the Gallup Poll. Its national surveys
consistently show that while many Americans 49 percent, according
to Gallup's latest poll of 631 adults taken Sept. 21 claim they
don't trust Clinton, a large majority 66 percent believe he's doing
his job well.
</P>
<P>
   That's the explanation for the gap between the personal
confidence the public claims to have, or not have, in the
president, and the polls suggesting that 66 percent, according to
Gallup, say he should remain in office.
</P>
<P>
   In a perfect world, these polls suggest, Americans would like to
believe in their president, though many appear willing to accept
competent management from Clinton, in good times at least, so long
as they think he means well.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a reasonable person,'' said political scientist Terry
Sullivan. ''He is a likeable guy, he appears to be sincere and
genuine and he does tell us what is right and what is wrong and he
does tell us what we need to do as Americans, what we ought to be
doing if our better angels were running our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton exemplifies, ''leadership which is moral in intent it's
intent is to accomplish good things,'' said Sullivan, an associate
professor at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. ''I
think that kind of moral leadership has a powerful influence on
most Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all that a nation asks of its leader, there may be no more
less forgiving a requirement than that they mirror those ''better
angels'' to which Sullivan refers. As Clinton has demonstrated,
perhaps even learned, Americans don't elect leaders to remind us of
our many shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, is it fair, is it even meaningful, for this country, a
sometimes morally-disoriented television nation largely inhabited
by an anything-goes culture that looks mostly to the Dow as a
measure of its collective worth, to hold Clinton to the gold
standard of presidential leadership?
</P>
<P>
   Or are we as nation simply fooling ourselves into believing that
personal character can truly be separated from the job of leading a
country that was, after all, founded upon a set of ideals, embodied
in the documents that bind us as one, enshrined in the faith of
generations now gone, and sanctified by the sacrifice of those who
gave, in the words of Abraham Lincoln, ''the last full measure of
devotion...that that nation might live.''

UNHEALTHY LESSONS IN THE DISSECTION LAB 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JONATHAN BALCOMBE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When I recall the days of my biology education _
from high school in the late '70s through 10 years of college
undergraduate and graduate training during the '80s _ I am reminded
of the animal labs.
</P>
<P>
   I chose to study animals because I love them. But I hated the
labs. They stretch out in my mind like a long anthem of grim death
and moldering flesh. The images are still as vivid as the
formaldehyde smell that accompanied them.
</P>
<P>
   Pathetic little fetal pigs who never saw life, removed from
clear plastic bags, pinned out splay-legged onto a rubber tray.
Cats with distorted faces, tongues protruding, some with kittens in
their wombs. Dogfish sharks who expelled part of their insides in
the throes of death, with severed tails where latex dyes were
injected. Pigeons, no longer graceful, their feathers drowned in
preservative. Frogs with eyes that shone like jewels in life now
milky and dull.
</P>
<P>
   When the dissections were over, one could listen to the thuds of
discarded bodies hitting the bottom of the plastic buckets at the
front of the room. Students, their morals muddied, often joked and
made crude displays of their carcasses. The sinks would clog with
greasy bits of skin and muscle. Animals as throw-aways. Disposable
items. Catch, kill, preserve, dismember, and toss.
</P>
<P>
   And learn. Learn what? Fetal pigs have four-chambered hearts
just like we do. Note the spongy texture of his lungs, which you
might be able to inflate if you stick a straw into the trachea. The
skull of the shark is cartilaginous, so it is possible to chip
through it with your probe and scalpel to reach the brain. Be
careful not to sever the optic nerve. Notice that even in a dead,
preserved cat the liver is darker than the stomach. This part of
the frog is called the mesonephric duct. Also, note the webbing
between the toes; it used to help her swim.
</P>
<P>
   What else do we learn when animals are killed for school
exercises? We learn that animals don't count for much, that they
are throw-away objects. We're taught that killing to learn is OK;
we take away their most precious possession _ their lives _ so the
teacher can test our knowledge on a midterm exam. We learn that
nature is our servant and that it is normal to exploit her for our
gain. We learn that might makes right. We learn that death is OK if
it can be justified. We learn that someone out there (the person
who procures and kills the animals) is willing to do the dirty work
for us, provided they get paid for it.
</P>
<P>
   Is there another way? Absolutely. There are many ways to learn
anatomy and physiology that don't involve killing. You don't need
to cut open animals to become a good scientist or a good surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of U.S. medical schools, including Yale, Harvard
and Columbia, have no animal labs, and more veterinary schools are
implementing clinical study programs where students work only with
animals in need of medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are computer programs, CD-ROMs, videotapes, models,
self-study modules, charts and manuals to help students learn
without harming any animals. The Humane Society of the United
States has compiled a list of more than a dozen published reports
showing that students learn biology equally well or better using
alternative methods that don't harm animals. The society also loans
out alternatives free of charge, so compassionate students can
learn without harming, and teachers can replace dissections with
more humane, more socially acceptable methods.
</P>
<P>
   In the Humane Society's view, requiring students to engage in
practices harmful to animals is unfair to students and inhumane to
animals. Change, especially when it involves an established
tradition like dissection, doesn't come easily. But it doesn't come
at all until someone is ready to rock the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there are growing numbers of boat-rockers out there
these days, and dissection is gradually receding. New laws are
being passed upholding a student's right to opt for humane
alternatives. Newer, better alternatives continue to flood the
market, and studies are being published showing the alternatives'
superior instructive potential over traditional methods. The
dissection hot line _ 800-922-FROG _ continues to ring off the
hook, with more than 100,000 calls since its inception. Education
is about much more than merely learning facts and concepts; it's
also about becoming a responsible, caring citizen. If you think
animals _ and students _ deserve better, speak out about it.

SEDUMS: NATURE'S GIFT TO THE GARDENING-IMPAIRED 
</HEADLINE>

   ``It's important to always have something to look foward to in
the garden, the failure of one thing redressed by the success of
another,'' wrote Thomas Jefferson 200 years ago. This is especially
true in autumn, when the end of the growing year is nigh. Fall
conjures up asters and chrysanthemums and, more recently, sedum
``Autumn Joy,'' a workhorse that has become a goodwill ambassador
for its entire genus.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to find more obliging plants than sedums that are not
made of plastic. Still, they are an acquired taste. While lilies
nod and peonies billow, sedums seem to hunker down in the garden,
squat and solid. Even the celebrated ``Autumn Joy'' is a plant few
would fall in love with at first sight. But like the entertainer
Madonna, it keeps our interest by constantly changing appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The foliage emerges in early spring as a tight head of blue-gray
leaves. Through the summer the lengthening stalks suggest broccoli.
Even in its green phase, ``Autumn Joy'' complements ummer stars
like perovskia and globe thistle. In August, the flat flower heads
gradually assume a pink coloration that deepens into a showy
salmon-red through September, when they attract butterflies and
bees. In October they turn russet and finally chocolate as the
flowers morph into seedheads. If not removed, these remain standing
like a dried arrangement through most of the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the mid-'70s the Washington landscape firm Oehme,
van Sweden &AMP; Associates exploited this last characteristic by
combining drifts of ``Autumn Joy'' with black-eyed Susan and
ornamental grasses that also maintain attractive skeletons through
winter. This signature tableau offered four-season interest without
being static.
</P>
<P>
   The look was an instant hit and insured that both ``Autumn Joy''
and grasses such as miscanthus gracillimus, pennisetum, and
calmagrostis got a try-out in many American gardens. Home gardeners
gave the grasses mixed reviews, but ``Autumn Joy'' passed the
audition. Now people are looking for new types of sedums to try.
</P>
<P>
   The genus' biggest attraction is that these plants don't need
watering. Each fleshy succulent leaf stores water like a cactus.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are using a much wider range of sedums because they're
becoming interested in drought-tolerant plants. They lend
themselves to window boxes and all sorts of hot dry spots,'' said
Dianne Ford, mananger of Niche Gardens, a well-regarded mail-order
nursery in Chapel Hill, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Sedums also work well in coastal plantings where water quickly
drains away in sandy soil, according to Kathi Herrick, owner of
Rock Spray Nursery in Truro, Mass., which specializes in heaths and
heathers. ``Sedums are not great for erosion control or for
stepping on, and they're not salt-spray resistant, but they're
tough and durable in other respects, tolerating lack of water and
full sun.''
</P>
<P>
   In his definitive book ``Sedum: Cultivated Stonecrops'' (Timber
Press, 1995), Ray Stephenson says there 400 varieties in
cultivation. Most are not hardy in New England. California, with
it's plentitude of heat and dearth of water, is where sedums are
most popular in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a strong movement toward succulents in general on the
West Coast because the climate is milder here,'' said Jeff Cox, the
California-based author of 13 garden books and host of a cable-TV
show.
</P>
<P>
   Though New Englanders may have fewer sedums to chose from, there
are more available than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The hot newcomers
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most sought-after newcomer is ``Frosty Morn,'' a striking 1
1/2-foot sedum with chalky white buds that open into white flowers
(in bloom now) on fleshy green leaves edged with white. Introduced
from Japan by plant explorer Barry Yinger a couple of years ago,
it's a mutant of Sedum alboroseum. It's especially effective
mulched with white or pinkish gravel, or planted in containers.
Like most sedums, it prefers sun and good drainage, but is
amazingly unfussy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matrona'' sedum, new from Germany, has a small red rim around
the edges of the foliage and is 3 feet tall. ``It will not last as
long in the seedhead stage as sedum `Autumn Joy,' but the stems
have a maroon tint. It's going to become popular in the next few
years,'' predicted Fred McGourty, who grows more than two dozen
kinds of sedums at Hillside Gardens, in Norfolk, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Not all new varieties are winners, of course. McGourty
scornfully describes a recent selection called ``Mohrchen'' as
``UPS truck brown'' in color. He has nothing but praise, however,
for 15-inch tall Sedum specacular ``Stardust'' with white fall
flowers in September and October.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, shorter sedums have also been overlooked. But
these are also fine for the front of the borders, as ground covers,
or in containers.
</P>
<P>
   McGourty calls Sedum sieboldii ``the October plant'' because
it's five-inch pink flowers bloom throughout that month. It is also
one of Herrick's favorites because of its disc-shaped leaves. Plant
this one where you can see it from a window, because you might not
be spending much time outdoors by then. The little round radiating
glaucous blue leaves are beautiful throughout the season,
especially planted around stone walls or with blue caryopteris or
Veronica ``Goodness Grows.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Sweden recommends sedum ``Ruby Glow.'' ``The color is
beautiful cascading over stones or crawling between rocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all sedums bloom in the fall. There are also spring- and
early summer-blooming varieties, which tend to be low growing and
to have yellow flowers such as goldmoss stonecrop (Sedum acre).
</P>
<P>
   Sedm alboroseum ``Mediovariegatum,'' more easily called striped
sedum, has a gold to creamy-white center to each leaf. It flowers
white in early summer and looks best with blue-flowered companions.
As with ``Frosty Morn,'' you have to pick it over a couple of times
a year, cutting out any all-white or all-green shoots.
</P>
<P>
   Sedum spurium ``Dragon's Blood'' was the most widely grown sedum
until ``Autumn Joy'' came along. Only 3 inches tall, with bright
crimson flowers in midsummer, it's a spreader. But McGourty's
favorite sedum ground cover for hot dry areas is the lesser known
S. spurium albumsuperbum, which will produce its white flowers even
in considerable shade.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Easy to propagate
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you try a new sedum and want more of it, propagation couldn't
be easier. In spring just cut a couple of inches off the tips of
growing shoots with some stem attached and stick them in the garden
where you want them to grow. By summer they'll be rooted and
thriving.
</P>
<P>
   And if you have lovely urns and flower boxes but you're tired of
all the fertilizing, pinching, and daily watering most flowers
require in containers, fill them with sedums next year and you
won't have to do a thing. Not even water.
</P>
<P>
   Like the word ``sedentary,'' the name ``sedum'' comes from the
Latin word for sitting. And that's what sedums do. They just sit
there and make the gardener look good, unlike the rest of the
perennials, which demand staking and deadheading as fall
progresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one had a whole garden of sedums,'' wrote the late great
garden author Henry Mitchell, ``people would think one was a superb
cultivator of plants, because they always look band-box fresh,
whether there have been droughts or floods or gas fumes or
plagues.''

KERRY WARNS: LONG PROCESS MAY BRING A BACKLASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senator John F. Kerry, emerging as a key broker in
the early stages of the impeachment process, warned Republican
congressional leaders Wednesday that their insistence on holding
months of impeachment hearings may backfire in the November
elections and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry refined and repeated his proposal that calls for President
Clinton voluntarily to testify before the House Judiciary Committee
in exchange for an expedited vote on impeachment. Under the plan,
Clinton would testify within weeks, and a vote would be taken by
the full House just weeks after that, averting the need for a
lengthy hearing that some lawmakers have estimated may spill from
1999 into 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not necessary to have another long, protracted
investigation,'' said Kerry, appearing at a Capitol news
conference. ``I think the question has to be fairly asked, is the
Republican leadership of the Congress prepared to enter into a
serious effort to reduce the agony for this country, to streamline
this process in a dignified and appropriate way?''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's proposal, made Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press,''
captured attention at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials lauded the Kerry proposal publicly and
privately Wednesday. Democratic leaders offered their own carbon
copies at various gatherings on Capitol Hill. And Republicans
leaders, though dismissive of the plan Wednesday, had held
discussions with Kerry early in the week.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal provides Kerry an odd place in the unfolding
political drama. He is neither an acknowledged party leader nor is
he regarded as any great ally of the White House, and he has
virtually no channels to the House leadership.
</P>
<P>
   But his proposal has made him an instant draw on the television
circuit, garnering him appearances on network newscasts Monday,
followed by ``Larry King Live.'' Wednesday, his news conference
broadcast live on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, he has said he still believes a brokered deal is
possible. In public, he has said senators and House members from
both parties have offered him support, though few Republicans have
come forward.
</P>
<P>
   Given his reputation in Washington as a publicity seeker, allies
and enemies were immediately skeptical of his suggestions for
speeding House action. But they then rendered a judgment that was
widely favorable. At the White House press briefing Wednesday,
Press Secretary Michael McCurry implicitly backed the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who are trying to bring this matter to closure by
putting forward what are reasonable ideas, like Senator John Kerry,
are getting drowned out by those who seem to want to let this
matter go on and on and on,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in a telephone interview, White House counselor Paul
Begala went even further.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a guy with a safe seat,'' Begala said. ``He's a war
hero, he's a former prosecutor. No one believes he is doing this
for political reasons. He is making a good faith effort. This
looked like something that could lead to closure.''
</P>
<P>
   The offer of Clinton's testimony had actually been quietly
floated on Capitol Hill by White House aides late last week, but
did not crystalize until Kerry endorsed the concept on television
Sunday and pursued it with congressional leaders Monday and
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``To throw all kinds of political calculations inside this is a
mistake,'' said John Marttila, a longtime consultant to Kerry in
Boston. ``This is an absolutely unpredictable outcome when the
crisis is so grave. His proposal feels right, and it is a clear and
simple idea, which makes it more appealing. The country wants this
to be dealt with quickly and promptly.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Republicans could not find fault with the motivation,
though they did reject the plan. Some strategists said a broker's
role between Clinton and the House Republicans was fraught with
danger, and any self-serving motivations would eventually be bared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you try a brokering role, it's high-risk,'' said Ron
Kaufman, a former political director in the Bush White House and
now a consultant and lobbyist. ``If his risk is: `this will help
elevate me for some stature as candidate for president,' its
high-risk. You pick up the enemies of those who lose out in the
end. But if this is honest, it could be a good thing for him.''
</P>
<P>
   KerryWednesday made repeated references Wednesday to the serious
decisions ahead. He chastised Republicans for their own political
motivations in stretching out the impeachment process, warning that
such a tactic would come with a price, both immediate and in
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am deeply concerned that when you are brandishing around the
potential of impeachment of a president of the United States, you
are doing so much more than pursuing a political strategy,'' said
Kerry. ``You are putting our institutions on trial _ the House, the
Senate, the Congress, and the presidency, and the reputation of all
who serve therein.''
</P>
<P>
   He added later: ``The bottom line is this is bigger than any of
us. This is not about any person's individual journey. This is
about our country's journey.''
</P>
<P>
   He argued that nearly all the facts in the case are already
known through sworn testimony and records compiled by independent
counsel Kenneth W. Starr, meaning much of the remaining disputes
come down to who touched whom where.
</P>
<P>
   As he was leaving, a reporter asked why he was trying to chart
the uncharted, and he replied, ``It's called leadership, good faith
efforts, bona fide approach to the problems of the country. And in
the end, the American people will make their judgment at the
polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps with that thought in mind, a Kerry aide Wednesday called
the Iowa state Democratic Party to inform the chairman that the
senator would be appearing on live television, and provided the
date and time, according to a state party official who declined to
be named.

SYNCHRONIZE YOUR LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON GARFINKLE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frequent readers of this column know that I've been spending a
lot of time experimenting with cellular telephones. One thing
that's made this task particularly difficult is the electronic
phone book that each of these phones contains. A built-in address
book can be both a timesaver and a moneysaver. Unfortunately, the
tiny keyboards and cryptic user interfaces that these phones all
share makes programming more than a few names and phone numbers
into the phones quite an arduous task.
</P>
<P>
   For years I've been telling Motorola and the other cell phone
vendors that they need to create some way for people to edit their
address books from a desktop computer, as well as to download a
list of names and numbers from the computer into the cellular phone
and upload it back. The manufacturers have been slow to respond.
After all, the lack of telephone management software hasn't really
hurt their sales, has it? Thankfully the wireless communications
marketplace is now going through a period of hyper-competition, and
some vendors have realized that integration with computers is a
competitive advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The first crop of wireless integration tools combine telephones
and two-way pagers with the 3Com PalmPilot. This is a curious
choice, considering that there are more than 100 million desktop
computers in the United States alone and less than 2 million Pilots
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first integration products to hit the market is a
nifty little device called the Snap-On. Manufactured by Option
International, a Belgian company, the product lets you control a
telephone using the GSM standard (Europe's standard for digital
cellular service) from a PalmPilot. In the Boston area it's being
sold by OmniPoint, a digital cellular carrier that uses the GSM
technology.
</P>
<P>
   One of the problems in building integration software is that
every cellular phone has a different arrangement of contacts across
its bottom. Option solves this problem with a variety of cables
that let you connect the Snap-On with more than 22 different GSM
handsets. You can find more information at
http://www.option.com/snapon.htm.
</P>
<P>
   I tried the Snap-On with an Ericsson 788 GSM phone. The
Snap-On's Phone Manager software let me view both the GSM
telephone's phonebook and the second phonebook that's stored inside
the GSM telephone's built-in smart card. I could move address-book
entries between the Pilot and the telephone, or edit the numbers in
place. Believe me, using the Pilot is a lot easier than trying to
deal with the 788's user interface.
</P>
<P>
   But the Snap-On provides a lot more than simple address book
synchronization. The system's enclosed Short Message Service
software lets you use GSM's built-in paging capability to send
short messages to other GSM users (or to Internet e-mail
addresses). Normally, sending a page from a cell phone is quite
difficult, but when you can compose the message on your Pilot it is
quite easy.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Snap-On comes with an application that lets you use
your GSM telephone as a wireless modem. With the software,
originally designed for the Minstrel wireless modem, you can use
the Pilot/GSM combination to browse the Web, check your e-mail, or
send full-blown e-mail messages. You can even synchronize your
Pilot with your desktop computer over the air, provided you have a
modem on your desktop machine and have set it up for remote
synchronization.
</P>
<P>
   Another company that's developed some exciting PalmPilot
software for wireless devices is Texas-based JP Software. Called
BeamLink, the program lets you send pages and update the address
book in the new AccessLink II two-way pagers manufactured by
Glenayre. These pagers work with the SkyTel nationwide two-way
paging service.
</P>
<P>
   As its name implies, BeamLink makes use of the infrared port
that's built into both the new Palm III and the AccessLink II
pagers. The infrared system avoids the need to carry around another
cable. Although it's a lot easier to compose a long message on the
Palm Pilot than on the pager's tiny six-button keyboard, the real
benefit of this software is for businesses: Using BeamLink, a
company can download the same address book into 10 or 20 pagers at
the same time, guaranteeing that each member of an organization
will have the same copy of the address book.
</P>
<P>
   BeamLink is still a little rough around the edges _ and the
rough spots are instructive for others who are thinking of
developing software for the two-way wireless market. For example,
while the software can download names, pager numbers, and e-mail
addresses to the two-way pager, it doesn't let you upload the
information from the pager into your Pilot. As the folks at Palm
Computing have known for years, synchronization is the key to
making mobile computers with relatively limited user interfaces
extremely useful.
</P>
<P>
   A more serious problem with BeamLink has to do with the
software's registration procedure. When I first started up the
program, BeamLink asked me for my serial number; it then sent a
two-way page with my number to JP Software. Although it's
understandable that JP Software wants to track the use (and
possibly the unauthorized use) of its software, a feature like this
one that transmits information over a network without the user's
permission sets a dangerous precedent. Computer users have the
right to use software without revealing information about
themselves to the people who wrote the software.
</P>
<P>
   Users have a right to expect that their personal information
will be kept secret. It's all too easy for software that integrates
computers with two-way wireless communication devices to become
automated surveillance tools. The way to stop this Orwellian
possibility is to loudly protest the companies that are taking the
first steps today.

 Drug for osteoporosis shows good results
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts General Hospital researchers are reporting
promising results from using a hormone treatment to improve bone
density in women suffering from osteoporosis, a common symptom of
menopause that causes about 1.3 million bone fractures in the
nation annually.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in the current Journal of the American Medical
Association, Dr. Joel S. Finkelstein of the MGH endocrine unit, Dr.
Robert M. Neer of the hospital's osteoporosis center and his
colleagues found that women undergoing premature menopause from
drug treatments experienced measurable improvements in spine and
hip bone density from injections of parathyroid hormone. The
hormone is normally produced by four tiny glands inside the
thyroid.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of a year, women given daily injections of the
hormone had about 4 to 7.5 percent better bone density in their
spine and femur than women who did not get the hormone, which helps
build up calcium levels in the bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time we've shown that'' the hormone ``can
prevent bone loss in the hip,'' Finkelstein said. ``Although we
still have to answer a lot of questions before'' it ``can become an
approved therapy, it may give us an entirely new approach to
preventing this serious problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The 43 women studied were aged 21 to 45 and were undergoing
treatment for endometriosis, a disease of the uterus, with a drug
that dropped their estrogen levels, triggering early menopause
symptoms. Half got the hormone and half did not.
</P>
<P>
   Finkelstein said that ``it is extremely plausible'' that the
treatment would work with similar results on older women undergoing
natural menopause. His group has won federal funding to start
enrolling 100 postmenopausal women for a three-year test of the
treatment. Anyone interested in participating can call
617-724-8069.
</P>
<P>
   If the treatment proves workable for all menopausal women, it
could have major benefits: About 15 percent of elderly patients who
suffer hip fractures die as a result, according to MGH researchers.
Many of those fractures are caused by osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Combat said to play small health role later
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's not a study that claims war is good for your health by any
means. But combat experience in Vietnam played a surprisingly small
role in affecting whether veterans later suffered hypertension,
respiratory illnesses or other health problems, according to a new
study by researchers from the Veterans Administration and the
Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, led by Dr. Seth A. Eisen, studied 4,700 pairs
of identical and fraternal twin brothers of whom at least one
fought in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, combat experiences explained fewer than 10 percent of
the health problems reported by veterans, with the biggest impact
on hearing loss and skin illnesses. Inherited genetic factors and
environmental exposures were much more important in explaining
hypertension, arthritis and gastrointestinal disorders, Eisen's
team writes in yesterday's edition of the journal Psychosomatic
Medicine.

   One limitation, Eisen acknowledged, was that the average age of
the veterans and their twins was 38 when they were given an initial
30-page questionnaire in 1987. ``If individuals do have low levels
of persistent psychological turmoil, they may have difficulties
after a period of years because many of these diseases develop over
decades'' so the findings ``do not preclude the possibility that
they will develop problems later on.''

   Hate to get up in the morning? Your genes may explain the
reason, according to new research by doctors from Stanford
University and the University of Wisconsin. In this month's journal
Sleep, which reports on sleep disorders, Dr. Emmanuel Mignot and
colleagues found that a specific variation in the so-called clock
gene seems to explain consistently why some of the 410 people
studied were more likely ``evening people'' whose bodies tell them
to go to sleep later at night. The researchers hope someday people
could get a genetic test that would advise them whether to seek a
job where they go to work later and can sleep later in the morning.

ACTIVISTS PRESS FOR IMPROVEMENT IN CANCER RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>

   She knew little about cancer before her husband, Michael, was
stricken with it. But now Carole Seigel has become something of an
expert on pancreatic cancer, urgently following every lead, surfing
the Internet, reading everything she can find.
</P>
<P>
   And she has concluded this: ``There is a lot of raw science in
the laboratories, and the pipeline for getting that science to the
patients is woefully small in spite of the war on cancer. They need
more resources.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Brookline, Mass. woman and her family, and tens
of thousands of others afflicted or affected by the dreaded
disease, are storming Washington this weekend, hoping that The
March _ expected to be the largest cancer rally ever _ can propel
the nation's commitment to fighting cancer to a new level.
</P>
<P>
   The celebrity-studded Saturday and Sunday event brings together
cancer patients, advocates and volunteers, researchers, doctors,
politicians and others to honor those who've died in the struggle
and to demand more money for better anticancer weapons.
</P>
<P>
   More than 500 organizations have endorsed the event, whose full
title is ``The March ... Coming Together To Conquer Cancer.'' Its
president, Ellen Stovall, a survivor of recurrent cancer, said in a
recent Internet press conference, ``There are many opportunities in
research and questions that need to be answered, but there is not
enough funding to pursue these issues. The March is about demanding
of our elected officials that we answer these questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and retired Army General H. Norman
Schwarzkopf are slated to participate in the rally, which has
attracted wide support not only in the lay community but among
clinicians and researchers and medical centers, and the American
Cancer Society. The American Society of Clinical Oncology,
representing about 12,000 physicians who treat cancer, issued a
briefing paper last week calling for a 35 percent increase in the
National Cancer Institute's fiscal year 1999 budget, from $2.54
billion to $3.19 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, said ASCO's president, Dr. Allen S. Lichter, the
organization sees an urgent need for more funding for the clinical
trials that test for new treatments, from chemotherapy agents to
new ``targeted'' drugs pouring from the laboratory to preventive
compounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can do more studies and put more patients in them faster
and finish them sooner, we get more results and that translates
into lives saved,'' he said in a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, a sponsor
of the 1971 National Cancer Act that launched the war on cancer,
said in a statement Wednesday, ``I`m optimistic that the March will
spur Congress and the country to even greater progress'' than has
already been made with an investment of over $36 billion by the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer is the nation's second-leading killer after heart
disease, and although the rate of new cases and deaths has finally
begun to decline, it still kills over half a million people a year
_ about 1,500 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of The March are unashamedly lobbying for their cause,
despite concerns by some health experts about the loudest voices
setting research agendas. ``The March has been unfairly
characterized as seeking to take attention and funding away from
other diseases, like Alzheimer's or diabetes,'' says Stovall, the
event's president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our feeling is that no money should be taken away from any
fields of medicine where there are opportunities to conduct
research,'' she said, adding that the goal regarding cancer funding
is the same _ not to boost support for any one form of cancer but
to ``create a bigger pie'' for the entire field.
</P>
<P>
   Names of people across the nation who have died of cancer are
being sent to Washington where they will be inscribed on an honor
roll. ``I've been beating the bushes to get friends to participate
in the honor roll,'' said Seigel. ``It is a dramatic and impressive
way of showing how this touches everybody's life.''

<P>
   We who think Flytrap encompasses at least a few matters of
genuine public importance are struck by the newsworthiness of a
certain e-mail chain letter making its way around the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, titled ``Reclaiming Our Dignity,'' calls for a
one-day boycott on Oct. 1 of all newspapers, magazines, TV news
programs, and (gasp) ``any of the Internet sites that have
information on the Starr report.''
</P>
<P>
   The boycott is not being ginned up by fringe crackpots. It's the
brainchild of three thirtysomething yuppies who were having dinner
together in Cambridge, Mass. One works for a publisher, one is
studying to be a teacher and one works for a foundation. All three
agreed that they needed some respite from the Lewinsky scandal,
which they felt had engulfed the national conversation.
</P>
<P>
   First they contemplated a national strike. Too radical, they
concluded (``We decided we couldn't get people to stay home from
work.'') Then they talked about a boycott of all consumer products.
But what did Prell Concentrate have to do with Monica Lewinsky? (In
fact, we would add, Monica probably wouldn't be caught dead near
the stuff.) Finally they settled on a one-day media boycott.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investigation of the President has gone too far,'' the
letter begins. Release of ``unnecessarily graphic details of the
President's sexual life, the recent release of the Starr Report
over the Internet and the videotapes of the President's testimony
to the grand jury has eroded our dignity as a country. The efforts
to humiliate the President, humiliate us all. Therefore, please set
aside October 1, 1998 as a day of reflection on our country and the
democratic process.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter asks readers not to buy newspapers or magazines on
that day. ``If you subscribe to a newspaper, tape it to your window
and door, with a large circle and slash, indicating your
displeasure with the level of reporting.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of watching the news, ``take a walk, say hi to your
neighbors, or write a letter to Congress.'' Above all, it says,
``reflect about the type of community you want, the characteristics
of a government that would make you proud to participate, and what
you can do (or not do) to reclaim the dignity of the democratic
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, we won't be participating, but we go weak in
the knees whenever people start calling for civic virtue. (Mario
Cuomo's speech to the 1984 Democratic convention still sets our
heart aflutter.)

THE TIME IS NOW FOR 56K MODEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the things that makes this job worthwhile is the fact
that sometimes my readers do as I tell them.
</P>
<P>
   Almost two years ago, I warned you not to buy one of those new
56K modems for your computer. And to judge by the anemic 1997
revenues of modem makers like 3Com Inc. and Boston's own Zoom
Telephonics Inc., you heard and obeyed.
</P>
<P>
   Good for you. You've saved yourselves a lot of trouble and a
good deal of money as well. Now here are your new orders. The time
has come for 56K. Go forth and buy.
</P>
<P>
   The new modems can receive data at speeds approaching 56,000
bits per second, nearly twice as fast as the previous generation of
modem. These 56K modems originally came in two different flavors,
called X2 and K56Flex.
</P>
<P>
   But the two types were incompatible. If your Internet provider
had one kind of 56K modem and you had the other kind, you could
connect at low speed, but not at the higher speeds.
</P>
<P>
   You can see how this would be a problem, and not just for
consumers. Some Internet providers chose up sides. In the process,
they drove away customers with incompatible modems. Other providers
offered both types, spending a small fortune on extra phone lines
and different phone numbers for X2 and K56Flex lines. Still others
sat on their hands, waiting for a universal standard to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   And so did many consumers. The result was a price war, as modem
makers tried to overcome buyer resistance with a relentless
campaign of markdowns. It worked, sort of. According to the market
research firm Dataquest, the modem industry sold 11 million more
units worldwide in 1997 than in the year before. But their revenues
fell by nearly $500 million, because of price cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a pretty bad loss last year,'' laments Zoom Telephonics
president Frank Manning. For sure _ a $7.1 million loss, after a
$2.5 million profit the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Poor fellow. He's suffered enough. It's time to start buying
modems again. Here's why.
</P>
<P>
   First, the standards war is officially over. One week ago, the
International Telecommunications Union ratified a worldwide
standard called V.90. All future 56K modems will comply and most of
the older ones can be upgraded. As a result, you can buy a new 56K
modem with confidence, as long as your Internet provider has
installed a V.90 modem on its end.
</P>
<P>
   Quite a few still haven't. My main provider, Concentric Network
Inc., is still making the changeover. But America Online is already
on board. That's 13 million potential V.90 customers right there.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's price. When 28,800 bit-per-second modems first
appeared in 1994 they could run you $300. That kind of pricing is
history. With consumers now accustomed to cheap modems, they won't
pay those kinds of markups. And manufacturers are smart enough not
to ask.
</P>
<P>
   Zoom sells an external V.90 modem for $99 with rebate.
Meanwhile, 3Com charges a premium for its US Robotics modems, but
$160 or so isn't too shabby, and you can probably do even better
with a bit of shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Federal Communications Commission is offering
encouragement. Today's 56K modems actually top out at 53,000 bits
per second, because of an FCC regulation that limits the power
output of modems. Now the FCC is proposing to abolish that rule. In
a few months, 56K modems could really become 56K modems.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the new modems have their limits. They'll only receive
data at the highest speeds; when you send data, it'll travel at
33,600 bits per second tops. And only about 80 percent of American
homes have phone lines that will allow the modems to work properly.
The modem maker 3Com offers a handy test that will let you
determine whether your phone line can handle 56K. For details, go
to http://www.3com.com/56k.
</P>
<P>
   Those of you with the good fortune to live in cable-modem
country will greet this news with smiles of pity. You've got 1.5
million bits per second to play with. But millions of others are
years away from cable-modem access. For them, 56K modems are the
best access deal around. So go ahead and get one. You have my
permission.

CAREFULLY PREPARE DRY WALL BEFORE PAPERING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. What is the best way to prepare new dry wall for wallpaper?
My concern is not ony with paper adhesion but also wih stripping
and repaparing or repainting. I'd like to start with a painted
surface so I can paper the rooms several times. I have little
confidence in the typical builder's flat paint.
</P>
<P>
   LYNDA BEDARD, Palm Harbor, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You are right; dry wall is tough to paper without proper
preparation because it is impossible to remove without ruining the
paper of the plasterboard.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a proper way to prepare, and this is it: Paint the
walls with a latex enamel undercoater, also called primer-sealer,
then apply one, possibly two coats of an eggshell finish (neither
flat nor shiny) latex wall paint. Be sure to glue size the walls
before putting up the paper.
</P>
<P>
   This hard, washable finish (the primer and paint) will make the
dry wall water resistant, and much easier to remove the paper
without messing up the paper of the plasterboard.
</P>
<P>
   The enamel undercoater is not normally used on walls, but for
added waterproofing, it is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if you apply the undercoater and two coats of the
eggshell finish, you might find it handsome enough to keep it that
way for a while.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The aluminum siding in our 100-year-old house is 20 years old
and beginning to look pretty shabby. We'd like to go back to wood
clapboards (original siding), but were told that when the aluminum
was installed, the installers cut the window sill ``horns'' to the
size of the sash, then installed the siding over the casings. We're
afraid that when the siding comes off, under each of 30 windows
there will be a gaping hole. Replacing windows does not make sense
because the windows are OK. Is there a way to replace or repair
those exterior sills without dismantling the entire window? Should
the siding be taken off before any sill work is done or should the
sills be fixed before the siding?
</P>
<P>
   CALVIN WELS, Portsmouth, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Oh, what aluminum and vinyl siders do to people's houses.
It's a shame, but at least you are going in the right direction to
get rid of that fake siding and go with something that belongs on
the house.
</P>
<P>
   Siders used to cover window casing with their fake siding. It
was called ``jumping the casings,'' and cutting the horns of the
sills was included. They also often cut off or covered decorative
trim. At least they don't do that any more.
</P>
<P>
   The horns you speak of were at each end of the sills, and
generally that was all they cut. If that is all they cut, you can
cut new horns from a 2 x 4 and screw, nail or glue them onto the
ends of the cut sills.
</P>
<P>
   If the siders cut off the front edge of the sill for its full
length, you may discover a gap, but not necessarily. Even so, you
can still cut a new piece and attach it to what is left of the
sill. Be sure to caulk the joint where you attach the new part of
the sill; it has to be waterproof. All this can be done without
disturbing the window itself.
</P>
<P>
   That's better than replacing whole sills, which you could do if
you had to, but it is a lot more work. I suggest you do this after
the aluminum siding has been removed; you might find some of the
clapboards and/or window casings in bad shape under the siding, and
if so you can make all your repairs at the same time before
treating the clapboards. If the clapboards are in good shape, I
suggest you apply two coats of a latex solid stain, not a paint,
after heavy sanding. The stain is less likely to peel than paint.
</P>
<P>
   If the siding is in such bad shape that it cannot be saved, I
suggest replacing it with new red cedar clapboards, rough side out,
and treating with one coat of a semitransparent stain. Or, put up
white cedar shingles and let them weather; there is no need for any
treatment, and they will turn to that Cape Cod silver and last for
40 years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. This past spring I put a white wicker sofa on our front
porch. After a hot, dry summer, when I took a good look at it I was
amazed to see how weatherbeaten it was. My wife wants me to paint
it, but no one here in Florida can tell me how to do it or what to
use. It is a lovely piece but now rather dried out. What if
anything can I do to restore this piece?
</P>
<P>
   WALTER POMAROLE, Ocala, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think the best thing you can do for your wicker sofa is to
paint it. And, I don't think there is any harm is the sofa seeming
too dry. Wood is supposed to be dry, and stay dry.
</P>
<P>
   First, dry scrub it to remove loose dirt, then wash with a
strong solution of Spic and Span and water and let dry. Treat with
a mild bleach/water solution if there is any mildew present. Rinse
and let dry. Rinsing is important if you use bleach, because bleach
and any finish _ varnish, paint, stain _ are incompatible.
</P>
<P>
   Apply a latex enamel undercoater, also called primer sealer. Use
a cheap brush; any brush will be worth throwing away after painting
wicker. Remove or cover upholstery or cushions, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Now here comes the best part. Paint with a spray enamel; Krylon
makes an aerosol spray enamel that works wonders; it is not too
shiny and not too dull, and spraying is the best way to do wicker.
It will also make the wicker a little more water resistant. I have
done it and am very happy with the results. Spray outdoors on an
calm day, if possible. You should be able to find the undercoater
or primer-sealer and the Krylon at any paint store.
</P>
<P>
   Wicker does not belong outdoors, even under a roof. Keep it in
the house or in a sunroom, or where it is protected from the
elements.
</P>

<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ You might say that Scott Bruce is up to his
old Trix.
</P>
<P>
   For a decade now, the man who claims the dubious distinction of
giving us the word ``cerealectibles'' has dedicated his
professional life to vintage cereal boxes and prizes. He has
amassed a world-class collection of the stuff. He talks eagerly of
plans for a cereal hall of fame in Orlando, Fla., or perhaps even
Las Vegas. And he's just published ``Cereal Boxes &AMP; Prizes:
1960s,'' the second of his decade-by-decade tribute to the genre.
In other words, his description of himself as ``The Grand Exalted
Flake'' can be taken in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   But the 43-year-old onetime sculptor is more than a little
serious about Frosted Flakes and Froot Loops, about Tony the Tiger
and Toucan Sam, about ``Free Inside!'' and ``Only 2 Box Tops!'' He
earnestly points out that such goods are ``universal commodities
that found their way to every breakfast table in America.'' He
expounds on the importance of character-driven merchandising,
``whether it's Dwight D. Eisenhower on a Corn Flakes box in 1952 or
Tiger Woods on a Wheaties Box in 1998.'' He even admits to eating
breakfast cereal himself, although not for breakfast. ``My favorite
nightcap is Grape-Nut Flakes, though they're unpalatable before 10
p.m.,'' he muses.
</P>
<P>
   As he talks, the lanky 6-foot-4 Bruce is nursing a bowl-sized
cup of morning coffee while sitting in the living room of the North
Cambridge apartment in which he lives with his wife and two young
sons. His chair is upholstered to look like a Holstein cow. The
adjoining room would be the dining room were it not for a cardboard
lunar lander climbing structure that is roughly 8 feet tall and
which was created by Bruce himself. ``It can accommodate 400
pounds,'' he notes proudly.
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, Bruce is interested in talking primarily
about the 1960s. But never mind JFK and the Beatles. (Although in
1969 the latter did appear on boxes of Rice Honeys and Wheat Honeys
_ see box.) When Bruce talks '60s he means such marketing successes
as Cap'n Crunch and Cocoa Krispies, or such failures as Twinkles
and Wackies. ``It was an important decade because it represented
childhood for a lot of Baby Boomers,'' he says. ``But it was also
an explosive time for cereal brands and characters. There were just
too many of them, really. By the 1970s there was a backlash against
them on the part of grocers who wouldn't give them shelf space.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce says he long ago lost count of his own collection of
cereal boxes and prizes, a stash that is ``stored in various places
around Cambridge'' and much of which is constantly changing due to
purchases and sales. Such stuff can fetch as much as $1,000 if it's
particularly rare or features a desirable character, although Bruce
is clearly uncomfortable talking dollars despite the fact that his
books serve as price guides. Still, he's not shy about discussing
his practical reason for becoming a cereal-box pro during the
mid-1980s: Lunch boxes of the '50s and '60s, a collectibles field
he'd virtually invented and popularized, finally left him bored.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thrill was gone,'' he laments of the lunch-box genre,
which he brought to the collecting public's consciousness via both
a coffee table book and a price guide. ``It was exciting creating
something, but it wasn't exciting maintaining it.'' So Bruce looked
around and found another worthless object to help make profitable.
``Cereal had characters like lunch boxes did, but has even more
nostalgia,'' he explains. ``After all, some kids carried lunch
boxes, but every kid sat down at the breakfast table, read the box,
and sent away his dime for a monkey ring or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce amassed his box and prize collection, started a fanzine
called Flake _ discontinued two years ago _ and began churning out
books, including a history of the cereal industry. He plans to
continue his series of tomes on vintage boxes and prizes with
volumes about the '70s and '80s. And he waxes enthusiastic about
negotiations with major cereal companies that he hopes will lead to
_ what else? _ a Breakfast Cereal Hall of Fame that would include
the core of his collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was doing lunch boxes, I was really a carpetbagger,''
he confesses. ``This time I want to leave a legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Raised in Seattle, where he went to the same private high school
as Bill Gates (his recent 25th reunion included a visit to Bill and
Melinda's well-protected manse), Bruce graduated from Amherst
College in 1979 as a religion major. He sculpted, traveled the
world, taught English to Iranian helicopter pilots, discovered
vintage lunch boxes, and eventually found cereal. Should you decide
to become a cereal box collector yourself, he has some advice: Pass
up the pricey old stuff and start stashing boxes bought at your
local supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eat the cereal, save the boxes, collapse 'em, stack 'em,''
Bruce says. ``They're not like stocks and bonds. Don't take them
too seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   You might say, then, that cereal boxes are simply a way to get
your Kix.

GREATEST HITS (AND MISSES) OF THE '60S
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Hottest cereal box: Nabisco Rice Honeys and Wheat Honeys, featuring
the Beatles (1969). ``Great crossover appeal.'' Worth as much as
$1,000. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Most unlikely cereal box character: Jack E. Leonard, Post
Alpha-Bits (1963). ``How bizarre to use a nightclub comedian to
sell a kids' product.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Most creative cereal boxes: Quaker Quisp and Quaker Quake (1965),
designed by Jay Ward and Bill Scott, who also collaborated on the
Rocky and Bullwinkle TV show, ``Rocky and His Friends.'' ``They
were first-rate satirists.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Most successful slogan: ``I'm Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs'' (1963).
``One of the few slogans that remains to this day.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Most successful cereals: Quaker Cap'n Crunch and Kellogg's Froot
Loops (both 1963). ``It was a good year, I guess.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Biggest bomb: General Mills Clackers (1969). ``Doughnut-shaped
graham crackers that cut up kids' mouths like glass.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Worst tasting cereal: Kellogg's Corn Flakes With Instant Bananas
(1965). ``Freeze-dried bananas which melted down to disgusting mush
when milk was added.''  &QL;

GETTING UP CLOSE WITH THE WEEDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE HATCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I weed, you weed, we all weed. And then we weed again.
</P>
<P>
   Weeding is to gardeners what suffering is to great artists _
painful and necessary. It gets us in touch with our soil, our
plants, our gardens, in ways no other endeavor can _ on hands and
knees, up close.
</P>
<P>
   I recognize its philosophical and practical worth, achieving a
laborious, Zen-like oneness with our garden, as well as a
beautiful, healthy garden. Besides, if you don't do it, the garden
quickly succumbs to the weeds, plants that by and large are (and I
am speaking frankly now) better than those we choose to grow.
</P>
<P>
   What makes them better? What makes a great weed? What is it
about certain weeds that makes our blood boil, or at least our
backs ache?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a person who loves to maintain a perfect lawn, or
if you are a person who wants to maintain a perfect garden bed, you
probably dislike crabgrass, because it seeds about with abandon,''
said Deborah Swanson, a specialist with the extension service in
Plymouth County. Crabgrass, Digitaria sanguinalis, is what I spend
most of my time excising _ or is it exorcising? Ignore it and it
spreads wide with tenacious fibrous roots, tangling itself with
desired plants and hogging the soil's nutrients and moisture
</P>
<P>
   Dandelions also would bedevil the lawn nut, Swanson said,
especially ``if you had one or two neighbors who had lawns with a
more natural look.'' Dandelions (Taraxacum officinale) not only pop
up all over, they have deep tap roots. Unless you remove all, or
nearly all, of that tap root, the plant will regenerate. (They pull
up more easily in moist soil.)
</P>
<P>
   Pokeweed (Phytolacca americana) also has a tap root. ``Pokeweed
is a very large weed,'' Swanson said. It grows up to 6 feet and is
fleshy, though its stalk gets somewhat woody as it matures, and it
has purple, stain-your-shirt berries. Oh, and it is poisonous.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly more benign would be black bindweed, Polygonum
convolvulus. A twiner, it has thin stalks and small, arrow-like
leaves. It pulls out easily. The one I just yanked started among
the nicotiana, climbed through the shed door, and went up a broom,
perhaps seeking shelter inside for the winter. Swanson said a
Norwell man recently sought identification of a weed. It was a
bindweed, and it covered his blueberry bushes, sucking up their
sunlight, as well as nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   Also using the strategy of climbing is Oriental bittersweet,
Celastrus orbiculatus. People like its pretty yellow and orange
berries, Swanson said, but it can reach 20 to 40 feet and strangle
whole trees.
</P>
<P>
   Like Rosa multiflora (a mass of which I will be tackling out
back in the next few weeks) and many honeysuckles, Oriental
bittersweet is an escapee from gardens, said Ron Kujawski, a
nursery crop specialist with the University of Massachusetts
Extension in Amherst. He is personally, as well as professionally,
familiar with weeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up working on an onion farm, and most of our growing
year was spent on our hands and knees going up and down the rows
pulling out the weeds,'' he said. ``You really get intimate with
your plants that way. It makes us humble.''
</P>
<P>
   His pick for worst garden weed is quack grass (Agropyron
repens), ``because it has these underground runners and you can
pull up the weed or, if you're hoeing, you always leave fragments
behind, and you never seem to get rid of them.'' The underground
runners are rhizomes, a modified stem, and whacking them is a great
way to propagate. (Deborah Swanson noted that rototilling yucca
will give a gardener a whole lot of little yucca headaches.)
</P>
<P>
   Kujawski also dislikes thistles, for obvious reasons _ ``you
really have to take care.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From a weed's standpoint, being rhizomatous helps, producing
an abundance of seed helps, having a high survival rates of seeds,
seeds that remain viable for a long time, things like lamb's
quarters and pigweed,'' Kujawski said. ``It seems like every time
you turn over the soil, you have more.''
</P>
<P>
   That raises a point. People make weeds. People imported to
America, deliberately or accidentally, many of the worst weeds,
among them dandelions, Oriental bittersweet, Japanese knotweed,
kudzu (in the South, but it's been found at the Arnold Arboretum),
and purple loosestrife. And people plant them. Every time a
gardener clears a bed, the way is cleared for weeds. Plant tender
vegetables, and the competition is lowered for weeds. Cultivate the
soil, and more weed seeds are exposed. Some weed seeds, Kujawski
said, require a flash of light before they can germinate;
gardeners, in working the soil, often provide that.
</P>
<P>
   Weeds, Swanson said, ``outcompete the other plants for light and
water and nutrients and space.'' Their strategies include taproots
to maintain a hold in one spot, super-seeding to spring up in other
places, and the ability to travel by climbing or sending stolons
across the ground or rhizomes under it.
</P>
<P>
   Antiweed strategies include hacking them to death, pulling them
out, forking them out, spraying with chemicals, mulching, and
avoiding turning the soil _ none of which works universally, all of
which have drawbacks.

ONCE MORE INTO THE BREACH, WITH CAULKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a recent article, our sermon was that insulation is the
predominant way to save heat. And the most inexpensive.
</P>
<P>
   That's still true, except the inexpensive part. There is
something much less expensive and does almost as much as
insulation.
</P>
<P>
   That is, caulking. Caulk up a storm in fall. Fill all those air
leaks, every nook and cranny, every seam, every joint and every
hole in the house, in the foundation and anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   But why bother? A good point, but consider this: Air leaks can
account, on average, for 30 percent to 40 percent of the heat loss
from a house. So, plugging these leaks can cut your heating bills
by up to that much, but you can count on a 20 percent saving.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those air leaks are service entrances (where electric
and telephone, cable and other lines go through walls); the joint
between ceiling joists and basement wall, and the joint at the sill
plate, where the wood plate sits on the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Caulking on the outside ...
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These nooks and crannies can be caulked on the outside. Use a
good quality caulking compound and load it in a caulking gun. The
rest is easy, more or less. Caulking can fill joints, seams, and
holes up to about 3/8 inch. A good quality caulking is phenolic
vinyl, widely sold in hardware stores under various brand names.
Acrylics and acrylic latexes are pretty good, too. They are easy to
work with, requiring a minimum of squeeze to get it out of a
caulking cartridge.
</P>
<P>
   How to caulk: Cut the cartridge mozzle with a utility knife to
the desired size, at a 45-degree angle. The nozzle opening
determines the size of the bead. Mount the cartridge in a caulking
gun, and squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   It is best to push the nozzle away from you rather than pull it
toward you. Pushing gives you a chance to see what you are doing
and where you are going, and tends to press the caulking more
compactly into the joint or seam. Sometimes you can slide your
finger along the joint to smooth it off and force it further into
the joint.
</P>
<P>
   Anything larger than 3/8 inch can be filled with an expanding
foam (Great Stuff is a well-known one), or oakum; the modern oakum
sold today is made of plastic, and is in rope form, for stuffing in
those extra wide joints and seams.
</P>
<P>
   An example of a wide joint or seam is that between the sill
plate and the foundation of the house. Another potentially wide
joint is under the bottom row of shingles, clapboards, or other
kind of siding.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
... and caulking on the inside
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other nooks and crannies are best caulked on the inside: Joints
between ceiling and walls; joints between floor and wall, around
window and door frames; electrical outlets and switches; joints at
an attic hatchway; chimney penetration of ceiling; plumbing and
vent penetration.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but will your signifigant other approve of all that
caulking indoors? It normally is not done, at least from a
decorating standpoint. But still, caulking around window and door
frames can be virtually invisible. You can get colored caulks to
match woodwork and walls.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, caulking around a window casing (frame that sits up
against the wall) will be covered by curtains or draperies.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, such as vent and plumbing pipes going through the
ceiling, generous stuffing of fiberglass insulation will do as well
as anything.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Be careful on outside of windows
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You will notice that we did not mention caulking around the
outside of window and door frames. That is because these casings
(frames) are set against the sheathing of the house. Lengths of
tarpaper are placed around the opening before the window is set in
place. In this case, water that might get behind the casing will
flow downward against the tarpaper, and come out at the bottom of
the window or door. This allows water to escape, not to set behind
the casing and rot it out.
</P>
<P>
   If such joints were caulked on the outside, the caulking could
trap water behind the casing, causing paint to peel and wood to
decay.
</P>
<P>
   We have seen cases where window casings are very tight, designed
to keep out water, but water gets in somehow anyway and cannot
escape. Result: possible decay. Besides, the joint between casing
and sheathing, in old and new houses, is usually tight enough to
prevent air to escape or enter the house.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Some alternatives to caulking
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some air leaks do not lend themselves to caulking. Electrical
outlet and switch boxes, for instance. These are best sealed with
foam plastic covers that fit under the regular covers. Unscrew the
cover, put the foam cover in place, and put the regularcover back.
It's invisible but effective.
</P>
<P>
   A big air leak is the hatchway cover under folding attic stairs.
You can build an extra cover for that hatchway opening, on the
attic side. Make an open box of 1(MUL)6s, cover the bottom with
1/4-inch hardboard, and fill it with fiberglass insulation. Cover
the top with 1/8-inch hardboard and fit it over the attic floor
opening. You could hinge it to make access easier.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Consider your windows
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For a grand finale, consider your windows, and this is something
you can do before you spend a bundle for replacement windows. Most
windows, if they are intact, not decayed or hopelessly broken, and
have good storm windows attached, do not need replacing.
</P>
<P>
   But they may need weatherstripping, which will not only tighten
loose windows but stop or reduce air loss.
</P>
<P>
   For old-fashioned weighted windows, the best weatherstripping is
spring bronze. It may be hard to find, but persistent shopping will
find it. Spring bronze is a strip of metal (sometimes plastic),
about 1 1/2 inches wide and slightly bent. It is placed between the
edge of the movable sash and the jamb and nailed in place. You have
to raise the lower sash and lower the upper sash to install this
stripping, but you do not have to remove the sash itself. Be sure
to put the stripping on all sides of the sash, top and bottom and
especially at the checkrail, where the two sash meet.
</P>
<P>
   Spring bronze can be installed on most doors.
</P>
<P>
   For modern windows that are spring-loaded, you can't put in the
spring bronze because the windows are already weatherstripped, it
is hoped.
</P>
<P>
   The stripping to use for these windows, if you have to, is a
rolled vinyl tube with a rigid metal backing. It is tacked at the
joint between sash and jamb, so that it shows. It is tricky to
install; you want to install it tightly enough to stop air flow,
but not so tightly that it restricts the window movement. This type
is better and lasts longer than felt or foam.
</P>
<P>
   All this done, you can take the trip of your dreams, albeit a
short one, with the money you save in heat this winter.

THE BEST PROP FOR PLAYING WITH YOUR CHILD IS YOU

 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whoever coined the expression ``baby's play,'' to refer to
something simple, didn't know much about babies. Their play is not
only complicated and intricate, but also as important to their
lives as good nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's serious work for them,'' says child psychiatrist Arnold
Kerzner. ``It's how they learn to regulate themselves, to develop
trust, handle stimulation, excitement, separation, loss, a sense of
self. ... It's a long list.''
</P>
<P>
   Just because there's all this work to do, doesn't mean we need
to work at it. When we act instinctively, lovingly, and
attentively, a baby's learning comes naturally, without our even
realizing it. Expensive toys, baby classes, videos marketed to make
babies smarter sooner _ these are unnecessary props.
</P>
<P>
   ``All your young baby really needs is you _ your face, your
fingers, your voice, your attention,'' says developmental
psychologist Marilyn Segal of Nova Southeastern University in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla. Even the 6- to 12-month-old needs mostly only
items you probably have around the house.
</P>
<P>
   The truth of that has been a pleasant surprise for Karen
Ward-Kaplan of Cambridge, Mass. and her husband, Elliot Kaplan.
When their daughter, Jess Avery, was born, they kept their
toy-buying to a minimum. Nonetheless, they've been surprised that
the few toys Jess has are not what capture her attention.
</P>
<P>
   Now 7 months old, Jess's favorite toy was invented by her
grandpa: wadded-up newspaper. ``She drops it on the floor, slings
it around, crinkles and uncrinkles it. It's great for noise and
texture,'' says Ward-Kaplan, who wisely lets her daughter lead the
way in how they play. She sings to Jess's musical accompaniment (a
wooden spoon on a pot) and delights in Jess's glee at the passing
game, where an object, usually mom's sunglasses, go back and forth
from one lap to another.
</P>
<P>
   For parents like Ward-Kaplan, this play time is sheer joy. Under
researchers' analyses, it takes on another dimension.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Jess's passing game. According to Segal, it teaches
predictability and trust: ``If I give it to mom, she gives it back
to me, every single time! Let me try again. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Turn-taking is the earliest form of play, typically beginning
when a newborn catches your gaze, looks away, then looks back. This
isn't just random, says child psychologist J. Kevin Nugent,
director of the Brazelton Institute at Children's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to do with an infant's need for securty,'' he said.
``It's as if baby is thinking, `If I get overwhelmed and look away,
can I rely on you to still be there when I'm ready to look back?'''
The patient parent is soon rewarded with a smile, not just a gaze;
without even realizing it, parent and baby have played their first
game.
</P>
<P>
   What's most important in these early months is learning to read
your baby's signals during play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Babies are easily over-stimulated. They let you know they need
a rest by turning away,'' Kerzner said. This gaze aversion
sometimes is brief; if she turns back in seconds full of smiles,
that amounts to turn-taking: She's ready for more. Otherwise, she
needs a longer break. Not catching the signal is what leads to
overload and crying, said Kerzner, who is in private practice in
Belmont and Wellesley, Mass. He is president emeritus of the Boston
Institute for the Development of Infants and Parents.
</P>
<P>
   So what, exactly, constitues play? ``It's play as long as the
baby is having fun,'' said Segal, who is co-author of a four-book
series, ``Your Child at Play, From Birth to Five Years'' (Newmarket
Press). For instance:
</P>
<P>
   _Two to four months. Your face is the best toy of all. She'll
reach for your eyes, nose, and mouth and play with them. Games like
``I'm gonna get you,'' ``How big is the baby,'' and ``This little
piggy'' are full of sensory stimulation and also introduce the
element of the unexpected. ``That teaches about resiliency,'' says
Kerzner. ``It's as if you're saying, `There are going to be a lot
of unexpected things happening in your life. I'm going to introduce
that notion to you gradually, so you won't be overwhelmed.''' Sing
often, make up rhymes, imitate her sounds. Verbal play is important
for neurological growth; music is a precursor to language, speech,
and math skills. These games can continue to be played for many
months.
</P>
<P>
   _Five months. Almost any object that he can't swallow and that
can't hurt him can be a toy; look for objects that offer a variety
of textures and shapes: sponges, wooden spoons, metal measuring
cups. Grasping is instinctive at two months; now he's more
purposeful, using thumb and finger to pick things up. He wants to
see what he's holding and pass it from hand to hand. Play with his
feet. Continue to capitalize on all his senses with colorful
mobiles and with music.
</P>
<P>
   _Six to seven months. Put objects slightly out of reach so she
can maneuver to get them. Lavish praise for her success. Introduce
cause-and-effect with objects that respond to being pushed, pulled,
poked, punched, or squeezed. Point to objects and name them. ``Now
she's beginning to internalize two concepts,'' says Nugent. ```I'm
fun and worth playing with,' and, `I can influence the world.'''
</P>
<P>
   _Eight to 12 months. Build on the ``I can be successful''
concept: Hide an object in your hand or under the blanket, put
several items in a bowl or a small box so she can dig them out.
``This kind of play empowers her learning and her imagination,''
says Kerzner. Play ``Peek-a-boo;'' it helps her begin to deal with
loss, separation, and trust, issues that loom large as stranger
anxiety sets in. If she cries at ``Peek-a-boo,'' back off, and try
again in a few weeks. ``This game introduces anxiety: `Where is
mommy? Is she coming back?''' Kids have different thresholds for
tolerating it,'' says Kerzner. Once she likes it, it's a sign she's
increased her capacity for stronger stimuli; she's building on what
she's already learned, namely, that the world is a predictable,
pleasurable place.
</P>
<P>
   About nine months, you'll see signs of frustration, usually when
something is just out of reach. You're also moving into prime time
for the drop-the-spoon-from-the-high-chair game. How many times do
you pick it up? As many as you can stand.
</P>
<P>
   Nugent explains why. First, he says, ``You want him to know this
is a physical law. You drop it and it goes in the same direction
every time.'' Then there's the matter of trust: ``You need to
continue to demonstrate he can trust you to help him.''
</P>
<P>
   But what about frustration? Isn't that a part of life you need
to build tolerance for? Indeed it is, says Nugent, but there's no
good rule of thumb to guide you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good play keeps a balance of pushing forward slightly but
waiting for baby to tell you you're going in the right direction or
not,'' says Nugent. ``It's a delicate balance that takes judgment
and instinct each time.'' If he's trying to reach something, don't
make it impossible for him. After a while of the dropping game, set
a limit: ``That's all now. We'll play again another time.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerzner sees all baby play as symbolic of life. ``Life is full
of highs and lows, and in play, the fun part is mixed with anxiety
and loss. The message a baby takes from this is, `I can cope.' In
that way, each stage of play lays the foundation for the next level
of development.'' As long as you keep the play at your baby's level
and pay attention to her cues, there's really no mistake you can
make.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky for Jess Avery, her parents aren't shy about baby play.
``Recently, I finished a box of crackers and bunched the plastic
wrapping into a wad,'' says her mom. ``Before I realized it, she
grabbed it and looked to me to play her game.''
</P>
<P>
   Some days, it's hard to tell who's having more fun, Jess Avery
or her parents.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _Although playing with your baby is what builds a bond of trust,
it's also good for her to engage in solitary play. When she's
bored, she'll let you know.
</P>
<P>
   _When choosing caregivers, look for one who understands how
important play is, even for a baby.
</P>
<P>
   _Babies are less fragile and more capable than we tend to
realize. Except for over-tickling or inappropriate physical play
(don't ``toss'' a baby in the air until she has good shoulder and
head control, about 5 months), parents' different styles of play is
to a baby's advantage because it increases his repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   _Every time you play with your baby, you're telling her, ``I
like to be close to you, you're special and fun.''
</P>
<P>
   _Toys worth buying: For the newborn, a few rattles; for under 6
months, toys that squeak and have bells; for the 6- to
12-month-old, a soft ball, a toy that fits into itself (like
stacking blocks), a push-and-pull toy.

THANKS, BILL AND KEN, FOR THIS HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Thanks to the
Clinton-Lewinsky-Starr-Drudge-CNN-MSNBC gang, this nation is one
big hostile environment.
</P>
<P>
   Out at Candlestick on Wednesday a guy kept telling the jokes of
the moment, including one about President Clinton wearing a pair of
panties on his sleeve. A reporter asks why, and Clinton says it's
like the patch _ he's trying to quit.
</P>
<P>
   At City Hall staff meetings, San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown
sometimes refers to Monica Lewinsky as ``Monica Will-insky.''
</P>
<P>
   Restaurant owner Vince Calcagno said, ``My parents never talked
to me about sex, and suddenly my mom calls and says, `What do you
think about the blue dress?'''
</P>
<P>
   Hello, Mom? Hello, National Organization for Women? This thing
has gotten completely out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe what we need is a class-action of the people of the United
States against Kenneth Starr, assorted members of Congress and the
media for downloading, televising and printing more than anyone
ever wanted to know about sex in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Especially include the media for creating an environment in
which you have to explain oral sex to your children and, in some
cases, your parents.
</P>
<P>
   Calcagno said that Tuesday, the day after the House Judiciary
Committee's giant data dump, a friend said he had to buy the San
Francisco Examiner with the X-rated excerpts from the Starr report.
He said, ``Do I have to show ID?''
</P>
<P>
   I want to sue Bill Clinton, Monica Lewinsky and Linda Tripp for
starring in the national defacement that launched a million bad
jokes on the Internet and at office water coolers.
</P>
<P>
   I want to sue Henry Hyde and all those Republicans who want to
censor all the pornography on the Internet but their own.
</P>
<P>
   Sue them all, and let Judge Judy sort them out.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is ground zero of the national hostile environment,
and the normally uptight city has undergone a collective bout of
Tourette's syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel they have perfect license to talk loudly and
dirtily in public places,'' said Annie Groer, who co-writes the
Washington Post's gossip column called The Reliable Source. ``In
restaurants, on the street and in stuffy clubs, they feel they can
talk about the most intimate things.''
</P>
<P>
   You know things are really bad when a gossip columnist is sick
of dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Groer said that the other day she was dining with friends at the
elegant Capitol Grill near the White House, and the waiter,
bartender and restaurant manager kept butting into their Monica
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, it was our private tacky conversation,'' she
said. ``I think that all the rules are out the window.''
</P>
<P>
   I had to ask. Was Groer sick of it all because Ken Starr had
become the uber-gossip columnist and eclipsed gossip and innuendo
with true, gritty dirt? No, she said she has even more work,
chasing rumors of a mythical second intern and such, and breaking
the news of Larry King's wife's pregnancy and other gossip
perennials. She also dropped items like Monica's favorite drink,
the Cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Shirley Temple martini,'' Groer cracked in her snappy
``Front Page'' style.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she seems ready to crack completely. ``It's a good thing
I read the dictionary and thesaurus when I was young. That's all
that allows you to conduct a conversation in public anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a complete cesspool. I couldn't wait to get home,'' said
John Jacobs, political editor of the Sacramento Bee, who just
returned from a week in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs talked about Washington as a town in the midst of a
religious war. ``I think Starr and his people are behaving like
they're in a cult, and when you're in a cult you're out of touch
with reality. ... Their blood lust is so up they don't realize the
country thinks they're nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are right. We have no standards. They've
destroyed them _ to save their majority in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to make sense  &LR; out of this nonsense, I called Michael
Crosby, a San Diego lawyer who specializes in employee
discrimination and sexual harassment. Crosby said he had just
finished listening to the Harry Shearer show on public radio.
Shearer had just run a tape of Ted Koppel saying sex words, all
spliced together from Monica-Bill-Linda-Ken ``Nightline'' episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Crosby agreed that the nation was one big hostile environment _
and because of that it may be harder to win sex harassment suits in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be that 25 to 30 years of jurisprudence have been
trumped by ABC news,'' Crosby said. He anticipates that anytime he
goes in against an executive who exposed himself to an employee,
the guy's lawyer will say the president did it too.
</P>
<P>
   Crosby also said that the sheer weight of sexual material dumped
by Starr on America reduces the ability of people to win lawsuits
against those whose behavior creates a hostile environment.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the plaintiff has to show that the type of
behavior would offend the average person. Unfortunately, the
average person has been beaten senseless with sexual material.
</P>
<P>
   As our government has been dumbed down, our sensitivities have
been numbed down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as we go on,'' said Crosby, ``it becomes harder and
harder for people with genuine sensibilities to prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, Mr. President, champion of feminism. Thank you, Mr.
Special Prosecutor, champion of family values. We're in hostile
environment hell.

AT HOME IN THE WORLD 
By Joyce Maynard 
Picador, 347 pp., $25 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This week's New Yorker has a cartoon that shows a woman looking
up from her book and saying, ``I think we should all be thankful
that Bill Clinton never had an inappropriate relationship with
Joyce Maynard.''
</P>
<P>
   Maynard is taking some hard knocks for her memoir ``At Home in
the World.'' Long before it was published, the idea that she would
reveal the intimate details of her teenage affair with reclusive
literary demigod J.D. Salinger was enough to give some critics the
vapors. They didn't even have to read the book to know that it
would be awful.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, ``At Home in the World'' isn't awful. It's not
wonderful, either. It's earnest, and rough around the edges.
Maynard has made a career of sharing her life _ marriage, children,
divorce, breast implants, tennis lessons, middle-aged dating, etc.
_ in magazines, a syndicated newspaper column, a newsletter, a
website, National Public Radio, novels, and memoirs. Her fans
follow her the way some people follow a favorite soap opera, a
genre her life tends to resemble.
</P>
<P>
   She's clearly trying to work things out in this memoir, to
achieve self-understanding. She has some insight, but she should
have thought longer and dug more deeply before she sent the
manuscript to the publisher. ``At Home in the World'' is
fascinating, the way certain disasters are fascinating. It's a
mess, but a riveting mess. You really don't want to look, and yet
you can't help wanting to see it all.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she entered Yale, Maynard says, she was an anorexic,
insecure overachiever, the product of a high-pressure childhood
with a mother and a father who, in their separate ways, defined the
word dysfunctional. This is the first time Maynard has written
honestly, in book form, about her horrible childhood. She has an
intellectual understanding of how abnormal her parents were, but
she still doesn't seem to fully comprehend the ways in which they
continue to shape her life.
</P>
<P>
   Outwardly, Max and Fredelle Maynard were doting parents who
prodded Joyce and her older sister, Rona, to excel. Max taught
English at the University of New Hampshire. Fredelle, a Harvard
PhD, was a devoted wife and mother who supplemented the family
income writing for women's magazines. In private Max was a bitter
drunk who blamed his wife for thwarting his career as an artist.
Fredelle was sexually frustrated, fiercely ambitious, resentful of
the fact that even though she was better qualified than her
husband, she couldn't get a university teaching job because she was
a woman. Fredelle may be the most interesting person in this book,
Salinger included.
</P>
<P>
   Maynard's relationship with Salinger started in the fall of
1972, when she was 18 and he was 53. A freshman at Yale, she wrote
a piece for the New York Times magazine, ``An Eighteen-Year-Old
Looks Back on Life,'' expressing, she recalls, ``a profound sense
of world-weariness and alienation.'' A picture of the big-eyed,
waif-like Maynard that appeared on the cover of the magazine is
reproduced on the jacket of ``At Home in the World.'' She looks no
more than 15.
</P>
<P>
   Among the hundreds of letters Maynard received from readers was
one from Salinger. She'd heard of him, but she'd never read his
work. ``Still, I am impressed with the name,'' she writes in
retrospective present tense. ``The fact that a famous man has
conferred approval on me thrills me.''
</P>
<P>
   Salinger was concerned that she might be exploited in the months
to come. Apparently he didn't understand, or didn't choose to
understand, that Maynard longed to be exploited by the forces of
commerce and criticism he'd spent much of his life avoiding. They
exchanged letters, telephone calls. She visited him, dressed up
like some virgin sacrifice in a childlike dress her mother made for
the occasion: ``stiff, white broadcloth, printed with ABC's in
primary colors.'' Years later, when her own daughter Audrey turns
18, Maynard finally realizes how strange it was that her parents
sent her off at the same age to spend the weekend with a man 35
years her senior.
</P>
<P>
   Maynard quit college and moved into Salinger's gloomy
ranch-style home in Cornish, N.H. Her description of their life
together is absurd and depressing, and oddly touching. His
obsessive interest in homeopathy. His diet of raw foods. Their
Saturday evenings fox-trotting in the blue glow of Lawrence Welk's
television show. Their unsuccesful attempts at sex.
</P>
<P>
   Salinger really cared for her, at first. And she adored him. She
clung to him desperately, even when it should have been clear that
he'd had enough of her. In March of 1973, during a trip with his
children to Daytona Beach, Fla., he told her to go back to New
Hampshire, pack her things, and leave his house. ``It's over that
quickly,'' Maynard writes.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't over, for her. She continued to adore him for
20-odd years, and long for some kind of reunion even though he made
it clear he wanted nothing to do with her. Given Salinger's
reclusive nature, his decision to woo Maynard was a
self-destructive impulse of nearly mythic proportions. But you get
what you deserve when you use the New York Times magazine as a
dating service. What was he thinking of? Maynard speculates that
the photo of her in the Times reminded him of one of his own
creations, 13-year-old Esme, from ``For Esme _ with Love and
Squalor.''
</P>
<P>
   Salinger has nobody to blame but himself for this violation of
his privacy. Up to a point, at least. Maynard's final chapter is
gratuitous, if perversely fascinating. In 1997 she went back to
Cornish to confront Salinger, to ask him, ``What was my purpose in
your life?'' His reaction is so vituperative she's reminded of
Rumpelstiltskin in a rage.
</P>
<P>
   He knows she's writing a book. She wants to tie things up. ``My
mother schools me young to view my writing as valuable,'' Maynard
writes early in this memoir. ``She conveys another lesson too:
Whatever happens in my life, I can look at it as material.''
</P>
<P>
   The tone may be rueful, but Maynard's career speaks for itself.

SPEAKING TO JUST WHAT IS APPROPRIATE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Erik Wensberg says he's amazed at how many ordinary citizens
want to talk like lawyers, even as they heap scorn on the
profession. Take ``venue,'' said Wensberg, ``The word is very
popular now. Location, place, spot, none of these common words is
good enough for us. We must have venues. It means the place of a
trial. Now the kitchen, the vacant lot, the cellar, all have become
venues among our fancier speakers.''
</P>
<P>
   Wensberg, a veteran magazine editor who spent the last few years
revising Wilson Follett's classic reference book ``Modern American
Usage,'' takes a dim view of fancy speech. Legal language isn't
fancy in its place, he said. For example, he wouldn't accuse the
president of linguistic hair-splitting when he said, ``It depends
on what the meaning of the word `is' is,'' in his grand jury
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in a legal proceeding, he wasn't in a television
show,'' Wensberg said from his home in Manhattan. ``He was talking
before a grand jury and to prosecutors. Legal proceedings turn on
the definition of a word. Language is the currency of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   One might say the president's statement was appropriate, to use
a fashionable word. But would that be an appropriate use of
``appropriate''? To put it another way, would it be fitting? Yes.
But ``appropriate'' is not always appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When President Clinton said his dalliance with Ms. Lewinsky
was `not appropriate' it sounded terribly prim and fancy,''
Wensberg said. ``He sounded like his own psychotherapist. It was
doubly silly because in the next breath he said that it was
`wrong,' a word everyone understands.''
</P>
<P>
   What about ``dalliance''? Isn't that an example of fancy speech?
Wensberg says it isn't. ``Dalliance is a wonderful old word for
hanky-panky, whoopee, whatever you want to call it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex'' perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   ``Occasionally I wonder whether words are the best means for
talking about language,'' Wensberg said. ``But they're all we
have.''
</P>
<P>
   The verb ``address'' is rampant now. ``Nobody ever thinks about
anything anymore, or discusses something, they address
everything,'' he said. ``Especially politicans, to whom the word is
very useful because all it promises is that one will turn one's
attention to something, or possibly just turn one's head.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Speak to'' is the evil twin of ``address,'' Wensberg says.
``Your attitude doesn't speak to my feelings. Your actions don't
speak to my needs. It comes straight out of the law,'' he said.
``It's terribly vague and windy.''
</P>
<P>
   Wensberg said he became ``almost painfully aware'' of other
people's speech while he was researching and revising the book.
``Although my friends say I don't go around correcting people,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes earlier I'd said, ``We seem compelled to use
florid language.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd question your use of `compel,''' Wensberg said. I deserved
that.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of ``Modern American Usage'' is to help people think
about the words they use. If they did, he says, perhaps they
wouldn't use so many evasive, fashionable, silly words.
</P>
<P>
   ``The infant imitates what he hears, and thereby learns words,''
Wensberg said. ``The instinct stays very strong. The media have a
terribly powerful effect. I think sometimes, on very bad days, that
we are coming down to a vocabulary of about 17 words. I listen to
politicians and broadcasters to see how swiftly they get from
`focus' to `address' to `frustrated' to `issues.' They're boring
the public to death and any experienced writer or speaker knows
that's failure.''

CHOOSE COMPROMISE OVER COERCION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We introduced our friends Judith and Michael with a warning.
``We're not fixing you up,'' I said when I invited them both to
dinner. ``We think you'll enjoy each other's company, but that's
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Judith and Mike were both unconventional, outspoken, and
exuberant, far too similar to fit well together. I not only thought
they'd each probably do best with a quiet, soft-spoken partner, I
had an additional reservation. I'd been in both Mike's and Judith's
kitchens. There was no way these two could ever share the same
space.
</P>
<P>
   Mike's kitchen in Wellesley, Mass. was lined with bookcases,
each filled with mysterious large glass bottles. In them were
chilis he'd brought back from Arizona, beans of all colors, exotic
condiments, and strange spices. Mike's kitchen was part laboratory,
part work of art, and in it he created elaborate meals from
scratch. Having often lingered over mouth-watering meals at his
kitchen table, I'd come to the conclusion the last thing he needed
was another cook.
</P>
<P>
   Judith, herself, was a whirlwind in the kitchen. All you ever
noticed in her kitchen was Judith, bustling from sink to
refrigerator to oven, hauling out stacks of Hanukkah latkes, baking
chocolate desserts so rich they could have made the Fortune 500
list, mixing, stirring, and energetically tossing scraps from the
cutting board onto the compost heap right outside her kitchen door.
Judith was Betty Crocker on steroids, prepared to feed a dozen
guests at the drop of a hat. Having watched her work miracles in a
kitchen stuffed to the gills with the implements of her trade, I
couldn't imagine another cook in her kitchen either.
</P>
<P>
   But what do I know? Mike and Judith saw stars the minute they
laid eyes on each other and married without a thought as to whether
there was a kitchen in this world big enough to hold them both.
Sure enough, I was right. The course of love never runs smooth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike couldn't get over the fact that I don't wring out the
sponges when I finish doing the dishes,'' Judith told me as we
chatted after an exercise class. ``In the meantime, I've been
amazed that he never notices when he spills things on the kitchen
floor. We were both trying to change in order to please the other,
but without much success. Then one day I said to him, `Look, I'll
wring out the sponges if you'll clean the floor,' and it's
working.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is?'' I said, feeling a sense of deja vu. My friend Lynn
and I used to argue about this all the time. We could never resolve
the question of whether asking tit for tat is a form of barter or
blackmail.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn always advocated giving love freely, without ever measuring
what you got in return. She didn't approve of adding an element of
coercion to negotiations, or of withholding any loving act as a
spur to action. For my part, l was in favor of all the leverage I
could get.
</P>
<P>
   I've come to see, however, that there's a difference between
withholding a service you're already providing and moving into
brand new territory. If you've already agreed without protest, say,
to act as the hostess to your husband's business collegues, it
isn't really fair to suggest that unless your husband is willing to
meet some demand of yours, you'll have to rethink those dinner
parties. That is a threat. Still, if you ask for what you want
without results, must you leave it at that? Isn't there something
more you can do?
</P>
<P>
   Forget the if-you-loved-me routine. No matter what you attach to
it, the perfect comeback is ``If you loved me, you'd accept me
exactly as I am.'' Emotional outbursts with no discernible results
turn out in the end to be a waste of everybody's time. Punishments,
like sulking or not speaking, usually create a whole new cycle of
resentment.
</P>
<P>
   I'm growing more and more fond of straight-forward transactions
like Judith's. The proposition goes: ``Look, hon, I really want you
to do this for me. What would I have to do in return to make that
attractive?''
</P>
<P>
   This only works, of course, if the people involved are
reasonable and caring. There's no room for cruel jibes, like ``How
about losing 25 pounds?'' There's no place for folks who want
something without being willing to give something in return. You
need a certain generosity of spirit to suceed at this marital
version of, ``Let's Make a Deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Now let's see. Jack's beaten me at gin rummy the last 11 times

100 YEARS OF GERSHWIN: 'S WONDERFUL! 'S MARVELOUS!

   He published his first song in 1916, when he was 17 years old.
He died 2 1/2 months before his 39th birthday. In that short
interval, George Gershwin created some of the most essential music
of the 20th century. He wrote for Tin Pan Alley and for the New
York Philharmonic, for Broadway and for Hollywood. No less highbrow
an authority than Arnold Schoenberg said of him, ``I know he is an
artist and a composer; he expressed musical ideas; and they were
new.'' And no less legendary a tunesmith than Irving Berlin
declared, ``We were all pretty good songwriters. But Gershwin was
something else. He was a composer.''
</P>
<P>
   In his own lifetime, he was hugely popular. Sixty years after
his death, he is even more beloved. Dozens of his songs are
standards now, endlessly reinterpreted by singers sublime (Ella
Fitzgerald) and ridiculous (Twiggy). He was a high school dropout;
his neighbors never expected him to amount to much. But the
immigrants' kid from the Brooklyn tenements turned out to be one of
the giants of American musical history.

   The lyrics, of course, were by his older brother Ira. It was for
Ira that Morris and Rose Gershvin (as the surname originally was)
bought a piano, but it was George, then 12, who monopolized it. Two
years later, piano lessons began; the year after that, he was
working for Jerome H. Remick &AMP; Co., a music publisher, as the
youngest piano pounder in Tin Pan Alley. ``He played all day,'' Ira
wrote, ``traveled to nearby cities to accompany the song pluggers,
was sent to vaudeville houses to report which acts were using
Remick songs, (and) wrote a tune now and then ...''
</P>
<P>
   His first hit came in 1919, when Al Jolson sang ``Swanee,'' a
number Gershwin had written with lyricist Irving Caesar. It became
the biggest hit of his lifetime. Jolson's recording sold more than
2.5 million copies, a mind-boggling number for an age when
phono-graph music was still in its childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swanee'' was only the start. Gershwin wrote something on the
order of 1,000 songs, most of them for Broadway musicals now
forgotten. Few remember the 1924 show ``Lady Be Good,'' but the
title song is immortal. So is ``The Man I Love.'' We take it all
for granted now, but 70 years ago, Gershwin's musical language was
new and aggressive. These were no mannered operettas he and his
brother were writing. They were jazzy, driving, angular _ very
American, very 1920s.

   ``Strike Up The Band.'' ``Someone To Watch Over Me.'' ``How Long
Has This Been Going On.'' ``I've Got A Crush On You.'' ``Let's Call
The Whole Thing Off.'' ``'S Wonderful.'' ``Summertime.'' It is
impossible to imagine the American songbook without Gershwin. And
if he hadn't died so long before his time, how many more melodies
would have flowed from that remarkable pen?
</P>
<P>
   His popular music alone would have guaranteed Gershwin fame
everlasting. But from the start he was equally interested in
writing ``serious'' music. In 1924, Paul Whiteman invited him to
contribute a piece of music to a concert he was organizing on the
theme of ``What Is American Music?'' Gershwin was just wrapping up
the score for a new musical, and it wasn't until he was headed to
Boston for the pre-Broadway tryout that he began to focus on
Whiteman's commission. On that journey, ``Rhapsody in Blue'' was
born.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was on the train, with its steely rhythms, its
rattle-ty-bang that is often so stimulating to a composer (that) I
suddenly heard _ and even saw on paper _ the complete construction
of the Rhapsody, from beginning to end,'' he later recalled. ``I
heard it as a sort of musical kaleidoscope of America.''
</P>
<P>
   There had never been anything like ``Rhapsody in Blue,'' with
its fabulous glissando clarinet opening. In 1928, ``An American in
Paris'' premiered at Carnegie Hall, and there had never been
anything like that, either, with its bluesy themes and scoring for
taxi horns. And it goes without saying that ``Porgy and Bess,''
Gershwin's 1935 masterpiece, was something astonishingly new under
the sun. The reviews were unfriendly and the show closed after just
124 performance. But Gershwin always knew it was his greatest
creation. Today, is there anyone who doesn't know?

BOOMERS RETIRE? NO WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY DYM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American psyche is riddled with contradictions and confusion
about aging and retirement.
</P>
<P>
   As a people, we are living longer, healthier lives. Yet American
businesses urge early retirement to unload the burden of highly
paid workers -- even as companies suffer from a shortage of
talented managers.
</P>
<P>
   As a culture, we have come to believe in early retirement almost
as a birthright. A broad array of social forces -- from social
workers to gerontologists, labor unions to the advertising industry
-- market a positive image of retirement. Consequently, many people
do end their work lives early in order to seek the pleasures of
family and travel, golf and gardening.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, many of them find themselves culturally almost
disenfranchised, living lives that seem to lack meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Baby boomers, having seen their parents face such problems in
early retirement, are balking.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent study by the American Association of
Retired Persons, or AARP, eight out of 10 Americans born between
1948 and 1964 expect to work beyond age 65. Compare that with the
roughly one in 10 (or 11.8 percent) of those over 65 who held jobs
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Almost two in five workers of the baby-boom generation agreed
with the statement: ``I can't even imagine myself retiring!'' How
could they? Aside from the fear of growing bored and irrelevant,
the young old won't have enough income from pensions and Social
Security to retire in anything close to the style they might have
imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is increasingly difficult to remain at work in satisfying
and productive ways. Rather than design jobs for workers in their
50s, 60s, and 70s, or provide training to those who want to expand
their skills, corporations seem content to lose many of their best
and brightest. Corporate literature on career development reveals
the bias: for workers over 50, there is almost none.
</P>
<P>
   Many older workers, left on their own, come up with personal
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands find or create part-time jobs that bridge the world
between full employment and retirement. Others start their own
companies. Still others become higher-paid consultants to the very
companies they had served. Those options are fine, as far as they
go, but they are no substitute for a workplace -- and a culture --
that values the continued, full-time participation of senior
workers well into the years now thought of as retirement time.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the problem is the mismeasure of age. We don't
yet know the distinctive capabilities and casts of character that
distinguish the 50-to-75 age group.
</P>
<P>
   Research is beginning to provide answers. One study, Healthy
People 2000, found that 84 percent of Americans over 45 (including
78 percent of those between 69 and 74) indicated that they were not
limited for health reasons in the amount and type of important
activities they could perform. Those who work are the healthiest of
all.
</P>
<P>
   Another study tells us that workers between 55 and 65 are as
healthy as those between 45 and 55. They don't get sick any more
often than younger workers, they report to work as reliably, and
they perform virtually all physical tasks with comparable ability.
</P>
<P>
   What about the idea that people slow down mentally? Longitudinal
studies show that, unless a person has suffered a serious health
problem such as a stroke or head injury, most of us sustain our
intellectual functioning well into our 70s and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   However, direct comparisons with younger people may be beside
the point.
</P>
<P>
   Measuring older workers only by the standards of youth
inevitably favors youth. The flaw in this form of measurement was
dramatically pointed out by Carol Gilligan, a Harvard University
professor and pioneer in gender studies, who contends that the
theories produced by such gurus of psychology as Sigmund Freud were
not theories of human development at all. They were theories of
male development. Men are different from women and they mature
differently.
</P>
<P>
   The ideal man is not the ideal woman.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, in the workplace, older people are generally measured
by standards that make them look less adequate, primarily by
emphasizing physical stamina and mental quickness, not depth and
complexity.
</P>
<P>
   Shouldn't the measures include their experience, their personal
and political savvy, their wisdom? What about their capacity to
take the long view, to keep small setbacks and slights in
perspective? What about their ability and inclination to nurture
younger workers, so long as they aren't placed in positions to
directly compete with their youthful colleagues? What about many
other capacities and casts of mind we have not yet associated with
corporate productivity?
</P>
<P>
   Older workers need new challenges that better fit the experience
and knowledge they've accumulated. Many people at 50, 55, or 60,
are not ready for year-round golf and gardening, though, in
addition to a steady income, many, if not most, do want more time
to seek pleasures, satisfy curiosities, pursue travels, and spend
time with the grandchildren. And they would like more control of
their time than they have had through the years.
</P>
<P>
   It is in the interest of all -- corporations, government
agencies, and individuals -- to restructure the workplace to
increase productivity and satisfaction for mature workers.
</P>
<P>
   A few organizations have begun this process. One way is for a
company to look to its own retirees as a source of temporary help.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Travelers Companies allow retired employees to work
up to 960 hours each year without cutting their pension checks. The
program saves the company about $1.5 million each year in agency
fees. To Travelers, this makes business sense because its retirees
are reliable and experienced workers.
</P>
<P>
   IBM has followed suit by rehiring many of the highly skilled and
knowledgeable people who were eliminated in the restructuring of
the early '90s. The rehired retirees are considered an elite corps
of managers, operating a supplemental work force to address
specific business problems. IBM is also designing a mentoring
system in which savvy retirees are paired with newly hired college
graduates. The mentors help the newcomers to understand IBM's
history and culture, as well as how to succeed there.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid has developed what it calls a ``flexible work
alternative'' to help senior employees make decisions about
retirement. For example, mature workers can take a ``rehearsal
retirement,'' a leave of absence for three to six months. They are
entitled to come back to the same job, no questions asked.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is ``tapering off,'' which permits employees to
reduce their work load to as few as 20 hours a week. The programs
are more than just altruistic. The bottom-line result is improved
morale and productivity, the company reports.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study of 500 companies of all sizes by Watson Wyatt
Worldwide, a Wellesley-based consultant to corporate human resource
departments, found 8 percent offering phased retirement. In that
arrangement, retirement-age employees continue in their old jobs
but with scaled down hours, typically 20 to 29 hours per week.
</P>
<P>
   A variation on phased retirement is the so-called ``boomerang
job,'' in which an employee retires for a few months or a year,
then bounces back to the company with limited hours. An example is
the Monsanto Company's so-called Retiree Resource Corps. Retirees
who participate are called back as needed, with a database tracking
their skills and hours. Monsanto figures boomerangers cost 12 to 15
percent less than temporary workers.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, some corporations such as Honeywell, American Express,
and 3M have developed internal task forces to guage workers' needs.
But these programs are only a start. It is sometimes said that a
society's health can be measured by how it views, and treats, it's
elders. This is not simply a matter of generosity to older people;
the way you conceive the future profoundly influences the way you
live in the present.
</P>
<P>
   Authentic anticipation of a secure and fulfilling future permits
young people to live and work more confidently. Reconceiving and
restructuring the future of the workplace now, rebalancing the way
it values and makes use of youth and maturity, are among the great
challenges of contemporary society.

HARVARD ENDOWMENT TAKES A $1.3 BILLION HIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The turmoil roiling the world's markets has erased about $1.3
billion from Harvard University's endowment in the last 2 1/2
months.
</P>
<P>
   In its annual letter, Harvard Management Co., the university's
investment arm, said it had lost ``approximately 10 percent'' of
the $13 billion endowment since July 1 and ``we are prepared for
the possibility that things will get worse before they get
better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard endowment, the world's largest university endowment,
is getting hurt by the same forces that produced big losses for
everyone from small investors to sophisticated hedge funds like
Long-Term Capital Management, the highly regarded Connecticut money
manager that recently owned up to losing $2 billion in the August
market meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's 10 percent decline is about equal to the drop in the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index over the same period. But Harvard has
always objected to using the S&AMP;P as a benchmark, saying it does not
properly reflect its blend of stocks, bonds, real estate, and other
investments. With its positions in bonds and other investments that
have done relatively well, Harvard Management says it should have
been able to top the S&AMP;P.
</P>
<P>
   Jack R. Meyer, president of Harvard Management, said he was
``particularly disappointed'' that the firm was trailing its own
internally developed benchmark by nearly 3 percentage points over
the last 2 1/2 months.
</P>
<P>
   He said Harvard's system was designed to outperform the
benchmark in down markets, but said the performance had been hurt
by the pressure on other hard-hit hedge funds to unwind their
positions, moves that have cut the value on some of the same
securities held by Harvard. Hedge funds are private investment
vehicles catering to the wealthy that engage in risky trading in
stocks and options.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trades that were compelling two months ago have moved against
us with surprising speed and magnitude,'' Meyer said in his annual
letter.
</P>
<P>
   On an absolute basis, Harvard's returns were hurt because of its
fairly substantial (9 percent of assets) bet on hard-hit emerging
markets. Overall, Harvard has about 30 percent of its assets in
foreign securities.
</P>
<P>
   While Meyer is not looking for a quick rebound, he remains
comfortable with Harvard's position and plans no changes in the
system. ``We are actually in good position,'' he said in an
interview Wednesday. ``We have no operational problems, no pressure
to unwind our positions. We are going to do very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent turmoil tends to obscure the fact that Harvard just
completed another year of strong performance.
</P>
<P>
   According to the annual accounting, Harvard Management produced
a total return after fees of 20.5 percent for the year ending June
30. That compares with a return of 17.9 percent for the median
institutional fund and 17.1 percentfor its own benchmark. Meyer
estimated that return provided Harvard with an additional $400
million last year in return above a passively invested portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   While it was another ``solid year,'' as Meyer put it, the
returns were down from the previous year, both on an absolute and
comparative basis. The total return for fiscal year 1997 was 25.8
percent, topping both its own benchmark and the median
institutional fund by more than 5 percentage points, a huge margin.
</P>
<P>
   Just the same, Meyer said he was delighted with '98 returns.
``Overall, it is above what is possible to do going forward,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last five years, Harvard Management has produced a
total annualized return of 19.6 percent compared with 14.8 percent
for the median fund and 16.6 percent for its benchmark. In dollar
terms, Meyer said, the median return over the period would mean
that Harvard would have $2.7 billion less in its endowment than it
has.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Meyer said the Harvard Management board over the
summer had rejected his initiative to allow the firm to manage more
non-Harvard assets. Meyer had pushed the proposal as a way to keep
key money managers from leaving the firm, but the board rejected
the idea because it feared the move would lessen the focus on
managing Harvard's own resources.
</P>
<P>
   Several managers have left in recent months, including star
equity manager Jonathon Jacobson, who will continue to manage
Harvard assets at his new hedge fund. Meyer said he was
disappointed by the board's decision, but noted the ``environment
has changed pretty substantially over the last 2 1/2 months.
Hopefully we're going to be pretty stable.''

The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; The showdown at the Circle T ranch continues.
</P>
<P>
   City councilors in Fort Worth, Texas, have refused to turn over
jurisdiction of the 2,500-acre ranch to the adjacent suburb of
Westlake, blocking plans of owner Ross Perot Jr. to build a new
regional campus for Fidelity Investments.
</P>
<P>
   A $6 million settlement offer by Perot, son of the former
independent candidate for president, was rejected Tuesday. Fidelity
had contracted to buy up to 311 acres if the jursdiction disputes
were settled and the property was deemed to be in tax-free
Westlake.

massacre.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ It began with a police crackdown on students
playing football and ended in a horrific massacre that has scarred
Mexico for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans call it Tlatelolco (pronounced, tla-tay-Lol-ko), one of
the names for an ancient plaza here where scores, perhaps hundreds
of students and others were shot down by soldiers during a peaceful
rally on Oct. 2, 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows how many really died in the sudden attack, carried
out on the eve of the 1968 Olympic Games here. And nobody was held
accountable for the carnage, which tarnished Mexico's reputation
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But more than a generation later -- as Tlatelolco's 30th
anniversary approaches -- Mexicans emboldened by a more democratic
era are demanding answers and an end to official secrecy about what
really happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still victims of Tlatelolco,'' said Ana Ignacia
Rodriguez, who was a 22-year-old law student who survived the
massacre only to be detained at gunpoint and sentenced to 16 years
in prison on trumped up sedition charges.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was released after two years, but black-listed from
jobs. Trained as a lawyer, she rejected the profession because she
forever lost faith in Mexico's justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Aguayo, a champion of fair elections in Mexico, said
Tlatelolco ``was a parting of the waters, especially because of the
violent methods of repression that were used.'' He is author of
``1968: Archives of Violence,'' one of a number of new books about
Tlatelolco that are now being published.
</P>
<P>
   A committee established last year in Mexico's newly pluralistic
Congress is expected to issue a report on Tlatelolco in October. It
has been investigating recently unsealed archives belonging to
Mexico's Interior Ministry, which is charge of domestic security.
</P>
<P>
   Some committee members are opposition politicians who are
Tlatelolco survivors; they were elected to Congress last year,
breaking nearly 70 years of monopoly by Mexico's dominant
Revolutionary Institutional Party.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the student protests that swept the world in 1968 -- for
democracy, against the Vietnam War -- Mexico's was perhaps the most
violently repressed, investigators say. The brutal attempt to
establish total control stripped away an image of benevolence the
government was struggling to project during the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Today, military records on Tlatelolco remain sealed. But Aguayo
and others have pieced together accounts of how -- and who -- was
behind the bloodshed by reviewing unsealed Mexican archives and
thousands of memos produced by the American CIA, the FBI, the U.S.
Embassy in Mexico and other U.S. agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Searching for clues and international reaction, Aguayo also
found a treasure of information among International Olympic
Committee records in Europe and in the Lyndon Baines Johnson
Library archives at the University of Texas in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a plan mounted by the government to get rid of the
student movement before the Olympics. There's no doubt,'' Aguayo
said.
</P>
<P>
   The government of then-President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz, considered
a stern authoritarian, didn't plan on killing so many students,
Aguayo said. But it was willing to use violence to stop the student
movement before the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest bombshell Aguayo found in archives is an apparent
pattern of international support for Mexico's decision to act
harshly.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, stories swirled that the students were financially
supported or armed by Cuba or the Soviet Union. Versions of these
tales appear in Cold War-influenced FBI memos dispatched to the
United States from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Aguayo said, ``evidence of outside support for the
students doesn't exist. All the evidence is that the outside
support was for the government of Mexico. This is very noteworthy
because the Soviet Union, Cuba, Washington, they all supported the
government of Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   The unlikely spark for the 1968 protests was a fight that broke
out that summer between two schools engaged in a casual game of
touch football. Police brutally intervened, angering students
throughout Mexico City. Even current Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo, who was 16, joined in some protests and was photographed
confronting police.
</P>
<P>
   Students were also primed by growing discontent over a lack of
freedom of speech and concern for political prisoners, including
imprisoned labor activists who were trying to break from Mexico's
government-controlled unions.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the summer, students marched for the repeal of a law
that gave authorities sweeping power to imprison dissidents. They
also wanted the dissolution of a repressive special police unit
they considered unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the consciousness of the young people and people in
general, the idea was growing that in Mexico there were no
democratic freedoms,'' recalled Rodriguez, the former law student.
``And we wanted freedoms.''
</P>
<P>
   Police occupied high schools and universities and began
imprisoning students. On Oct. 2, Rodriguez said, students gathered
for a legal assembly in Tlatelolco. The site is also called the
Plaza of the Three Cultures because it is surrounded by Aztec
pyramids, a colonial church and modern high-rise apartment
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   As dusk fell, investigators say, a secret police force known as
the Olympic Brigade opened fire on the crowd, provoking soldiers to
begin shooting. People of all ages were killed, indiscriminately,
while others ran for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The official version of the story was that armed students fired
on soldiers. Aguayo said some of a hard core of protestors may have
returned fire, but his research shows that they were few and not
responsible for the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers were censured in the aftermath of the shooting and
surviving student leaders were rounded up. The government offered
three different numbers -- none over 50 -- for how many died. The
figure is probably closer to 200 or 300, according to reporters who
attempted to independently investigate the death toll.
</P>
<P>
   Some survivors are calling for military officers from the era to
be forced to testify before Mexican or international investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the special congressional committee vainly attempted
to glean new information from former President Luis Echeverria, who
was Diaz Ordaz's interior minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still need the truth,'' said Elena Poniatowska, a Mexican
journalist and novelist who in 1971 published ``The Night of
Tlatelolco,'' a shattering account of survivors' experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez believes Mexico's archives on Tlatelolco have probably
been sanitized, although she supports opening up all information as
well as investigating foreign archives.
</P>
<P>
   Three months after the massacre, Rodriguez was kidnapped by
police, blindfolded and interrogated and sentenced to prison in an
unconstitutional trial with fabricated evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine, a girl of 22. I pinched myself and told myself this
couldn't be happening to me,'' said Rodriguez, who now helps run a
Mexico City center that teaches women new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Tlatelolco, Rodriguez said, frightened Mexicans and forced them
to accept authoritarian rule for a time. But it also inspired
massive outrage over voter fraud in the 1980s as well as the
country's current movement for greater democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico before 1968 was one country,'' Rodriguez said, ``and
after 1968 it was another.''

 &HT;    TRADING ON THIN ICE: RUSSIA BARTERS AMID THE ECONOMIC BREAKDOWN
 &HT;    With RUSSIA-REGIONS-$ADV27.
 &HT;    EDs: Engels is on the Volga River about 450 miles south of
Moscow.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ENGELS, Russia _ The good news for Trolza, a mammoth assembly
plant and major employer in this depressed town on the Volga River,
was a recent deal worth $25 million to produce buses for several
Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news: No cash will be exchanged and no profits will
result.
</P>
<P>
   Barter made the deal possible. In a country with a sick economy,
a flimsy currency and a sea of debt, barter accounts for more than
two-thirds of all transactions in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The electric trolley buses will be built on an intricate web of
trades and swaps involving Trolza, dozens of companies who provide
component parts for the buses and the cities who need the vehicles
for their public transit systems.
</P>
<P>
   The factory, deep in the red since the Soviet Union collapsed in
1991 and with barely a ruble to its name, conducts an astounding 92
percent of its business in barter.
</P>
<P>
   It swaps buses to the city of Engels in lieu of paying its local
taxes. Farms give food in exchange for stocks of sheet metal, paint
and other items from Trolza's warehouses. Since Trolza cannot fully
afford to pay its employees, they get their salaries in onions,
cucumbers and macaroni.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like barter. The best option is the classic one:
money for goods and services. But we don't have a choice. We've
returned to ancient times: a piece of meat for a piece of fur,''
said Arthur Mikhel, Trolza's chairman of the board.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, ``cashless society'' conjures 21st century images
of ``smart'' credit cards and high-tech cash registers and instant
electronic debits from a bank account.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's cashless society is from a century in the other
direction. It emerged from a Soviet-era economy that never quite
made the transition to capitalism. The Russian marketplace is
hamstrung by failing banks, the falling ruble, government
corruption and an oppressive tax system.
</P>
<P>
   The result is survival-by-barter from the corner fruit stand to
the highest levels of industry.
</P>
<P>
   Every Russian province, even in the relatively prosperous
capital, Moscow, has examples of barter. Workers get paid in toilet
paper and t-shirts. Companies stay in business by wrangling
supplies and swapping their products to pay their utility bills and
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   About 8,000 teachers in the impoverished Altai district of
Siberia have not been paid since February, owed $3.5 million in
wage arrears. They agreed this week to accept their pay in 15
bottles of vodka per teacher per month, which then can be re-sold
on the streets and to local markets.
</P>
<P>
   Barter now accounts for about 70 percent of trade in Russia and
the figure is growing amid the current economic crisis, according
to Yaroslav Lisavolik, a Moscow economist who has studied the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, barter reflects the fortitude of Russians who
are determined to survive in tough times, keeping the factories
running and commerce humming.
</P>
<P>
   But economists warn that more barter will only produce more
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Barter perpetuates trading between companies and individuals,
but perverts the system by making it impossible for the economy to
grow and for government to collect badly needed taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a law in economics that says bad money drives out
good money and this is exactly what has been going on. Barter,
which is bad money in a way, has been replacing cash,'' said
Lisavolik.
</P>
<P>
   Since the demise of the Soviet Union, about 70 percent of
Russia's economy is now in private ownership. Barter transactions
make it possible for businesses to remain in business. Bankruptcies
are rare.
</P>
<P>
   But barter leaves businesses with little capital for their
payroll and no clear picture of their prices and earnings. It chews
up time and productivity among the financial officers and corporate
planners who must arrange the often elaborate deals.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of cash also prevents Russian businesses from doing
things that fundamentally would improve the Russian economy, such
as modernizing aging Soviet-era plants and retraining the work
force.
</P>
<P>
   Without barter, debt-ridden companies would be forced to compete
in the hard world of a genuine market economy. Many factories would
fail and unemployment would rise.
</P>
<P>
   One of the world's largest enterprises, Russia's natural gas
monopoly, Gazprom, conducts 80 percent of its business in barter,
according to the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no cash and the chain begins from there. Everybody
uses electricity and everybody uses gas ... Enterprises couldn't
make their payments, so they started bargaining,'' said Andrei
Laptev, financial director for Sapkon/Neftemash, a company in the
southern city of Saratov which manufactures equipment for the oil
and gas industry.
</P>
<P>
   Since Russia's troubled economy means its customers cannot pay,
Sapkon/Neftemash has been forced to do about 60 percent of its
business this year in barter, up from 40 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In the dilapidated river town of Engels (named for the 19th
century philosopher Friedrich Engels who helped found the Communist
movement) the trolley bus factory struggles simply to exist. Dreams
of profit are sheer fantasy at Trolza, founded 130 years ago and
operating from a plant built just after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The electric buses, which are tethered to overhead wires running
along city streets, are a common form of mass transit in Moscow and
dozens of other Russian cities. The company with 2,200 employees
had during its Soviet heyday the ability to produce 2,500 buses a
year. In 1996 and 1997, it manufactured only 120 each year.
</P>
<P>
   Trolza currently owes about $4.2 million in back taxes and
penalties -- a sum it cannot pay. Barter complicates the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Under Russia's tax laws, the company must record the sale of its
buses even if no cash changes hands. Thus, Trolza will owe taxes on
$25 million in sales after the recent barter deal is completed. And
without cash, it cannot pay taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You work and work and there is no result,'' complained Nikolai
Polulyakh, the company's general director and a member of the
regional parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two real questions in Russia, 'What is to be done?'
and 'Who is to blame?' I think we are all to blame to take part in
such a system,'' he said.

<P>
   SARATOV, Russia _ ``It involves a lot of time and nerves and
risks,'' Fyodor Shimchuk says of barter. He is general director of
Sapkon/Neftemash, a company in southern Russia that makes pumps and
valves for the oil and gas industry.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, it took a dozen negotiators from his company
and others more than two months to complete a barter deal involving
$100,000 worth of equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it unfolded:
</P>
<P>
   1. A natural gas drilling facility in Yamburg, above the Arctic
Circle, needed replacement parts: $100,000 worth of safety valves
and pumps.
</P>
<P>
   2. In Saratov, about 1,500 miles southwest of Yamburg, a company
called Sapkon/Neftemash makes the pumps and valves.
</P>
<P>
   3. The two companies began negotiations after Yamburg said it
did not have the cash to pay for the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   4. Yamburg is a subsidiary of Russia's natural gas monopoly,
Gazprom, headquartered in Moscow. Yamburg asked Gazprom to give
Sapkon/Neftemash $100,000 worth of natural gas in return for the
pumps and valves.
</P>
<P>
   5. Gazprom agreed, ordering its subsidiary in Saratov to provide
the gas.
</P>
<P>
   6. But Sapkon/Neftemash, the pump manufacturer, had no use for
natural gas. However, it owed about $100,000 to the local electric
company, Sarenergo.
</P>
<P>
   7. Sarenergo didn't need natural gas either. But its subsidiary
did -- the power plant that actually produces the electricity.
</P>
<P>
   8. So the chain was completed. Simply put, the Arctic drilling
station paid Sapkon/Neftemash for the valves and pumps with
$100,000 worth of natural gas. But four other companies and
affiliates also were involved in the complex circle of bartering.
</P>
<P>
   Since no cash traded hands, Sapkon/Neftemash is hard-pressed to
pay its workers. Also, under Russia's tax system the company will
have to record the value of the transaction -- $100,000 -- and pay
taxes on the sale, money it does not have.
</P>
<P>
   Without barter, the company would survive, but would be forced
to make major layoffs and pay cuts, Shimchuk said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the barter negotiations reach a critical point where
our suppliers can do nothing else but pay cash,'' says Shimchuk,
``and for that we are very happy.''

`FARMER'S WIFE' FAMILY DOING WELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Everything's a lot better,'' says Darrel Buschkoetter, the
Lawrence, Neb., husband/father/farmer whose rollercoaster family
struggles with his wife Juanita and three young daughters were
dramatically recounted in the acclaimed three-part PBS
``Frontline'' and Independent Television Service special ``The
Farmer's Wife,'' which concluded Wednesday night PBS.
</P>
<P>
   Buschkoetter, speaking by phone from the busy kitchen of his
home last night, updated the family fortunes since the filming
concluded. ``Juanita saved us,'' he said, referring to his wife's
emotional and financial rescue efforts for the family. ``Our
finances are in order. My dad retired and I bought his equipment.
Everything's going great.'' As for the public's reaction to the
series, he said, ``it's been real positive from all over the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   He was awaiting the arrival of Juanita from her job in town.
She'd just returned after going on a round of media appearances
surrounding the broadcast of the special.
</P>
<P>
   Independent filmmaker David Sutherland of Newton, Mass., who
filmed the family over three years, said Juanita's successful
takeover of the family fortunes at their bleakest has transformed
her. She's become so confident and proficient that ``she could run
for public office.'' And ``Darrel is a changed man, thanks to
therapy,'' he said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sutherland said he talked to Juanita by telephone Monday night
and that she was ``very excited'' by the response to their story.
The response included a letter of greetings from Hillary Rodham
Clinton and regret that she missed Juanita's testimony in
Washington Sept. 15 before a Democratic hearing on agricultural
issues.
</P>
<P>
   The family was invited to Washington by Senator Bob Kerrey
(D-Neb.). They've also been presented the National Catholic Rural
Life Conference's first St. Isidore and Maria Award honoring a
rural couple's ``fidelity to a dream, to a vocation and to love
combined with family integrity, stewardship, and religion.''
They'll receive the award in November in Des Moines. Willie Nelson
also invited them to ``Farm Aid'' in Illinois, Oct. 3.

   Forget books and magazines. Turn off the television. Put down
the Starr report. If you really want the lowdown, something that
will tell you almost anything you want to know about people,
medical journals are where the action is.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 alone, the National Library of Medicine added references
to 519,012 new articles from some 3,200 journals to its Medline
database. The fact that all these journals can survive and multiply
should be a clue that there's something compelling about them.
</P>
<P>
   Subscribers are willing to pay dearly to keep their favorite
journals going. Rates run to $3,000 a year or more for some
journals. As a result, while The New Yorker lost millions last
year, the scientific publishing giant Elsevier put out some 1,200
journals and made a whopping 40 percent profit on them.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, for many doctors and scientists, the interest in a
given journal is purely parochial. Even the smallest ones--Elsevier
produces some with fewer than 500 subscribers--can be the prestige
publication for a tiny field. Moreover, behind the glossy covers
and stilted prose, many of these little journals function as the
gossip rags, the People magazines, for the science niches.
</P>
<P>
   Poke around in a few medical journals, and you're bound to find
material as absorbing as anything you'll find in Vanity Fair.
</P>
<P>
   The names alone are worth perusing. Many journals follow the
standard ``Annals of'' or ``Archives of'' or ``Journal of''
approach--you know, like the International Journal of Leprosy. But
the best are the direct, in-your-face journal names: Placenta, Gut,
Brain, Blood. When you pick up Placenta, you know exactly what
you're getting.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, you get the impression that the editors are proud
to give it to you, that they have no second thoughts about the
field they have chosen. Consider, by comparison, Foot and Ankle
International. It's a terrible name. It conveys embarrassment, a
sense that the editors thought ``Foot'' alone wasn't good enough
for them. Even adding ``Ankle'' was still too minor league for
their ambitions, so they had to tack on that ``International.'' You
want a journal more willing to glory in its small, arcane world.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, however, the cool stuff is what's inside, and a few
journals always have the cool stuff. The Journal of Sex and Marital
Therapy is, not surprisingly, reliably fascinating no matter what
your profession. A recent issue I browsed through at the library
(while hiding it in a copy of Science) had such topically relevant
reports as ``Extramarital Affairs'' and ``Penile Erections: Shape,
Angle, and Length.''
</P>
<P>
   A quirkier favorite of mine is the Journal of Emergency
Medicine, which is replete with oddball articles--such as the
recent one from the University of Tennessee on 14 cases occurring
over five weeks in which prisoners reported swallowing razor blades
and other metal objects.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, however, I discovered the journal that never fails
to amaze: the American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology.
A typical issue contained an article on three suicide victims with
multiple gunshot wounds to the head (complete with photos from the
death scenes; one poor guy shot himself five times before he
finally died), another on improved methods to determine the age of
an unidentified victim, and yet a third on the homicide rituals of
the Italian Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these specialized journals offers an obsessive's-eye
view of the world around us, a new look at the seemingly familiar.
International medical journals, however, can do the opposite. They
tend to share the common language of doctors everywhere and so can
make the unfamiliar reassuringly accessible, while still conveying
a revealing sense of their national Zeitgeist.
</P>
<P>
   I recently picked up the Annals of Saudi Medicine, for example,
and discovered, to my surprise, the telling obsessions of a
modernized country: ulcers, a growing epidemic of obesity, smoking,
heart disease, child abuse. The Indian Journal of Medical Research,
on the other hand, despite all the press reports about India's
burgeoning middle class, is currently filled with reports on
infectious diseases--the scourge of poor nations.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, few people appreciate the refined charms of medical
journals. Occasionally, however, I'll come across a fellow journal
junkie. We'll exchange tips like frat boys do. ``Have you seen the
Journal of Personality and Social Psychology?'' one such friend
asked me not long ago. ``That journal is hot.''
</P>
<P>
   I looked it up at my next opportunity. It did not disappoint.
The first issue I read had a study of 219 subjects who were
instructed to put on a specific facial expression while looking in
the mirror. What the psychologists found was that participants told
to do nothing more than put on a happy face developed a
significantly more positive mood than those told to adopt a neutral
expression. And those made to assume an unhappy expression had the
worst moods of all.
</P>
<P>
   I made a mental note to check that journal out again. And, when
I left the library that evening, you can bet I had a smile on my
face.

`JESSE''S SINGULAR STRENGTH IS CHRISTINA APPLEGATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
JESSE 
Starring: Christina Applegate, George Dzundza, Bruno Campos, David
DeLuise, John Lehr, Eric Lloyd 
On: NBC 
Time: Thursday at 8:30 p.m. 
Rated: TVPG 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We may as well go ahead and order up the bouquets for Christina
Applegate and her new sitcom, ``Jesse,'' in celebration of their
preordained landing in the Nielsen Top10. Blessed by NBC with the
time slot between ``Friends'' and ``Frasier,'' their ratings
success is one of those TV sure things. But let's put FTD on hold
regarding flowery critical praise for this unformed single-mom
comedy, a very maybe proposition that could get a whole lot funnier
(see: ``Just Shoot Me''), if it doesn't get a whole lot freakier
and more foolish first (don't see: ``Veronica's Closet'').
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, NBC premiered ``Conrad Bloom,'' about a Mr.
Nice Guy who is suffocated by the many women in his life. ``Jesse''
sets up the opposite situation, with a heroine much in demand with
the boys _ big and little _ in her life. She's a waitress at Der
Biergarten, a Buffalo establishment owned by her gruff dad, and she
lives nearby with her 10-year-old son. Her two brothers are
frequently on hand, one of whom is a witless entrepreneur, and she
is facing her first romance in years with her new neighbor, Diego,
who comes a-courting in episode 2 bearing Pablo Neruda poems.
Meanwhile, deadbeat dudes at the bar keep hitting on her, despite
the fact that her outfit makes her look ``like the girl from the
Ricola commercial,'' as Diego points out.
</P>
<P>
   It's a working-class slice of life, although this is Thursday
night after ``Friends,'' so the hipness level (and the haircut
standard) is definitely higher than a ``Roseanne''-type show such
as ``The King of Queens.'' Applegate's Jesse looks like a less
coddled version of Jennifer Aniston, and her brother, John Jr., is
a classically cool slacker figure. Philosophical and long-haired,
he has taken a vow of silence ``until he can find a way to use
language in a more efficient manner,'' Jesse explains. John Jr.'s
wordlessness is an obvious gimmick, but one that, if handled with a
light touch, could push the show's family scenes beyond cliche.
</P>
<P>
   Because the rest of Jesse's gang are fairly stock characters,
particularly Jesse's father, John Sr., played by George Dzundza. He
is a gross bigot, given to amazement that William Shatner is Jewish
since he ``never pictured those people in space,'' and yet he's
presented as lovable and cuddly _ the 1990s,
can't-we-all-just-get-along answer to Archie Bunker. He's openly
displeased that his daughter is dating Diego, who is from Chile.
Also, Jesse's thick-headed brother Darren has the not-very-original
problem of being hooked on get-rich-quick schemes, which tonight
finds him in possession of far too many unpainted garden gnomes.
</P>
<P>
   Applegate emerges from this mixed bag as a real natural. Best
known for her years as the slutty Kelly Bundy on ``Married ... With
Children,'' she projects intelligence, sanity, and vulnerability as
Jesse. She's believable as both an assured, loving mother and a
single woman terrified of getting hurt by a man. The show's
creators, the same folks behind ``Friends'' and ``Veronica's
Closet,'' need to resist using her relationship with Diego as an
ongoing romantic tease (like Ross and Rachel on ``Friends,'' or
Caroline and Richard on ``Caroline in the City''). Applegate plays
the only single mother on the big network sitcoms, and she's strong
enough to carry the show without relying on silly wedding high
jinks.

NEED SEEN FOR IMPROVEMENT IN MASSACHUSETTS HMOS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes Gauging the HMOs text table.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Although Massachusetts is home to some of the best
health maintenance organizations in America, there is plenty of
room for them to improve, according to three reports released
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The reports, from the National Committee for Quality Assurance,
the Massachusetts Medical Society and US News &AMP; World Report,
reflect efforts to make HMOs more accountable to an increasingly
skeptical public.
</P>
<P>
   The most comprehensive of the three comes from the National
Committee for Quality Assurance, which released detailed
information on nearly 300 health plans across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   While Massachusetts HMOs as a whole performed considerably
better than their peers nationwide, the report showed considerable
variation in the quality of individual health plans. For example,
the percentage of patients given follow-up care after they are
discharged from hospitalization for mental illness ranged from 69
percent for patients of United Health Care of New England in
Providence to 93 percent at Fallon Community Health Plan in
Worcester.
</P>
<P>
   A second report from the Massachusetts Medical Society suggested
that while doctors were generally satisfied with health plans, they
are annoyed with the administrative hassles of dealing with HMOs.
The survey of 1,685 doctors also reported dissatisfaction with the
quality of mental health care provided by HMOs, as well as the
managed care industry's use of financial incentives to mold
physician behavior. Physicians also gave health plans low marks for
the quality of information HMOs give consumers, and in the plans'
ability to coordinate care between specialists and primary care
physicians.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs took the comments as constructive criticism, saying they
are already looking at ways to improve care and reduce red tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``If managed care works better for doctors, they will work
better for patients, too,'' said Dr. Kathryn J. Goonan, chief
medical officer for Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts plans fared well in a third report, from US News &AMP;
World Report, capturing five of the top 10 spots in the magazine's
third annual list of the nation's best HMOs. Fallon was ranked No.
1, Tufts Health Plan in Waltham was No. 3, Harvard Pilgrim Health
Care in Brookline ranked No. 4, Healthsource Massachusetts in
Worcester was No. 6, and Blue Cross was No. 10. Even so, the plans'
scores on member satisfaction, though higher than their national
peers, averaged 70 out of a possible 100 points.

DRESSES THAT ARE UNABASHEDLY ROMANTIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Designer Jessica McClintock has come a long way
from dimity-and-lace empire hippie dresses like the one Hillary
Rodham was married in. But her focus has remained the same _
romantic dresses for young women.
</P>
<P>
   The Holiday collection McClintock showed at the American Cancer
Society high tea in San Francisco Wednesday afternoon was romance
personified. Big foufy skirts, boned bustiers, acres of black
velvet and discreet sparkle. Gowns not only for high school
sweeties, but for their mothers who have kept their waistlines.
</P>
<P>
   McClintock's aim has never been haute couture although many of
her clothes are reminiscent of Vera Wang's more linear looks,
particularly a cloth-of-gold, strapless, floor-length sheath shown
with a notched lapel duster. Instead, she has dressed prom queens
and bridesmaids. Now, she's dressing the young woman who has more
taste than money. Her most expensive looks run $450 to $500.
</P>
<P>
   The prettiest dresses were quite Belle Epoque in feel,
particularly taffetas (especially a deep ruby-cranberry, perfect
for Christmas parties) worn with glittery collars of pearls or
rhinestones. These clothes, by the way, require nice shoulders,
slim backs and a straight carriage.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's show, McClintock presented a lot of the same
shapes in different fabrics like sleek, light-catching velvets in
black, deep plum, bottle green, chocolate brown and anthracite;
rusty taffetas in midnight blue, cranberry, green and champagne;
lace over taffeta, poly-silk and velvet. Or lace over sequins for a
twinkle hint of sheen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sequins are soooo '80s,'' said McClintock's niece, Jessica.
</P>
<P>
   The best looks are separates so tops and skirts could be mixed
and matched. There were boned bustiers or bateau-necked,
long-sleeved, corsetry-boned tops over bustled skirts, either
straight with ruched backs or full-on ball skirts. What slip
dresses there were (we call them sheaths now) were cut very low in
the back, some with rhinestone or jet-beaded straps. Then there
were the nipped waist, Shakespearean-style jackets with faux-fur
(mink, Persian lamb or nutria) collars and cuffs.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, this is a line that mothers and daughters will fight
over.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _____ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Neiman Marcus Christmas wish book is in the mail and this
year there are affordable presents among the outlandishly expensive
ones. But no one really wants to know about $10 stocking stuffers,
now, do they? We'd rather imagine what it would be like to be able
to afford a pound of Petrossian Beluga just as an appetizer.
</P>
<P>
   This year's fantasy gifts are a hodgepodge of the affordable
versus the ridiculous. What they all have in common, however, is
boomer nostalgia. There are, for instance, blue-painted benches
from Ebbets Field for $2,750 (seats two tushes) and $3,750 (a
three-seater). Then there is Neiman's yearly piece de resistance, a
one-of-a-kind carousel with six animals including a goat, a lion
and three different horses; 270 lights; an emergency-stop button;
solid brass poles, but no brass ring. It can be yours for $300,000,
first dibs, first served. And finally, a real childhood memory:
Cracker Jacks. His and Hers with fine jewelry prizes inside. For
her (at $950): a gold and ruby ring; for him (at $400): enamel
cufflinks in the shape of Cracker Jack boxes. Memories don't come
cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Neither do Paola Quadretti's cashmere jackets, created from Loro
Piana cashmere fabric. The teensy, blond, Florentine women's wear
designer was at Gretchen DeWitt's Sausalito aerie last week after
spending three days at Laura Fay's, showing her fall line to the
faithful who include Norah Stone, Sandra Mosbacher Lloyd, Vaughn de
Guigne and Frances Bowes. Quadretti's clothes are created from
couture fabrics, mostly Ungaro and Valentino. They cost one-third
of the price they'd be in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Clients enjoy selecting the fabric for one-of-a-kind outfits
which Quadretti tailors to their measurements.

FALL COLORS DRESS UP A GRAY SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Makeup is the form that follows fashion. And
fashion this fall is very, very gray and luxuriously textured.
Cashmere on suede. Crushed velvets. Menswear stripes with lace.
Sequins glinting quietly under organza. The clothes are also
deceptively simple, mostly linear takeoffs on American sportswear,
gussied up in luxury fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   And to carry them off, the face must be fresh and vivid. Color
has to cut through all that fashionable gray fog.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with the lips. All of the big cosmetic houses have
done lipsticks in the burgundy/plum/deep red families. Lips,
however, are not as defined by pencil as before. These lipsticks
can be daubed on with the finger (Chanel's new LipBlush in Bizarre,
a satisfying velvet stain in dark cabernet). Francois Nars' Colette
is the purplest in a crop of plums and burgundies. It's a sheer
that either glosses on alone or over another color or builds into a
stained-glass shine with double application.
</P>
<P>
   Chanel's special ``Temptress'' fall collection features
Sorceress, a dark burgundy brown lipstick; Lauder's ``Bejeweled''
collection has two baroquely gem-like lip colors including Antique
Amethyst, a purply fuchsia which is great for blondes, and Simply
Red, a deep brown-scarlet, which was brought back from last year.
Yves Saint Laurent's ``In Love Again'' collection presents a sunny
coral red (Rouge Pur No. 41) and a blue red (Rouge Pur No. 42).
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the most outrageous collection was makeup artist Fred
Faruggia's ``Rouge'' for Lancome. The lipsticks are volcanic and
intense reds, particularly Rouge Thermique, a scarlet of great
depth and vivacity. Faruggia, brought in last year to enliven the
line, has created an avant-garde specialty line, reportedly
``walking off counters,'' says Women's Wear Daily.
</P>
<P>
   The entire look _ red, red lips, highly rouged cheeks and red
eye shadows, liners and mascaras _ in the wrong hands could turn
you into a Kabuki bunny. Which is why it's nice to get to know your
sales staff and have them teach you how to wear it. The red liner
alone is a great accent, but the shadows that come in three
textures (frosted, matte and cream) are like TNT in the hands of a
baby. Better used in small doses.
</P>
<P>
   Eyelids in general have invited lots of deep and interesting
color this fall. YSL's In Love Again Eyes No. 5 compact is
definitely redhead colors with a smoky blue, a hunter green, a
violet and a burnished gold. Shadow deeply or fluff on for sheer
color. Chanel's Quadra Shadow compact, Mysteres, is a child's
palette of jade green, cider-cognac, topaz brown and gold worn with
a brandy-hued eye pencil and scads of black mascara. Dior's
Visionary Violets fall eye compact from the ``Les Tenebreuses''
Shadow and Light collection mixes up a smokier scheme with dark
blues, juxtaposed against chocolate brown and highlighted with
golden beige and deep, grayed lilac.
</P>
<P>
   Texture and depth of color are important new fall trends,
particularly on the lips.
</P>
<P>
   There is a new category of lip shine _ Industrial Strength Lip
Gloss _ which has the depth of car paint on the lips. Dior's
Plastic Shine really says it all. As thick and rich in pigment as
lipstick, it goes on like a gloss with a foam-tipped applicator but
looks like vinyl instead of some wimpy no-hue pastel. YSL's comes
in two forms _ Lip Lacquer which leaves a deep, mirror-shine of
intense color and Intense Lipcolor, which is a velvety matte.
</P>
<P>
   Prescriptives, meanwhile, has reformulated its lip gloss in a
tube into a high-shine formula made to last a long time on the
lips. And L'Oreal's Rouge Pulp has gotten some good results in the
lower-priced makeup category.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BeautyMart: Glitter and be gay: Coming for the holiday _ glitter
gels and fluff-on powders of pure glitter. Lancome's
Micro-Paillettes are holographic specks of shine that pick up light
and sparkle like crazy, just like fairy dust. Designed to light up
Fred Faruggia's all-red face, the Micro-Paillettes look extra
glittery fluffed on over Poudre Blanc Neige, Lancome's sheer
compact powder which goes on with a fiber-optic brush. Look for
face and body glitter from Chanel (a gel), YSL (gold and silver
glide-on creams and bright silver glitter); Maybelline (lavender
and golden glitters) and Lauder (an entire line of golden face
gleamers, lipsticks and nail glazes).
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Turn up the heat: Thermasilk hair products, developed by Helene
Curtis gives you a lot of bang(s) for the buck. These products are
heat-activated, starting with shampoo and conditioner. The Light
Conditioning Mist leave-in conditioner is a good protectant against
the thermal heat of hair dryers and the Shape &AMP; Hold Spray holds
without build-up. The price is right, too: $2.99 to $3.49.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Portable practicality: Francois Nars, whose runway looks for
Nicole Miller and Anna Sui were quite shiny and Barbie-like for
fall, has developed two very practical all-in-one makeup compacts,
called Artists' Palates. One is Skin Deep, in warm neutrals, and
the other is Lust for Life, a compendium of cooler burgundies,
roses and grays to match this fall's major gray color story. Using
existing colors from his extensive line, Nars has grouped three
lipsticks, two blushes and three eye colors in one flat black
rubber compact with a huge mirror. Says Nars' makeup artist at Saks
Fifth Avenue in San Francisco, Robert Williams, ``You don't have to
carry brushes. You can use it all at your fingertips for a quick
makeup that always looks perfect. The only thing you have to add is
mascara.'' For the privilege of packing light, the Artist Palates
are $58, Saks only.

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: Archie and Veronica
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I said I wouldn't watch it. But I did, at least about an hour of
Bill Clinton's grand jury performance. I thought it was pretty
dull, which, I'd guess, is what the president was shooting for.
Only once, when he was denouncing Paula Jones' lawyers with a
series of ``deplores,'' did I think Clinton hit his rhetorical
stride, rhythmically matching eloquence with indignation. His
strong suit was his supposed unwillingness to kiss and tell. They
say a gentleman doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   The Monica Lewinsky papers were released about the same time.
I've only read what I've seen in the papers. It seems to me that
what we have here is a collision of the greatest male midlife
crisis since Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack with a descendant of
the '60s Sexual Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton, a participating beneficiary of the Sexual
Revolution, seems to have forgotten the part about growing up.
We're not talking here about Romeo and Juliet. We're talking about
something more like Archie and Veronica. Monica Lewinsky, no
revolutionary, may or may not have ever heard of the Sexual
Revolution or thought about it very much. For her, it was an
unremarkable part of her life. Until, inexplicably, she fell in
love, just as Bill Clinton was flatfooting it down the hall on the
cusp of a '60s flashback.
</P>
<P>
   An amazing moment, really, fusing slapstick comedy, pathos,
irony and the culture gap into a criminal matter.

   FILM-CLAY (Undated) In an interview last month, director Gus Van
Zant said he cast Vince Vaughn for the Norman Bates role in his
upcoming remake of Hitchcock's ``Psycho'' because he wanted
``someone who would take you off guard'' _ an actor you wouldn't
expect to be a serial murderer. But it now looks as if Vaughn could
be typecast in that role before the film's December release.
Because in ``Clay Pigeons,'' he plays a vicious murderer of
helpless women in a story that seems to be inspired, ironically

`A SOLDIER'S DAUGHTER' IS THE ANTITHESIS OF `MOMMIE DEAREST' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For most of his writing career, James Jones suffered from having
his work compared unfavorably to his landmark first novel, ``From
Here to Eternity.'' Esquire Magazine once even made the morbid case
(``James Jones and the Critics'') that he was possibly the most
critically lambasted American novelist of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   But he's definitely getting the last laugh. His critical
reputation has steadily grown since his 1977 death until he's now
almost universally considered the greatest novelist of the World
War II generation. More recently _ thanks largely to Terrence
Malick's upcoming film version of Jones' 1962 novel, ``The Thin Red
Line'' _ he's once again the hottest writer in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a half-dozen biographies and memoirs that have
appeared in the last 20 years have all made the case that Jones was
that rarity in American letters: a successful novelist who was also
a successful human being. As gifted as he was as a novelist, he was
even better at being a father, husband and friend.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, this unique American success story is not going to be
tarnished by ``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries,'' the
Merchant-Ivory film version of a family memoir written by Jones'
daughter, Kaylie. As a portrait of the artist as a parent, it's the
very antithesis of ``Mommie Dearest'' and the whole
celebrity-parent bashing genre.
</P>
<P>
   The film is also more than just a valentine to Jones' parenting
skills. It's an unusually rich, unconventional and highly original
coming-of-age-in-the-'70s drama, and a bittersweet meditation on
the expatriate life. Frame-for-frame, it's the most totally
satisfying Merchant-Ivory production since ``A Room With a View.''
</P>
<P>
   The script, by James Ivory and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, is divided
into three segments, and opens in the late '60s as the Jones family
_ father (Kris Kristofferson), mother (Barbara Hershey) and young
daughter (Luisa Conlon) _ have left America to live more or less
permanently in a luxury apartment on Paris' fashionable Ille St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The first segment deals mostly with the James and Gloria Jones'
adoption of a French orphan boy: opening with the young mother's
decision to give up her son, his conflict with his slightly jealous
new sister, his difficulties adjusting to his posh new school, and
his gradual bonding with the American family.
</P>
<P>
   The second section follows the daughter, now a teenager (Leelee
Sobieski), through her early adolescence, concentrating on her
problems being an American in a French school, and her relationship
with her best friend and soulmate: an effeminate, illegitimate boy
(Anthony Roth Costanzo) who aspires to be an opera singer.
</P>
<P>
   The third section chronicles the family's decision to return to
their native land in the early '70s, the two teenagers' shaky
adjustment to suburban American life, the death of the
author-father from a congenital heart problem, and the impact this
incomparable loss has on each surviving member of the family.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, this could be the most authentic film biography
ever made of a famous writer. Nothing seems to have been invented,
scenes were filmed in and around the actual Jones apartment on the
Quai d'Orleans, and _ though there's not much physical resemblance
_ the performances of Kristofferson and Hershey could hardly be
more authentic.
</P>
<P>
   But Kaylie Jones wrote her family story as a novel, she changed
the characters names (from Jones to Willis), and she really doesn't
go into any of the famous particulars of Jones' literary life. The
film maintains the limited point-of-view of the daughter character
throughout, and claims the protection of fiction.
</P>
<P>
   And its real power comes less from biographical accuracy than in
its poignant universality as a family drama. Even without the Jones
connection, the film comes off as a splendid collection of
vignettes tracing the childhood of a young American girl in an
alien, often hostile, always magical Paris of the '60s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly effective are the scenes tracing the young
heroine's difficult sexual awakening _ including a pre-adolescent,
quasi-rape by a young neighbor boy that is boldly, yet sensitively,
handled _ and her growing awareness of her famous, rather gruff
father's total, unquestioning love and acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, and in its own unique way, ``A Soldier's Daughter''
is wonderfully reminiscent of the 1962 ``To Kill a Mockingbird.''
Like that classic film, it's about the power of a successful
father-daughter relationship, and it's a celebration of an
unorthodox but completely functional family unit.
</P>
<P>
   A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries. Directed by James Ivory.
Screenplay by Ivory and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala. Cast: Kris
Kristofferson, Barbara Hershey, Leelee Sobieski, Jane Birkin.
October Films. 124 minutes. Rated R for mature themes.

`RONIN' IS OLD-FASHIONED FARE IN THE SPIRIT OF `BULLITT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you find yourself nostalgic for an old-fashioned,
no-holds-barred car chase _ on the scale of those signature moments
of 1968's ``Bullitt'' and 1971's ``The French Connection'' _ then
John Frankenheimer's ``Ronin'' is your movie.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the director promised ``the granddaddy of all
car chases'' and he's delivered the goods _ not just one, but two
lavishly suicidal crunch-a-thons: one through the narrow streets of
the Parisian Left Bank, the other along the broad corniches of the
French Riviera.
</P>
<P>
   And the movie itself makes an entertaining thriller, though _ as
always with Frankenheimer, the director of such classics as ``The
Manchurian Candidate'' and ``The Train'' _ it has an off-beat and
enigmatic edge that could frustrate anyone expecting a more
traditional action movie.
</P>
<P>
   The story is about a band of mercenaries recruited in Paris by a
pretty Irish terrorist (Natascha McElhone) for a particularly
difficult caper: the snatching of a valuable, highly protected
suitcase of undisclosed contents in the south of France.
</P>
<P>
   The men are all ex-intelligence agents from various countries
who have been put out of work by the end of the Cold War (``like
ronin samurai without a liege lord,'' one of them explains): an
American (Robert De Niro), a Frenchman (Jean Reno), a Brit (Sean
Bean) and a Russian (Skellan Skarsgard).
</P>
<P>
   It's an art house cast and, at times, it seems like an art house
movie. The various characters' foreign accents _ especially those
of McElhone and Bean _ are so hard to follow they need subtitles,
and it's easy to get lost in the bewildering array of
double-crosses and double-double crosses that drive the plot.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other time in his 40-year career, Frankenheimer's
design seems to be to subordinate everything in his film _
character, story, dialogue, humor _ to his fast-paced style and
disjointed, existential mood. In a way, it's quite demanding, and
it often helps to just turn off the mind and go with the
exhilarating flow.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, everyone and everything do eventually add up and make
sense, and the film ultimately pays off with considerably more
story satisfaction than we usually get in big-budget Hollywood
action spectaculars. All told, ``Ronin'' is a clever piece of
visual story-telling.
</P>
<P>
   It does, however, invite criticism for one bizarre moment: the
unmistakable recreation (in the midst of its second chase sequence)
of the pursuit of Princess Di through the Seine tunnel one year
ago, with the exact same flip-over crash against the tunnel wall.
What is this? A bad-taste in-joke? A ghoulish anniversary tribute?
</P>
<P>
   Ronin. Directed by John Frankenheimer. Screenplay by J.D. Zeik
and Richard Weisz. Cast: Robert De Niro, Jean Reno, Natascha
McElhone, Stellan Skarsgard, Sean Bean. United Artists. 118

`CLAY PIGEONS' IS INCORRIGIBLY MEDIOCRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an interview last month, director Gus Van Zant said he cast
Vince Vaughn for the Norman Bates role in his upcoming remake of
Hitchcock's ``Psycho'' because he wanted ``someone who would take
you off guard'' _ an actor you wouldn't expect to be a serial
murderer.
</P>
<P>
   But it now looks as if Vaughn could be typecast in that role
before the film's December release. Because in ``Clay Pigeons,'' he
plays a vicious murderer of helpless women in a story that seems to
be inspired, ironically enough, by Hitchcock's ``Strangers On a
Train.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's not exactly an auspicious matching of actor and role,
either. In fact, he gives a fairly hammy performance in what is an
incorrigibly mediocre movie. If his ``Psycho'' turn isn't quite a
few notches above this one, Anthony Perkins can continue to rest in
peace.
</P>
<P>
   The film is about a smalltown Montana auto mechanic named Clay
(Joaquin Phoenix), whose best friend (Gregory Sporleder) _
devastated by his discovery that Clay is having an affair with his
wife _ kills himself in the opening scene and makes it appear that
Clay is the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   When the wife (Georgina Cates) starts to sexually blackmail him,
she in turn is murdered by an affable stranger named Lester
(Vaughn) who _ as in Hitchcock's ``Strangers'' _ commits the murder
to ingratiate himself with the hero, expecting friendship, approval
and reciprocation.
</P>
<P>
   Out of this situation, first-time director David Dobkin tries to
construct a typical Hitchcockian drama that gets more ironic and
darkly humorous as the innocent hero struggles desperately to get
out of his mess, and only looks more and more guilty to the world.
</P>
<P>
   But the film somehow manages to lose its way in the first act,
and never recovers. Indeed, it's so incompetent that it plays its
big dramatic scene _ Phoenix, locked up in jail and thus
agonizingly unable to prevent Vaughn from murdering a young girl _
in a cell with bars set so wide apart that Orson Welles would slip
through them!
</P>
<P>
   The cast has a few bright spots _ the usual good work from Scott
Wilson and Georgina Cates. But the two leads are weak: Phoenix
simply looks too malevolent to be very credible as a wronged
innocent, and Vaughn is at a loss to find that element which made
all the great Hitchcock villains come alive _ a point of sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Clay Pigeons. Directed by David Dobkin. Written by Matt Healy.
Cast: Joaquin Phoenix, Vince Vaughn, Georgina Cates, Scott Wilson,
Janeane Garofalo. Gramercy. 104 minutes. Rated R for violence and
sex scenes.

RONIN-MOVIE (Los Angeles) _ It's no surprise that ``Ronin,'' John
Frankenheimer's new thriller about a group of post-Cold War
mercenaries pursuing a mysterious briefcase, contains some
electrifying car-chase scenes that wind through the streets of
Paris and Nice. After all, auto racing has always been a passion
with him. By Glenn Whipp. 
. 
NATASCHA-MOVIE (Los Angeles) _ Natascha McElhone, who has
co-starred with heavyweights like Harrison Ford, Anthony Hopkins,
Brad Pitt and Jim Carrey, gets to be the only female in John
Frankenheimer's action thriller starring Robert De Niro. It's a
heavy-duty ensemble, which suited McElhone fine, since she's not,
as she puts it, a ``popcorn actress.'' By Bob Strauss. 
. 
DEATH-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ Death was the common denominator at the
recent Los Angeles International Short Film Festival, though the
two major category winners took a different slant on this most
universal theme. By Bob McCarthy. 
. 
CLAY-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ A decent though not exactly inspired
black comedy, ``Clay Pigeons'' boasts just enough grotesquerie and
gallows humor to sustain interest. However, it doesn't make much of
a point beyond the obvious one that very bad things can happen when
you mess with your friends and neighbors. 3 stars. By Bob Strauss. 
. 
MONUMENT-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ ``Monument Ave.'' is a potentially
engrossing tale of working class Irish Americans fighting yuppie
encroachment on their Boston neighborhood by, mainly, stealing the
yups' stuff. But the script stumbles almost immediately and never
regains its footing. 2 stars. By Bob Strauss. 
. 
PECKER-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ ``Pecker,'' the latest from John
Waters, is packed with indie movie scene stars and built around an
actually cinematic idea. Though this film has some merit, it just
doesn't deliver the fun it thinks we're having with it. 2{ stars.
By Bob Strauss. 
. 
RONIN-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ John Frankenheimer's stylish new
thriller, ``Ronin,'' wears its ambiguity like a badge of honor. Its
world-weary characters never spell out their motives or their
allegiances while chasing a mysterious briefcase. Frankenheimer
succeeds in turning all this mystery to the film's advantage,
though. 3 stars. By Glenn Whipp. 
. 
SHADRACH-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ ``Shadrach'' is a pleasant,
exceedingly minor feature film that works best as an anecdotal
memory piece set in the Depression Era South and less well when it
gets condescending and preachy. 2{ stars By Bob Strauss. 
. 
URBAN-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ ``Urban Legend'' follows in the
footsteps of ``Scream'' and ``I Know What You Did Last Summer,''
with enough blood and suspense to go along with the complete lack
of logic to satisfy most fans of the horror genre. 2{ stars. By
Glenn Whipp. 
. 
DEATH-STAGE (Los Angeles) _ Jack Klugman's intensity and the strong
ensemble cast make ``Death of a Saleman'' at the Falcon Theatre a
production worth seeing. By Reed Johnson. 
. 
MEMORY-STAGE (Los Angeles) _ Even Oedipus might conclude that the
unexamined life isn't so bad after all, if he had to face the
dilemma confronting Russell Burke, the troubled hero of Jonathan
Tolins' ambitious but erratic new play about the culture of
victimology, ``If Memory Serves,'' at the Pasadena Plyhouse. By
Reed Johnson. 
. 
MASSIVE-MUSIC (Los Angeles) _ Call it trip-hop, English psychedelia
or just plain dance music for shut-ins. Whatever you dub it,
Massive Attack has stumbled upon one of the most seductive pop
confections of the decade. By Fred Shuster. 
. 
POP-BEAT (Los Angeles) _ British music author Simon Reynolds, a
senior editor at Spin magazine in New York, wrote the fascinating
``Generation Ecstasy'' (Little, Brown; $25), which traces the
history of the rave scene and, by extension, electronic music forms
such as techno, drum 'n' bass, trip-hop and jungle, as well as
pirate radio and the illegal speed-based drug Ecstacy. By Fred
Shuster. 
. 
DISCS-MUSIC (Los Angeles) _ ``Titanic,'' the blockbuster that
declares love means never having to say you're soggy, has spawned a
soundtrack sequel, this one featuring Celine Dion's ubiquitous
radio-only version of ``My Heart Will Go On'' with dialogue from
Jack and Rose. Also included is composer James Horner's new
``Titanic Suite'' and ``Epilogue: The Deep and Timeless Sea,'' two
symphonic works with themes from the main score interwoven. By Fred
Shuster. 
. 
DANGEROUS-VIDEO (Los Angeles) _ ``Dangerous Beauty'' is a historic
sexual romp that's both light and fun and with enough witty
rapartee, swordplay and boudoir high jinks to be entertaining. At
other times, though, the film can't seem to decide if it is itself
sexploitation or is about the serious theme of the suppression of
women. By Rob Lowman.

`URBAN LEGEND'S' HUMOR JUST DOESN'T CUT IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We all know an urban legend: there's the one about the famous
actor who did something gross with a gerbil; or about the
babysitter who, after being beleagured by frightening phone calls,
discovers the stalker is upstairs in the house.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of using modern, weird tales as the basis for a horror
film must have sounded intriguing on paper and, for the first half
hour or so, ``Urban Legend'' has some potential.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it quickly erodes into a mean-spirited,
ridiculous and sadistic gore-fest that includes a scene with a dog
and a microwave.
</P>
<P>
   True, horror is hip at the box office. Witness the success of
``Scream'' and its sequel and the recent ``Halloween: H2O.'' But
``Urban Legend,'' which actually features a better-than-average
cast, is dull-witted by comparison. It makes a stab at humor but
doesn't cut it. The only amusing character is Loretta Devine, who
plays a campus cop named Reese who practices gunplay while watching
a video of Pam Grier in ``Foxy Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone has lost more than their mind at the peaceful,
gable-and-stone New Hampshire-based Pendleton College campus. A
young coed has just lost her head _ literally _ in a murder that
bears a striking resemblance to an urban legend. Soon the peace and
serenity of the school known as ``the safest in the country'' is
shattered as students and faculty alike begin dying in mysterious
ways based on all kinds of modern myths.
</P>
<P>
   It's up to a young journalism student, Paul (Jared Leto), and
Natalie (Alicia Witt), for whom the killings have become perilously
personal, to discover the reason for the serial murders and the
identity of a killer who has a very sick sense of ``moral
admonition.'' They're aided by Professor Wexler (Robert Englund),
who teaches a class on American Folklore and who is the only
survivor of the Stanley Hall Massacre, a black spot in the school's
stellar history.
</P>
<P>
   Leto and Witt, who are both capable, likeable actors, are wasted
in this outing. The 24-year-old scriptwriter, Silvio Horta, and
director Jamie Blanks give them very little to do except stand
around and look worried and perplexed while they utter some
dreadfully bad lines.
</P>
<P>
   At least supporting actors Devine, Rebecca Gayheart and Joshua
Jackson understand they're not exactly making high art and camp it
up wildly, adding a little spice. But the film itself is eminently
forgettable.
</P>
<P>
   Urban Legend. Directed by Jamie Blanks. Written by Silvio Horta.
Cast: Jared Leto, Alicia Witt, Rebecca Gayheart, Natasha Gregson
Wagner. TriStar Pictures. 100 minutes. Rated R for graphic
violence, language.

PLOT TAKES BACK SEAT TO ACTION IN `RONIN'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3 Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ John Frankenheimer's stylish new thriller,
``Ronin,'' wears its ambiguity like a badge of honor. Its
world-weary characters never spell out their motives or their
allegiances while chasing a mysterious briefcase, the contents of
which are never revealed to them or to the audience. (Maybe it's
the same items contained in that case from ``Pulp Fiction.'') If
you were confused by the often incoherent complexities of
``Mission: Impossible,'' you might as well throw up the white flag
here. Plot takes a back seat to action and atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Frankenheimer succeeds in turning all this mystery to the film's
advantage, though, creating a gritty, stark, old-fashioned
international action caper that offers the pleasure of frenetic car
chases and scenic French locales in place of digitally driven
special effects. A solid international cast that includes Robert De
Niro, Jean Reno, Natascha McElhone and Jonathan Pryce lends the
needed emotional weight to their often interchangeable characters,
a ragtag group of covert operatives called together to steal the
cryptic case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronin'' begins with an unnecessary written prologue that
explains the film's title, some mumbo-jumbo about shamed samurai
warriors who have failed to protect their masters. It's a metaphor
that is used again later in the film to lend some kind of
psychological motivation to the jaded, exhausted spies in the
movie. It's a nice try, but the screenplay by J.D. Zeik and Richard
Weisz (the latter a pseudonym for David Mamet, who did a complete
rewrite) never quite manages to make flesh out its characters and
make them into real people who resonate with the audience.
Ambiguity is one thing, confusion another entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Ronin'' bristles with the sort of post-Cold War
skulduggery that informs a good John LeCarre novel. The early part
of the movie finds De Niro wandering through the dimly lit streets
of Paris' Montmartre district, arriving at a small bar where the
patrons regard him and each other with open suspicion. Soon,
they're moving to a warehouse where McElhone, the Irish ringleader,
tells them about the briefcase and their mission to steal it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, given the level of subterfuge here, it's obvious some
of these free-agent rogues might have their own agendas. To the
movie's credit, you never know whom to trust (or for that matter,
what exactly is going on), which sets into motion some thrilling
high-speed chases through the streets and tunnels of Paris (you
can't help but think of Princess Diana's final ride) and the tight,
winding roadways surrounding Nice. Frankenheimer is an old pro at
such stuff, having been a racer himself and having made the classic
car movie ``Grand Prix,'' so the scenes crackle with an excitement
typically lacking in chase scenes.
</P>
<P>
   In a movie where the action, not the dialogue, reveals
character, the actors have enough of a presence and allure to keep
their performances interesting. De Niro is always fun to watch, and
here, he gets to blow up things. His character, an old CIA agent
who's apparently on the run, seems perpetually both tired and
amused, even in the most dire of circumstances, such as when he's
on a makeshift operating table having a bullet removed from his
stomach.
</P>
<P>
   It's a scene that will make even the most hardened moviegoer
squirm, but De Niro somehow makes it a pleasure, albeit a gruesome
one. Happily for audiences, ``Ronin's'' diversions are many and
varied, and you don't have to be a masochist to like it. Unless, of
course, you need to have every little plot detail spelled out for
you. In that case, you'd be a masochist to see it. &UR; !end! &QL;

`CLAY PIGEONS' HAS A FEW GOOD GASPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3 Stars 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A decent though not exactly inspired black comedy,
``Clay Pigeons'' boasts just enough grotesquerie and gallows humor
to sustain interest. But unlike the recent ``Your Friends &AMP;
Neighbors'' or the upcoming ``Very Bad Things,'' this film doesn't
have much of a point to make beyond the obvious one that very bad
things can happen when you mess with your friends and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the kind of thing you remember as all that outrageous
afterward, even if you enjoy a few good gasps and jolts in the
watching. There's a certain passion missing from its studied
wickedness.
</P>
<P>
   Set in and around a flyspeck Montana town, the film opens with
two buddies target shooting in the middle of nowhere. One of them
knows his wife's been cheating with the other one; he kills himself
but makes it look like his two-timing pal committed murder.
</P>
<P>
   Though not the brightest bulb under the Big Sky, Clay Bidwell
(Joaquin Phoenix) has a kind of unconscious genius for covering up
the trouble he lets himself get dragged into. He makes his friend's
death look like an accident, then tries to talk the
anything-but-grieving widow, Amanda (Georgina Cates), into backing
up his alibi. She refuses; what would the neighbors think, she
supposed to be grief-stricken and all? But if he can stay out of
jail, the brazen hussy would still like to pay Clay a discreet
visit now and then.
</P>
<P>
   As if he didn't have enough to be paranoid about, Clay is soon
the target of a new best friend. Lester Long (Vince Vaughn, the
``You're Money!'' guy from ``Swingers'') is an affable
cowboy/trucker who breezes into town with a rigload of charm and a
bit too much mystery. Initially, he's just the kind of supportive
distraction Clay needs, always up for a fishing trip or
commiseration about woman troubles.
</P>
<P>
   But as female corpses pile up around Clay, you start to wonder
just what Lester really is _ even if he's really real, or just an
extension of Clay's twisted psyche. Anyway, the good ol' local
sheriff (Scott Wilson) is getting mighty suspicious. Tart-tongued
FBI agent Dale Shelby (Janeane Garofalo) arrives suspicious, too.
Suddenly, Lester isn't around when Clay needs him to be _ and is
way too there when he doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Director David Dobkin comes from advertising and music videos
and writer Matt Healy was a newspaper graphics designer. Both make
their feature debuts with ``Clay Pigeons,'' and they acquit
themselves professionally. The story's told clearly, builds
suspense well, and the gags and the gross stuff are effectively
staged. But the film feels more like it was built to a sound plan
than like something that its creators were vitally engaged with.
</P>
<P>
   The performances are what really carry ``Clay Pigeons.'' Phoenix
plays Clay passive-aggressive-passive, so numbed by the absurd
mayhem surrounding him that fear and guilt are the only things that
can still spur him to action. The big, blustery Vaughn is great at
mixing camaraderie with menace; he's so much fun to be around, he
makes you very nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Her usual arch, sophisticated self, Garofalo gives Agent Shelby
a superior attitude toward all the rubes she has to work with, but
the tough cop's vulnerable side is activated nicely when the
seductive Lester turns on the attention. And although Amanda is
written as your typical, amoral hot potato, Cates goes so
enjoyably, lewdly over the top with her, the stereotype doesn't
interfere with the fun.!end! &QL;

WATERS GOES GENIAL IN OFF-THE-WALL `PECKER' 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Waters is going soft. His latest comedy is the not-so-black
``Pecker,'' a homage to Waters' hometown of Baltimore and a sweet
little satire of the New York art world.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Furlong, who starred as the kid in danger in ``Terminator
2 _ Judgment Day,'' brings a loopy grace to the title role, playing
a compulsive photographer who's called Pecker because he pecks at
his food. Eating isn't his thing. He'd rather watch and record.
Everywhere he goes he snaps pictures.
</P>
<P>
   What fascinates him? His family and hometown. His mother (Mary
Kay Place) runs a clothing store for the homeless: ``We know how to
make a dollar hollar.'' His dimwitted dad (Mark Joy) runs a bar and
his grandmother (Jean Schertler) sells pit beef sandwiches from a
stand in front of the family home and talks to her statue of the
Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Grandma makes Mary's rubbery mouth move, but instead of the
traditional ``full of grace,'' Grandma has her say, ``full of
grease,'' which is more in keeping with Grandma's line of work.
</P>
<P>
   Pecker's girlfriend Shelley (Christina Ricci) runs a notably
strict laundromat and his best friend Matt (Brendan Sexton III)
shoplifts for a living. Add his big sister Tina (Martha Plimpton),
who hosts a gay strip bar, and his little sister Chrissy (Lauren
Hulsey), the sugar addict, and Waters has a scene that makes the
blighted version of L.A. in Quentin Tarantino's ``Jackie Brown''
look decidedly upscale.
</P>
<P>
   And yet everybody here gets along. Nobody's mad, nobody's
wasting his life, abusing illegal substances, mulling over his
problems or aspiring to greater things. It's one big happy family,
until Pecker's pics hit the big time. New York art dealer Rorey
(Lili Taylor) sees his stuff, loves it and makes him a star.
</P>
<P>
   In loving him, New York patronizes him and unsettles not only
his life but the lives of everybody around him.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the movie's been fun to watch, but predictable. Now
Waters hits his stride, turning the cultural tables in a fun and
inventive way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pecker'' sounds no depths, offers few real insights in art but
creates a happy glow of a good time, full of zinging one-liners and
credible camera work. It isn't Waters at his best, but Waters at
his most relaxed and genial. And the actors are terrific,
especially the deadpan Ricci and darling boy Furlong as Pecker.
</P>
<P>
   Pecker. Directed and written by John Waters. Cast: Edward
Furlong, Christina Ricci, Martha Plimpton, Lili Taylor. Fine Line

McELHONE KEEPS GOOD COMPANY IN `RONIN' 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   los angeles - Natascha McElhone has kept some pretty good screen
company in her feature films, playing modern art's muse opposite
Anthony Hopkins in ``Surviving Picasso,'' Brad Pitt's sympathetic
squeeze in ``The Devil's Own'' and Jim Carrey's inspiration in
``The Truman Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, in John Frankenheimer's new thriller, ``Ronin,'' McElhone
plays an Irish terrorist who may or may not have eyes for Robert
DeNiro. She's pretty much the only woman in the cast, an
international boy's club that includes French actor Jean Reno,
Swede Stellan Skarsgard and Brit Jonathan Pryce. It's a heavy-duty
ensemble, which suited McElhone fine, since she's not, as she puts
it, a ``popcorn actress.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that she wouldn't accept a part in a Jerry Bruckheimer film.
Her name just hasn't been suggested in casting discussions. Trained
at the London Academy of Music and Drama, McElhone came up through
the theater ranks, starring in London and Manchester productions of
``The Cherry Orchard,'' ``Richard III'' and ``A Midsummer Night's
Dream.'' It was during the latter two productions that she caught
the eye of James Ivory and Ismail Merchant, who cast her opposite
Hopkins in ``Surviving Picasso.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's gorgeous, so beautiful, so good, such great poise,''
Hopkins raves. ``I hope she's going to be a big, big movie star. I
have a corrupting influence on her. I say, `Don't go back to the
theater.'''
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be no danger of that happening any time soon,
although McElhone does hope to perform on Broadway someday. But
acting in movies just seems ``right'' to her. Strange, but right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a nomad, a gypsy,'' she says. ``I like to live somewhere
for a short period and then move on. That's why movies suit me so
perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   Born near London (where she still keeps an apartment), McElhone
had never acted professionally before enrolling in the London
Academy when she was 18. The move, though, was hardly a surprise.
McElhone has wanted to act since the age of 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least, that's what my parents tell me; my memory isn't that
good,'' McElhone says with a laugh. ``But I did always suspect that
acting was my destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Her choices in movie roles certainly haven't hurt her prospects.
``Surviving Picasso'' provided McElhone her meatiest role, and
turns in the high-profile ``Truman Show'' and the troubled
``Devil's Own'' fixed her star with Hollywood studios. ``Ronin'' is
her first action turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``At its heart, certainly, that's what it is,'' McElhone says of
the film. ``But there's a lot of ambiguity to it that I like, both
with the characters and the plot, and I think it takes the movie to
another level. It was certainly a challenge as an actress, and I
don't think you could say that about too many of these films.''
</P>
<P>
   Another challenge for McElhone was keeping her sanity during the
movie's frenetic car chase scenes through the streets of Paris and
Nice, a couple of which featured her behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the cast members, she was the best in the car,''
Frankenheimer says. ``She really does have nerves of steel. The
faster the car went, the more she seemed to be enjoying herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Says McElhone: ``Sometimes I was actually driving, but mostly we
had a stunt driver sitting next to me doing the steering. This man
was a master; I've never been in a car with someone who had such
quick reflexes. So, it was fairly hairy, but great fun, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said for working with DeNiro. One scene called
for McElhone and DeNiro to make out passionately in a car, not the
kind of thing you normally associate with a DeNiro action film.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's everything he's made out to be _ challenging, intense and
very involved in every aspect of what he does,'' McElhone says.
``He tells his part of the story brilliantly, and you're there just
trying to keep up. But it's like playing tennis with a great
player. They make you better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that that happens to me,'' she adds laughing. ``I can't
hit the ball. I just get worse.''
</P>
<P>
   In tennis, maybe. With acting, her form just keeps on improving.

MALIGNED DIRECTOR BACK IN DRIVER'S SEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When director John Frankenheimer finished his
senior year at Williams College, classmates voted him ``Highway
Menace'' for his unnerving need for speed behind the wheel. For a
while, Frankenheimer even toyed with the idea of becoming a race
car driver, competing in amateur races until the money gave out. He
still indulges now and again, going to drag-racing school (top
speed, 217 mph) and airing out his collection of modified Mercedes
cars, one of which is equipped with a 750 horsepower engine.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise, then, that ``Ronin,'' Frankenheimer's new
thriller about a group of post-Cold War mercenaries pursuing a
mysterious briefcase, contains some electrifying car-chase scenes
that wind through the streets of Paris and Nice. His fluid camera
work is a natural extension of the techniques he used in his 1966
homage to Formula One racing, ``Grand Prix,'' a film that
Frankenheimer remembers as ``the happiest time of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everything has been as wonderful for the 68-year-old
director, whose impressive screen career includes ``The Manchurian
Candidate,'' ``The Days of Wine and Roses'' and ``The Birdman of
Alcatraz.'' Personal problems, including a long bout with
alcoholism, took their toll on his career, as did a series of
mediocre movies in the late '70s and '80s. That Frankenheimer
survived and continues making movies is an achievement, the
greatest one of his life, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beach is littered with bodies that this town has ground up
and spit out,'' Frankenheimer says from his Beverly Hills home.
``I've had films that have worked and films that haven't. But I've
never given up. I've always sucked in my gut and kept plugging
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Of late, Frankenheimer's career path has brought him back to
television, the medium with which he began some 45 years ago.
Following a stint in the Air Force making training films,
Frankenheimer worked for ``Playhouse 90'' and other anthology
series, directing 152 live television dramas between 1954 and 1960.
(We'll do the math for you _ that's one show every two weeks.)
</P>
<P>
   He returned to TV in 1994, winning an Emmy for his direction of
HBO's ``Against the Wall,'' a tense retelling of the 1971 Attica
prison uprising. He has won three subsequent Emmys in the past four
years, the latest just recently for his work on the TNT biography
of George Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a rebirth for me, no question about that,''
Frankenheimer says candidly. ``I had done a series of movies that
hadn't done very well, and my phone wasn't ringing. I was about to
do a crummy action movie with a second-rate action star when the
offer for `Against the Wall' came in. That changed my life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What it did,'' Frankenheimer continues, ``is it altered my
perception of myself and the town's perception of me. I woke up and
realized I had a lot more work in me. I remembered why I got in
this business to begin with _ to do the work, to create something
that's good. And people around here saw I wasn't some old fart who
couldn't handle the job anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had always thought of those early years in television as the
greatest in my life. And now with these past four movies, I feel
I've topped that. It's been incredibly rewarding on every level.''
</P>
<P>
   The rewards are about to increase with an exclusive deal with
TNT to produce and direct movies for the network. Frankenheimer
would also like to continue making feature films, too, and he has
his eye on a CIA drama called ``The Good Shepherd,'' written by
Eric Roth of ``Forrest Gump'' fame. Age doesn't seem to be a
problem. If anything, approaching his 70th birthday only seems to
make Frankenheimer want to work harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has so much energy, he's really unstoppable on the set,''
says Natascha McElhone, who stars with Robert De Niro and Jean Reno
in ``Ronin.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Reno, ``His experience is so vast that he knows exactly
what he wants and is able to accomplish it quickly. He gives actors
a lot of room, though, giving them the freedom in rehearsals to get
comfortable and find their own rhythm so once the shooting begins,
he can request precise variations from them. His set is very
disciplined, and I think most actors really appreciate that.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even that kind of discipline couldn't save
Frankenheimer during his last feature film, ``The Island of Dr.
Moreau,'' which has become a certified cult classic for an enormous
Marlon Brando's strange and campy performance as the mad title
character. Frankenheimer replaced the original director, Richard
Stanley, who was fired three days into the shoot and later sneaked
back on the set wearing a disguise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got paid a fortune for taking it on, but a couple of days
into it, I realized I was still grossly underpaid,'' Frankenheimer
says, laughing. ``Every wild thing you heard about that set was
true. But I still think it turned out to be a pretty good movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean he has some fond memories of ``Moreau'' despite
all the publicized difficulties?
</P>
<P>
   Frankenheimer pauses for what seems like an eternity before
answering.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only good thing I remember about that movie was when the
check cleared the bank.''

`URBAN LEGEND' SCARES UP MODERN-DAY CHILLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 2{ Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Urban Legend'' follows that now-familiar,
self-referential path blazed by writer Kevin Williamson in the
``Scream'' movies and ``I Know What You Did Last Summer.'' Only
here, all that post-modern irony is directed toward modern-day folk
tales, not classic horror films. So instead of talking about Jason
and Freddy Krueger (more on him later), the well-scrubbed,
attractive young people spend their time (what little they have
left) dissecting urban legends _ like Life cereal's Mikey exploding
from Pop Rocks and Pepsi, and doggies melting in microwave ovens.
</P>
<P>
   While the formula is only a couple of years old, it already
seems tired. But director Jamie Blanks is able to coax some thrills
and chills from Silvio Horta's occasionally smart and funny script.
Certainly, no new ground is broken. But there's enough blood and
suspense to go along with the requisite complete lack of logic to
satisfy most fans of the horror genre.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's action takes place on a gothic college campus that,
legend has it, was the scene of a gruesome massacre courtesy of an
abnormal-psych professor 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The frat boys are, naturally, celebrating the anniversary, but
they're soon distracted by the fact that their current classmates
are dropping like flies around them. Each death follows the ritual
of a different urban legend, most of which are conveniently
discussed in an American Folklore class led by the creepy Professor
Wexler (played by Freddie Krueger himself, Robert Englund).
</P>
<P>
   While the subject of urban legends is ripe for satire, director
Blanks too often follows the tried-and-true path here in his
feature debut. ``Urban Legend'' contains every genre convention you
can imagine. Sometimes the air is so thick with cliches that you
feel you're watching a David Zucker movie, but instead of sight
gags, it's the fright gags flying fast and furious just to see what
sticks. There must be a couple of dozen instances where characters
turn into some object just off screen to goose a cheap thrill from
the audience.
</P>
<P>
   The cast is populated mostly by young actors from television,
including Alicia Witt (``Cybill'') as the Smart Girl, Rebecca
Gayheart (``90210'') as the Pretty Girl, Jared Leto (``My So-Called
Life'') as the Pretty Boy and Joshua Jackson (``Dawson's Creek'')
as the Smart Aleck. They all scream with the proper conviction.

`SALESMAN' FOLLOWS KLUGMAN'S STRONG LEAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Notwithstanding its iconic central character,
``Death of a Salesman'' is, of course, a great ensemble show. More
than the tragedy of a deluded dreamer's downfall, Arthur Miller's
1949 masterpiece investigates an entire family's pent-up hopes and
angers, stemming from its members' collective inability to connect
with each others' deepest emotional needs.
</P>
<P>
   In Andrew J. Robinson's taut, explosive production at Burbank's
Falcon Theatre, Jack Klugman gets top billing as the scrappy,
beleaguered Brooklyn salesman _ and rightfully so. It's pretty
well-known that Klugman lost one of his vocal cords to a 1989
operation that might've silenced his career.
</P>
<P>
   Here, he turns his tattered instrument into a surprising asset.
Though distracting for the first five minutes, his raspy baritone
lends an uncommon poignancy to his performance, as if life's
accumulated travails had corroded even Willy's means of expressing
his terrible pain. Klugman's words may be stretched thin, but
they're never lost or misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   His bullying, quick-tempered Willy sets the tone for the entire
production, unleashing a lacerating anger that sweeps us along like
a Santa Ana wind. Later, as defeat closes in, Klugman's face goes
slack, his mouth oddly puckered, almost comic with inaudible
bewilderment. It's like seeing Buster Keaton doing Edvard Munch's
``The Scream.'' Though his performance basically consists of one or
two notes, Klugman bends, blasts and flutters those notes with
enviable authority.
</P>
<P>
   He's well-matched by Nancy Lineham Charles, who eschews the
typical long-suffering qualities of Willy's wife, Linda, in favor
of a proud, comely stoicism. She's the production's emotional
fulcrum.
</P>
<P>
   As Happy, Willy's chip-off-the-old-block younger son, James
Calvert conveys the doubtful jocularity of an aging frat-house
president. Raphael Sbarge lays aside two generations of
over-intellectualized, James Dean-ish Biffs, playing Willy's eldest
son as the impulsive, childlike soul he is. For once, Biff doesn't
sound like some distant New York cousin of ``The Glass
Menagerie's'' Tom Wingfield.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Gibson Frazier finds a nervy core to the nerdy
Bernard, Steven Gilborn is a terrifically sly but compassionate
Charley (Bernard's father), and James Karen gives Willy's brother
Ben the ruthless, imperious air of an Old South plantation owner.
They're all well worth your time.

PROMISING `MEMORY' FALTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Troubled mama's boys are nothing new in the
theater. They've been with us since Sophocles.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even Oedipus might conclude that the unexamined life isn't
so bad after all, if he had to face the dilemma confronting Russell
Burke, the troubled hero of Jonathan Tolins' ambitious but erratic
new play about the culture of victimology, ``If Memory Serves.''
</P>
<P>
   As the son of ``America's sweetheart,'' sitcom actress Diane
Barrow, Russell grew up in the shadow of his mother's iconic image
and the drinking problems of his father, Stan, ``the Willy Loman of
first-run syndication.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with his own writing career foundering and midlife closing
in, Russell feels strangely unfulfilled and restless. Could his
malaise stem from his close _ perhaps dangerously close _ childhood
relationship with his adoring mother? Is the perky, still-youthful
Diane really a monster of Norma Desmond proportions? And if Russell
decides to blow the whistle on his Mommie Dearest, will Middle
America ever forgive him?
</P>
<P>
   These questions, along with the hot topic of ``recovered
memory,'' frame the second of Tolins' works to be birthed at the
Pasadena Playhouse &UR;  &LR; following ``The Twilight of the Golds.''
Tolins' latest serves up another contemporary moral conundrum,
couched in a writing style that careens from literate, aphoristic
repartee worthy of Noel Coward to clunky platitudes and scenes that
are alternately convincing and contrived.
</P>
<P>
   The play opens promisingly with Diane (Brooke Adams) meeting
over drinks with a catty, sob-sister gossip columnist, beautifully
played by Marilyn Sokol. Though her bouffanted, '70s sitcom
character lives on in reruns, Diane badly needs a professional
boost akin to the sexual jump-start she's been getting from her
hunky actor-lover Taylor (Steven Culp).
</P>
<P>
   To say the least, Russell (Michael Landes) feels ambivalent
about his mom's new beau, who's young enough to be his own twin.
But that's only the start of his !ital!tsuris!off!.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after he begins seeing a therapist (Paula Kelly), who
pledges to ``deliver him to a new state of being,'' Russell agrees
to appear in an open-mike benefit for abuse victims organized by
his lesbian ex-girlfriend (an angrily funny Pamela Segall Adlon).
When Russell off-handedly mentions the nuzzling affections Diane
showered on him as a child _ glibly observing that it's his only
claim to being anything other than a dull heterosexual white male _
he unleashes a scandal that sets tongues wagging on both coasts.
</P>
<P>
   After initially reacting with outraged horror, Diane implausibly
buys Russell's argument that this is just the career break she
needs. But as mother and son collude to cash in on the uproar, more
evidence bubbles up through Russell's medicinally induced
flashbacks that Diane's maternal instincts weren't always so, well,
motherly.
</P>
<P>
   Tolins offers plenty to chew on here: the way individuals can be
blindsided by changing social mores; celebrity's tendency to devour
its offspring; the way performance functions as therapy, and vice
versa; and the difficulty in making sense of a world where millions
of competing ``narratives,'' from Freudian psychotherapy to tabloid
gossip, clamor for attention.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, he doesn't have quite the right tools or
performers to pull it all off. Landes' Russell, while sympathetic,
is too much of a cipher. Adams, an impressively straightforward
actor, seems miscast here. Her wholesome looks and upbeat demeanor
make it hard to conceive of her as the manipulative harpie
Russell's embittered father (David Groh) makes her out to be.
</P>
<P>
   Her portrayal, like Leonard Foglia's otherwise crisply directed
production, lacks a critical ambiguity that would make the
characters' conflicting memories jell into a truly troubling
``Rashomon''-like perspective. The standout performance here is
Bill Brochtrup's rendition of Diane's blithe, openly gay assistant
Paul, who rises above the surrounding madness by treating life as
one big ``Mildred Pierce'' remake.
</P>
<P>
   Tolins is a rare commodity: a tart, smart writer with a taste
for tough subjects. But his dialogue gets bogged down with
Hollywood in-jokes and predictable allusions to (groan) Judy
Garland. He's still struggling to fold his considerable comic
insights into a plausible, self-contained worldview.
</P>
<P>
   The vision is there. Now Tolins needs to keep it from getting
lost in his constant switchovers from earnestness to flippancy, and
the background buzz of camp cliches and old-movie references.

Celine Dion's ubiquitous radio-only version of ``My Heart Will Go
On'' with dialogue from Jack and Rose. Also included is composer
James Horner's new ``Titanic Suite'' and ``Epilogue: The Deep and
Timeless Sea,'' two symphonic works with themes from the main score
interwoven. Like the original smash-hit soundtrack, the sound of
ethereal Norwegian singer Sissel is heard throughout. A pleasant
enough souvenir for ``Titanic'' fanatics, but if you're immune to
such mass-market piffle, get ready for a deep and timeless sleep. 2

MARILYN MANSON/``Mechanical Animals'' (Nothing/Interscope)
</P>
<P>
   Straight from _ where else? _ the Florida suburbs comes the
former Brian Warner, now known as Marilyn Manson, purveyor of
warmed-over Alice Cooper theatrics and, on his fourth and latest
album, souped-up '70s glam. Actually, the flame-haired Manson and
producer Michael Beinhorn have come up with a solid pop-rock effort
full of snappy riffs and glossy hooks that owe a debt to Ziggy-era
Bowie. On his mostly moronic but harmless previous efforts, Manson
sang of serial killers and other assorted demons. Here, his main
subject seems to be himself or at least alter-ego Omega, an alien
rock star figure who eventually dies on the old rock 'n' roll
altar. Ziggy Stardust, call your copyright lawyer! In any case,
``Mechanical Animals'' proves this Manson is a lot smarter than he
looks. 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
GOO GOO DOLLS/``Dizzy Up the Girl'' (Warner Bros.)
</P>
<P>
   Not only does this Buffalo, N.Y., group sound like Paul
Westerberg, singer John Rzeznik looks like him, too. But don't hold
that against this good-natured outfit. For their sixth release, the
Goo Goos _ whose sweet ``City of Angels'' soundtrack ballad
``Iris'' garnered a ton of airplay _ polish up the acoustic guitars
for a shiny set of Rob Cavallo-produced tunes that start off where
the 1996 heartstring-tugger, ``Name,'' ended. ``Dizzy Up the Girl''
is headed straight into the top 40. 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
LONG RYDERS/``Anthology'' (PolyGram Chronicles)
</P>
<P>
   Founded by onetime local wag Sid Griffin and heavily influenced
by Gram Parsons, the now-defunct Long Ryders was the country-punk
band that got away. This double-CD compilation chooses the best
material from the band's three full-length albums and assorted
other releases, showing just how convincing Griffin and company
could be. Some of the best tracks stem from the Ryders' first
album, ``Native Sons,'' on which ex-Byrd Gene Clark handled guest
vocals. 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
LEONARD BERNSTEIN/``West Side Story'' and ``On the Town'' (Sony
Classical)
</P>
<P>
   Reissued as part of the Columbia Broadway Masterworks series,
these Bernstein musicals show off the extraordinary genius of the
late composer/conductor, who would have turned 80 this year. While
songs like ``New York, New York'' from ``On the Town'' or ``Maria''
from ``West Side Story'' are certainly unforgettable classics,
these digitally remastered versions also remind us of Bernstein's
brilliance as an arranger. Like the other reissues in the series _
``Cabaret,'' ``My Fair Lady,'' ``A Chorus Line'' _ ``Town'' and
``Story'' offer extra music not found on the original releases, in
this case extended danced numbers where Bernstein's always
surprising orchestrations shine. 4 Stars for each. &QL; 
_ Rob Lowman &QR; 
 &QL; 
LYLE LOVETT/``Step Inside This House'' (MCA/Curb)
</P>
<P>
   When I first heard about this release, it was the old good
news/bad news scenario. Good news: New Lovett. Bad news: He didn't
write any of the songs. But unlike Lovett's collection of decent
but unremarkable early work, ``I Love Everybody,'' this new double
album illuminates his art in ways both moving and profound. With
the 21 songs here, Lovett pays a stirring homage to the Texas
songwriters, including Townes Van Zandt and Walter Hyatt (four
songs apiece), who informed his own career. Droll, dry and achingly
bittersweet, these lovingly crafted songs are a natural extension
of the brilliant writing Lovett has perfected over the past decade.
It's obvious these songs mean a lot to Lovett. After listening to
them, they'll mean a lot to you, too. 4 Stars. &QL; 
_ Glenn Whipp &QR; 
 &QL; 
FRANK SINATRA/``I Remember Tommy,'' ``Sinatra and Swingin' Brass,''
``Sinatra &AMP; Strings'' and ``It Might as Well Be Swing'' (Reprise)
</P>
<P>
   Four new reissues from the early 1960s in the Reprise/Capitol
Sinatra ``Entertainer of the Century'' series find the Chairman
swinging hard but not quite as magnificently as he once had and
would again. ``I Remember Tommy'' (3 Stars) pays tribute to
Sinatra's first great orchestra leader with a sentimental batch of
tunes associated with his early days as a singer. Neil Hefti's
up-tempo arrangements keep ``Sinatra and Swinging Brass'' (3{
Stars) moving at a brisk pace from beginning to end, including the
hardest driving version of the Gershwins' ``They Can't Take That
Away From Me'' you're likely ever going to hear. Sinatra's
authoritative phrasing on ``Pick Yourself Up'' (``Dust yourself
off!'') is worth the price of the album alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sinatra &AMP; Strings'' (3 Stars) isn't as fun, particularly if
you're familiar with Sinatra's work with master arrangers Nelson
Riddle and Gordon Jenkins. Still, there are a number of fine,
stately songs including ``Night and Day'' and warhorse weepers like
``Stardust'' and ``Misty.'' The Sinatra-Count Basie collaboration,
``It Might as Well Be Swing'' (3 Stars) isn't their best work. (The
superior ``Sinatra-Basie'' should have been reissued first.) But
it's hard to argue with ``Fly Me to the Moon'' and ``The Best Is
Yet to Come,'' sung with the kind of arrogant swagger that only
Sinatra could pull off. The best, indeed. &QL; 
_ G.W. &QR; 
 &QL; 
BETTE MIDLER/``Bathhouse Betty'' (Warner Bros.)
</P>
<P>
   As always with Midler, she meets expectations of humor, warmth,
quirkiness and innuendo in her song selections. The Divine Miss M
picks her songs without regard to age, mining American music here
back to 1925 for Gus Kahn's ``Ukulele Lady,'' 1935 for ``I Sold My
Heart to the Junkman,'' 1955 for ``One Monkey Don't Stop No Show''
(backed by neo-swingsters Royal Crown Revue), and a smattering of
up-to-the-minute songs including work by Ben Folds, Jennifer
Kimball and Adam Cohen. The gems include ``I'm Beautiful,'' a
ripping dance-pop self-affirmation that puts real spice into Girl
Power. She easily handles the idiosyncratic phrasing needed for the
jazzy Dave Frishberg/Bob Dorough cover ``I'm Hip.'' The implied
R-rating on ``Big Socks'' satisfies with its tale of
dissatisfaction. But as always with Midler, the slower arrangements
can make bleary what her voice crystalizes. ``Song of Bernandette''
by Leonard Cohen (Adam's dad) has had its personality removed, and
``My One True Friend''(from the movie ``One True Thing'') is dull
enough to read movie credits over. 2{ Stars. &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; When it comes to state-of-the-art bad taste, the
culture has kind of passed John Waters by. From ``There's Something
About Mary'' to the Starr Report, the general tone of things has
gotten so raunchy that the onetime king of outrageous kitsch seems
positively quaint nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that is his own doing. Ever since his best film,
``Hairspray,'' 10 years ago, Waters has been trying to mix the
subversive, scuzzball humor of his earlier midnight movies (``Pink
Flamingos,'' ``Female Trouble,'' ``Desperate Living'') with a kind
of camp naivete (``Cry Baby,'' ``Serial Mom'').
</P>
<P>
   It only really worked for ``Hairspray'' because it was fresh at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   If he could somehow get the mix to mesh as hilariously as his
straight gross-out comedies played, he'd be onto something. But
``Pecker,'' Waters' latest, is another one that's low on laughs.
Packed with indie movie scene stars and built around an actually
cinematic idea, the film has some merit. It just doesn't deliver
the fun it thinks we're having with it.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Furlong, the kid from ``Terminator 2,'' plays the title
character. He's the son of a lower-middle-class family _ Mom (Mary
Kay Place) runs a used ``fashion'' store for homeless people, Dad
(Mark Joy) tends a neighborhood bar _ who exults in taking
photographs of downscale life in Waters' beloved Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Pecker _ he got the nickname because, as a child, he ate like a
bird, which wouldn't have been the reason in a '70s Waters film _
smiles a lot because, presumably, he's surrounded by amusing
eccentrics. His grandmother does a lame ventriloquist act with a
``miraculous'' statue of the Virgin Mary. His sister (Martha
Plimpton) loves her ``career'' as the only female employee at a gay
disco. Pecker's best friend, Matt (Brendan Sexton III), is a
compulsive _ but lovable! _ thief. And his girlfriend, Shelley
(Christina Ricci in the film's funniest performance), is a
humorless careerist obsessed with running the perfect coin-operated
laundry.
</P>
<P>
   When a snooty New York art dealer (Lili Taylor) sees Pecker's
work, she turns him into a gallery sensation. But success has its
price. Every picture Pecker snaps triggers dire consequences for a
friend or relative.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Ricci and Furlong, everyone plays it in broad, ironic
strokes. Waters slings some tame satire at class pretensions,
commercial exploitation and uptightness in all its forms. But
``Pecker'' is, at best, a celebration of marginal kookiness. Anyone
expecting a full-frontal assault on good taste will be better
served by the Farrelly brothers or the government. &UR;

A CLINTON, BUT NOT THE PRESIDENT, IS POPULAR ON THE HUSTINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For Democratic candidates needing fund-raising
help for the final six weeks of the campaign, there's only one name
to turn to: Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton, that is.
</P>
<P>
   With President Clinton struggling to ward off impeachment,
Democrats are asking for the first lady, whose support in polls has
grown since her husband admitted having an affair with Monica
Lewinsky, the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton launched a three-day national campaign tour
Wednesday by campaigning for Rep. Charles E. Schumer, who is the
Democratic nominee for Senate in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady will be the featured guest Friday at a
$250-per-person fund-raiser for Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. Boxer
faces a hard-charging challenge from Republican state Treasurer
Matt Fong.
</P>
<P>
   The president also will be in the San Francisco Bay area, but at
a lower profile, if bigger money, event: a $25,000-a-couple
fund-raiser in San Jose for the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's visit is welcome news to Boxer, who has been
dogged throughout the campaign by questions about the president's
scandal. Though Boxer has called the president's behavior wrong and
indefensible, she has said she still supports his policies and has
tentatively scheduled a fund-raiser with him in late October.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal opinion is that (Mrs. Clinton) would be the
hottest ticket on Earth at this moment for the Democrats,'' said
Gale Kaufman, a Democratic political consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton always has been a strong draw at party fund-raisers
in California. Her most fervent supporters _ liberals, feminists
and partisan Democrats _ remained loyal even when her standing in
the polls was low.
</P>
<P>
   But the president's televised admission of infidelity have made
her a more popular figure even among those less likely to support
her, including moderate Democrats, Republicans and men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think people, regardless of how they come down on the
conduct of this president, and I don't care what gender they are,
really feel for her,'' Kaufman said.
</P>
<P>
   But Steve Merksamer, a Republican lawyer and strategist who ran
Bob Dole's 1996 campaign in California, noted that the sympathy for
the first lady might not translate into real political power.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can believe that she did not know about (the affair),
then she shares something in common with the Congress and the
American people, and that's that they all were betrayed by the same
man,'' Merksamer said. ``That makes her a sympathetic figure. That
doesn't necessarily make her a popular figure.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's problems have created a quandary for Democratic
candidates: They need his fund-raising muscle, yet fear his support
could give their opponents ammunition and may alienate some voters.
After the release of the Whitewater independent counsel's on Mr.
Clinton's conduct was released, Gov. Parris N. Glendening of
Maryland canceled a fund-raiser with Clinton, fearing the
association could hurt the Democrat in a tight race for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Inviting Mrs. Clinton provides an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are hugely committed to her, especially those in
contested races,'' said Troy Edwards, a Democratic fund-raiser in
Los Angeles. ``They want to have her out, they want to have her in
their homes, they want her to speak at events for them. I don't
think you'll see that change.''

</P>
<P>
   Last week, 26 congresswomen met with Mrs. Clinton at the White
House to discuss the Nov. 3 elections. Many expressed concern that
turnout among women could be low. According to those who attended,
the first lady agreed to use her popularity to help Democrats get
out their message about education, health care and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Her public role in the campaign comes in sharp contrast to the
1994 congressional elections, when her failed drive for a
comprehensive health system became an issue that hurt Democrats at
the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Clinton has softened her image as a feminist,
focusing her attention on issues like children's health and safety,
education and child care. In trips abroad, however, she continues
to champion women's rights.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her public stands on women's issues, her willingness to
stand by her husband has surprised even some supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, I'm amazed that she is able to hold herself
together and hold her family together,'' said Helen Grieco,
president of the California chapter of the National Organization
for Women. ``On the other hand, I'm saying, how does she deal with
all of this? It certainly wouldn't be my choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Malcolm, president of Emily's List, a national group that
raises money for Democratic women who support abortion rights, said
she hoped the first lady could help refocus voters' attention away
from the scandal and back on issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the Democratic candidates are extremely frustrated at
their inability to cut through all the media coverage and talk
about issues,'' Malcolm said. ``The first lady is a very effective
force at reminding women that voting is, in fact, about issues that
make a difference.''

THINGS GET SOUTHERN-STYLE STICKY IN `SHADRACH'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; ``Shadrach,'' a pleasant, exceedingly minor
feature film based on a William Styron short story, works best as
an anecdotal memory piece and less well when it reaches for
significance it doesn't actually possess.
</P>
<P>
   Co-adapted and directed by the author's daughter, Susanna
Styron, the film has a nice, languorous feel for the Depression-era
South. When it's focused on ornery, bathing-impaired moonshiners
and their kin, the film is fun and frisky. But its racial elements
are handled much less assuredly. There's a liberal piety to the
piece that's simultaneously hard to take, condescending and, worst
of all, unnecessary; the story's basics make its humanistic points
just fine, no preaching necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The Styron stand-in for this kinda-sorta autobiographical tale
is Paul Whitehurst (Scott Terra), a 10-year-old only child from a
comfortable family. His mother is in poor health, which is perhaps
why he's irresistibly drawn to a rude, robust clan across the
tracks, the Dabneys.
</P>
<P>
   Also, unexpectedly, drawn to them is Shadrach, a 99-year-old
African-American gentleman. Played, in his movie debut, by
octogenarian John Franklin Sawyer, Shadrach is a former slave who
walks all the way from his home in Alabama to Virginia's Tidewater
country so he can be buried on the old plantation land where he was
born.
</P>
<P>
   That property is still owned by the once-aristocratic,
now-trashy Dabneys. Vernon (Harvey Keitel) apparently hasn't held a
legitimate job since the stock market crashed six years earlier; he
supports his large, semi-civilized brood by selling homemade
whiskey. Ma Trixie (Andie MacDowell) lovingly oversees her
rambunctious horde _ three boys named Mole, four daughters on
various stages of the road to unwed parenthood _ with a bottle of
beer constantly at her side.
</P>
<P>
   Paul is staying over the weekend (one of the Moles is his best
friend) when Shadrach shows up. His final request becomes a kind of
family project, especially when the local sheriff informs Vernon
that it's illegal to bury people on private land. Prone to swearing
every other minute about that blinkin' Franklin Roosevelt, who he
blames for all his financial problems, this gives the easily
agitated Vernon more cuss-worthy material.
</P>
<P>
   The kids, meanwhile, get to learn stuff about kindness and
mortality and the dignity of the human soul _ not to mention
sleeping outside and visiting the ol' swimming hole. Shadrach
doesn't get to do much more than need help and die, though. This is
another one of those unfortunate movies that isn't really about the
title African-American character but uses him as a catalyst for
white folks to find out how decent they can be.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Keitel and MacDowell have an infectiously amusing
time getting in touch with their inner rednecks here. She, being
from the South, convinces more than he does, but it's still fun to
watch Keitel's Methody approach to Vernon, especially when the
man's rasslin' with his inbred prejudices.
</P>
<P>
   Styron the director captures the film's rural, '30s ambience as
well as she evokes its swampy summer heat _ that is, with
atmospheric precision. Still, this slight story is PBS, not
feature, material, Vernon's foul mouth notwithstanding. The
``Sophie's Choice'' author has sketched an incident here, not woven
a narrative.

`MONUMENT AVE.' LIMPS DOWN WELL-TRAVELED ROADS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Consider the curse of Denis Leary. He has great
comic timing, decent enough dramatic chops, an edgy magnetism,
outstanding ability as a monologuist, an instinct for the unusual _
in short, everything a movie star should have.
</P>
<P>
   Except, fatally, the ability to distinguish an interesting
concept from a well-conceived project. ``The Ref,'' ``Love Walked
In,'' ``Suicide Kings''; all films that Leary did fine work in, but
that his contribution was not enough to make work.
</P>
<P>
   Add ``Monument Ave.'' to the list. It's a potentially engrossing
tale of working-class Irish Americans fighting yuppie encroachment
on their Boston neighborhood by, mainly, stealing the yups' stuff.
But the script stumbles almost immediately and never regains its
footing.
</P>
<P>
   From sub-Tarantino dialogue about Brat Pack movies to
boilerplate blarney and increasingly grim, ``Mean Streets''
cliches, ``Monument Ave.'' is always limping down roads too often
taken.
</P>
<P>
   Leary's performance, however, is a sizzler. He's Bobby O'Grady,
33 years old and relatively sensible for a guy who steals luxury
cars for a living. He snorts too much coke _ but then, so does
everyone in Charlestown _ and has a secret affair going with Katy
(Famke Janssen), a restaurateur who's also the moll of neighborhood
godfather Jackie O (Colm Meaney).
</P>
<P>
   A devoted mother's son, Bobby is showing his Irish cousin Seamus
(Jason Berry) the organized petty crime ropes when another cousin,
the speed freak Teddy (Billy Crudup) unexpectedly is released from
prison. Fearing his former associate's motor mouth, Jackie O orders
Teddy gunned down. Bobby resents this, of course, but when an
intrusive cop (Martin Sheen) dares to investigate the murder, Bobby
sticks to the neighborhood code of silence. He isn't happy about
it, though.
</P>
<P>
   Things get worse, loyalties fray, more and more old women weep
over their dead sons and nephews. Director Ted Demme (``Beautiful
Girls'') douses the proceedings in persuasive, dead-end atmosphere.
But there have been dozens of movies that have done that, and many
to more illuminating or jarring effect. This one, for the most
part, just adds a bit of brogue to the street pathology.
</P>
<P>
   Except, occasionally, for Leary. In his best scene, Bobby
maniacally threatens an African-American who's wandered unaware
into the territorial neighborhood. It's a performance designed to
get an annoying, racist buddy to shut up, but Leary has so expertly
built up Bobby's angry, coked-out state of mind by that time, we're
not sure if his basic good sense is still in control.
</P>
<P>
   A couple more movies like ``Monument Ave.,'' and we'll be
worrying the same thing about Leary.

MASSIVE ATTACK HAILS FROM MUSIC-CRAZY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Call it trip-hop, English psychedelia or just
plain dance music for shut-ins. Whatever you dub it, Massive Attack
has stumbled upon one of the most seductive pop confections of the
decade.
</P>
<P>
   The music collective comes from the only metropolis located
between London and coastal Cornwall _ Bristol, a cliquey little
city that once played host to cigarette factories and a
particularly downtrodden dockland.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the dock is notable for sleek art galleries, and the
town's factories churn out Rolls-Royce engines. Lloyd's Banks is
based there.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing that never changed is the hunger among the Bristol
populace for the latest, edgiest pop music trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a weird little place,'' admits Grant Marshall
(Daddy G) of the pioneering dance/trip-hop trio known simply as
Massive. ``It's so remote we developed our own little scene over
the years. It's a place that's been heavily obsessed with reggae
and always had an eye for good taste. People are quite obsessive
about music there.''
</P>
<P>
   That good taste is evident in Massive's third and latest record,
``Mezzanine'' (Virgin), in which dub bass, languid, reverb-laden
guitar, eerie percussion, darkly atmospheric electronics and such
high-profile vocalists as veteran reggae star Horace Andy and
ex-Cocteau Twins chanteuse Liz Fraser help put this hypnotic sound
across.
</P>
<P>
   Massive Attack got together in 1983 as the Wild Bunch, a
portable sound system that spun reggae and post-punk rock at
parties and outdoor events. Four years later, the group _ which
included Neneh Cherry, Tricky and Nellee Hooper (who would later
produce Madonna, U2 and Bjork) _ started work on the highly
influential ``Blue Lines'' album, which boasted the standout track
``Unfinished Symphony.''
</P>
<P>
   That first Massive album can be viewed as the beginning of so
much of today's most resonant pop music. Tricky, Portishead, Roni
Size, Goldie, Hooper _ all are linked in some way to the record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bristol was always on the verge of a musical explosion,''
Marshall says. ``It just had so much potential, even before us. The
music we were doing was unique. Nobody else was doing it when we
started. We were influenced by dance and soul, but `Blue Lines' was
so far removed from the dance floor. It was music for the head.''
</P>
<P>
   Massive Attack _ which also includes singer-DJ Robert del Naja
(3-D) and DJ-keyboardist Andrew Vowles (Mushroom) _ appears Sunday
at the Hollywood Palladium with young Brit rapper Lewis Parker
opening. The New York Times said a recent Massive gig in Manhattan
was ``magnificent'' and ``brooding.''
</P>
<P>
   On stage, the trio is augmented by a band, including such
players from ``Mezzanine'' as guitarist Angelo Bruschini, bassist
Winston Blissett, drummer Pete Lewinson and keyboardist Michael
Timothy, plus vocalists Debbie Mira and Andy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken years to figure out how to adapt this music for the
stage,'' Marshall said. ``We started out using turntables, but that
was too rigid. The problem was how to perform studio-based music.
Slowly but surely, the band reinterpreted the albums.
</P>
<P>
   ``With nine people on stage, the focus is always changing.
There's a lot of things happening, a lot of experimentation. Things
happen by complete accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Massive was due to open the recent Verve stadium
tour. Asked if he was disappointed those plans fell apart, Marshall
says no.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just couldn't work things out between us,'' the DJ says.
``Everyone involved went a bit crazy, I suppose.''

SPIN EDITOR'S BOOK A TRIBUTE TO RAVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Looking at TV coverage of crowds mourning
Princess Diana last year, British music author Simon Reynolds could
only think of one analogy _ a ``negative rave'' of people across
the country all feeling the same emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, a senior editor at Spin magazine in New York, wrote
the fascinating ``Generation Ecstasy'' (Little, Brown; $25), which
traces the history of the rave scene and, by extension, electronic
music forms such as techno, drum 'n' bass, trip-hop and jungle, as
well as pirate radio and the illegal speed-based drug Ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't help making it seem like a wonderful thing, but I
did put in stuff about the dark side,'' Reynolds said. ``The scene
has definitely lost some of its idyllic luster.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Reynolds, the first Ecstasy-related dance music
scene erupted in Dallas and Austin, Texas, in the '80s, before the
drug, once used in group therapy sessions, was placed on the
controlled substances list.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this famous club that was legendary where you could
buy it over the counter _ and it wasn't considered a drug in that
sense, since it was legal,'' Reynolds said. ``It seemed like an
ordinary pill. It arrived in England from people who brought it
over from the States not realizing it was illegal in Britain. The
dance connection was made in Ibiza, where it became this enormous
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, who says he became ``an active raver'' in 1991, began
work on ``Generation Ecstasy'' in 1996 after traveling to raves in
the States and throughout Europe. He also bought loads of records
to track the evolution of electronic dance music from soul and
disco to jungle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a strong American rave scene,'' he said. ``But the
thing about jungle is, it's so unique to London, which is so full
of different cultures and races. It's hard to imagine the music
having the same impact here. It's becomes an exotic import in the
States.''
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER AMERICAN BAND: We've endured the return of disco, new
wave, jazz-fusion and kid groups. Now get ready for metal's
revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Such '80s hair bands as Poison, Motley Crue and Cinderella are
on the road. And Atlanta's Jackyl _ once infamous for on-stage
chain-saw abuse _ last week scored a stunning 75 adds at rock radio
across the nation for its new cover of Grand Funk Railroad's
``We're an American Band.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackyl singer Jesse James Dupree isn't surprised: ``I think it's
obvious the public is ready to jam again.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the extremely hairy quintet, formed in 1991, is aiming to
set a world record by playing 100 shows in 50 days throughout the
South and Midwest on the back of a 48-foot tractor-trailer rig.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the gear will be permanently attached to the flatbed,''
Dupree says.
</P>
<P>
   The group's 15-song hits package, ``Choice Cuts'' (Geffen),
containing the Grand Funk cover and a remake of the Beatles' ``I Am
the Walrus,'' was issued last week.
</P>
<P>
   ALANIS RESURFASING: Alanis Morissette's new disc, ``Supposed
Former Infatuation Junkie'' (Maverick), won't be released until
Nov. 3, but she's decided to return to the road starting Oct. 11.
Tickets go on sale Oct. 3 for her Oct. 14 date at the Hollywood
Palladium.

SHORT FILMS DEAL WITH DEATH AND WIN AWARDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB McCARTHY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Death was the common denominator at the recent Los
Angeles International Short Film Festival, though the two major
category winners took a different slant on this most universal
theme. The sobering ``Luz de la Mission'' took the top prize for
Best American Film while the comedic ``Tombstone'' won for Best
Foreign Film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luz de la Mission,'' by Martin Garcia Flores, is the account
of a prisoner's coming to terms with his grandmother's death. In
``Tombstone,'' by Brazilian director Paula Morelli, an
argumentative couple fights about love, death and especially the
choice of a headstone.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Pelletier, whose submission ``New Testament'' screened,
was judged to have the most potential as a director of a commercial
spot and given the Commercial Director's Award.
</P>
<P>
   Certificate Awards went to Mike Johnson (``The Devil Went Down
to Georgia''), Best Animation Film; Kia Simon, Eve Conant and
Jonathon Crosby, Best Documentary for ``Looking for Sly''; Swiss
director Vincent Pappalardo, Best Comedy for ``Electric Baby
Cleaner''; Erik Knight, Best Experimental Film for ``Dread Night
Folk''; and director Marty Keegan, Best Drama for ``Has Been.''
</P>
<P>
   The second annual L.A. International Short Film took place Sept.
11-13 at Barnsdall Park in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNATIONAL LEADING LADY: Actress Sharon Stone and the Academy
of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will host a retrospective of
films by French actress and director Jeanne Moreau on Thursday
night in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Moreau brought an aura of femininity and sensuality to the roles
she played, beginning in Louis Malle's ``The Lovers'' (1958) and
Francois Truffaut's ``Jules and Jim'' (1961). This international
star's career, which started in 1948, continues today. Most
recently, she appeared in Ismail Merchant's ``The Proprietor''
(1996) and had a cameo in this summer's hit ``Ever After.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreau is scheduled to attend. Doors open at 7 p.m. and the
program starts at 8.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets cost $5 for the public, $3 for academy members and may
be purchased at the academy during business hours. The theater is
at 8949 Wilshire Blvd. Call (310) 247-3600 for information.
</P>
<P>
   The tribute officially opens a retrospective of Moreau's career
at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's Bing Theatre, running
Oct. 4-25. ``Bay of Angels'' (1962) and ``Lillian Gish'' (1983),
the admiring portrait of the silent screen's first lady, directed
by and starring Moreau, will be shown 7 p.m. Oct. 4.
</P>
<P>
   For tickets, call the LACMA box office at (323) 857-6010 or
Ticketmaster at (213) 480-3232.
</P>
<P>
   BLOCKBUSTER WRITING: So you want to write for Hollywood. First
you might want to check out the Screenwriters on Screenwriting
course starting Oct. 12 at the UCLA Extension Writers' Program.
</P>
<P>
   Writers of some of the summer's blockbusters are lined up as
speakers, starting with Jonathan Hensleigh (``Armageddon''). He'll
be followed by Patrick Smith Kelly (``A Perfect Murder''), Rita
Hsiao (``Mulan''), Michael Tolkin (``Deep Impact''), Harry Elfont
and Deborah Kaplan (``Can't Hardly Wait'') and Scott Frank (``Out
of Sight''), who will talk about their experiences in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Screenwriters on Screenwriting is designed for writers of all
levels and for the general public. The course meets from 7 to 10
p.m. Mondays through Nov. 6 at UCLA. Tuition is $210 for the course
or $35 per class at the door.
</P>
<P>
   Call (310) 206-1542 for information, or e-mail at
writersunex.ucla.edu. Call (310) 825-9971 or visit the Web site
www.unex.ucla.edu/writers to register.
</P>
<P>
   YOU DIRTY RATS: Long before ``in your face'' got into modern
language, Jimmy Cagney and his snarling mug showed what bravado was
all about in ``Public Enemy.'' In the role of a Prohibition-era
gangster, Cagney was the poster boy for mean.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Prohibition ended and tavern beer taps flowed again,
films about crime bosses and thugs stuck around. Laemmle's Sunset 5
and Monica 4-Plex are running weekend screenings of gangster flicks
from the 1930s to the present-day ``GoodFellas'' and ``New Jack
City.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday and Sunday, ``Public Enemy'' (1931) plays at 10 a.m.
at the Sunset 5, 8000 Sunset Blvd. in West Hollywood, and at 11
a.m. at the Monica 4-Plex, 1332 Second St., Santa Monica. Not only
is Cagney one bad customer, but he smushes that grapefruit right in
Mae Clarke's face in a fit of rage that is cinematic lore.
</P>
<P>
   Films to follow include ``G Men,'' ``Key Largo,'' ``White
Heat,'' ``Bonnie &AMP; Clyde'' and ``Mean Streets.''

`FARO' AIMING FOR COOL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Friday's new faces are about as different as you
can get, with a guy who's been missing since the '70s and some kids
who weren't even born until a decade later.
</P>
<P>
   For the younger set, ABC adds two new shows to its TGIF lineup.
Coincidentally _ or, maybe not _ they're both about single fathers
who happen to be college professors, with the kids tended to by
nontraditional care-givers.
</P>
<P>
   CBS attempts to steal that stay-at-home audience with the return
of ``Kids Say the Darndest Things'' and ``Candid Camera'' at the 8
o'clock hour, followed by newcomer ``Buddy Faro.'' Will the
transition work? You'll decide. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
BUDDY &UR;  &LR; FARO &UR;  &QC; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Stylish, retro-chic and ring-a-ding.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Faro (Dennis Farina), the private investigator who wrote
the book on the business, scrammed to Mexico 20 years ago to escape
from a mad mobster. He had it all _ money, women, a cool car and
bartenders who knew his name.
</P>
<P>
   Think of an American version of Austin Powers with better teeth
and a suaver wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   A crisply written show packed with humor and a soundtrack with
non-Frank Sinatra versions of the Chairman's standards add up to a
deliciously entertaining show.
</P>
<P>
   The mob picks Bob Jones (Frank Whaley), a modern-day private
eye, from the phone book and tricks him into finding Faro so they
can kill him.
</P>
<P>
   Jones succeeds and locates the scraggly-bearded Rip Van Winkle
and gets him back to Los Angeles, where he finds that not much has
changed in style and attitude from the '70s. Swing is back, and the
martinis are flowing.
</P>
<P>
   Faro proves too slick for the gangsters and turns their little
scheme around on them. Faro and Jones then form an agency that will
be intact for episodes to come.
</P>
<P>
   Farina inhabits the most interesting new character on prime-time
television.
</P>
<P>
   Faro, a one-time friend of the Rat Pack, uses throwback language
such as ``kooky scene,'' ``toots,'' ``rub-a-dub-dub,'' ``doll
face,'' ``double sawbuck'' and ``funny face.''
</P>
<P>
   He dresses cool, and you'll never see him sweat.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot does drag a bit in the middle, but it picks up toward
the end.
</P>
<P>
   As Faro says, ``Buddy is back in town,'' and that is a good
thing. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
TWO OF A KIND &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The Olsen twins may have grown up, but their audience will
remain the same.
</P>
<P>
   Playing 11-year-olds, they will appeal to an audience younger
than themselves. Kids their own age will be too busy trying to
sneak into PG-13 movies and watching MTV to catch this sweet
sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   The twins, who shared a role on ``Full House,'' each get their
own part this time. Mary-Kate plays a tomboy and jock, Ashley plays
a princess who wants to wear makeup and date boys.
</P>
<P>
   Their father, Kevin Burke (Christopher Sieber), is a widower who
teaches science at a local college.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot has the girls tricking Dad into dumping the old baby
sitter _ an old neighbor (``She's like Generation A'') _ for a
26-year-old worldly and brash college student, Carrie Moore (Sally
Wheeler).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the girls prevail and Carrie becomes their female
role model and confidant. Through conversations with her, you get
the girls' innermost thoughts. Think of it as ``Ally McBeal: The
Early Years.''
</P>
<P>
   The producing team of Thomas L. Miller, Robert L. Boyett and
Michael Warren have been working with the Olsens since they were 6
months old and have not lost the touch of writing for them.
</P>
<P>
   When talking about poker, Ashley jokes, ``When we were little,
Full House beat everything.''
</P>
<P>
   It looks like the twins have another winner on their hands here.
</P>
<P>
   An interesting footnote (and an indication of how long pilots
sit around before they make the air): Carrie and Kevin, while
watching a Cubs game from her roof, complain about Sammy Sosa's
salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see you earn some of that $10.2 million,'' Carrie yells
across the street.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, was more than 60 home runs ago.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BROTHER'S KEEPER &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Porter Waide (William Ragsdale) is living a dandy life, raising
his whiz of an 8-year-old son, Oscar, all by himself.
</P>
<P>
   Everything is going as planned for the stuffy English professor
... until his wild brother Bobby (Sean O'Bryan) moves in.
</P>
<P>
   In a stretch that would hurt a gymnast, Bobby Waide, the bad boy
of the National Football League, is traded to the San Francisco
49ers and has a clause in his $1 million contract that forces him
to live with his responsible, uptight brother.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby is a place-kicker and looks as if he couldn't even kick a
habit.
</P>
<P>
   The two brothers clash on everything from food to child-rearing
(like Bobby would care).
</P>
<P>
   O'Bryan tries too hard to act irreverent in the pilot, and plot
twists _ such as his getting his brother a date with an
emergency-room nurse _ are preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   This show's idea of a big comedy moment is Porter getting a
board-game piece stuck up his nose. Don't bother letting your kids
stay up late for ``Brother's Keeper'' _ it's definitely not worth
it.

HISTORIC SEXUAL HIGH JINX REVISITED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``God made sin so we might know his mercy,''
declares a character in ``Dangerous Beauty,'' a historic sexual
romp that's out on video this week.
</P>
<P>
   So, it seems, we're talking wickedness and redemption here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dangerous Beauty'' tells the story of a young woman, Veronica
(Catherine McCormack), who falls in love with the wrong man (Rufus
Sewell) _ the son of a wealthy aristocrat _ in Venice in 1583.
Unable to marry him because her family could not provide a
sufficiently rich dowry, her mother (Jacqueline Bisset) offers an
alternative _ become a courtesan like she was in her youth. A
courtesan, her mother says, has the best of both worlds _ she can
be educated, have the man she wants when she wants and not be a
slave to stifling convention that the good wives of Venice are.
Veronica, though repulsed at first, quickly outdoes her mother,
becoming the darling of Venice and even saving the city with her
particular skills.
</P>
<P>
   For much of ``Dangerous Beauty,'' the tone is light and fun as
the couple perform their sexual dance, with enough witty rapartee,
swordplay and boudoir high jinks to be entertaining. At other
times, though, the film can't seem to decide if it is itself
sexploitation or is about the serious theme of the suppression of
women. (There is some irony that one of ``Beauty's'' main
commercial selling points is that there are a number of scenes with
women with their clothes off.)
</P>
<P>
   The lovely McCormack (Mel Gibson's doomed wife in
``Braveheart'') gives a lively performance, and Sewell (``Hamlet'')
is appropriately uppercrust while still being a hunk. The rest of
the cast, including Moira Kelley and Oliver Platt, is solid, and
the scenery is sumptuous.
</P>
<P>
   The last part of ``Beauty'' grows predictably serious as forces
of the Inquisition catch up with our heroine, and she becomes a
scapegoat for the ills of a city hit by the plague. This being the
Middle Ages, her accomplices (male clients) were not accused.
Although it is called a true story, the film's ending is a bit too
contrived, which undermines its earlier tone.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the most famous and successful historic sexual romp
of all time was ``Tom Jones'' (1963), which won four Academy
Awards, including Best Picture. Directed by Tony Richardson and
written by playwright John Osborne, ``Tom Jones'' may seem a little
overly cute today with its Keystone Kops-style chases, officious
off-screen narrator and silent-film-style titles, but there is
still much fun in this bawdy satire in which the hypocritical prigs
get their comeuppance.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Henry Fielding's 1749 sprawling episodic novel, ``Tom
Jones'' tells the story of the bastard son of the sister of a
wealthy country squire. Jones (played with delightful wit by Albert
Finney) is a wild youth whose love of drink and carnal pleasures
can't hide his good heart. Eventually he falls in love with Sophie
(Susannah York), the daughter of a neighboring squire (Hugh
Griffith).
</P>
<P>
   Being a bastard, Jones is not high on the squire's list of
perspective sons-in-law, and forces soon conspire against ``our
hero,'' as the narrator refers to him.
</P>
<P>
   Fielding's intent was to skewer all levels of English society at
the time, but Richardson's film makes it timeless. There are
hypocrites in every age after all.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you who would like to see a more fleshed-out
version of ``Tom Jones'' (we're not talking literally only length),
earlier this year A&AMP;E released on videotape its miniseries version,
starring Max Beesley.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few other films that fall into the historic sexual
category that you might want to rent:
</P>
<P>
   ``Queen Margot'' (1994), starring Isabelle Adjani, revolves
around the intrigues and incestuous relationships of the French
court in 1572. It's not much of a romp, since the film tells the
story of the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of thousands of
Protestants, but Adjani is stunning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moll Flanders'' (1996) is a feminist retelling of Daniel
Defoe's 18th-century novel about an orphan girl who triumphs over
her impoverished upbringing and servitude in a house of ill repute.
Robin Wright (Moll) is luminous, but there is not much humor. The
story never gets too sudsy, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``Restoration'' (1996), starring Robert Downey Jr., is a true
sexual romp, at least for the first half. Set in 1660 England,
``Restoration'' is the story of a hedonistic physician (Downey)
whose debauched life leads him to ruin (this is where the romp
stops), but he eventually finds redemption. Meg Ryan has a nice
turn as a slightly mad woman who helps Downey recover.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the soon-to-be-released videotape of Bill
Clinton's grand jury testimony. Not exactly a historical romp, but
historical anyway.

   MIAMI _ Like a gripping soap opera, Hurricane Georges had all of
Miami on the edge of its seat Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   For those of us who've never lived through a hurricane before,
it was actually more like sitting through a trailer for a very
scary movie -- a lot of anxiety-causing teases, but no ending.
</P>
<P>
   Not yet anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Georges spent Thursday hugging Cuba's northern coast,
confounding forecasters who weren't 100 percent certain whether the
deadly storm would strike Miami or skirt past the Florida Keys and
into the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Sustaining winds of just 80 mph by lunchtime, the storm no
longer packed much of its earlier punch.
</P>
<P>
   So my biggest question was: How bad can it be?
</P>
<P>
   Pretty bad, judging from the frantic actions of friends and
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, many had boarded up their homes as tightly as Fort
Knox; so much so that I wasn't sure there was still life inside
some of them.
</P>
<P>
   They had smothered china and other valuables on beds under a
mountain of quilts, and had stocked up on enough food and water to
last through the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   I was doing good to get my plants inside.
</P>
<P>
   But I didn't live through Hurricane Andrew. Many of them did.
</P>
<P>
   ``My yard was a mess and I was without water and electricity for
two weeks,'' one friend recounted. ``The heat, particularly at
night, was unbearable with no air-conditioning.''
</P>
<P>
   How's that for a calming effect?
</P>
<P>
   Andrew is the bullet Miami had dodged since 1965, when Hurricane
Betsy sliced through the upper Florida Keys and cruised across the
Gulf of Mexico to slam the Louisiana coast, killing 75 people.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1992, most residents here paid little heed to hurricane
warnings that were broadcast whenever a storm would roar out of the
Caribbean because, in general, most hurricanes failed to deliver
the promised blows.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane David, for example, threatened to strike Miami in
1979, but zigzagged away at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   But then came Andrew, which shook the city by the throat, and
out of its complacency.
</P>
<P>
   The storm was the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history,
inflicting some $30 billion in damage on southern Florida.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, residents are no longer apathetic.
</P>
<P>
   A hurricane warning posted for the Miami area and much of South
Florida early Thursday prompted a rush of activity in this city of
oceanfront condominiums and smoked-glass towers.
</P>
<P>
   Schools and daycare centers were closed, leaving parents in a
crunch. Offices shut down, and stores were overwhelmed with
frazzled homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic jams were no where to be found in a maddeningly
congested city that has numerous commuters traveling hours to get
to and from work.
</P>
<P>
   But for me, the worst part was the uncertainty of not knowing
what would come next.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters raised stress levels even higher by warning just
before 1 p.m. EDT that Georges was finally headed away from Cuba
and out over the open waters of the Florida Straits, which -- from
everyone's dire predictions -- appear to be the warmest waters
outside of Hades.
</P>
<P>
   Warm water, it seems, heats up a hurricane's intensity faster
than fire heats up a marshmallow.
</P>
<P>
   If that wasn't alarming enough, television stations that began
broadcasting around-the-clock Thursday morning peppered their
coverage with testimonials from those who had been through Andrew,
building tension even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``One man who tried to film the storm with his camcorder was
ripped right off his balcony, completely sucked away by the
storm,'' one woman interjected.
</P>
<P>
   By early afternoon, folks were being prompted not only to have
well-stocked first-aid kits, but also ``signal flares'' in case of
they get into ``serious'' trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the grim words of an official from the National
Hurricane Center, who had this warning for those residents of Key
West planning to ride out the deadly storm: ``This could be the
worst night of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   So under deceptively gorgeous, sunny skies, I was growing
increasingly concerned, but still thinking Thursday that the storm
couldn't possibly be as bad as everyone warned it might be.
</P>
<P>
   Or could it?

   HURRICANE
</P>
<P>
   HURRICANE-GEORGES _ MIAMI _ Southern Florida continued to brace
for the approaching storm on Thursday, as Hurricane Georges
appeared to be taking a sounthernmost track across the Caribbean.
By early morning, the storm _ which was still barely a hurricane _
was skimming the northern coast of Cuba, leaving 50 dead in its
wake in other parts of the Caribbean. Developing. (Emling, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   JOURNAL-HURRICANE _ MIAMI _ In my years of travel as a foreign
correspondent throughout the Caribbean and Latin America, there is
very little that I haven't had to deal with _ from corrupt
dictatorships to drug cartels to starving people to tony tourist
meccas. But I'm not sure any of that prepared me for the high
anxiety and paranoia that has gripped this city since it learned
that Hurricance Georges could come its doorstep. (Emling, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   STORM _ The storm continues lumbering towards us. The prognosis
and updated forecasts. (McLachlin., Palm Beach Post). WITH MAP.
</P>
<P>
   WATER _ So it's going to flood. When, where and why. What
precautions are being taken by water managers? (King, Palm Beach
Post).
</P>
<P>
   RUSH _ MIAMI _ Officials in Miami-Dade were expected to begin
evacuations that could send millions of people north. Let the
gridlock begin. We chronicle how it will affect Palm Beach County.
(Desmon, Palm Beach Post).
</P>
<P>
   KEYS _ THE FLORIDA KEYS _ Expected to be relatively quiet day in
the Keys as residents brace for the wrath of Georges. (Hiaasen in
Marathon, Staletovich in Key West and Kane in Key Largo, Plam Beach
Post).
</P>
<P>
   PREP _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Any last-minute stragglers for
supplies? (Bierman, Palm Beach Post).
</P>
<P>
   ART _ So what if you didn't have just Target lawn furniture to
protect, you had priceless sculptures and paintings? That's exactly
the dilemma facing folks at the Norton Museum in West Palm Beach
and other museums. (Schwan, Palm Beach Post).

   GEORGES STORIES THAT HAVE ALREAY MOVED . . .
</P>
<P>
   PORT-PALMBEACH _ RIVIERA BEACH, Fla. _ The Port of Palm Beach
will be the only major port in South Florida to remain open as
federal authorities shut down the Port of Miami and Port Everglades
as a Hurricane Georges-related precaution. (Utley, Palm Beach Post)
MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   STORM-DINING _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ If the storm rolls in,
how will John Alfeo tell? His Hurricane Grill restaurant on 25th
Street has the decor of a full-force gale. There's a storm tracking
chart by the cash register, but it shows Andrew's path. Hurricane
Georges is nothing but a special on the menu. Spinach salad with
grilled chicken, bacon and balsamic vinaigrette. (Anna, Palm Beach
Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   STORM-PREPARATION _ Karen Jacobs didn't panic in August 1992
when Hurricane Andrew built up a running start in the Atlantic
Ocean. ``What's the worst, you know, the AC could go off?'' She had
said. The air conditioning did go off. So did part of the roof and
one wall. That's why Jacobs was covering windows to prepare for
Hurricane Georges. But oddly, only the windows on the east side.
Jacobs partial reaction typefies, under one rebuilt roof, the two
currents of thought in Country Walk. (Trontz, Palm Beach Post)
MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   STORM-PROTECTION _ Eleven-dollar pieces of plywood gained new
value as local residents competed with Broward, Miami-Dade and
Monroe county residents to buy storm supplies. But most Palm Beach
County and Treasure Coast residents remained calm, figuring the
brunt of Hurricane Georges wouldn't come this far north. (Bierman,
Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   STORM-INSURANCE _ Like most major insurance carriers, State Farm
Fire and Casualty stops writing new home and auto policies when a
hurricane watch has been posted. State Farm wasn't alone. If you
live in an area where you think you might need insurance within a
few days, you probably can't get it. Most companies stopped writing
new policies in South Florida by September 23. (Murawski, Palm
Beach Post) MOVED.

   WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON _ Clinton meets with Congressional Black Caucus this
morning. Checking out what Lewis, McKinney and Bishop have to say
afterwards. (Sherman, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON _ WASHINGTON _ Challenging Congress to ``think of the
American people,'' President Clinton appeared in the Rose Garden on
Thursday to press for a long list of legislation that he said was
being neglected in the midst of impeachment deliberations. (Deans,
Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-TAPES _ WASHINGTON _ In what could bring a reprise of
the partisan furor over President Clinton's videotaped testimony,
the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee said Thursday the
panel may release edited transcripts _ but not the original tapes _
of Monica Lewinsky's phone conversations with Linda Tripp. Members
cite reasons ranging from the fact that the tapes show signs of
tampering to suspicions that their tone will make Americans more
sympathetic to Clinton. (Dart, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-CONGRESS _ House Judiciary Committee continues to work
on what else to release of the boxes of Starr evidence. (Sherman,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   INCOME _ WASHINGTON _ Poverty rates and household incomes have
returned to 1989 pre-recession levels, the result of a strong
national economy, especially in the South and the West, that has
helped to lift millions of African Americans and Hispanics out of
poverty, according to Census Bureau reports released Thursday.
(Shepard, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   FOREIGN-STUDENTS _ WASHINGTON _ The United States may be losing
its edge in attracting the brightest foreign students to study here
instead of at other universities abroad, experts said Thursday at a
meeting co-sponsored by the Educational Testing Service and the
U.S. Information Agency. (Monroe, Cox News Service).

announce a new rule Thursday aimed at dealing with
``cross-boundary'' smog problems in which power plants in the South
and Midwest have been charged with creating smog problems in other
regions. (Nesmith, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   MILMED _ Surgeons general of Army, Navy and Air Force discuss
military medical shortfall and its impacts in hearing before House
subcommittee members. Hearing was called after committee members
happened upon e-mail messages from an Army commander complaining
about the shortfall. (Nesmith, Cox Nedws Service).
</P>
<P>
   TECH-VISAS _ WASHINGTON _ The House is expected to approve more
visas for highly skilled foreign workers Thursday, admitting up to
337,500 foreign workers over the next three years, instead of the
195,000 that would be allowed under current law. President Clinton,
whose economic advisers helped write this plan, is expected to sign
the legislation, in part because it will create scholarships and
job training for U.S. workers.(Harlan, Cox News Service).

   Y2K-CONSUMERS _ WASHINGTON _ Two House subcommittees hold a 2

   (For Texas papers) TAX-GOETZ _ WASHINGTON _ For the estate of
Nelda G. Goetz, the Internal Revenue Service is seeing the forest
but not the trees. The estate of the San Augustine, Texas, woman
filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court here claiming the IRS
valued her 1,252 acres of wooded lands at more than four times
their worth. The IRS demanded the estate pay $706,334 in additional
taxes and civil tax fraud penalties. (Moskal, Cox News Service).

<P>
   SMOG _ U.S. EPA is set today to implement tougher regulations on
nitrogen oxide emissions in 22 states including Ohio. Old,
coal-fired power plants are the chief culprit. Environmental
officials say the regulations, which will require cuts in Nox
levels up to 45 percent in Ohio, are needed to curtail downwind
pollution from the Midwest to the Eastern states. Midwest
politicians and power company officials say the cuts will reduce
electric capacity and hurt the economy. (Dempsey, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 20.

   VETERAN-WOMAN-OLDEST-LONG (Undated) Carol Smith. A personal

several awful months in 1918 _ months that would affect the rest of

   FILM-CRIES (Undated) ``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries,'' the
Merchant-Ivory film version of a family memoir written by Jones'
daughter, Kaylie. As a portrait of the artist as a parent, it's the
very antithesis of ``Mommie Dearest'' and the whole
celebrity-parent bashing genre.

   FILM-RONIN (Undated) If you find yourself nostalgic for an
old-fashioned, no-holds-barred car chase _ on the scale of those
signature moments of 1968's ``Bullitt'' and 1971's ``The French
Connection'' _ then John Frankenheimer's ``Ronin'' is your movie.

   FILM-CLAY (Undated) In an interview last month, director Gus Van
Zant said he cast Vince Vaughn for the Norman Bates role in his
upcoming remake of Hitchcock's ``Psycho'' because he wanted
``someone who would take you off guard'' _ an actor you wouldn't
expect to be a serial murderer. But it now looks as if Vaughn could
be typecast in that role before the film's December release.
Because in ``Clay Pigeons,'' he plays a vicious murderer of
helpless women in a story that seems to be inspired, ironically
enough, by Hitchcock's ``Strangers On a Train.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   (begin italics) ``Do I look bad?'' the soldier pleads.
</P>
<P>
   Half his face is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Frost hurriedly dresses the raw shreds that remain. There
are still men moaning on gurneys in the rain outside the operating
tent.
</P>
<P>
   Her hands shake from the chilling damp that seeps through the
canvas walls. Her thin leather boots are coated with mud. Blood is
smeared across her nurse's uniform.
</P>
<P>
   She tries to block out the sound of limbs dropping into enamel
pails as surgeons saw through mangled flesh and bones.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment she presses her hand against her eyes. Sometimes
the men in their misery make her cry.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   Eighty years later her hand still goes to her eyes when she
recalls that scene.
</P>
<P>
   At 105, Laura Frost Smith travels easily in her mind to 1918 and
the Western Front, a war zone that separated her from her youth.
</P>
<P>
   Today she is one of the oldest known living American veterans of
World War I, a war that marked the first time women officially
served in the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
   She is also my grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   I had mixed emotions on learning of this latest milestone in my
grandmother's life.
</P>
<P>
   Her other accomplishments are more dear to me _ the lemon cake
she baked when I was a child, the parade of hand-knit socks and
mittens for Christmas, her skilled watercolors, prized garden and
the stories she told of growing up on a farm near Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The war was almost never mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Her military service was such a small sliver of her life. Like a
single tree ring lost in the dense coil that holds a life together,
it hardly seemed significant as I was growing up.
</P>
<P>
   I could barely remember the contours of the war drawn in history
classes, let alone picture my grandmother serving at five of its
bloodiest fronts. To me they were just names printed on tiny brass
bars and clasped to the ribbon of the Victory Medal in a glass box
on her wall.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the women who served in the Great War are gone now.
Ignored when they came home and forgotten by subsequent
generations, most never had a chance to tell their stories.
</P>
<P>
   So I went in search of this part of my grandmother's life. I
visited her earlier this month at the Meadows care center in Los
Gatos, Calif., where she lives now. For three days we sat together
in the sun beside a lemon tree, while I looked for pathways through
her memory that would take me with her to that place and time.
</P>
<P>
   She is still beautiful, and though her eyesight and hearing are
failing, there are still flashes of her keen mind and wicked sense
of humor. She remembers.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't where I found the pieces I was looking for.
</P>
<P>
   I went back, instead, to the letters she sent home from the war,
and to a family memoir she wrote in her 90s.
</P>
<P>
   There, in her own words, I found a young woman I never knew, a
woman who went off to see the world, and in the process helped
change it.
</P>
<P>
   Her year at war not only shaped her life in ways I had never
understood, it had also helped shape mine.
</P>
<P>
   Give me girls
</P>
<P>
   Laura Frost was an unconventional woman even before she went to
war.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1893, she grew up on a small farm in East Taunton, Mass.
Her father, George, grew vegetables that her mother made into
pickles they sold in town.
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother, the youngest of three daughters, was given the
middle name ``Georgina,'' for the son her parents didn't have, and
she learned to work the land accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   She went to a one-room school where boys and girls had separate
entrances, but there was no such division of labor at home. ``Give
me girls every time,'' her father would tell her years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister and I proved to him we could do our share working
the farm,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So it seemed natural to do her share when the call went out for
volunteers to fight the war that had been raging across Europe
since 1914. Her graduation from nursing school nearly coincided
with the U.S. declaration of war on the Germans on April 6, 1917.
</P>
<P>
   Her training hospital, working with the Red Cross, organized
military Base 44. ``Most of my class signed up for it,'' she wrote
in her memoir. She was sworn in on Feb. 15, 1918, and sent to Fort
Oglethorpe, Ga., for training.
</P>
<P>
   She went to war for adventure. She had no idea how much her life
was about to change.
</P>
<P>
   When she signed up, women couldn't vote and men were deeply
suspicious of those who were educated. According to scientists of
the day, women's smaller brains were not equipped for higher
education, and too much thinking was believed to impair their
childbearing capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Only five years earlier, the sinking of the Titanic and the cry
of ``women and children first'' had inflamed arguments about female
roles in society. To traditionalists, the Titanic proved that women
belonged to a special class, one requiring protection by _ not
equality with _ men.
</P>
<P>
   That left no room for women on the battlefield. But some women
saw it differently.
</P>
<P>
   When the United States entered the war, there were 403 Army
nurses on active duty. By Armistice Day, 19 months later, more than
21,000 had enlisted and about 10,000 had seen duty overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Such a good time
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of the country, my grandmother entered the war
with high spirits and a certain innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know I have never had such a good time in my life as I
have had this last two weeks,'' she wrote from training camp on
March 4, 1918. ``One thing I have learned already _ and had to if I
was to live at all _ that is to dance. Can you imagine fox-trotting
and waltzing with majors and captains?''
</P>
<P>
   She was soon swept up in her first real romance _ a love affair
with a dashing first lieutenant. Pete Herzog wooed her with
dinners, dancing and shows _ heady experiences for a tomboy whose
social life had centered mostly on the annual clambake at her tiny
church or the occasional ride in a horse-drawn sleigh.
</P>
<P>
   In letters home, she referred often to her lieutenant. He taught
her military marching maneuvers and stood at attention as she
passed by in her first parade. Before they left for Europe, he gave
her a diamond service pin as a pledge of love, and she promised to
write him through the war.
</P>
<P>
   Though the romance thrilled her, she never lost sight of her
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Assigned to the psychiatric ward at training camp, she
encountered a shellshocked patient sent home from battle: ``The
first day I went into the ward after lunch, I found everyone
cringing into corners or under their beds. A young fellow was
brandishing a straight razor. I didn't know what was happening but
went right up to him and yelled: `Give me that!' He smiled and
handed me the open razor.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger of battle, however, still felt a long way off, and in
some ways the war seemed like a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so happy to think that we are at last on the way,'' she
wrote from training camp. ``. . . We'll soon have the Huns on the
run and be home in no time.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were signs that fantasies of war were about to end.
</P>
<P>
   One day a friend asked her to go horseback riding. She accepted,
but at the last minute changed her plans and asked a fellow nurse
to take her place.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was so pleased to think that she was going for a ride, and
in five minutes she was thrown and died three hours later,'' my
grandmother wrote home.
</P>
<P>
   Sobered by the death, the nurses marched behind her hearse in a
military funeral. ``I never realized what taps meant before, until
they sounded for her at the station,'' she wrote. ``None of us have
very much pep since it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 17, 1918, the base hospital moved by train from Georgia
to New York to prepare for the trip to France.
</P>
<P>
   The timing meant the nurses would get to march 60 blocks in New
York City's Fourth of July parade. It would be one of the first
times American military women had ever marched alongside men. It
would also provide her first glimpse of how the rest of the country
viewed women in the Army.
</P>
<P>
   On July 6, 1918, she wrote: ``It really was a wonderful parade.
... They didn't say much about the nurses in it. We thought we were
the whole show. They just said 400 (women) marched and there were
at least 1,400. It is funny, because a paper usually exaggerates so
much.''
</P>
<P>
   It made her feel important to march then, she said during my
recent visit. The irony is not lost on her, even all these years
later.
</P>
<P>
   When she came home after the war, people would barely notice.
</P>
<P>
   Over there
</P>
<P>
   On July 14, 1918, she sailed on the troop ship Northland for the
18-day trip to Liverpool and then Le Havre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never knew how many ships were in our convoy, but I guessed
about 18,'' she wrote in her memoir. ``That month, about 300,000
troops went over. We were told to throw nothing overboard, as any
floating objects would reveal our course to any lurking
submarine.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucked in her small Army trunk was a box camera and developing
fluid _ despite warnings they were not to take pictures.
</P>
<P>
   By Aug. 4, she had left Paris and was on duty in Evacuation No.
7, a field hospital in the VO Surg District in France.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it hadn't been the amputation ward, maybe the shock
wouldn't have been so devastating,'' she wrote. ``But helping dress
those quivering stumps and hearing the laughter and jokes in spite
of their misfortune was too much for me and I cried all that first
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they had made a mistake by putting us through that
experience so soon, but maybe it was for the good and I could stand
anything after that miserable week.''
</P>
<P>
   The nurses sent closest to the front were equipped with a
helmet, gas mask, mess kit and canteen. She was one of them.
</P>
<P>
   They headed straight into the horror of the first ``modern''
war. Poison gas, aerial bombardments and machine guns were being
used for the first time. In four years of madness, more than 65
million men would go to war. Many were slaughtered in the bellies
of trenches that gashed the length of France.
</P>
<P>
   The terrorist bullet that took the life of Archduke Franz
Ferdinand ended up gutting a generation. The casualties _ more than
8 million by war's end _ left a deep scar across several
continents.
</P>
<P>
   Mud and blood
</P>
<P>
   Mobile hospitals at the front worked frantically to save what
was left of men's bodies as they came in. But the damage was
frequently too great. Double amputations were common.
</P>
<P>
   Many died on the operating tables. Sometimes they arrived on
stretchers, scared yet hopeful, their young faces untouched. But
when their uniforms were cut away, they would be nearly shot in
two. Nurses could do nothing but hold their hands as they died.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the women spoke of their experiences, even decades later,
silenced as much by trauma as social norms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was too sad,'' my grandmother said during my recent visit.
``So many hurt boys. Seeing the stumps and their bones . . .'' She
could not finish.
</P>
<P>
   From her original hospital, my grandmother was dispatched closer
to the front. She went with Evac 5 to what had been a town on the
River Marne. The unit, totaling about 1,000 beds, received
casualties directly from the trenches. Each operating tent had 10
surgery tables in use around the clock. At full capacity, the
hospital had about 48 nurses, each handling 20 patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the wounded began to come in, the stretchers were laid on
the ground and the corpsmen stripped them of their muddy clothes
and deloused them, usually before we received them in the operating
tent,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The most seriously wounded were operated on right away, and
those who could stand the journey were evacuated to base hospitals
farther from the front.
</P>
<P>
   The nurses worked under primitive conditions, layering men's
socks and underwear under their uniforms for warmth, sleeping on
the ground or cots in their tents, sometimes subsisting on little
more than beans and hardtack. They worked eight hours on and eight
hours off, around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the afternoon off today for the first time,'' she wrote
home. ``With so much time on my hands I didn't know what to do so I
slept till supper time. Then tonight we went out to get water in
our canteens and took a little walk. . . . The moon looked so
pretty tonight shining on the ruins.''
</P>
<P>
   During the bitter-cold fall of 1918, rain drilled down
relentlessly. They pitched their camps in fields filled with
viscous, sucking mud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing we have to contend with is the mud,'' she
wrote home. ``The blankets on the cots hang over into it and then
they get all wet and so dirty you dread to put them on the patient.
Then the pillows and cots get wet through the tent. Believe me,
it's some mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight decades later, it isn't hard for her to remember what was
different from what she had expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mud,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the blood.''
</P>
<P>
   A long, long trail
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in their training had prepared them for the kind of
nursing they would have to do.
</P>
<P>
   The patients, especially the brain injuries, made them
heartsick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Margaret and I became very fond of one of our patients and
kept him several days, trying to get him to talk,'' she wrote. ``He
was only about 18 years old and had a bullet hole right in the
middle of his forehead. All he could say was `glass,' but he wasn't
paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he wanted something, we would keep asking him until we
hit the right thing and he would nod his head. One day Margaret
sang `Over There' to him, and he followed along saying all the
words. That was a great day for us. When he was evacuated, we went
to the train with him and sat by his litter until the train pulled
out.''
</P>
<P>
   They taught another brain-damaged patient to say, ``Good night,
nurse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He says, `Good night' for everything he wants,'' she wrote.
``They were singing to him yesterday and he joined in and said
`long, long trail' quite plainly. I couldn't stay to hear any more,
for it is going to be a long, long trail for him. We had quite a
time tonight trying to find out what he wanted and would you
believe it was a cigarette?''
</P>
<P>
   Shattered brains, bullet holes and severed limbs weren't the
only wounds they saw. The use of poisonous gases _ mustard gas,
chlorine, phosgene and other toxic aerosols _ increased toward the
war's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Germans were getting desperate now and used more and more
mustard gas,'' she wrote. ``Our casualties were 20 and 30 percent
gassed. It made huge blisters on them and they suffered painfully.
Even though they were cleaned, I sometimes got a whiff of the
miserable stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   For nurses, flu was even more deadly. More than 400 died in the
line of duty, most from Spanish influenza, a virulent strain that
swept the world in 1918 and 1919, killing 21 million.
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother fell sick with the flu immediately after the
Meuse-Argonne Offensive, one of the war's decisive battles.
</P>
<P>
   She spent several days in a coma. ``I came to one day and found
myself in a regular hospital bed in a little tent all by myself,''
she wrote. ``I hadn't seen a bed before, as all our patients were
put on army cots when they came in and that's what we slept on,
too. The head nurse took care of me and I'm sure she saved my
life.''

<P>
   A different front
</P>
<P>
   The nurses coped with wrenching wounds and death, filth and the
flu, the threat of shells and poison gas. But they were also
fighting a battle on a different front.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving a letter from home with news that her town was
displaying a flag for the nurses, she wrote: ``I'm glad someone
appreciates the nurses. The patients are the only ones here that
do. ... We just have to fight for our very existence here.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, when the Army passed out tickets to receive donated
Christmas packages from America, they skipped the nurses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry about our Christmas, no one over here worries
about us, so why should you?'' she wrote her mother and father.
``We weren't given any cards or tickets or anything else, so we are
just out of luck. `S.O.L.' they say in the army. When I get back,
you won't understand my language, not because it is French or
German either.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their difficulties, the nurses found ways to endure, and
even raise their spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we were invited to dances,'' she wrote. ``The
English and French could go home for rest, but it was too far for
the Americans, so recreation was planned in plays and dances.''
</P>
<P>
   Humor helped them survive.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, they were loaded onto trains for transport.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (nurses) were fortunate to have a toilet on board, but the
men stopped along the way at different sidings,'' she wrote. ``One
of our nice doctors was caught with his pants down when the train
started up unexpectedly. He really got an ovation from the crowd as
he scrambled aboard clutching his clothes. We made fun out of every
little incident and were hilarious at times.''
</P>
<P>
   Letters helped, too _ especially from her lieutenant friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had a letter from Pete,'' she wrote home. ``He may be in the
next town for all I know. He censors his own mail but is a very
good soldier and wouldn't say a thing that wasn't right. Some
people at home think that your mail coming this way is opened, but
it isn't ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``... Marg Cooper got a letter from one of the girls at the base
today. It surely must be a wonderful place, but we are satisfied
with this wild and woolly life until the snow flies at least. ...
Our tent is pitched on a kind of a hill and even though I have my
cot propped up, my head is usually lower than my feet, and
sometimes I wake up and find the bunk has sort of skidded during
the night and my head is outside, with the flap of the tent forming
a bib. Oh it's a great life if you don't weaken. . . . It may not
be quite as comfortable as the little bungalows (at the base
hospital) . . . but I like it fine.''
</P>
<P>
   And when there were no letters, they sang to keep their courage
up.
</P>
<P>
   After pitching tents near Ypres, she wrote: ``. . . The boys
found three pianos while they were searching the dugouts. They say
some of the dugouts the Germans had were carpeted. Last night they
brought one of the pianos back to camp and put it up in the Red
Cross hut. Someone was clever enough to tune it and a lot of the
boys can play, so we had quite a concert.''
</P>
<P>
   They sang all the songs written for the war, sometimes devising
their own lyrics. For one called ``The Rose of No Man's Land,''
they substituted the words: `` 'Neath the war's red curse stands
the Cross Red Nurse. She's the rose of no man's land.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Army now
</P>
<P>
   The lighter moments helped them keep their fear in check. They
relocated the tent hospitals frequently, often on 24 hours notice,
so they could go where casualties were heaviest. They would pack 12
nurses to an ambulance and space their vehicles miles apart, so
planes wouldn't detect their moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The devastation along our route was unbelievable,'' she wrote.
``Houses just a pile of rubble, dead cows in the fields, bloated
bodies of horses along the muddy roads where rats were scurrying
out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they were several miles from the front, they were still
at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We soon learned the sound of a German Fokker plane,'' she
wrote. ``It didn't have the same droning sound of the Allied ones
and we hardly waited for the sound of the alarm to take cover. . .
. It seemed cruel to leave the bed patients, but (it was)
reasonable that someone should be left to take care of them in case
the hospital was bombed.''
</P>
<P>
   On the troop ship over, she had written her parents: ``. . . Now
mother, imagine us having such good times and everyone at home
worrying their heads off about us. You know, Uncle Sam is pretty
clever and I am sure I have never been safer in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Four months later, any romantic illusions she'd harbored about
the war had disappeared, replaced by an appreciation for the
paradox and futility of battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one at home has the faintest idea how they are getting
killed (here),'' she wrote home. ``... I'm sure no one realizes the
suffering of the boys. It's their spirit that affects me. I can
watch them amputate a leg and dress a wound that is open from the
hip down, but when a boy tells you he is sorry he lost (his leg)
because it puts him out and he can't go back, well I have to walk
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Daily, the medical teams fixed up men to be shot to pieces
again. At the same time, in the same tents, they worked to save
enemy prisoners _ the same men Allied soldiers were trying
desperately to kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of my ward there were several wounded German
prisoners, young towheaded, blue-eyed boys,'' she wrote. ``A guard
stood over them with a .45. Having American and German patients
together brought home the fact of how stupid any war is.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other absurdities.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1918, blacks and whites were kept separate even when sick
in the hospital,'' she wrote in her memoir. ``White orderlies were
supposed to give the personal care to the men, but when one refused
to give an enema to a black man, I was so angry I put up a screen
and took care of the patient myself. He was very grateful and that
was the only time I was ever thanked for giving an enema.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman who had signed her early letters home ``From your
soldier girl,'' and gaily referred to being ``in the Army now,''
had hardened into a pragmatic realist and passionate pacifist. She
would become a lifelong believer in equal rights.
</P>
<P>
   Coming home
</P>
<P>
   If the war began a personal transformation that defined the rest
of her life, it also began a transformation of women in general
back home.
</P>
<P>
   After more than 50 years of pressure from suffragists, it was
the women who served in WWI who finally shamed the government into
taking action on the right to vote.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1919, less than a year after the war ended, the U.S.
Senate passed the 19th Amendment. Women marked ballots for the
first time in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   By breaking the military's gender barrier, the 33,000 women who
served in WWI spurred other social changes. By WWII, women
encountered fewer barriers to serving, and more than 10 times that
number signed up. At war's end, thousands of them took up work in
fields previously dominated by men.
</P>
<P>
   But my grandmother couldn't know back then _ just as the war was
ending _ how it would affect her life or her country. She was
simply excited to be coming home safely.
</P>
<P>
   ``About Nov. 7th, we began to hear rumors that the armistice was
being planned,'' she wrote in her memoir. ``We didn't believe it,
for we still heard the guns and the wounded were still coming in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, one day, the 11th of November, everything became
quiet about 11 a.m. and you wondered what was different. There
wasn't a sound, for there were no birds to sing, or no cows to moo.
We still couldn't believe it possible, as we had so many patients.
A group of French trumpeters came in the afternoon and played for
us, so that was the only celebration we had.''
</P>
<P>
   By the Armistice, her unit had treated 15,000 casualties.
</P>
<P>
   It would be six more months before she got orders to go home.
She continued to care for the wounded, but with the war over, she
also spent time in Paris, Monaco and the French Alps.
</P>
<P>
   Though the shelling had stopped, the war continued to wound in
unexpected ways.
</P>
<P>
   While on leave in Nice, my grandmother bumped into a friend of
the first lieutenant she'd fallen in love with during training
camp, the man whose letters she read and reread when she was off
duty. She was told her lieutenant would arrive in the same city the
next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``With great expectation, Margaret and I went to the train to
meet him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had lost weight and looked very tired and just gave a nod
of recognition when we greeted him. We all got in a taxi and he saw
that we got off at our hotel, then he went on to where the officers
were staying.''
</P>
<P>
   She later learned he had been gassed and wounded, and his best
friend had been blown apart beside him in a trench two days before
the Armistice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw him again, and sent the little service pin back to
him by a messenger.''
</P>
<P>
   But heartache couldn't dampen her excitement at going home. On
May 31, 1919, she boarded the Cape Finesterre bound for America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming into New York harbor was an unforgettable event,'' she
wrote. ``Tugboats and fireboats came out to meet us and in my
exuberance, I flung my blue straw hat right at the Statue of
Liberty. Bands were playing and toilet paper was strung all over
the ship like confetti on a happy cruise ship.''
</P>
<P>
   She didn't know then that the celebration would be short-lived,
that she was returning to a country not ready to hear her stories
or those of the other women who served.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saying goodbye to all the friends we had made in the service
was very sobering,'' she wrote. ``On the train and the streetcar
home, I never felt so depressed and forlorn in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Though dressed in full uniform ``no one knew or noticed I was a
returning veteran.''
</P>
<P>
   Many years later, she said she knew how Vietnam veterans felt
when they they came home.
</P>
<P>
   After the war
</P>
<P>
   The war was rarely mentioned after her return.
</P>
<P>
   Though many of the nurses' experiences were more dramatic than
those of their husbands, boyfriends or brothers, they didn't talk
for fear of embarrassing the men. Social pressures against women
doing ``men's work'' also enforced their silence.
</P>
<P>
   But the war's imprint remained. It would influence my
grandmother's outlooks and actions for the rest of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Sick of the carnage of battle, she turned to obstetrical
nursing. ``I decided I had worked long enough with men,'' she
wrote. ``It was very pleasing and satisfactory work. The babies
were so lovely and everyone so happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Her nursing skills freed her from the family farm and gave her a
degree of economic independence still rare among women. Eager for
more adventure, she struck out for San Francisco to visit her
uncle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a graduate of a good school gave me prestige wherever I
wanted to go,'' she said later. ``They called me to the Children's
Hospital in San Francisco and I worked there for awhile. When I
thought it was time to return home (to Massachusetts), I tried to
get a job on the Dollar Line (cruise ship company) as far as New
York, but they said I would have to sign up for the trip around the
world. Sometimes I wish I had taken that cruise.''
</P>
<P>
   But by that time _ 1925 _ she was engaged to Wilson Smith, a
young shoe salesman who had grown up in the town next to hers. He
had served in the Navy on a submarine chaser during the war. They
married that year, when she was 32, relatively old for that era.
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother had two children _ the second, my father, when
she was 40. They lived first in Minneapolis and migrated in 1939 to
Seattle, where her husband sold shoes to Nordstrom and other stores
in his territory. Widowed in 1953, she moved to California in 1956
to be near her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   When my grandfather was alive, he was frequently on the road for
his work, so she lived a life not unlike a modern single mother,
filling many roles and fending for herself. It was a job the war
had taught her well.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, I was in awe of her. It seemed she could do
anything, from wiring a lamp to knitting a blanket. An accomplished
artist who painted and sculpted, she was always busy with her
hands.
</P>
<P>
   And her feminist leanings were not lost on me, her only
granddaughter, even at an early age.
</P>
<P>
   She used to tell me how she had run into two French officers on
cavalry horses at the beach. They let her ride but kept hold of her
reins, which wounded her pride. When one of them showed off by
riding up a steep sand dune and down the other side, she pulled her
horse free and rode up and down the same dune.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so angry,'' she would say, and laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Her legacy has been simple. She encouraged her children and five
grandchildren to follow our hearts, use our hands and speak our
minds.
</P>
<P>
   Today, when I ask her for advice, she always says the same
thing: ``Be yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Her quiet courage sustained us through the usual childhood woes
and deeper hurts as we got older.
</P>
<P>
   When she learned that my son _ her first great-grandchild _ was
deaf, she gamely picked up sign language in her 90s. Though her
gnarled, arthritic hands could barely shape the signs, they
communicated her love nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   When he died at age 7, her strength comforted me. She knew there
is the possibility of joy after such sorrow. The war had taught her
that.
</P>
<P>
   The war left other traces on her life as well.
</P>
<P>
   She went to the battlefields two years before women got the
vote. When she returned, she voted in every election until she was
103.
</P>
<P>
   Her patriotism, while not showy, ran deep. She would have
members of the military over for dinner on holidays and she always
put out the flag.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most enduring mark of my grandmother's
experience in WWI has been her lifelong recoil at the mention of
war.
</P>
<P>
   The few times she heard dinner-table talk of war or battlefield
exploits, she quickly stopped it.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, when I told her I was writing this article, she
was quiet for awhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wars are so unnecessary,'' she said finally.
</P>
<P>
   I realized, then, that although she has seldom spoken of it, the
war had spoken through her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen it,'' she would say when war talk came up. ``That's
why I'm a pacifist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there.''

WATERS GOES GENIAL IN OFF-THE-WALL `PECKER' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REGINA HACKETT  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Waters is going soft. His latest comedy is the not-so-black
``Pecker,'' a homage to Waters' hometown of Baltimore and a sweet
little satire of the New York art world.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Furlong, who starred as the kid in danger in ``Terminator
2 _ Judgment Day,'' brings a loopy grace to the title role, playing
a compulsive photographer who's called Pecker because he pecks at
his food. Eating isn't his thing. He'd rather watch and record.
Everywhere he goes he snaps pictures.
</P>
<P>
   What fascinates him? His family and hometown. His mother (Mary
Kay Place) runs a clothing store for the homeless: ``We know how to
make a dollar hollar.'' His dimwitted dad (Mark Joy) runs a bar and
his grandmother (Jean Schertler) sells pit beef sandwiches from a
stand in front of the family home and talks to her statue of the
Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Grandma makes Mary's rubbery mouth move, but instead of the
traditional ``full of grace,'' Grandma has her say, ``full of
grease,'' which is more in keeping with Grandma's line of work.
</P>
<P>
   Pecker's girlfriend Shelley (Christina Ricci) runs a notably
strict laundromat and his best friend Matt (Brendan Sexton III)
shoplifts for a living. Add his big sister Tina (Martha Plimpton),
who hosts a gay strip bar, and his little sister Chrissy (Lauren
Hulsey), the sugar addict, and Waters has a scene that makes the
blighted version of L.A. in Quentin Tarantino's ``Jackie Brown''
look decidedly upscale.
</P>
<P>
   And yet everybody here gets along. Nobody's mad, nobody's
wasting his life, abusing illegal substances, mulling over his
problems or aspiring to greater things. It's one big happy family,
until Pecker's pics hit the big time. New York art dealer Rorey
(Lili Taylor) sees his stuff, loves it and makes him a star.
</P>
<P>
   In loving him, New York patronizes him and unsettles not only
his life but the lives of everybody around him.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the movie's been fun to watch, but predictable. Now
Waters hits his stride, turning the cultural tables in a fun and
inventive way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pecker'' sounds no depths, offers few real insights in art but
creates a happy glow of a good time, full of zinging one-liners and
credible camera work. It isn't Waters at his best, but Waters at
his most relaxed and genial. And the actors are terrific,
especially the deadpan Ricci and darling boy Furlong as Pecker.
</P>
<P>
   Pecker. Directed and written by John Waters. Cast: Edward
Furlong, Christina Ricci, Martha Plimpton, Lili Taylor. Fine Line

`URBAN LEGEND'S' HUMOR JUST DOESN'T CUT IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We all know an urban legend: there's the one about the famous
actor who did something gross with a gerbil; or about the
babysitter who, after being beleagured by frightening phone calls,
discovers the stalker is upstairs in the house.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of using modern, weird tales as the basis for a horror
film must have sounded intriguing on paper and, for the first half
hour or so, ``Urban Legend'' has some potential.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it quickly erodes into a mean-spirited,
ridiculous and sadistic gore-fest that includes a scene with a dog
and a microwave.
</P>
<P>
   True, horror is hip at the box office. Witness the success of
``Scream'' and its sequel and the recent ``Halloween: H2O.'' But
``Urban Legend,'' which actually features a better-than-average
cast, is dull-witted by comparison. It makes a stab at humor but
doesn't cut it. The only amusing character is Loretta Devine, who
plays a campus cop named Reese who practices gunplay while watching
a video of Pam Grier in ``Foxy Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone has lost more than their mind at the peaceful,
gable-and-stone New Hampshire-based Pendleton College campus. A
young coed has just lost her head _ literally _ in a murder that
bears a striking resemblance to an urban legend. Soon the peace and
serenity of the school known as ``the safest in the country'' is
shattered as students and faculty alike begin dying in mysterious
ways based on all kinds of modern myths.
</P>
<P>
   It's up to a young journalism student, Paul (Jared Leto), and
Natalie (Alicia Witt), for whom the killings have become perilously
personal, to discover the reason for the serial murders and the
identity of a killer who has a very sick sense of ``moral
admonition.'' They're aided by Professor Wexler (Robert Englund),
who teaches a class on American Folklore and who is the only
survivor of the Stanley Hall Massacre, a black spot in the school's
stellar history.
</P>
<P>
   Leto and Witt, who are both capable, likeable actors, are wasted
in this outing. The 24-year-old scriptwriter, Silvio Horta, and
director Jamie Blanks give them very little to do except stand
around and look worried and perplexed while they utter some
dreadfully bad lines.
</P>
<P>
   At least supporting actors Devine, Rebecca Gayheart and Joshua
Jackson understand they're not exactly making high art and camp it
up wildly, adding a little spice. But the film itself is eminently
forgettable.
</P>
<P>
   Urban Legend. Directed by Jamie Blanks. Written by Silvio Horta.
Cast: Jared Leto, Alicia Witt, Rebecca Gayheart, Natasha Gregson
Wagner. TriStar Pictures. 100 minutes. Rated R for graphic
violence, language.

`A SOLDIER'S DAUGHTER' IS THE ANTITHESIS OF `MOMMIE DEAREST' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For most of his writing career, James Jones suffered from having
his work compared unfavorably to his landmark first novel, ``From
Here to Eternity.'' Esquire Magazine once even made the morbid case
(``James Jones and the Critics'') that he was possibly the most
critically lambasted American novelist of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   But he's definitely getting the last laugh. His critical
reputation has steadily grown since his 1977 death until he's now
almost universally considered the greatest novelist of the World
War II generation. More recently _ thanks largely to Terrence
Malick's upcoming film version of Jones' 1962 novel, ``The Thin Red
Line'' _ he's once again the hottest writer in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a half-dozen biographies and memoirs that have
appeared in the last 20 years have all made the case that Jones was
that rarity in American letters: a successful novelist who was also
a successful human being. As gifted as he was as a novelist, he was
even better at being a father, husband and friend.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, this unique American success story is not going to be
tarnished by ``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries,'' the
Merchant-Ivory film version of a family memoir written by Jones'
daughter, Kaylie. As a portrait of the artist as a parent, it's the
very antithesis of ``Mommie Dearest'' and the whole
celebrity-parent bashing genre.
</P>
<P>
   The film is also more than just a valentine to Jones' parenting
skills. It's an unusually rich, unconventional and highly original
coming-of-age-in-the-'70s drama, and a bittersweet meditation on
the expatriate life. Frame-for-frame, it's the most totally
satisfying Merchant-Ivory production since ``A Room With a View.''
</P>
<P>
   The script, by James Ivory and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, is divided
into three segments, and opens in the late '60s as the Jones family
_ father (Kris Kristofferson), mother (Barbara Hershey) and young
daughter (Luisa Conlon) _ have left America to live more or less
permanently in a luxury apartment on Paris' fashionable Ille St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The first segment deals mostly with the James and Gloria Jones'
adoption of a French orphan boy: opening with the young mother's
decision to give up her son, his conflict with his slightly jealous
new sister, his difficulties adjusting to his posh new school, and
his gradual bonding with the American family.
</P>
<P>
   The second section follows the daughter, now a teenager (Leelee
Sobieski), through her early adolescence, concentrating on her
problems being an American in a French school, and her relationship
with her best friend and soulmate: an effeminate, illegitimate boy
(Anthony Roth Costanzo) who aspires to be an opera singer.
</P>
<P>
   The third section chronicles the family's decision to return to
their native land in the early '70s, the two teenagers' shaky
adjustment to suburban American life, the death of the
author-father from a congenital heart problem, and the impact this
incomparable loss has on each surviving member of the family.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, this could be the most authentic film biography
ever made of a famous writer. Nothing seems to have been invented,
scenes were filmed in and around the actual Jones apartment on the
Quai d'Orleans, and _ though there's not much physical resemblance
_ the performances of Kristofferson and Hershey could hardly be
more authentic.
</P>
<P>
   But Kaylie Jones wrote her family story as a novel, she changed
the characters names (from Jones to Willis), and she really doesn't
go into any of the famous particulars of Jones' literary life. The
film maintains the limited point-of-view of the daughter character
throughout, and claims the protection of fiction.
</P>
<P>
   And its real power comes less from biographical accuracy than in
its poignant universality as a family drama. Even without the Jones
connection, the film comes off as a splendid collection of
vignettes tracing the childhood of a young American girl in an
alien, often hostile, always magical Paris of the '60s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly effective are the scenes tracing the young
heroine's difficult sexual awakening _ including a pre-adolescent,
quasi-rape by a young neighbor boy that is boldly, yet sensitively,
handled _ and her growing awareness of her famous, rather gruff
father's total, unquestioning love and acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, and in its own unique way, ``A Soldier's Daughter''
is wonderfully reminiscent of the 1962 ``To Kill a Mockingbird.''
Like that classic film, it's about the power of a successful
father-daughter relationship, and it's a celebration of an
unorthodox but completely functional family unit.
</P>
<P>
   A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries. Directed by James Ivory.
Screenplay by Ivory and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala. Cast: Kris
Kristofferson, Barbara Hershey, Leelee Sobieski, Jane Birkin.
October Films. 124 minutes. Rated R for mature themes.

`RONIN' IS OLD-FASHIONED FARE IN THE SPIRIT OF `BULLITT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you find yourself nostalgic for an old-fashioned,
no-holds-barred car chase _ on the scale of those signature moments
of 1968's ``Bullitt'' and 1971's ``The French Connection'' _ then
John Frankenheimer's ``Ronin'' is your movie.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the director promised ``the granddaddy of all
car chases'' and he's delivered the goods _ not just one, but two
lavishly suicidal crunch-a-thons: one through the narrow streets of
the Parisian Left Bank, the other along the broad corniches of the
French Riviera.
</P>
<P>
   And the movie itself makes an entertaining thriller, though _ as
always with Frankenheimer, the director of such classics as ``The
Manchurian Candidate'' and ``The Train'' _ it has an off-beat and
enigmatic edge that could frustrate anyone expecting a more
traditional action movie.
</P>
<P>
   The story is about a band of mercenaries recruited in Paris by a
pretty Irish terrorist (Natascha McElhone) for a particularly
difficult caper: the snatching of a valuable, highly protected
suitcase of undisclosed contents in the south of France.
</P>
<P>
   The men are all ex-intelligence agents from various countries
who have been put out of work by the end of the Cold War (``like
ronin samurai without a liege lord,'' one of them explains): an
American (Robert De Niro), a Frenchman (Jean Reno), a Brit (Sean
Bean) and a Russian (Skellan Skarsgard).
</P>
<P>
   It's an art house cast and, at times, it seems like an art house
movie. The various characters' foreign accents _ especially those
of McElhone and Bean _ are so hard to follow they need subtitles,
and it's easy to get lost in the bewildering array of
double-crosses and double-double crosses that drive the plot.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other time in his 40-year career, Frankenheimer's
design seems to be to subordinate everything in his film _
character, story, dialogue, humor _ to his fast-paced style and
disjointed, existential mood. In a way, it's quite demanding, and
it often helps to just turn off the mind and go with the
exhilarating flow.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, everyone and everything do eventually add up and make
sense, and the film ultimately pays off with considerably more
story satisfaction than we usually get in big-budget Hollywood
action spectaculars. All told, ``Ronin'' is a clever piece of
visual story-telling.
</P>
<P>
   It does, however, invite criticism for one bizarre moment: the
unmistakable recreation (in the midst of its second chase sequence)
of the pursuit of Princess Di through the Seine tunnel one year
ago, with the exact same flip-over crash against the tunnel wall.
What is this? A bad-taste in-joke? A ghoulish anniversary tribute?
</P>
<P>
   Ronin. Directed by John Frankenheimer. Screenplay by J.D. Zeik
and Richard Weisz. Cast: Robert De Niro, Jean Reno, Natascha
McElhone, Stellan Skarsgard, Sean Bean. United Artists. 118
minutes. Rated R for violence.

NEW STUDY SAYS MARIJUANA IS EFFECTIVE PAIN KILLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A circuit in the brain stem that is switched on
and off by the active ingredient in marijuana is the latest
scientific evidence pointing to the drug's ability to kill pain,
according to a study published Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The substance, a synthetic form of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol),
has an effect similar to morphine in an area at the base of the
skull that is known to block pain impulses.
</P>
<P>
   Importantly, researchers at the University of California at San
Francisco found that the substance used a different mechanism to
trigger the blockage, suggesting that marijuana-like drugs might be
developed as effective painkillers without the unwanted side
effects of opiates.
</P>
<P>
   The area of the brain where the substance is active is known to
block pain messages in extremely stressful situations like war, in
which people have reported not feeling pain despite catastrophic
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature,
comes in the midst of continuing debate over the therapeutic use of
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Five states and the District of Columbia have initiatives on the
November ballot similar to California's Proposition 215, which
allows seriously ill patients to grow and use marijuana for pain
relief, with a doctor's recommendation, without being prosecuted
under state law.
</P>
<P>
   Marijuana also is receiving more attention from scientists. The
California study is one of several that have demonstrated
painkilling properties of cannabinoids, the substances that are the
major active ingredient in marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a hot field right now,'' said Ian Meng, author
of the study reported in Nature. ``There is a breakthrough every
month, it seems.''
</P>
<P>
   In Meng's experiments, a synthetic cannabinoid was given to two
sets of laboratory rats, one in which the region of the brain stem
involved in pain blockage was normal, and one group in which it was
deactivated.
</P>
<P>
   The rats with the deactivated brain region showed no difference
in their response to pain from rats without the drug. But those who
had normal brain stems took longer to respond to a painful stimulus
after receiving the cannabinoid.
</P>
<P>
   The results show that the cannabinoids are working directly at
that site, which is also where morphine works. The experiments also
worked when Meng gave the rats a drug that blocks the action of
morphine, indicating the pathways used by the two drugs are
different.
</P>
<P>
   Morphine, which is highly addictive, can be fatal in high doses
by depressing a patient's breathing and inducing nausea. Cannabis,
on the other hand, has been shown to stimulate appetite and is much
less addictive.

`CLAY PIGEONS' IS INCORRIGIBLY MEDIOCRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an interview last month, director Gus Van Zant said he cast
Vince Vaughn for the Norman Bates role in his upcoming remake of
Hitchcock's ``Psycho'' because he wanted ``someone who would take
you off guard'' _ an actor you wouldn't expect to be a serial
murderer.
</P>
<P>
   But it now looks as if Vaughn could be typecast in that role
before the film's December release. Because in ``Clay Pigeons,'' he
plays a vicious murderer of helpless women in a story that seems to
be inspired, ironically enough, by Hitchcock's ``Strangers On a
Train.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's not exactly an auspicious matching of actor and role,
either. In fact, he gives a fairly hammy performance in what is an
incorrigibly mediocre movie. If his ``Psycho'' turn isn't quite a
few notches above this one, Anthony Perkins can continue to rest in
peace.
</P>
<P>
   The film is about a smalltown Montana auto mechanic named Clay
(Joaquin Phoenix), whose best friend (Gregory Sporleder) _
devastated by his discovery that Clay is having an affair with his
wife _ kills himself in the opening scene and makes it appear that
Clay is the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   When the wife (Georgina Cates) starts to sexually blackmail him,
she in turn is murdered by an affable stranger named Lester
(Vaughn) who _ as in Hitchcock's ``Strangers'' _ commits the murder
to ingratiate himself with the hero, expecting friendship, approval
and reciprocation.
</P>
<P>
   Out of this situation, first-time director David Dobkin tries to
construct a typical Hitchcockian drama that gets more ironic and
darkly humorous as the innocent hero struggles desperately to get
out of his mess, and only looks more and more guilty to the world.
</P>
<P>
   But the film somehow manages to lose its way in the first act,
and never recovers. Indeed, it's so incompetent that it plays its
big dramatic scene _ Phoenix, locked up in jail and thus
agonizingly unable to prevent Vaughn from murdering a young girl _
in a cell with bars set so wide apart that Orson Welles would slip
through them!
</P>
<P>
   The cast has a few bright spots _ the usual good work from Scott
Wilson and Georgina Cates. But the two leads are weak: Phoenix
simply looks too malevolent to be very credible as a wronged
innocent, and Vaughn is at a loss to find that element which made
all the great Hitchcock villains come alive _ a point of sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Clay Pigeons. Directed by David Dobkin. Written by Matt Healy.
Cast: Joaquin Phoenix, Vince Vaughn, Georgina Cates, Scott Wilson,
Janeane Garofalo. Gramercy. 104 minutes. Rated R for violence and
sex scenes.

<TEXT>
<P>
   (begin italics) ``Do I look bad?'' the soldier pleads.
</P>
<P>
   Half his face is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Frost hurriedly dresses the raw shreds that remain. There
are still men moaning on gurneys in the rain outside the operating
tent.
</P>
<P>
   Her hands shake from the chilling damp that seeps through the
canvas walls. Her thin leather boots are coated with mud. Blood is
smeared across her nurse's uniform.
</P>
<P>
   She tries to block out the sound of limbs dropping into enamel
pails as surgeons saw through mangled flesh and bones.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment she presses her hand against her eyes. Sometimes
the men in their misery make her cry.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   Eighty years later her hand still goes to her eyes when she
recalls that scene.
</P>
<P>
   At 105, Laura Frost Smith travels easily in her mind to 1918 and
the Western Front, a war zone that separated her from her youth.
</P>
<P>
   Today she is one of the oldest known living American veterans of
World War I, a war that marked the first time women officially
served in the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
   She is also my grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   I had mixed emotions on learning of this latest milestone in my
grandmother's life.
</P>
<P>
   Her other accomplishments are more dear to me _ the lemon cake
she baked when I was a child, the parade of hand-knit socks and
mittens for Christmas, her skilled watercolors, prized garden and
the stories she told of growing up on a farm near Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The war was almost never mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Her military service was such a small sliver of her life. Like a
single tree ring lost in the dense coil that holds a life together,
it hardly seemed significant as I was growing up.
</P>
<P>
   I could barely remember the contours of the war drawn in history
classes, let alone picture my grandmother serving at five of its
bloodiest fronts. To me they were just names printed on tiny brass
bars and clasped to the ribbon of the Victory Medal in a glass box
on her wall.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the women who served in the Great War are gone now.
Ignored when they came home and forgotten by subsequent
generations, most never had a chance to tell their stories.
</P>
<P>
   So I went in search of this part of my grandmother's life. I
visited her earlier this month at the Meadows care center in Los
Gatos, Calif., where she lives now. For three days we sat together
in the sun beside a lemon tree, while I looked for pathways through
her memory that would take me with her to that place and time.
</P>
<P>
   She is still beautiful, and though her eyesight and hearing are
failing, there are still flashes of her keen mind and wicked sense
of humor. She remembers.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't where I found the pieces I was looking for.
</P>
<P>
   I went back, instead, to the letters she sent home from the war,
and to a family memoir she wrote in her 90s.
</P>
<P>
   There, in her own words, I found a young woman I never knew, a
woman who went off to see the world, and in the process helped
change it.
</P>
<P>
   Her year at war not only shaped her life in ways I had never
understood, it had also helped shape mine.
</P>
<P>
   Give me girls
</P>
<P>
   Laura Frost was an unconventional woman even before she went to
war.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1893, she grew up on a small farm in East Taunton, Mass.
Her father, George, grew vegetables that her mother made into
pickles they sold in town.
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother, the youngest of three daughters, was given the
middle name ``Georgina,'' for the son her parents didn't have, and
she learned to work the land accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   She went to a one-room school where boys and girls had separate
entrances, but there was no such division of labor at home. ``Give
me girls every time,'' her father would tell her years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister and I proved to him we could do our share working
the farm,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So it seemed natural to do her share when the call went out for
volunteers to fight the war that had been raging across Europe
since 1914. Her graduation from nursing school nearly coincided
with the U.S. declaration of war on the Germans on April 6, 1917.
</P>
<P>
   Her training hospital, working with the Red Cross, organized
military Base 44. ``Most of my class signed up for it,'' she wrote
in her memoir. She was sworn in on Feb. 15, 1918, and sent to Fort
Oglethorpe, Ga., for training.
</P>
<P>
   She went to war for adventure. She had no idea how much her life
was about to change.
</P>
<P>
   When she signed up, women couldn't vote and men were deeply
suspicious of those who were educated. According to scientists of
the day, women's smaller brains were not equipped for higher
education, and too much thinking was believed to impair their
childbearing capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Only five years earlier, the sinking of the Titanic and the cry
of ``women and children first'' had inflamed arguments about female
roles in society. To traditionalists, the Titanic proved that women
belonged to a special class, one requiring protection by _ not
equality with _ men.
</P>
<P>
   That left no room for women on the battlefield. But some women
saw it differently.
</P>
<P>
   When the United States entered the war, there were 403 Army
nurses on active duty. By Armistice Day, 19 months later, more than
21,000 had enlisted and about 10,000 had seen duty overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Such a good time
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of the country, my grandmother entered the war
with high spirits and a certain innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know I have never had such a good time in my life as I
have had this last two weeks,'' she wrote from training camp on
March 4, 1918. ``One thing I have learned already _ and had to if I
was to live at all _ that is to dance. Can you imagine fox-trotting
and waltzing with majors and captains?''
</P>
<P>
   She was soon swept up in her first real romance _ a love affair
with a dashing first lieutenant. Pete Herzog wooed her with
dinners, dancing and shows _ heady experiences for a tomboy whose
social life had centered mostly on the annual clambake at her tiny
church or the occasional ride in a horse-drawn sleigh.
</P>
<P>
   In letters home, she referred often to her lieutenant. He taught
her military marching maneuvers and stood at attention as she
passed by in her first parade. Before they left for Europe, he gave
her a diamond service pin as a pledge of love, and she promised to
write him through the war.
</P>
<P>
   Though the romance thrilled her, she never lost sight of her
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Assigned to the psychiatric ward at training camp, she
encountered a shellshocked patient sent home from battle: ``The
first day I went into the ward after lunch, I found everyone
cringing into corners or under their beds. A young fellow was
brandishing a straight razor. I didn't know what was happening but
went right up to him and yelled: `Give me that!' He smiled and
handed me the open razor.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger of battle, however, still felt a long way off, and in
some ways the war seemed like a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so happy to think that we are at last on the way,'' she
wrote from training camp. ``. . . We'll soon have the Huns on the
run and be home in no time.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were signs that fantasies of war were about to end.
</P>
<P>
   One day a friend asked her to go horseback riding. She accepted,
but at the last minute changed her plans and asked a fellow nurse
to take her place.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was so pleased to think that she was going for a ride, and
in five minutes she was thrown and died three hours later,'' my
grandmother wrote home.
</P>
<P>
   Sobered by the death, the nurses marched behind her hearse in a
military funeral. ``I never realized what taps meant before, until
they sounded for her at the station,'' she wrote. ``None of us have
very much pep since it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 17, 1918, the base hospital moved by train from Georgia
to New York to prepare for the trip to France.
</P>
<P>
   The timing meant the nurses would get to march 60 blocks in New
York City's Fourth of July parade. It would be one of the first
times American military women had ever marched alongside men. It
would also provide her first glimpse of how the rest of the country
viewed women in the Army.
</P>
<P>
   On July 6, 1918, she wrote: ``It really was a wonderful parade.
... They didn't say much about the nurses in it. We thought we were
the whole show. They just said 400 (women) marched and there were
at least 1,400. It is funny, because a paper usually exaggerates so
much.''
</P>
<P>
   It made her feel important to march then, she said during my
recent visit. The irony is not lost on her, even all these years
later.
</P>
<P>
   When she came home after the war, people would barely notice.
</P>
<P>
   Over there
</P>
<P>
   On July 14, 1918, she sailed on the troop ship Northland for the
18-day trip to Liverpool and then Le Havre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never knew how many ships were in our convoy, but I guessed
about 18,'' she wrote in her memoir. ``That month, about 300,000
troops went over. We were told to throw nothing overboard, as any
floating objects would reveal our course to any lurking
submarine.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucked in her small Army trunk was a box camera and developing
fluid _ despite warnings they were not to take pictures.
</P>
<P>
   By Aug. 4, she had left Paris and was on duty in Evacuation No.
7, a field hospital in the VO Surg District in France.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it hadn't been the amputation ward, maybe the shock
wouldn't have been so devastating,'' she wrote. ``But helping dress
those quivering stumps and hearing the laughter and jokes in spite
of their misfortune was too much for me and I cried all that first
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they had made a mistake by putting us through that
experience so soon, but maybe it was for the good and I could stand
anything after that miserable week.''
</P>
<P>
   The nurses sent closest to the front were equipped with a
helmet, gas mask, mess kit and canteen. She was one of them.
</P>
<P>
   They headed straight into the horror of the first ``modern''
war. Poison gas, aerial bombardments and machine guns were being
used for the first time. In four years of madness, more than 65
million men would go to war. Many were slaughtered in the bellies
of trenches that gashed the length of France.
</P>
<P>
   The terrorist bullet that took the life of Archduke Franz
Ferdinand ended up gutting a generation. The casualties _ more than
8 million by war's end _ left a deep scar across several
continents.
</P>
<P>
   Mud and blood
</P>
<P>
   Mobile hospitals at the front worked frantically to save what
was left of men's bodies as they came in. But the damage was
frequently too great. Double amputations were common.
</P>
<P>
   Many died on the operating tables. Sometimes they arrived on
stretchers, scared yet hopeful, their young faces untouched. But
when their uniforms were cut away, they would be nearly shot in
two. Nurses could do nothing but hold their hands as they died.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the women spoke of their experiences, even decades later,
silenced as much by trauma as social norms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was too sad,'' my grandmother said during my recent visit.
``So many hurt boys. Seeing the stumps and their bones . . .'' She
could not finish.
</P>
<P>
   From her original hospital, my grandmother was dispatched closer
to the front. She went with Evac 5 to what had been a town on the
River Marne. The unit, totaling about 1,000 beds, received
casualties directly from the trenches. Each operating tent had 10
surgery tables in use around the clock. At full capacity, the
hospital had about 48 nurses, each handling 20 patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the wounded began to come in, the stretchers were laid on
the ground and the corpsmen stripped them of their muddy clothes
and deloused them, usually before we received them in the operating
tent,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The most seriously wounded were operated on right away, and
those who could stand the journey were evacuated to base hospitals
farther from the front.
</P>
<P>
   The nurses worked under primitive conditions, layering men's
socks and underwear under their uniforms for warmth, sleeping on
the ground or cots in their tents, sometimes subsisting on little
more than beans and hardtack. They worked eight hours on and eight
hours off, around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the afternoon off today for the first time,'' she wrote
home. ``With so much time on my hands I didn't know what to do so I
slept till supper time. Then tonight we went out to get water in
our canteens and took a little walk. . . . The moon looked so
pretty tonight shining on the ruins.''
</P>
<P>
   During the bitter-cold fall of 1918, rain drilled down
relentlessly. They pitched their camps in fields filled with
viscous, sucking mud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing we have to contend with is the mud,'' she
wrote home. ``The blankets on the cots hang over into it and then
they get all wet and so dirty you dread to put them on the patient.
Then the pillows and cots get wet through the tent. Believe me,
it's some mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight decades later, it isn't hard for her to remember what was
different from what she had expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mud,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the blood.''
</P>
<P>
   A long, long trail
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in their training had prepared them for the kind of
nursing they would have to do.
</P>
<P>
   The patients, especially the brain injuries, made them
heartsick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Margaret and I became very fond of one of our patients and
kept him several days, trying to get him to talk,'' she wrote. ``He
was only about 18 years old and had a bullet hole right in the
middle of his forehead. All he could say was `glass,' but he wasn't
paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he wanted something, we would keep asking him until we
hit the right thing and he would nod his head. One day Margaret
sang `Over There' to him, and he followed along saying all the
words. That was a great day for us. When he was evacuated, we went
to the train with him and sat by his litter until the train pulled
out.''
</P>
<P>
   They taught another brain-damaged patient to say, ``Good night,
nurse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He says, `Good night' for everything he wants,'' she wrote.
``They were singing to him yesterday and he joined in and said
`long, long trail' quite plainly. I couldn't stay to hear any more,
for it is going to be a long, long trail for him. We had quite a
time tonight trying to find out what he wanted and would you
believe it was a cigarette?''
</P>
<P>
   Shattered brains, bullet holes and severed limbs weren't the
only wounds they saw. The use of poisonous gases _ mustard gas,
chlorine, phosgene and other toxic aerosols _ increased toward the
war's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Germans were getting desperate now and used more and more
mustard gas,'' she wrote. ``Our casualties were 20 and 30 percent
gassed. It made huge blisters on them and they suffered painfully.
Even though they were cleaned, I sometimes got a whiff of the
miserable stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   For nurses, flu was even more deadly. More than 400 died in the
line of duty, most from Spanish influenza, a virulent strain that
swept the world in 1918 and 1919, killing 21 million.
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother fell sick with the flu immediately after the
Meuse-Argonne Offensive, one of the war's decisive battles.
</P>
<P>
   She spent several days in a coma. ``I came to one day and found
myself in a regular hospital bed in a little tent all by myself,''
she wrote. ``I hadn't seen a bed before, as all our patients were
put on army cots when they came in and that's what we slept on,
too. The head nurse took care of me and I'm sure she saved my
life.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   A different front
</P>
<P>
   The nurses coped with wrenching wounds and death, filth and the
flu, the threat of shells and poison gas. But they were also
fighting a battle on a different front.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving a letter from home with news that her town was
displaying a flag for the nurses, she wrote: ``I'm glad someone
appreciates the nurses. The patients are the only ones here that
do. ... We just have to fight for our very existence here.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, when the Army passed out tickets to receive donated
Christmas packages from America, they skipped the nurses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry about our Christmas, no one over here worries
about us, so why should you?'' she wrote her mother and father.
``We weren't given any cards or tickets or anything else, so we are
just out of luck. `S.O.L.' they say in the army. When I get back,
you won't understand my language, not because it is French or
German either.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their difficulties, the nurses found ways to endure, and
even raise their spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we were invited to dances,'' she wrote. ``The
English and French could go home for rest, but it was too far for
the Americans, so recreation was planned in plays and dances.''
</P>
<P>
   Humor helped them survive.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, they were loaded onto trains for transport.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (nurses) were fortunate to have a toilet on board, but the
men stopped along the way at different sidings,'' she wrote. ``One
of our nice doctors was caught with his pants down when the train
started up unexpectedly. He really got an ovation from the crowd as
he scrambled aboard clutching his clothes. We made fun out of every
little incident and were hilarious at times.''
</P>
<P>
   Letters helped, too _ especially from her lieutenant friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had a letter from Pete,'' she wrote home. ``He may be in the
next town for all I know. He censors his own mail but is a very
good soldier and wouldn't say a thing that wasn't right. Some
people at home think that your mail coming this way is opened, but
it isn't ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``... Marg Cooper got a letter from one of the girls at the base
today. It surely must be a wonderful place, but we are satisfied
with this wild and woolly life until the snow flies at least. ...
Our tent is pitched on a kind of a hill and even though I have my
cot propped up, my head is usually lower than my feet, and
sometimes I wake up and find the bunk has sort of skidded during
the night and my head is outside, with the flap of the tent forming
a bib. Oh it's a great life if you don't weaken. . . . It may not
be quite as comfortable as the little bungalows (at the base
hospital) . . . but I like it fine.''
</P>
<P>
   And when there were no letters, they sang to keep their courage
up.
</P>
<P>
   After pitching tents near Ypres, she wrote: ``. . . The boys
found three pianos while they were searching the dugouts. They say
some of the dugouts the Germans had were carpeted. Last night they
brought one of the pianos back to camp and put it up in the Red
Cross hut. Someone was clever enough to tune it and a lot of the
boys can play, so we had quite a concert.''
</P>
<P>
   They sang all the songs written for the war, sometimes devising
their own lyrics. For one called ``The Rose of No Man's Land,''
they substituted the words: `` 'Neath the war's red curse stands
the Cross Red Nurse. She's the rose of no man's land.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Army now
</P>
<P>
   The lighter moments helped them keep their fear in check. They
relocated the tent hospitals frequently, often on 24 hours notice,
so they could go where casualties were heaviest. They would pack 12
nurses to an ambulance and space their vehicles miles apart, so
planes wouldn't detect their moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The devastation along our route was unbelievable,'' she wrote.
``Houses just a pile of rubble, dead cows in the fields, bloated
bodies of horses along the muddy roads where rats were scurrying
out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they were several miles from the front, they were still
at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We soon learned the sound of a German Fokker plane,'' she
wrote. ``It didn't have the same droning sound of the Allied ones
and we hardly waited for the sound of the alarm to take cover. . .
. It seemed cruel to leave the bed patients, but (it was)
reasonable that someone should be left to take care of them in case
the hospital was bombed.''
</P>
<P>
   On the troop ship over, she had written her parents: ``. . . Now
mother, imagine us having such good times and everyone at home
worrying their heads off about us. You know, Uncle Sam is pretty
clever and I am sure I have never been safer in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Four months later, any romantic illusions she'd harbored about
the war had disappeared, replaced by an appreciation for the
paradox and futility of battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one at home has the faintest idea how they are getting
killed (here),'' she wrote home. ``... I'm sure no one realizes the
suffering of the boys. It's their spirit that affects me. I can
watch them amputate a leg and dress a wound that is open from the
hip down, but when a boy tells you he is sorry he lost (his leg)
because it puts him out and he can't go back, well I have to walk
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Daily, the medical teams fixed up men to be shot to pieces
again. At the same time, in the same tents, they worked to save
enemy prisoners _ the same men Allied soldiers were trying
desperately to kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of my ward there were several wounded German
prisoners, young towheaded, blue-eyed boys,'' she wrote. ``A guard
stood over them with a .45. Having American and German patients
together brought home the fact of how stupid any war is.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other absurdities.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1918, blacks and whites were kept separate even when sick
in the hospital,'' she wrote in her memoir. ``White orderlies were
supposed to give the personal care to the men, but when one refused
to give an enema to a black man, I was so angry I put up a screen
and took care of the patient myself. He was very grateful and that
was the only time I was ever thanked for giving an enema.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman who had signed her early letters home ``From your
soldier girl,'' and gaily referred to being ``in the Army now,''
had hardened into a pragmatic realist and passionate pacifist. She
would become a lifelong believer in equal rights.
</P>
<P>
   Coming home
</P>
<P>
   If the war began a personal transformation that defined the rest
of her life, it also began a transformation of women in general
back home.
</P>
<P>
   After more than 50 years of pressure from suffragists, it was
the women who served in WWI who finally shamed the government into
taking action on the right to vote.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1919, less than a year after the war ended, the U.S.
Senate passed the 19th Amendment. Women marked ballots for the
first time in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   By breaking the military's gender barrier, the 33,000 women who
served in WWI spurred other social changes. By WWII, women
encountered fewer barriers to serving, and more than 10 times that
number signed up. At war's end, thousands of them took up work in
fields previously dominated by men.
</P>
<P>
   But my grandmother couldn't know back then _ just as the war was
ending _ how it would affect her life or her country. She was
simply excited to be coming home safely.
</P>
<P>
   ``About Nov. 7th, we began to hear rumors that the armistice was
being planned,'' she wrote in her memoir. ``We didn't believe it,
for we still heard the guns and the wounded were still coming in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, one day, the 11th of November, everything became
quiet about 11 a.m. and you wondered what was different. There
wasn't a sound, for there were no birds to sing, or no cows to moo.
We still couldn't believe it possible, as we had so many patients.
A group of French trumpeters came in the afternoon and played for
us, so that was the only celebration we had.''
</P>
<P>
   By the Armistice, her unit had treated 15,000 casualties.
</P>
<P>
   It would be six more months before she got orders to go home.
She continued to care for the wounded, but with the war over, she
also spent time in Paris, Monaco and the French Alps.
</P>
<P>
   Though the shelling had stopped, the war continued to wound in
unexpected ways.
</P>
<P>
   While on leave in Nice, my grandmother bumped into a friend of
the first lieutenant she'd fallen in love with during training
camp, the man whose letters she read and reread when she was off
duty. She was told her lieutenant would arrive in the same city the
next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``With great expectation, Margaret and I went to the train to
meet him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had lost weight and looked very tired and just gave a nod
of recognition when we greeted him. We all got in a taxi and he saw
that we got off at our hotel, then he went on to where the officers
were staying.''
</P>
<P>
   She later learned he had been gassed and wounded, and his best
friend had been blown apart beside him in a trench two days before
the Armistice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw him again, and sent the little service pin back to
him by a messenger.''
</P>
<P>
   But heartache couldn't dampen her excitement at going home. On
May 31, 1919, she boarded the Cape Finesterre bound for America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming into New York harbor was an unforgettable event,'' she
wrote. ``Tugboats and fireboats came out to meet us and in my
exuberance, I flung my blue straw hat right at the Statue of
Liberty. Bands were playing and toilet paper was strung all over
the ship like confetti on a happy cruise ship.''
</P>
<P>
   She didn't know then that the celebration would be short-lived,
that she was returning to a country not ready to hear her stories
or those of the other women who served.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saying goodbye to all the friends we had made in the service
was very sobering,'' she wrote. ``On the train and the streetcar
home, I never felt so depressed and forlorn in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Though dressed in full uniform ``no one knew or noticed I was a
returning veteran.''
</P>
<P>
   Many years later, she said she knew how Vietnam veterans felt
when they they came home.
</P>
<P>
   After the war
</P>
<P>
   The war was rarely mentioned after her return.
</P>
<P>
   Though many of the nurses' experiences were more dramatic than
those of their husbands, boyfriends or brothers, they didn't talk
for fear of embarrassing the men. Social pressures against women
doing ``men's work'' also enforced their silence.
</P>
<P>
   But the war's imprint remained. It would influence my
grandmother's outlooks and actions for the rest of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Sick of the carnage of battle, she turned to obstetrical
nursing. ``I decided I had worked long enough with men,'' she
wrote. ``It was very pleasing and satisfactory work. The babies
were so lovely and everyone so happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Her nursing skills freed her from the family farm and gave her a
degree of economic independence still rare among women. Eager for
more adventure, she struck out for San Francisco to visit her
uncle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a graduate of a good school gave me prestige wherever I
wanted to go,'' she said later. ``They called me to the Children's
Hospital in San Francisco and I worked there for awhile. When I
thought it was time to return home (to Massachusetts), I tried to
get a job on the Dollar Line (cruise ship company) as far as New
York, but they said I would have to sign up for the trip around the
world. Sometimes I wish I had taken that cruise.''
</P>
<P>
   But by that time _ 1925 _ she was engaged to Wilson Smith, a
young shoe salesman who had grown up in the town next to hers. He
had served in the Navy on a submarine chaser during the war. They
married that year, when she was 32, relatively old for that era.
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother had two children _ the second, my father, when
she was 40. They lived first in Minneapolis and migrated in 1939 to
Seattle, where her husband sold shoes to Nordstrom and other stores
in his territory. Widowed in 1953, she moved to California in 1956
to be near her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   When my grandfather was alive, he was frequently on the road for
his work, so she lived a life not unlike a modern single mother,
filling many roles and fending for herself. It was a job the war
had taught her well.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, I was in awe of her. It seemed she could do
anything, from wiring a lamp to knitting a blanket. An accomplished
artist who painted and sculpted, she was always busy with her
hands.
</P>
<P>
   And her feminist leanings were not lost on me, her only
granddaughter, even at an early age.
</P>
<P>
   She used to tell me how she had run into two French officers on
cavalry horses at the beach. They let her ride but kept hold of her
reins, which wounded her pride. When one of them showed off by
riding up a steep sand dune and down the other side, she pulled her
horse free and rode up and down the same dune.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so angry,'' she would say, and laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Her legacy has been simple. She encouraged her children and five
grandchildren to follow our hearts, use our hands and speak our
minds.
</P>
<P>
   Today, when I ask her for advice, she always says the same
thing: ``Be yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Her quiet courage sustained us through the usual childhood woes
and deeper hurts as we got older.
</P>
<P>
   When she learned that my son _ her first great-grandchild _ was
deaf, she gamely picked up sign language in her 90s. Though her
gnarled, arthritic hands could barely shape the signs, they
communicated her love nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   When he died at age 7, her strength comforted me. She knew there
is the possibility of joy after such sorrow. The war had taught her
that.
</P>
<P>
   The war left other traces on her life as well.
</P>
<P>
   She went to the battlefields two years before women got the
vote. When she returned, she voted in every election until she was
103.
</P>
<P>
   Her patriotism, while not showy, ran deep. She would have
members of the military over for dinner on holidays and she always
put out the flag.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most enduring mark of my grandmother's
experience in WWI has been her lifelong recoil at the mention of
war.
</P>
<P>
   The few times she heard dinner-table talk of war or battlefield
exploits, she quickly stopped it.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, when I told her I was writing this article, she
was quiet for awhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wars are so unnecessary,'' she said finally.
</P>
<P>
   I realized, then, that although she has seldom spoken of it, the
war had spoken through her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen it,'' she would say when war talk came up. ``That's
why I'm a pacifist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there.''

OPTIONS FOR REMOTE E-MAIL AND LAPTOP SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
  By STEPHEN C. MILLER 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a previous column a reader wanted to know how to get his
e-mail during an extended stay in Finland. While the suggestions I
made will work, a number of readers suggested additional options.
</P>
<P>
   I suggested having his current Internet service provider (ISP)
forward his mail to the local Finnish ISP. A lot of readers pointed
out that it was not necessary. One reader even said his ISP told
him it would not forward his mail when he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The one option most often mentioned was to set different
incoming and outgoing e-mail servers via one's e-mail reader. This
works for a majority of e-mail users if your software supports it.
Check with your two ISP's for the correct information to make it
work. And check your e-mail program's documentation on how to enter
the correct information. Not every one, however, has software to
support it. Lots of users have older e-mail readers that may not
support multiple accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Another suggestion was to Telnet from the alternative ISP.
Telneting is not difficult, but, depending on the type of server
and your Telnet software, it can involve some arcane Unix commands.
For the Telnet-savvy, it is especially useful if you are traveling
sans laptop and need to access your e-mail from someone else's
system.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Security in Carrying Cases &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Port Inc., has a new carrying case that protects your laptop not
only from damage but also from theft. The company has integrated
its Defcon 1 security system into a bag. It has been dubbed the
Defcon 3. It operates with a remote control similar to the one that
is popular with car alarm systems. When you arm the system, anyone
who picks up the bag will cause a loud alarm to sound. If you
forget to arm it and someone snatches the bag, there is a panic
mode that will set off the alarm if the bag is within 40 feet.
</P>
<P>
   You can set the sensitivity of the alarm so that it takes more
than just touching the bag to kick it off. It is for those of us
who use the slide-the-luggage-forward-with-the-foot-method when
standing in the airline check-in line.
</P>
<P>
   The Defcon unit is built into the side of the bag and when it is
armed, a blinking red light is visible -- a subtle way of telling
would be thieves that this is no easy target.
</P>
<P>
   My only complaint is that the remote control is quite small. I
worry about losing it because it does not have enough heft to
remind me that it is in my pocket. It does have a ring so that you
can attach it to the ring with the rest of your keys.
Unfortunately, my key ring contains way too many keys and, on
trips, I often put it inside my laptop's zippered inner pocket,
leaving me no way to hit the panic button if the button is in the
bag, in the hand of the thief who is running down the concourse.
The Defcon3 sells for $129.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PowerBook Update &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A number of readers pointed out that Apple has discontinued the
12-inch dual scan mode PowerBook G3. It's not true. Apple
discontinued the 13-inch model. If you go to the Apple Web site and
check PowerBook configurations, the first one on the list is for
the alleged discontinued model.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to continue to offer a low-cost option for our
customers,'' an Apple representative said.
</P>
<P>
   The price still starts at less than $2,000. And my opinion
stands that the screen is not sharp enough.
</P>
<P>
   The other issue raised by readers involved the size of the case.
I did not make it clear that all the PowerBook G3 cases are the
same size, but that the bezel around the screen is adjusted to
accommodate all screen sizes. It's still too big for most standard
carrying cases.

   &UR; PowerBook Update &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A number of readers pointed out that Apple has discontinued the
12-inch dual scan mode PowerBook G3. It's not true. Apple
discontinued the 13-inch model. If you go to the Apple Web site and
check PowerBook configurations, the first one on the list is for
the alleged discontinued model.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to continue to offer a low-cost option for our
customers,'' an Apple representative said.
</P>
<P>
   The price still starts at less than $2,000. And my opinion
stands that the screen is not sharp enough.
</P>
<P>
   The other issue raised by readers involved the size of the case.
I did not make it clear that all the PowerBook G3 cases are the
same size, but that the bezel around the screen is adjusted to
accommodate all screen sizes. It's still too big for most standard
carrying cases.

ARTS(AT)LARGE 
 NEA CHIEF VOWS TO SUPPORT INDIVIDUAL ARTISTS  
</HEADLINE>
  By MATTHEW MIRAPAUL 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Endowment for the Arts will strive to expand its
support for individual artists, according to its new chairman, Bill
Ivey -- a step that could ultimately benefit the digitally creative
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my goals as chairman is to work with Congress and other
interested parties to move the agency back into funding individual
artists more completely than we do now,'' Ivey said in an interview
Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the federal arts agency has a history of financing
artists who use technologies such as video in their work, Ivey
added: ``We certainly need to find a way to get back into
supporting individual visual artists. And I think that, in
supporting the individual artist, you tend to get a quicker handle
on new technologies because the individual artist tends to take on
these things more quickly than organizations do.''
</P>
<P>
   The NEA's program of grants to individual artists was curtailed
in 1996 after a handful of controversial works prompted members of
Congress to threaten to eliminate the agency. Although the
endowment still awards a few individual fellowships out of its $98
million annual budget, the NEA's guidelines have been changed so
that most grants now go to arts institutions, not-for-profit
organizations and regional arts agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Because, as Ivey observed, these groups are often slow to make
use of new technology, online projects rarely receive support. The
situation is worsened by many online artists' embrace of the
democratic, do-it-yourself spirit of the Internet. For example, the
NEA's rules on literature fellowships flatly exclude self-published
projects, which means most works of hypertext fiction would be
ineligible.
</P>
<P>
   During a telephone interview to herald the relaunch of the NEA's
Web site, Ivey acknowledged that ``we may not be as far into
supporting the digital arts as we might be,'' although he
speculated that some computer-based projects might already be in
the grants pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are somewhat application-dependent,'' Ivey explained.
``It's up to the artists' organizations to come to us with projects
in the digital realm, so it's a little bit of a waiting game for
the endowment.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivey said that the NEA is seeking to hire a technology
specialist in the next few months to help assess grant proposals in
this area. The agency is also considering convening a panel of
experts from across the nation that, he said, ``could really allow
us to enter the field with some authenticity.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, the NEA has yet to make a strong commitment to digital
media. Reading through the NEA's program descriptions and
guidelines, it is difficult to find references to the electronic
realm, just as one is unlikely to see a Web-based work of art in a
museum or gallery in the United States. Although more innovations
in the technology industry come from the United States, digital art
is more widely accepted in Europe. Government-sponsored
electronic-art centers and festivals like Ars Electronica in Linz,
Austria, routinely showcase Internet projects and digital works.
</P>
<P>
   Apprised of this situation, Ivey said: ``If we as a nation are
leading in technology but somehow lagging in the most creative
parts of the use of that technology, that's something we at the
endowment and the other entities that are involved in either
nurturing or regulating life on the Internet should get into. There
may well be some kind of a positive intervention that some agency
could accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   The NEA does subsidize Open Studio, a national program to
provide technology tools and Internet access to nonprofit arts
organizations and the artists they serve. Last Friday, Ivey visited
Space One Eleven, an arts center in Birmingham, Ala., that has
received Open Studio grants. While there, he viewed Piotr
Szyhalski's Web-based Ding an sich project, commissioned by the
Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. Ivey described the work as
``pretty interesting and pretty exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   While most artists are eager for additional income sources, not
all welcome government sponsorship. Robbin Murphy, a New York
artist and one of the founders of artnetweb, said: ``When
politicians here face the voters, they have to say whether they
support sissy, elitist art or serious science that the kids will
like. My fear is that if government does give more support, it will
be for art that looks like science projects.''
</P>
<P>
   David Feit, the artistic director of the Seattle-based NEA Army,
has an unusual twist on the government's role in the intersection
of art and technology. His four-man group applied earlier this year
for a grant the size of the agency's total budget. The group plans
to use the money to build a portion of a B-2 Stealth bomber that
would be toted across the country bearing a sign that says
``Priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To get the most bang for their buck, the NEA should coordinate
with the Pentagon, which already uses cutting-edge technology to
project American creativity around the globe,'' Feit said. ``The
high-tech arts are here already. For $1 million each, the Tomahawk
cruise missile can generate a beautiful high-tech fireworks display
in the skies of any country in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivey, 54, was selected by President Clinton to succeed the
actress Jane Alexander as head of the NEA. Unanimously confirmed by
the Senate in May, he was sworn in on July 17, after 27 years at
the helm of the Country Music Foundation in Nashville. He has
computers at work and at home, and sometimes carries a laptop when
he travels. A pilot, he enjoys flight-simulation software, but as
an amateur musician, he prefers guitar-instruction videotapes over
the one CD-ROM tutorial he has.
</P>
<P>
   Ivey said he is not much of an Internet surfer, preferring to
visit specific online locales like book-retailing sites, which he
uses as a convenient way to check whether a title is in print. He
praised the Library of Congress' American Memory Web site, a
collection of historic photographs, sound clips and other source
materials, and he voiced support for the plans of Robert Pinsky,
the nation's poet laureate, to build an online archive of citizens'
favorite poems.
</P>
<P>
   Ivey said he had ``very little'' input on the NEA's Web site,
which was quietly relaunched last week. Compared to the original
site, which went up in April 1996, the updated version is more
functional, with a structure than enables faster access to basic
information about the NEA.
</P>
<P>
   The site also sports more images than the previous incarnation,
although its plain appearance is unlikely to earn any
graphic-design prizes. As before, there are feature articles on
contemporary artists, including an interview with Julie Taymor, the
director of the Broadway musical ``The Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   The site gets between 1,200 and 1,600 visits per day, with most
visitors seeking grants-related information. So far, the galleries
and other areas for the general public are less trafficked,
something Ivey would like to see change.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ivey does not foresee the site becoming an art archive,
a children's area is under discussion, and he would like to see
other public areas expand and add more fun elements over the next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that our Web site would be a gateway to some of
the magic of making art, learning about art, participating in art
and viewing art,'' he said.

FORMER CHAMPION OF CLASSROOM COMPUTERS FORESEES FAILURE 
</HEADLINE>
  By PAMELA MENDELS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jane M. Healy has spent the past several years peering over the
shoulders of students working in technology-filled classrooms
touted as essential to modern education.
</P>
<P>
   To say she is not impressed is an understatement. The verb
``horrified'' often creeps into the conversation of this petite,
well-mannered woman.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Healy, an educational psychologist and author, has written
a book about children and computers, fleshed out with interviews
with experts, looks at research, discussions of child development
and personal musings. She hopes the book, ``Failure to Connect: How
Computers Affect Our Children's Minds -- For Better and Worse''
(Simon &AMP; Schuster), will embolden parents and educators to begin
asking loud and tough questions about whether the billions of
dollars being spent on wiring schools is a sound investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought computers would be better than television,'' said
Healy, who earlier wrote ``Endangered Minds,'' a book about
television and its effects on children. ``I had high hopes -- and I
came back with huge disillusionment. In fact, I was horrified with
what I saw in schools and people's homes. We have jumped into
[educational technology] way too soon. It's become an idea that has
taken over the public consciousness -- helped, of course, by the
mass promoting of these products to kids as young as a
year-and-a-half.''
</P>
<P>
   It should come as little surprise that classroom technology
enthusiasts think she has it all wrong. Elsie L. Brumback, director
of educational technology at the North Carolina Department of
Public Instruction, believes technology can help students learn
more productively and more deeply. In the right classrooms, she
says, ``students use technology like a sophisticated tool'' to
find, research and synthesize information. ``I've seen that; I've
watched that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And Linda G. Roberts, director of the Office of Educational
Technology at the U.S. Department of Education, says critics like
Healy are overlooking the positive reports of teachers who have
embraced classroom technology. ``We've got almost 10 years
experience in this area,'' she said. ``People are not making this
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, are hoping Healy's book sparks something they
consider long overdue: a national discussion of the role of
computers in education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think her book could actually have an impact,'' said Edward
Miller, a former editor of the Harvard Education Letter and a
critic of many technology-in-education efforts. ``My sense is that
there is a big, untapped reservoir of skepticism about educational
uses of technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman in the center of this is no technophobe. Remedial
technology has worked ``wonders'' for some disabled children and
students with learning disabilities, Healy writes. Her book also
documents what she considers valuable computer-based learning
experiences, among them a sophisticated software program aimed at
getting 9- and 10-year-olds to think about systems theory. And
Healy, a former elementary school principal who was once enthralled
with the classroom possibilities of the first-edition Apple
computer, believes that maybe 50 years from now, technology could
be sophisticated enough to offer invaluable assistance in learning.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, Healy asserted as she sipped bottled water during a
book tour swing through New York City this week, there are a lot
disheartening patterns in the world of education and technology.
Among them: constant classroom computer breakdowns and little
technical support; no thought given to arranging children's
computers in a way to reduce the possibility of vision problems,
repetitive motion injuries and other computer hazards; too ready
acceptance of software that is fun but of dubious educational
value, and a lack of research so deep that teachers are unable to
agree on such basics as the best age to teach a child keyboarding.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Healy is upset that preschoolers are being
urged to log on. Time on the computer might interfere with
development of everything from the young child's motor skills to
his or ability to think logically and distinguish between reality
and fantasy, she writes.
</P>
<P>
   Equally disturbing to Healy was her observation during her
classroom journeys of how computers were often being used by
students. Healy writes of one wealthy private school where students
instructed to use the Internet for research on Latin America devote
their class time to looking up glitzy Web sites about hotels.
``Within a few minutes,'' she writes, ``most of the class is
enthusiastically comparing swimming pools and beds in various
locations.''
</P>
<P>
   In an impoverished inner city school, meanwhile, Healy spent
time in a computer lab, where students were supposed to be
receiving remedial help from educational software.
</P>
<P>
   One boy ``effortlessly solves a few simple addition problems and
then happily accepts his reward -- a series of smash-and-blast
games in which he manages to demolish a sizable number of aliens,''
Healy writes. ``By the time I move on, Raoul has spent many more
minutes zapping aliens than doing math.'' Meanwhile a girl in
desperate need of reading help spends her time at the screen
clicking on colorful animated objects, incapable of reading the few
words in the text, and getting no human assistance in how to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Healy is clearly outraged by such things.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cynical palliative,'' she said. ``I could have taken
either one of those kids and in 15 minutes taught them more than
they would have learned in that computer lab.''

WHEN TO IMPEACH? FIND OUT ON THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
  By CARL S. KAPLAN 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Sept. 8, 1787, following a muggy summer, the delegates to the
Federal Convention in Philadelphia turned their attention to the
impeachment clause of the proposed Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates had already decided that treason and bribery
should serve as two grounds for prosecuting the president before a
jury of senators. But according to notes taken by James Madison,
George Mason of Virginia asked for the addition of a broader
category: ``maladministration.''
</P>
<P>
   This term was rejected as too vague. Gouverneur Morris of
Pennsylvania quipped that ``an election of every four years will
prevent maladministration.'' Eventually, the framers of the
Constitution, borrowing language from English common law, hit upon
a phrase that has been very much in the news during a muggy
September 211 years later: ``high crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   People rushed to the Web last week to read the details of the
Starr report, which detailed President Clinton's possible
impeachable offenses. Now that some of the more salacious details
have sunk in, Web surfers who wish to ponder the deeper meaning of
impeachment can visit the Web again to immerse themselves in the
past. There are a wealth of primary and secondary historical
sources on the Internet that shed light on the meaning and context
of the term ``high crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great thing'' that relevant historical
documents are on the Web, said Bernard J. Hibbitts, a professor at
the University of Pittsburgh law school who teaches legal history
and serves as associate dean for communications and information
technology. ``It allows history to speak for itself. Why not go
back and read what the framers of the Constitution had to say?''
</P>
<P>
   James Madison's notes from the Federal Convention are available
on Yale Law School's Avalon Project Web site, an eclectic trove of
legal history, as well as from the Library of Congress' ``A Century
of Lawmaking for a New Nation'' site, which collects records of the
young America from 1774 to 1873. Surfers may click on the key date
of September 8, 1787 in the Madison notes and stir their historical
imaginations.
</P>
<P>
   The framers also discussed the need for impeachment as a check
on the power of the president on July 20, 1787. On that date,
Madison said it was ``indispensable that some provision should be
made for defending the Community [against] the incapacity,
negligence or perfidy of the chief Magistrate.''
</P>
<P>
   The grounds for impeachment were also discussed authoritatively
by Alexander Hamilton in The Federalist, No. 65, dated March 7,
1788 and also available at the Avalon and New Nation sites. In that
essay, which is part of a series of articles penned by Hamilton,
Madison and John Jay supporting ratification of the Constitution,
Hamilton concluded that grave ``misconduct of public men''
warranted impeachment. In the opinion of Michael J. Gerhardt, a
professor at William and Mary Law School and an expert on
impeachment, Hamilton believed this was not a category that could
be neatly tied down, meaning that a case-by-case determination
might be required.
</P>
<P>
   During President Nixon's impeachment inquiry, the House
Judiciary Committee issued a 60-page report on the constitutional
grounds for presidential impeachment. Available on a special
impeachment Web site prepared by the library of the University of
North Texas, the report surveys the English and American historical
record on the practice of impeachment. It is written in clear
language that can be appreciated by non-lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Peter M. Shane, who teaches constitutional law at the University
of Pittsburgh's law school, cautioned that the historical documents
have their limits. ``I don't think the Federal Convention debates
or The Federalist No. 65 are precisely attuned'' to Clinton's
alleged offenses, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shane noted that Madison's notes were not published until after
his death, partly so that the framers' subjective understanding of
the words used in the Constitution would not have too great an
influence over subsequent generations. ``Still, it's inherently
fascinating'' to read the original documents on the Web, Shane
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gerhardt noted that the term ``high crimes and misdemeanors,''
adopted on Sept. 8, 1787, is a phrase borrowed from English
impeachment practices. It refers to political crimes and is
generally understood to mean ``serious offenses against the U.S. or
the republic, serious breaches of trust or of one's duty,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gerhardt said it was an open question whether, assuming Clinton
lied under oath about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky,
such perjury would fit squarely within the term ``high crimes and
misdemeanors.'' On the one hand, he said, it could be argued the
president's perjury does not relate to his performance in office --
and thus isn't constitutionally significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The argument on the other side is that perjury is a serious
business, especially for the president, who takes an oath to
faithfully execute the laws,'' said Gerhardt.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the latest historical impeachment document on the
Internet is the Starr report itself, which spread with
unprecedented speed upon its release. ``Never have so many read so
much so soon,'' said Hibbitts.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the report, which could affect the constitutional
history of the country, also represented a maturing of the Web as a
mass medium, said Hibbitts.''The Web can go where other media can't
go. It provided a forum for the Starr Report. If it weren't for the
Net, I think the Starr report would have been edited, expurgated
and published (on paper).''

KICK BACK AND REVEL IN THE COOLNESS THAT IS `BUDDY FARO'' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Owing to the largess of CBS, Friday night now means two, two,
two crime-busters with classic convertibles. In addition to ``Nash
Bridges,'' now in its fourth season of enforcing the law from a
ragtop, CBS tonight introduces ``Buddy Faro,'' a
Thunderbird-driving, martini-sipping, rug-cutting private eye whose
swagger would give normal people whiplash.
</P>
<P>
   But Buddy isn't normal. He's got panache. He's got chutzpah.
He's got style.
</P>
<P>
   Substance is another matter, but CBS tried ``Style &AMP; Substance''
last spring and it didn't work. Besides, this is Friday night on
CBS, where, in addition to the ``Nash Bridges'' brand of Cop Lite
macho posing, the schedule offers such mind-expanding fare as
``Kids Say the Darndest Things'' and ``Candid Camera.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Buddy Faro'' fits right in. And it sure beats the possibile
alternative: another network newsmagazine. So kick back and revel
in the coolness of the hippest Faro since Sam the Sham.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Farina, flat Chicago accent and all, is the Budster with
the bluster, and quite enjoyable in a you-love-him-you-hate-him
sort of Rat Package. However, he wouldn't be back in circulation
without the unwitting assistance of Bob Jones, a swaggerless,
plain-vanilla private investigator who is duped into locating Faro,
the former king of the L.A. scene who dropped from sight 20 years
ago to avoid an acute case of small-caliber lead poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Whaley is appropriately self-effacing as the nondescript
Jones, the guy who eventually becomes guide and interpreter for
someone who's stuck in the '70s. Allison Smith is also aboard as
the required female assistant with the setup lines.
</P>
<P>
   Despite adherence to the revered formula, or maybe because of
it, ``Buddy Faro'' is slick, well-paced and fun to watch _ a nice
piece of light entertainment for starting the weekend. But any
attempt to compare it with the ABC series ``Vega$,'' which just
happened to debut in 1978, would be preposterous. Dan Tanna's
Thunderbird was cherry red. Buddy Faro's is jet black.
</P>
<P>
   'Course, we all know Jim Rockford's gold Firebird would leave
'em both in the dust.
</P>
<P>
   Over at ABC, the TGIF juggernaut continues to roll with a couple
of new entries that are just about par for the course. ``Two of a
Kind,'' featuring the Olsen twins, kicks off the Friday night
kidfest with another of the many single-parent shows so popular
this season. ``Brother's Keeper'' wraps up the two-hour TGIF block
with yet another.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Two of a Kind,'' Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen play Mary-Kate
and Ashley Burke, very different twin daughters of science
professor Kevin Burke (Christopher Sieber), who is looking for the
right person to supervise them when he's away. The least likely
candidate, at least in his mind, is a 28-year-old headstrong
freshman named Carrie Moore (Sally Wheeler), who doesn' exactly get
off on the right foot with the professor on the first day of class.
</P>
<P>
   Natuarlly, the girls love Carrie because she can relate to the
tomboy in Mary-Kate and the princess in Ashley and, well, you
pretty much know the rest of the story.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing here that will go down in the annals of TV lore,
but for ABC's intended audience of pre-teens, ``Two of a Kind'' is
quite acceptable, and a vast improvement over last year's failed
entries, ``Teen Angel'' and ``You Wish.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Brother's Keeper'' isn't half-bad, either, though the similar
premise may wear thin after a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Porter Waide (William Ragsdale) is a college professor (history
this time) who is trying to raise his 8-year-old son Oscar (Justin
Cooper) alone. Waide seems to be faring well until his
ne'er-do-well brother Bobby, a pro football placekicker, arrives
one day. It seems Bobby (Sean O'Bryan) is such a well-known
troublemaker that his new team has required that he live with a
responsible party to stay on the straight and narrow _ and be
assured of getting his million-dollar salary.
</P>
<P>
   Little Oscar thinks it's cool having another juvenile around.
His dad isn't so sure, but he allows Bobby to stay, meaning he
occasionally has two children to contend with, and that Oscar has
two very distinct _ and distinctly different _ authority figures.
</P>
<P>
   O'Bryan is especially appealing in the role of the irresponsible
lout knowing he should be a good camper but more inclined to
mischief-making.

STUDY SAYS SAN FRANCISCO AREA'S ECONOMY CONTINUES TO BOOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The San Francisco Bay area continues to show
steady growth and low unemployment despite the eventual loss of 13
military bases in the region and the financial instability in Asia,
according to a survey released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly everyone has concerns about the developments in Asia
and who knows what will happen in Latin America but, at this point,
the Bay area has shown its economic resilience,'' said Alexander
Winslow, spokesman for the Bay Area Council, a regional nonprofit
organization of corporate leaders. The survey was published in the
council's quarterly Economic Pulse newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   The one area where the Bay area has felt the Asian flu has been
in merchandise exports, which fell 4.4 percent in 1998's second
quarter from the previous quarter and 8.2 percent from the same
quarter last year. Winslow said the numbers were still in line with
national export figures.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay area's unemployment rate of 3.5 percent is well below
the state's rate of 5.7 percent and the nation's 4.5 percent rate.
Meanwhile, the Bay area's 1998 annual growth rate of 3 percent
slowed slightly from 4.5 percent in 1997 and 3.3 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Housing prices, another indicator for a region's economic
strength, were 8.8 percent higher than the previous quarter and
15.2 percent higher than the quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   This quarter's report focused on how the Bay area's seven
military bases that began closing in 1994 and the six others slated
to be shut down through 2008 affect the economy. The bases
represent more than 45,000 military and civilian jobs lost, or 1.3
percent of all jobs in the area.
</P>
<P>
   R. Sean Randolph, president of the Bay Area Economic Forum and
co-author of the base portion of the report, said the Bay area is
the most heavily affected part of the country for base closings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is not the closures, but how rapidly those
bases can be converted to productive civilian use,'' Randolph said.
``It's going to take a lot of time.''
</P>
<P>
   While the closings can eventually have a positive effect on the
economy, Randolph said the process may be delayed by environmental
cleanup problems and confusion over who controls the military bases
for lease purposes.

BALLET FOLKLORICO DE MEXICO TAPS COLORFUL ARRAY OF CULTURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH LAFAVE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Long, long ago, in the days before Riverdance, there
was a dance company that evoked the native culture of a country by
blending classical technique and folk traditions.
</P>
<P>
   It's still around. And despite being 46 years old, Ballet
Folklorico de Mexico remains popular.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it finds itself on the leading edge of the
fastest-growing market in the United States: the Hispanic
community.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ballet Folklorico de Mexico appeals not only to Hispanics,
says co-producer Adam Friedson, but to Anglos who want to move
beyond a concept of Mexican culture that stops at serapes and
tacos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The various dances in the show come from the daily lives of
people in Mexico, and each dance is unique to the culture of the
region it comes from,'' says Friedson, a Los Angeles-based producer
who describes himself as ``the Anglo half'' of the production team.
</P>
<P>
   Not many people, for example, would think ``Mexico'' and conjure
a sea pageant with French and African influences. Yet the Mexican
state of Veracruz, home to the eponymous port city, harbored
African slaves who jumped ship on the way to the United States in
the 19th century. It was also home to many French families during
the reign of Maximilian, the Austrian made Emperor of Mexico by
Napoleon III.
</P>
<P>
   Add Dutch traders to this polyglot, mix them with the Spanish
and Native American ingredients that are Mexico's backbone, and
what's the result?
</P>
<P>
   `` `Fiesta de Tlacotalpan' is the dance from Veracruz state,''
Friedson says. ``The women are undersea creatures, and the men come
out and capture them with huge white nets. There's also a great big
Carnival scene with huge puppets of papier-mache and iron. It
really expresses the cultural lifeblood of the area.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Mexican states represented in the current version of
Ballet Folklorico de Mexico include Chiapas, Chihuahua, the Yucatan
and Jalisco. Though the dances change from year to year and from
tour to tour, the most enduring is that from Sonora: the
extraordinary Deer Dance of the Yaqui Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the first dance to define the company, back in the
1950s,'' Friedson says.
</P>
<P>
   The Deer Dance was choreographed by Ballet Folklorico's founder,
Amalia Hernandez, who single-handedly originated not only Ballet
Folklorico de Mexico, but the very idea of folkloric dancing.
</P>
<P>
   ``She created the concept of training the dancers in classical
technique first and then giving them the folk traditions. She
started the company in 1952, vigorously researching the traditions
herself, drawing all the designs for scenery and costumes. For many
years, her company was presented in the United States by the great
impresario Sol Hurok,'' Friedson says.
</P>
<P>
   But when Hurok died in 1979, there was nobody ``to treat Amalia
as the incredible diva she is,'' according to Friedson. For almost
a decade, Ballet Folklorico de Mexico did not tour the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Then Hernandez remembered the son of a friend, a young man who
had produced concerts in Mexico and in the United States with an
American partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how I became involved,'' Friedson _ the American
partner _ recalls with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my friend, Julio Solorzano, she called to produce the
company's reintroduction to the United States. I said to Julio,
`But you've never produced anything like this.' He said he knew
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The first efforts, a pair of concerts in Southern California in
1987, failed to make expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can remain friends with a producing partner when you're
losing money, you can make it. Julio and I laughed through those
first traumatic concerts,'' Friedson says.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the losses, Hernandez asked the team to produce the
company's future tours of the United States, which have
subsequently been successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we came to understand was that the Hispanic market has
had a sudden transformation. It now desires high-quality
entertainment on a world-class level.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, now 81, is in semi-retirement, but she's creating a
dance based on Mexican Christmas traditions for the company, to be
premiered in December. The newest addition to the present tour is
nearly in sync with Egypt-mania:
</P>
<P>
   ``We're bringing a 30- by 30-foot pyramid that weighs about a
ton,'' Friedson says. ``It's for the new opening number about Aztec
gods.'' &QL;

FORMER TEXAS REPORTER, LAWMAKER DIES AT 72 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CARMINIA DANINI  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Mary Jane Bode, an award-winning journalist,
former state legislator and first female press secretary for a
statewide office in Texas, died Wednesday morning in Barrington,
Ill., where she had been visiting her daughter. She was 72.
</P>
<P>
   Bode died at Good Shepherd Hospital of complications from
cancer, said her daughter, Georgianne Harms.
</P>
<P>
   During a journalism career that spanned more than 30 years, she
was a political reporter and worked for the Long News Service, the
Austin American-Statesman, the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, the Del
Rio News-Herald, the Houston Chronicle and the San Antonio
Express-News.
</P>
<P>
   She played flag football in George Bush's back yard and covered
the first presidential press conference on the environment, but her
most memorable assignment occurred the day the infamous Berlin Wall
came down.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1989, Bode was assigned to follow the West German
ambassador for the day _ the same day the East German government
announced it would open the border with the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met him (the ambassador) at 9:30 and by 3 o'clock, my notes
were obsolete,'' she recalled in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, Bode went to work for then-Attorney General John Hill
as his press secretary and speechwriter. She stayed with Hill until
1977.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, a former chief justice of the Texas Supreme Court, said
Bode was his right arm in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am saddened because she was very skillful and talented and a
wonderful source of strength,'' said Hill, now a Houston lawyer.
``She saved me a lot of steps and we had so much fun working
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Bode was born in Chicago on July 28, 1926, but moved with her
family to Galveston, Texas, when she was a baby. She was still in
high school when she began working for the Galveston News.
</P>
<P>
   She married a doctor while she was a student at the University
of Houston but he died early in their marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Following her husband's death, she went to work at the Houston
Chronicle. While there, she met and married Winston Bode, a
reporter for the Houston Press. The couple later divorced.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, Bode ran in the Austin special election to fill the
seat in the Texas House of Representatives left vacant by Sarah
Weddington, who resigned.
</P>
<P>
   She defeated her opponent by 64 votes. The day of her
swearing-in, she joked that her staff referred to her as
``Landslide Bode'' and ``Marginal Mary Jane.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Legislature, she pushed programs to fight child abuse and
to deter juvenile delinquency. She served two terms.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Bode won the Chrysalis Award from the Texas Women's
Political Caucus for ``excellence in continuous coverage of issues
vital to women and humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgianne Harms said her mother always shared her experiences
and knowledge with younger women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any woman who worked hard in Texas politics and journalism was
a friend of hers,'' Harms said.
</P>
<P>
   Memorial services are planned in Austin and in Barrington.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her former husband, Winston Bode of Austin;
two daughters, Georgianne (Dennis) Harms of Barrington and Vera
Alexander of San Marcos, Texas; and one son, Todd (Charmaine) Bode
of Austin; and five grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Her oldest child, a son, Cori Carmignani, died in 1983.

WILD WOMEN: FEMALES FLOCKING TO LEARN OUTDOORS SKILLS  
 (WITH WOLD WOMEN-SIDE)

 WOMEN-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

   UNDATED - Looping a line in the graceful arcs of fly-fishing, a
woman coaxes trout from a stream.
</P>
<P>
   Another picks her way through the forest using a topographic map
and compass.
</P>
<P>
   Women across the country are banding together through private
companies and clubs to experience the outdoors as much as their
male counterparts traditionally have.
</P>
<P>
   Adventure companies and programs catering to women in the
outdoors have evolved during the '80s and '90s. Many report full
classes and trips that take as many women as slots allotted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge demand,'' said Nicole Leiria, coordinator of
the California State Parks program Women in the Outdoors. ``It's
taken off.''
</P>
<P>
   California's program is modeled on Becoming an Outdoors Woman,
started by Christine Thomas, a professor of resource management at
the University of Wisconsin. Thomas conducted research in the early
1990s that showed women face a number of barriers to outdoor
activities, from not knowing lingo that enables them to shop for
supplies to a culture that assumes males are more suited to
outdoors training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Becoming an Outdoors Woman was developed as a program to break
down the barriers,'' said its assistant director, Diane Lueck.
Currently it exists in 44 states and nine Canadian provinces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response is so positive. Women look forward to it. They
beg for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Women who participate are often leery, wondering whether they
must sleep outside or if they'll be thrown out into the wild and
expected to co-exist with nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're in new territory,'' Leiria said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than roughing it in rustic style, women typically stay in
cabins or similar accommodations, with meals included as part of
the purchase price. Classes offered teach women new skills _
backpacking, outdoor survival, map and compass skills.
</P>
<P>
   Talk to any of the women's outdoor companies and one theme is
dominant: Women who learn new skills come away with a boosted sense
of self-confidence. Part of it stems from participating in a
learning environment that is nurturing rather than competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you gain a little bit of knowledge and a little bit of
experience . . . it makes them feel like they're so empowered, and
they can do anything that they want to do,'' Leiria said.
</P>
<P>
   Some needed that boost to help them through tough times. Many
women who come through the program are in transition _ kids have
left the nest, a divorce has left them lonely, perhaps they simply
feel a need for something new.
</P>
<P>
   ``The women are there not just for the outdoors skills part of
it. There's a change going on in them,'' Lueck said.
</P>
<P>
   Women who participate have a stubborn streak when it comes to
sticking out the experience. When a foot of snow fell during a
Becoming an Outdoors Woman conference in March in Arizona, only
seven of about 100 who came left early.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were canoeing in the snow. They were fly-fishing while it
was snowing,'' said Valerie Nelson, office manager at the Arizona
Wildlife Federation, which coordinates the weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly few complaints come from male partners. One Montana
husband paid for his new bride to attend a workshop during their
honeymoon so they could do more outdoors together. Another woman
who was left immobile by illness came to a California conference
after her health improved. Her husband bought the trip for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was really apprehensive about coming. . . . By the end of
the weekend, she was doing everything and just having a great,
great time,'' Leiria said. ``It really had changed her way of
thinking about the things we fear and the things we avoid.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically the three-day weekends go something like this: Women
check in. Greetings by organizers follow, perhaps over lunch, then
it's off to the first session. Sample classes: fly-fishing, camp
cooking, rifle marksmanship, beginning archery, canoeing, mountain
biking and horse sense.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most popular classes are those normally associated
with the most macho of men. So many women at an Alaska workshop
wanted to take game cleaning that organizers had to double the
number allowed in the class.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Wisconsin, it is the class that filled first,'' Lueck said.
``The shooting classes are very popular.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're breaking down the barriers,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The women are there not just for the outdoors skills part of it.
There's a change going on in them. &QL;

<P>
   A different front
</P>
<P>
   The nurses coped with wrenching wounds and death, filth and the
flu, the threat of shells and poison gas. But they were also
fighting a battle on a different front.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving a letter from home with news that her town was
displaying a flag for the nurses, she wrote: ``I'm glad someone
appreciates the nurses. The patients are the only ones here that
do. ... We just have to fight for our very existence here.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, when the Army passed out tickets to receive donated
Christmas packages from America, they skipped the nurses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry about our Christmas, no one over here worries
about us, so why should you?'' she wrote her mother and father.
``We weren't given any cards or tickets or anything else, so we are
just out of luck. `S.O.L.' they say in the army. When I get back,
you won't understand my language, not because it is French or
German either.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their difficulties, the nurses found ways to endure, and
even raise their spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we were invited to dances,'' she wrote. ``The
English and French could go home for rest, but it was too far for
the Americans, so recreation was planned in plays and dances.''
</P>
<P>
   Humor helped them survive.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, they were loaded onto trains for transport.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (nurses) were fortunate to have a toilet on board, but the
men stopped along the way at different sidings,'' she wrote. ``One
of our nice doctors was caught with his pants down when the train
started up unexpectedly. He really got an ovation from the crowd as
he scrambled aboard clutching his clothes. We made fun out of every
little incident and were hilarious at times.''
</P>
<P>
   Letters helped, too _ especially from her lieutenant friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had a letter from Pete,'' she wrote home. ``He may be in the
next town for all I know. He censors his own mail but is a very
good soldier and wouldn't say a thing that wasn't right. Some
people at home think that your mail coming this way is opened, but
it isn't ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``... Marg Cooper got a letter from one of the girls at the base
today. It surely must be a wonderful place, but we are satisfied
with this wild and woolly life until the snow flies at least. ...
Our tent is pitched on a kind of a hill and even though I have my
cot propped up, my head is usually lower than my feet, and
sometimes I wake up and find the bunk has sort of skidded during
the night and my head is outside, with the flap of the tent forming
a bib. Oh it's a great life if you don't weaken. . . . It may not
be quite as comfortable as the little bungalows (at the base
hospital) . . . but I like it fine.''
</P>
<P>
   And when there were no letters, they sang to keep their courage
up.
</P>
<P>
   After pitching tents near Ypres, she wrote: ``. . . The boys
found three pianos while they were searching the dugouts. They say
some of the dugouts the Germans had were carpeted. Last night they
brought one of the pianos back to camp and put it up in the Red
Cross hut. Someone was clever enough to tune it and a lot of the
boys can play, so we had quite a concert.''
</P>
<P>
   They sang all the songs written for the war, sometimes devising
their own lyrics. For one called ``The Rose of No Man's Land,''
they substituted the words: `` 'Neath the war's red curse stands
the Cross Red Nurse. She's the rose of no man's land.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Army now
</P>
<P>
   The lighter moments helped them keep their fear in check. They
relocated the tent hospitals frequently, often on 24 hours notice,
so they could go where casualties were heaviest. They would pack 12
nurses to an ambulance and space their vehicles miles apart, so
planes wouldn't detect their moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The devastation along our route was unbelievable,'' she wrote.
``Houses just a pile of rubble, dead cows in the fields, bloated
bodies of horses along the muddy roads where rats were scurrying
out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they were several miles from the front, they were still
at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We soon learned the sound of a German Fokker plane,'' she
wrote. ``It didn't have the same droning sound of the Allied ones
and we hardly waited for the sound of the alarm to take cover. . .
. It seemed cruel to leave the bed patients, but (it was)
reasonable that someone should be left to take care of them in case
the hospital was bombed.''
</P>
<P>
   On the troop ship over, she had written her parents: ``. . . Now
mother, imagine us having such good times and everyone at home
worrying their heads off about us. You know, Uncle Sam is pretty
clever and I am sure I have never been safer in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Four months later, any romantic illusions she'd harbored about
the war had disappeared, replaced by an appreciation for the
paradox and futility of battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one at home has the faintest idea how they are getting
killed (here),'' she wrote home. ``... I'm sure no one realizes the
suffering of the boys. It's their spirit that affects me. I can
watch them amputate a leg and dress a wound that is open from the
hip down, but when a boy tells you he is sorry he lost (his leg)
because it puts him out and he can't go back, well I have to walk
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Daily, the medical teams fixed up men to be shot to pieces
again. At the same time, in the same tents, they worked to save
enemy prisoners _ the same men Allied soldiers were trying
desperately to kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of my ward there were several wounded German
prisoners, young towheaded, blue-eyed boys,'' she wrote. ``A guard
stood over them with a .45. Having American and German patients
together brought home the fact of how stupid any war is.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other absurdities.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1918, blacks and whites were kept separate even when sick
in the hospital,'' she wrote in her memoir. ``White orderlies were
supposed to give the personal care to the men, but when one refused
to give an enema to a black man, I was so angry I put up a screen
and took care of the patient myself. He was very grateful and that
was the only time I was ever thanked for giving an enema.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman who had signed her early letters home ``From your
soldier girl,'' and gaily referred to being ``in the Army now,''
had hardened into a pragmatic realist and passionate pacifist. She
would become a lifelong believer in equal rights.
</P>
<P>
   Coming home
</P>
<P>
   If the war began a personal transformation that defined the rest
of her life, it also began a transformation of women in general
back home.
</P>
<P>
   After more than 50 years of pressure from suffragists, it was
the women who served in WWI who finally shamed the government into
taking action on the right to vote.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1919, less than a year after the war ended, the U.S.
Senate passed the 19th Amendment. Women marked ballots for the
first time in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   By breaking the military's gender barrier, the 33,000 women who
served in WWI spurred other social changes. By WWII, women
encountered fewer barriers to serving, and more than 10 times that
number signed up. At war's end, thousands of them took up work in
fields previously dominated by men.
</P>
<P>
   But my grandmother couldn't know back then _ just as the war was
ending _ how it would affect her life or her country. She was
simply excited to be coming home safely.
</P>
<P>
   ``About Nov. 7th, we began to hear rumors that the armistice was
being planned,'' she wrote in her memoir. ``We didn't believe it,
for we still heard the guns and the wounded were still coming in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, one day, the 11th of November, everything became
quiet about 11 a.m. and you wondered what was different. There
wasn't a sound, for there were no birds to sing, or no cows to moo.
We still couldn't believe it possible, as we had so many patients.
A group of French trumpeters came in the afternoon and played for
us, so that was the only celebration we had.''
</P>
<P>
   By the Armistice, her unit had treated 15,000 casualties.
</P>
<P>
   It would be six more months before she got orders to go home.
She continued to care for the wounded, but with the war over, she
also spent time in Paris, Monaco and the French Alps.
</P>
<P>
   Though the shelling had stopped, the war continued to wound in
unexpected ways.
</P>
<P>
   While on leave in Nice, my grandmother bumped into a friend of
the first lieutenant she'd fallen in love with during training
camp, the man whose letters she read and reread when she was off
duty. She was told her lieutenant would arrive in the same city the
next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``With great expectation, Margaret and I went to the train to
meet him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had lost weight and looked very tired and just gave a nod
of recognition when we greeted him. We all got in a taxi and he saw
that we got off at our hotel, then he went on to where the officers
were staying.''
</P>
<P>
   She later learned he had been gassed and wounded, and his best
friend had been blown apart beside him in a trench two days before
the Armistice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw him again, and sent the little service pin back to
him by a messenger.''
</P>
<P>
   But heartache couldn't dampen her excitement at going home. On
May 31, 1919, she boarded the Cape Finesterre bound for America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming into New York harbor was an unforgettable event,'' she
wrote. ``Tugboats and fireboats came out to meet us and in my
exuberance, I flung my blue straw hat right at the Statue of
Liberty. Bands were playing and toilet paper was strung all over
the ship like confetti on a happy cruise ship.''
</P>
<P>
   She didn't know then that the celebration would be short-lived,
that she was returning to a country not ready to hear her stories
or those of the other women who served.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saying goodbye to all the friends we had made in the service
was very sobering,'' she wrote. ``On the train and the streetcar
home, I never felt so depressed and forlorn in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Though dressed in full uniform ``no one knew or noticed I was a
returning veteran.''
</P>
<P>
   Many years later, she said she knew how Vietnam veterans felt
when they they came home.
</P>
<P>
   After the war
</P>
<P>
   The war was rarely mentioned after her return.
</P>
<P>
   Though many of the nurses' experiences were more dramatic than
those of their husbands, boyfriends or brothers, they didn't talk
for fear of embarrassing the men. Social pressures against women
doing ``men's work'' also enforced their silence.
</P>
<P>
   But the war's imprint remained. It would influence my
grandmother's outlooks and actions for the rest of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Sick of the carnage of battle, she turned to obstetrical
nursing. ``I decided I had worked long enough with men,'' she
wrote. ``It was very pleasing and satisfactory work. The babies
were so lovely and everyone so happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Her nursing skills freed her from the family farm and gave her a
degree of economic independence still rare among women. Eager for
more adventure, she struck out for San Francisco to visit her
uncle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a graduate of a good school gave me prestige wherever I
wanted to go,'' she said later. ``They called me to the Children's
Hospital in San Francisco and I worked there for awhile. When I
thought it was time to return home (to Massachusetts), I tried to
get a job on the Dollar Line (cruise ship company) as far as New
York, but they said I would have to sign up for the trip around the
world. Sometimes I wish I had taken that cruise.''
</P>
<P>
   But by that time _ 1925 _ she was engaged to Wilson Smith, a
young shoe salesman who had grown up in the town next to hers. He
had served in the Navy on a submarine chaser during the war. They
married that year, when she was 32, relatively old for that era.
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother had two children _ the second, my father, when
she was 40. They lived first in Minneapolis and migrated in 1939 to
Seattle, where her husband sold shoes to Nordstrom and other stores
in his territory. Widowed in 1953, she moved to California in 1956
to be near her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   When my grandfather was alive, he was frequently on the road for
his work, so she lived a life not unlike a modern single mother,
filling many roles and fending for herself. It was a job the war
had taught her well.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, I was in awe of her. It seemed she could do
anything, from wiring a lamp to knitting a blanket. An accomplished
artist who painted and sculpted, she was always busy with her
hands.
</P>
<P>
   And her feminist leanings were not lost on me, her only
granddaughter, even at an early age.
</P>
<P>
   She used to tell me how she had run into two French officers on
cavalry horses at the beach. They let her ride but kept hold of her
reins, which wounded her pride. When one of them showed off by
riding up a steep sand dune and down the other side, she pulled her
horse free and rode up and down the same dune.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so angry,'' she would say, and laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Her legacy has been simple. She encouraged her children and five
grandchildren to follow our hearts, use our hands and speak our
minds.
</P>
<P>
   Today, when I ask her for advice, she always says the same
thing: ``Be yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Her quiet courage sustained us through the usual childhood woes
and deeper hurts as we got older.
</P>
<P>
   When she learned that my son _ her first great-grandchild _ was
deaf, she gamely picked up sign language in her 90s. Though her
gnarled, arthritic hands could barely shape the signs, they
communicated her love nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   When he died at age 7, her strength comforted me. She knew there
is the possibility of joy after such sorrow. The war had taught her
that.
</P>
<P>
   The war left other traces on her life as well.
</P>
<P>
   She went to the battlefields two years before women got the
vote. When she returned, she voted in every election until she was
103.
</P>
<P>
   Her patriotism, while not showy, ran deep. She would have
members of the military over for dinner on holidays and she always
put out the flag.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most enduring mark of my grandmother's
experience in WWI has been her lifelong recoil at the mention of
war.
</P>
<P>
   The few times she heard dinner-table talk of war or battlefield
exploits, she quickly stopped it.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, when I told her I was writing this article, she
was quiet for awhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wars are so unnecessary,'' she said finally.
</P>
<P>
   I realized, then, that although she has seldom spoken of it, the
war had spoken through her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen it,'' she would say when war talk came up. ``That's
why I'm a pacifist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there.''

 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (begin italics) ``Do I look bad?'' the soldier pleads.
</P>
<P>
   Half his face is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Frost hurriedly dresses the raw shreds that remain. There
are still men moaning on gurneys in the rain outside the operating
tent.
</P>
<P>
   Her hands shake from the chilling damp that seeps through the
canvas walls. Her thin leather boots are coated with mud. Blood is
smeared across her nurse's uniform.
</P>
<P>
   She tries to block out the sound of limbs dropping into enamel
pails as surgeons saw through mangled flesh and bones.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment she presses her hand against her eyes. Sometimes
the men in their misery make her cry.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   Eighty years later her hand still goes to her eyes when she
recalls that scene.
</P>
<P>
   At 105, Laura Frost Smith travels easily in her mind to 1918 and
the Western Front, a war zone that separated her from her youth.
</P>
<P>
   Today she is one of the oldest known living American veterans of
World War I, a war that marked the first time women officially
served in the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
   She is also my grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   I had mixed emotions on learning of this latest milestone in my
grandmother's life.
</P>
<P>
   Her other accomplishments are more dear to me _ the lemon cake
she baked when I was a child, the parade of hand-knit socks and
mittens for Christmas, her skilled watercolors, prized garden and
the stories she told of growing up on a farm near Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The war was almost never mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Her military service was such a small sliver of her life. Like a
single tree ring lost in the dense coil that holds a life together,
it hardly seemed significant as I was growing up.
</P>
<P>
   I could barely remember the contours of the war drawn in history
classes, let alone picture my grandmother serving at five of its
bloodiest fronts. To me they were just names printed on tiny brass
bars and clasped to the ribbon of the Victory Medal in a glass box
on her wall.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the women who served in the Great War are gone now.
Ignored when they came home and forgotten by subsequent
generations, most never had a chance to tell their stories.
</P>
<P>
   So I went in search of this part of my grandmother's life. I
visited her earlier this month at the Meadows care center in Los
Gatos, Calif., where she lives now. For three days we sat together
in the sun beside a lemon tree, while I looked for pathways through
her memory that would take me with her to that place and time.
</P>
<P>
   She is still beautiful, and though her eyesight and hearing are
failing, there are still flashes of her keen mind and wicked sense
of humor. She remembers.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't where I found the pieces I was looking for.
</P>
<P>
   I went back, instead, to the letters she sent home from the war,
and to a family memoir she wrote in her 90s.
</P>
<P>
   There, in her own words, I found a young woman I never knew, a
woman who went off to see the world, and in the process helped
change it.
</P>
<P>
   Her year at war not only shaped her life in ways I had never
understood, it had also helped shape mine.
</P>
<P>
   Give me girls
</P>
<P>
   Laura Frost was an unconventional woman even before she went to
war.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1893, she grew up on a small farm in East Taunton, Mass.
Her father, George, grew vegetables that her mother made into
pickles they sold in town.
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother, the youngest of three daughters, was given the
middle name ``Georgina,'' for the son her parents didn't have, and
she learned to work the land accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   She went to a one-room school where boys and girls had separate
entrances, but there was no such division of labor at home. ``Give
me girls every time,'' her father would tell her years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister and I proved to him we could do our share working
the farm,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So it seemed natural to do her share when the call went out for
volunteers to fight the war that had been raging across Europe
since 1914. Her graduation from nursing school nearly coincided
with the U.S. declaration of war on the Germans on April 6, 1917.
</P>
<P>
   Her training hospital, working with the Red Cross, organized
military Base 44. ``Most of my class signed up for it,'' she wrote
in her memoir. She was sworn in on Feb. 15, 1918, and sent to Fort
Oglethorpe, Ga., for training.
</P>
<P>
   She went to war for adventure. She had no idea how much her life
was about to change.
</P>
<P>
   When she signed up, women couldn't vote and men were deeply
suspicious of those who were educated. According to scientists of
the day, women's smaller brains were not equipped for higher
education, and too much thinking was believed to impair their
childbearing capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Only five years earlier, the sinking of the Titanic and the cry
of ``women and children first'' had inflamed arguments about female
roles in society. To traditionalists, the Titanic proved that women
belonged to a special class, one requiring protection by _ not
equality with _ men.
</P>
<P>
   That left no room for women on the battlefield. But some women
saw it differently.
</P>
<P>
   When the United States entered the war, there were 403 Army
nurses on active duty. By Armistice Day, 19 months later, more than
21,000 had enlisted and about 10,000 had seen duty overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Such a good time
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of the country, my grandmother entered the war
with high spirits and a certain innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know I have never had such a good time in my life as I
have had this last two weeks,'' she wrote from training camp on
March 4, 1918. ``One thing I have learned already _ and had to if I
was to live at all _ that is to dance. Can you imagine fox-trotting
and waltzing with majors and captains?''
</P>
<P>
   She was soon swept up in her first real romance _ a love affair
with a dashing first lieutenant. Pete Herzog wooed her with
dinners, dancing and shows _ heady experiences for a tomboy whose
social life had centered mostly on the annual clambake at her tiny
church or the occasional ride in a horse-drawn sleigh.
</P>
<P>
   In letters home, she referred often to her lieutenant. He taught
her military marching maneuvers and stood at attention as she
passed by in her first parade. Before they left for Europe, he gave
her a diamond service pin as a pledge of love, and she promised to
write him through the war.
</P>
<P>
   Though the romance thrilled her, she never lost sight of her
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Assigned to the psychiatric ward at training camp, she
encountered a shellshocked patient sent home from battle: ``The
first day I went into the ward after lunch, I found everyone
cringing into corners or under their beds. A young fellow was
brandishing a straight razor. I didn't know what was happening but
went right up to him and yelled: `Give me that!' He smiled and
handed me the open razor.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger of battle, however, still felt a long way off, and in
some ways the war seemed like a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so happy to think that we are at last on the way,'' she
wrote from training camp. ``. . . We'll soon have the Huns on the
run and be home in no time.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were signs that fantasies of war were about to end.
</P>
<P>
   One day a friend asked her to go horseback riding. She accepted,
but at the last minute changed her plans and asked a fellow nurse
to take her place.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was so pleased to think that she was going for a ride, and
in five minutes she was thrown and died three hours later,'' my
grandmother wrote home.
</P>
<P>
   Sobered by the death, the nurses marched behind her hearse in a
military funeral. ``I never realized what taps meant before, until
they sounded for her at the station,'' she wrote. ``None of us have
very much pep since it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 17, 1918, the base hospital moved by train from Georgia
to New York to prepare for the trip to France.
</P>
<P>
   The timing meant the nurses would get to march 60 blocks in New
York City's Fourth of July parade. It would be one of the first
times American military women had ever marched alongside men. It
would also provide her first glimpse of how the rest of the country
viewed women in the Army.
</P>
<P>
   On July 6, 1918, she wrote: ``It really was a wonderful parade.
... They didn't say much about the nurses in it. We thought we were
the whole show. They just said 400 (women) marched and there were
at least 1,400. It is funny, because a paper usually exaggerates so
much.''
</P>
<P>
   It made her feel important to march then, she said during my
recent visit. The irony is not lost on her, even all these years
later.
</P>
<P>
   When she came home after the war, people would barely notice.
</P>
<P>
   Over there
</P>
<P>
   On July 14, 1918, she sailed on the troop ship Northland for the
18-day trip to Liverpool and then Le Havre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never knew how many ships were in our convoy, but I guessed
about 18,'' she wrote in her memoir. ``That month, about 300,000
troops went over. We were told to throw nothing overboard, as any
floating objects would reveal our course to any lurking
submarine.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucked in her small Army trunk was a box camera and developing
fluid _ despite warnings they were not to take pictures.
</P>
<P>
   By Aug. 4, she had left Paris and was on duty in Evacuation No.
7, a field hospital in the VO Surg District in France.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it hadn't been the amputation ward, maybe the shock
wouldn't have been so devastating,'' she wrote. ``But helping dress
those quivering stumps and hearing the laughter and jokes in spite
of their misfortune was too much for me and I cried all that first
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they had made a mistake by putting us through that
experience so soon, but maybe it was for the good and I could stand
anything after that miserable week.''
</P>
<P>
   The nurses sent closest to the front were equipped with a
helmet, gas mask, mess kit and canteen. She was one of them.
</P>
<P>
   They headed straight into the horror of the first ``modern''
war. Poison gas, aerial bombardments and machine guns were being
used for the first time. In four years of madness, more than 65
million men would go to war. Many were slaughtered in the bellies
of trenches that gashed the length of France.
</P>
<P>
   The terrorist bullet that took the life of Archduke Franz
Ferdinand ended up gutting a generation. The casualties _ more than
8 million by war's end _ left a deep scar across several
continents.
</P>
<P>
   Mud and blood
</P>
<P>
   Mobile hospitals at the front worked frantically to save what
was left of men's bodies as they came in. But the damage was
frequently too great. Double amputations were common.
</P>
<P>
   Many died on the operating tables. Sometimes they arrived on
stretchers, scared yet hopeful, their young faces untouched. But
when their uniforms were cut away, they would be nearly shot in
two. Nurses could do nothing but hold their hands as they died.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the women spoke of their experiences, even decades later,
silenced as much by trauma as social norms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was too sad,'' my grandmother said during my recent visit.
``So many hurt boys. Seeing the stumps and their bones . . .'' She
could not finish.
</P>
<P>
   From her original hospital, my grandmother was dispatched closer
to the front. She went with Evac 5 to what had been a town on the
River Marne. The unit, totaling about 1,000 beds, received
casualties directly from the trenches. Each operating tent had 10
surgery tables in use around the clock. At full capacity, the
hospital had about 48 nurses, each handling 20 patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the wounded began to come in, the stretchers were laid on
the ground and the corpsmen stripped them of their muddy clothes
and deloused them, usually before we received them in the operating
tent,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The most seriously wounded were operated on right away, and
those who could stand the journey were evacuated to base hospitals
farther from the front.
</P>
<P>
   The nurses worked under primitive conditions, layering men's
socks and underwear under their uniforms for warmth, sleeping on
the ground or cots in their tents, sometimes subsisting on little
more than beans and hardtack. They worked eight hours on and eight
hours off, around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the afternoon off today for the first time,'' she wrote
home. ``With so much time on my hands I didn't know what to do so I
slept till supper time. Then tonight we went out to get water in
our canteens and took a little walk. . . . The moon looked so
pretty tonight shining on the ruins.''
</P>
<P>
   During the bitter-cold fall of 1918, rain drilled down
relentlessly. They pitched their camps in fields filled with
viscous, sucking mud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing we have to contend with is the mud,'' she
wrote home. ``The blankets on the cots hang over into it and then
they get all wet and so dirty you dread to put them on the patient.
Then the pillows and cots get wet through the tent. Believe me,
it's some mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight decades later, it isn't hard for her to remember what was
different from what she had expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mud,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the blood.''
</P>
<P>
   A long, long trail
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in their training had prepared them for the kind of
nursing they would have to do.
</P>
<P>
   The patients, especially the brain injuries, made them
heartsick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Margaret and I became very fond of one of our patients and
kept him several days, trying to get him to talk,'' she wrote. ``He
was only about 18 years old and had a bullet hole right in the
middle of his forehead. All he could say was `glass,' but he wasn't
paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he wanted something, we would keep asking him until we
hit the right thing and he would nod his head. One day Margaret
sang `Over There' to him, and he followed along saying all the
words. That was a great day for us. When he was evacuated, we went
to the train with him and sat by his litter until the train pulled
out.''
</P>
<P>
   They taught another brain-damaged patient to say, ``Good night,
nurse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He says, `Good night' for everything he wants,'' she wrote.
``They were singing to him yesterday and he joined in and said
`long, long trail' quite plainly. I couldn't stay to hear any more,
for it is going to be a long, long trail for him. We had quite a
time tonight trying to find out what he wanted and would you
believe it was a cigarette?''
</P>
<P>
   Shattered brains, bullet holes and severed limbs weren't the
only wounds they saw. The use of poisonous gases _ mustard gas,
chlorine, phosgene and other toxic aerosols _ increased toward the
war's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Germans were getting desperate now and used more and more
mustard gas,'' she wrote. ``Our casualties were 20 and 30 percent
gassed. It made huge blisters on them and they suffered painfully.
Even though they were cleaned, I sometimes got a whiff of the
miserable stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   For nurses, flu was even more deadly. More than 400 died in the
line of duty, most from Spanish influenza, a virulent strain that
swept the world in 1918 and 1919, killing 21 million.
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother fell sick with the flu immediately after the
Meuse-Argonne Offensive, one of the war's decisive battles.
</P>
<P>
   She spent several days in a coma. ``I came to one day and found
myself in a regular hospital bed in a little tent all by myself,''
she wrote. ``I hadn't seen a bed before, as all our patients were
put on army cots when they came in and that's what we slept on,
too. The head nurse took care of me and I'm sure she saved my
life.''

`RONIN' IS OLD-FASHIONED FARE IN THE SPIRIT OF `BULLITT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you find yourself nostalgic for an old-fashioned,
no-holds-barred car chase _ on the scale of those signature moments
of 1968's ``Bullitt'' and 1971's ``The French Connection'' _ then
John Frankenheimer's ``Ronin'' is your movie.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the director promised ``the granddaddy of all
car chases'' and he's delivered the goods _ not just one, but two
lavishly suicidal crunch-a-thons: one through the narrow streets of
the Parisian Left Bank, the other along the broad corniches of the
French Riviera.
</P>
<P>
   And the movie itself makes an entertaining thriller, though _ as
always with Frankenheimer, the director of such classics as ``The
Manchurian Candidate'' and ``The Train'' _ it has an off-beat and
enigmatic edge that could frustrate anyone expecting a more
traditional action movie.
</P>
<P>
   The story is about a band of mercenaries recruited in Paris by a
pretty Irish terrorist (Natascha McElhone) for a particularly
difficult caper: the snatching of a valuable, highly protected
suitcase of undisclosed contents in the south of France.
</P>
<P>
   The men are all ex-intelligence agents from various countries
who have been put out of work by the end of the Cold War (``like
ronin samurai without a liege lord,'' one of them explains): an
American (Robert De Niro), a Frenchman (Jean Reno), a Brit (Sean
Bean) and a Russian (Skellan Skarsgard).
</P>
<P>
   It's an art house cast and, at times, it seems like an art house
movie. The various characters' foreign accents _ especially those
of McElhone and Bean _ are so hard to follow they need subtitles,
and it's easy to get lost in the bewildering array of
double-crosses and double-double crosses that drive the plot.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other time in his 40-year career, Frankenheimer's
design seems to be to subordinate everything in his film _
character, story, dialogue, humor _ to his fast-paced style and
disjointed, existential mood. In a way, it's quite demanding, and
it often helps to just turn off the mind and go with the
exhilarating flow.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, everyone and everything do eventually add up and make
sense, and the film ultimately pays off with considerably more
story satisfaction than we usually get in big-budget Hollywood
action spectaculars. All told, ``Ronin'' is a clever piece of
visual story-telling.
</P>
<P>
   It does, however, invite criticism for one bizarre moment: the
unmistakable recreation (in the midst of its second chase sequence)
of the pursuit of Princess Di through the Seine tunnel one year
ago, with the exact same flip-over crash against the tunnel wall.
What is this? A bad-taste in-joke? A ghoulish anniversary tribute?
</P>
<P>
   Ronin. Directed by John Frankenheimer. Screenplay by J.D. Zeik
and Richard Weisz. Cast: Robert De Niro, Jean Reno, Natascha
McElhone, Stellan Skarsgard, Sean Bean. United Artists. 118

`URBAN LEGEND'S' HUMOR JUST DOESN'T CUT IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We all know an urban legend: there's the one about the famous
actor who did something gross with a gerbil; or about the
babysitter who, after being beleagured by frightening phone calls,
discovers the stalker is upstairs in the house.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of using modern, weird tales as the basis for a horror
film must have sounded intriguing on paper and, for the first half
hour or so, ``Urban Legend'' has some potential.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it quickly erodes into a mean-spirited,
ridiculous and sadistic gore-fest that includes a scene with a dog
and a microwave.
</P>
<P>
   True, horror is hip at the box office. Witness the success of
``Scream'' and its sequel and the recent ``Halloween: H2O.'' But
``Urban Legend,'' which actually features a better-than-average
cast, is dull-witted by comparison. It makes a stab at humor but
doesn't cut it. The only amusing character is Loretta Devine, who
plays a campus cop named Reese who practices gunplay while watching
a video of Pam Grier in ``Foxy Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone has lost more than their mind at the peaceful,
gable-and-stone New Hampshire-based Pendleton College campus. A
young coed has just lost her head _ literally _ in a murder that
bears a striking resemblance to an urban legend. Soon the peace and
serenity of the school known as ``the safest in the country'' is
shattered as students and faculty alike begin dying in mysterious
ways based on all kinds of modern myths.
</P>
<P>
   It's up to a young journalism student, Paul (Jared Leto), and
Natalie (Alicia Witt), for whom the killings have become perilously
personal, to discover the reason for the serial murders and the
identity of a killer who has a very sick sense of ``moral
admonition.'' They're aided by Professor Wexler (Robert Englund),
who teaches a class on American Folklore and who is the only
survivor of the Stanley Hall Massacre, a black spot in the school's
stellar history.
</P>
<P>
   Leto and Witt, who are both capable, likeable actors, are wasted
in this outing. The 24-year-old scriptwriter, Silvio Horta, and
director Jamie Blanks give them very little to do except stand
around and look worried and perplexed while they utter some
dreadfully bad lines.
</P>
<P>
   At least supporting actors Devine, Rebecca Gayheart and Joshua
Jackson understand they're not exactly making high art and camp it
up wildly, adding a little spice. But the film itself is eminently
forgettable.
</P>
<P>
   Urban Legend. Directed by Jamie Blanks. Written by Silvio Horta.
Cast: Jared Leto, Alicia Witt, Rebecca Gayheart, Natasha Gregson
Wagner. TriStar Pictures. 100 minutes. Rated R for graphic
violence, language.

`A SOLDIER'S DAUGHTER' IS THE ANTITHESIS OF `MOMMIE DEAREST' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For most of his writing career, James Jones suffered from having
his work compared unfavorably to his landmark first novel, ``From
Here to Eternity.'' Esquire Magazine once even made the morbid case
(``James Jones and the Critics'') that he was possibly the most
critically lambasted American novelist of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   But he's definitely getting the last laugh. His critical
reputation has steadily grown since his 1977 death until he's now
almost universally considered the greatest novelist of the World
War II generation. More recently _ thanks largely to Terrence
Malick's upcoming film version of Jones' 1962 novel, ``The Thin Red
Line'' _ he's once again the hottest writer in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a half-dozen biographies and memoirs that have
appeared in the last 20 years have all made the case that Jones was
that rarity in American letters: a successful novelist who was also
a successful human being. As gifted as he was as a novelist, he was
even better at being a father, husband and friend.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, this unique American success story is not going to be
tarnished by ``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries,'' the
Merchant-Ivory film version of a family memoir written by Jones'
daughter, Kaylie. As a portrait of the artist as a parent, it's the
very antithesis of ``Mommie Dearest'' and the whole
celebrity-parent bashing genre.
</P>
<P>
   The film is also more than just a valentine to Jones' parenting
skills. It's an unusually rich, unconventional and highly original
coming-of-age-in-the-'70s drama, and a bittersweet meditation on
the expatriate life. Frame-for-frame, it's the most totally
satisfying Merchant-Ivory production since ``A Room With a View.''
</P>
<P>
   The script, by James Ivory and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, is divided
into three segments, and opens in the late '60s as the Jones family
_ father (Kris Kristofferson), mother (Barbara Hershey) and young
daughter (Luisa Conlon) _ have left America to live more or less
permanently in a luxury apartment on Paris' fashionable Ille St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The first segment deals mostly with the James and Gloria Jones'
adoption of a French orphan boy: opening with the young mother's
decision to give up her son, his conflict with his slightly jealous
new sister, his difficulties adjusting to his posh new school, and
his gradual bonding with the American family.
</P>
<P>
   The second section follows the daughter, now a teenager (Leelee
Sobieski), through her early adolescence, concentrating on her
problems being an American in a French school, and her relationship
with her best friend and soulmate: an effeminate, illegitimate boy
(Anthony Roth Costanzo) who aspires to be an opera singer.
</P>
<P>
   The third section chronicles the family's decision to return to
their native land in the early '70s, the two teenagers' shaky
adjustment to suburban American life, the death of the
author-father from a congenital heart problem, and the impact this
incomparable loss has on each surviving member of the family.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, this could be the most authentic film biography
ever made of a famous writer. Nothing seems to have been invented,
scenes were filmed in and around the actual Jones apartment on the
Quai d'Orleans, and _ though there's not much physical resemblance
_ the performances of Kristofferson and Hershey could hardly be
more authentic.
</P>
<P>
   But Kaylie Jones wrote her family story as a novel, she changed
the characters names (from Jones to Willis), and she really doesn't
go into any of the famous particulars of Jones' literary life. The
film maintains the limited point-of-view of the daughter character
throughout, and claims the protection of fiction.
</P>
<P>
   And its real power comes less from biographical accuracy than in
its poignant universality as a family drama. Even without the Jones
connection, the film comes off as a splendid collection of
vignettes tracing the childhood of a young American girl in an
alien, often hostile, always magical Paris of the '60s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly effective are the scenes tracing the young
heroine's difficult sexual awakening _ including a pre-adolescent,
quasi-rape by a young neighbor boy that is boldly, yet sensitively,
handled _ and her growing awareness of her famous, rather gruff
father's total, unquestioning love and acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, and in its own unique way, ``A Soldier's Daughter''
is wonderfully reminiscent of the 1962 ``To Kill a Mockingbird.''
Like that classic film, it's about the power of a successful
father-daughter relationship, and it's a celebration of an
unorthodox but completely functional family unit.
</P>
<P>
   A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries. Directed by James Ivory.
Screenplay by Ivory and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala. Cast: Kris
Kristofferson, Barbara Hershey, Leelee Sobieski, Jane Birkin.
October Films. 124 minutes. Rated R for mature themes.

REVISED BOOK REVEALS DARK SIDE OF FUNERAL INDUSTRY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA MCUSIC 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Quick, name the third-largest single household expense after the
house and the car. A pool? A grand piano? A Jacuzzi?
</P>
<P>
   How about your funeral?
</P>
<P>
   The average cost for an adult funeral is a whopping $7,800,
according to the funeral industry. That makes the funeral business
big business.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Houston-based Service Corporation International, a
major chain in the funeral business, took in more than $1.5 billion
in 1995. In 1996, the company sold more than $2.3 billion in
pre-arranged funerals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funeral seller, like any other merchant, is preoccupied
with price, profit, selling techniques,'' who wrote Jessica Mitford
the definitive industry expose, ``The American Way of Death,'' in
1962. ``Thirty years later, the situation seems worse,'' Mitford
writes in an updated version of the material.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Mitford, a self-proclaimed muckraking journalist, saw the
need for an update of her original bestseller. Although Mitford
died last year at age 78, her book is now out and could be just as
popular as the last.
</P>
<P>
   It's called ``The American Way of Death Revisited'' (Alfred A.
Knopf, 296 pages, $25).
</P>
<P>
   In her cut-to-the-chase style, Mitford describes the funeral
industry as an overpriced, unregulated sham that plays on the
public during one of life's most difficult moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sellers of funeral service have, one gathers, a
preconceived, stereotyped view of their customers,'' she writes.
``To them, the bereaved person who enters the funeral establishment
is a bundle of guilt feelings, a snob, and a status seeker.''
</P>
<P>
   Most consumers are not in a mood to shop, are generally
uninformed about the products and are forced into an impulse buy.
Why else would they buy such items as Ko-Zees, shoes for the dead
described as having ``soft, warm, luxurious slipper comfort, but
true shoe smartness.'' Or the Beautyrama Adjustable Soft-Foam Bed,
a quality mattress inside the casket.
</P>
<P>
   And don't get Mitford started on caskets. She discusses topics
from casket arrangement in the showroom to the latest models,
including Batesville's Burping Casket with a permeable seal
designed to ``burp'' out the buildup of methane gas from the
decomposing body, thus avoiding a casket explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Mitford discusses how funeral home personnel and their products
seek to manipulate customers, often quoting directly from trade
publications, annual reports and such publications as the
``Successful Mortuary Operation Service Manual.''
</P>
<P>
   She also provides a good overview of the death industry,
including some interesting statistics. One of the reasons the
industry is so high-priced is because there are approximately
22,000 nationwide, when less than 10,000 are needed, according to
the Funeral and Memorial Societies of America. Based on the death
rate, most funeral homes conduct only one or two funerals a week.
</P>
<P>
   But consolidation, a major industry trend, doesn't seem to be
lowering prices. Corporations such as SCI may own many funeral
homes in a given area but are not passing on economies of scale to
their customers, Mitford writes.
</P>
<P>
   The author also looks at the failings of the industry's primary
regulator, the Federal Trade Commission. In 1995, after years of
inactivity, the FTC conducted what it termed a ``nationwide
crackdown'' on the industry that actually covered just three
states, even though the agency estimated that less than 30 percent
of all mortuaries complied with the pricing disclosure rules.
</P>
<P>
   Mitford ends her book with a chapter on the growth of such
nonprofit watchdog
</P>
<P>
   organizations as the Funeral and Memorial Societies of America.
She includes a state-by-state directory of nonprofit funeral and
memorial societies that provide price surveys and discounts for
members, and she includes toll-free phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Mitford leaves readers with two helpful consumer tips.
One, send a friend to two or more mortuaries to get general price
lists and casket prices, plus the cost of direct cremation or an
immediate burial.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Mitford writes, ``remember, above all, that many funeral
homes have a `no-walk' policy, which means simply that if and when
you start to walk out, the price will come down, down, down until a
level acceptable to you is reached.''

WATERS GOES GENIAL IN OFF-THE-WALL `PECKER' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REGINA HACKETT  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Waters is going soft. His latest comedy is the not-so-black
``Pecker,'' a homage to Waters' hometown of Baltimore and a sweet
little satire of the New York art world.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Furlong, who starred as the kid in danger in ``Terminator
2 _ Judgment Day,'' brings a loopy grace to the title role, playing
a compulsive photographer who's called Pecker because he pecks at
his food. Eating isn't his thing. He'd rather watch and record.
Everywhere he goes he snaps pictures.
</P>
<P>
   What fascinates him? His family and hometown. His mother (Mary
Kay Place) runs a clothing store for the homeless: ``We know how to
make a dollar hollar.'' His dimwitted dad (Mark Joy) runs a bar and
his grandmother (Jean Schertler) sells pit beef sandwiches from a
stand in front of the family home and talks to her statue of the
Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Grandma makes Mary's rubbery mouth move, but instead of the
traditional ``full of grace,'' Grandma has her say, ``full of
grease,'' which is more in keeping with Grandma's line of work.
</P>
<P>
   Pecker's girlfriend Shelley (Christina Ricci) runs a notably
strict laundromat and his best friend Matt (Brendan Sexton III)
shoplifts for a living. Add his big sister Tina (Martha Plimpton),
who hosts a gay strip bar, and his little sister Chrissy (Lauren
Hulsey), the sugar addict, and Waters has a scene that makes the
blighted version of L.A. in Quentin Tarantino's ``Jackie Brown''
look decidedly upscale.
</P>
<P>
   And yet everybody here gets along. Nobody's mad, nobody's
wasting his life, abusing illegal substances, mulling over his
problems or aspiring to greater things. It's one big happy family,
until Pecker's pics hit the big time. New York art dealer Rorey
(Lili Taylor) sees his stuff, loves it and makes him a star.
</P>
<P>
   In loving him, New York patronizes him and unsettles not only
his life but the lives of everybody around him.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the movie's been fun to watch, but predictable. Now
Waters hits his stride, turning the cultural tables in a fun and
inventive way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pecker'' sounds no depths, offers few real insights in art but
creates a happy glow of a good time, full of zinging one-liners and
credible camera work. It isn't Waters at his best, but Waters at
his most relaxed and genial. And the actors are terrific,
especially the deadpan Ricci and darling boy Furlong as Pecker.
</P>
<P>
   Pecker. Directed and written by John Waters. Cast: Edward
Furlong, Christina Ricci, Martha Plimpton, Lili Taylor. Fine Line

`CLAY PIGEONS' IS INCORRIGIBLY MEDIOCRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an interview last month, director Gus Van Zant said he cast
Vince Vaughn for the Norman Bates role in his upcoming remake of
Hitchcock's ``Psycho'' because he wanted ``someone who would take
you off guard'' _ an actor you wouldn't expect to be a serial
murderer.
</P>
<P>
   But it now looks as if Vaughn could be typecast in that role
before the film's December release. Because in ``Clay Pigeons,'' he
plays a vicious murderer of helpless women in a story that seems to
be inspired, ironically enough, by Hitchcock's ``Strangers On a
Train.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's not exactly an auspicious matching of actor and role,
either. In fact, he gives a fairly hammy performance in what is an
incorrigibly mediocre movie. If his ``Psycho'' turn isn't quite a
few notches above this one, Anthony Perkins can continue to rest in
peace.
</P>
<P>
   The film is about a smalltown Montana auto mechanic named Clay
(Joaquin Phoenix), whose best friend (Gregory Sporleder) _
devastated by his discovery that Clay is having an affair with his
wife _ kills himself in the opening scene and makes it appear that
Clay is the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   When the wife (Georgina Cates) starts to sexually blackmail him,
she in turn is murdered by an affable stranger named Lester
(Vaughn) who _ as in Hitchcock's ``Strangers'' _ commits the murder
to ingratiate himself with the hero, expecting friendship, approval
and reciprocation.
</P>
<P>
   Out of this situation, first-time director David Dobkin tries to
construct a typical Hitchcockian drama that gets more ironic and
darkly humorous as the innocent hero struggles desperately to get
out of his mess, and only looks more and more guilty to the world.
</P>
<P>
   But the film somehow manages to lose its way in the first act,
and never recovers. Indeed, it's so incompetent that it plays its
big dramatic scene _ Phoenix, locked up in jail and thus
agonizingly unable to prevent Vaughn from murdering a young girl _
in a cell with bars set so wide apart that Orson Welles would slip
through them!
</P>
<P>
   The cast has a few bright spots _ the usual good work from Scott
Wilson and Georgina Cates. But the two leads are weak: Phoenix
simply looks too malevolent to be very credible as a wronged
innocent, and Vaughn is at a loss to find that element which made
all the great Hitchcock villains come alive _ a point of sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Clay Pigeons. Directed by David Dobkin. Written by Matt Healy.

`WRITE' TRAPPED IN A PEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harold McMurphy is a nice guy, a good son _ and he perceives
himself as such a loser, even his daydreams end with him getting
dumped.
</P>
<P>
   Harold is a Hollywood tour-bus driver who would be happy with
his job if only people cared more about film history than about
contemporary action heroes. His low self-esteem leads him to take a
lot of bad advice _ none of which includes ``be yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder that when Harold meets Amanda Clark, his favorite
actress, he leads her to believe that he's a hotshot screenwriter.
Or rather, she leads herself to believe it _ and he doesn't stop
her.
</P>
<P>
   That's the premise of ``Just Write,'' which _ despite likable
characters and performances _ just doesn't feel quite right. It
seems like a screenwriter's daydream, one in which he gets the
pretty actress, who's really just a person like everyone else. But
it's a daydream built on a shaky foundation. Take away any one
element _ Harold's lie, Amanda's gullibility, the pigheadedness of
Harold's father, the unusually understanding writer's agent, the
self-absorption of the Hollywood players who don't want to admit
they've never heard of Harold _ and the whole thing would fall
apart.
</P>
<P>
   The movie provides a few reasons to forgive its contrivances,
but they're not quite enough to put it in the win column. Like
``Second Chances,'' another small-budget indie released this year,
its primary virtue is its lack of cynicism _ this movie wants to
entertain more than it wants to make big bucks. Although Stan
Williamson's script is formulaic, it does get in some funny digs at
Hollywood _ enough that you wish it would go further _ and it
appreciates the past: You don't see too many movies these days
where the characters sing the praises of ``All About Eve'' and
``Sunset Boulevard.'' And, to the movie's credit, it doesn't think
it's on the same plane as those classics.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Piven, dropping his wiseacre act, and Sherilyn Fenn, in a
sweet role that's far from the weirdness of ``Twin Peaks'' and
``Boxing Helena,'' are charming in the lead roles, and JoBeth
Williams is funny as Amanda's cell-phone-addicted agent. Director
Andrew Gallerani keeps a loose hand on a fairly large cast, unusual
for a graduate of directing commercials _ they usually want to show
all the flash they can. His lack of self-consciousness is another
point in the movie's favor.
</P>
<P>
   The movie was produced by former Arlington resident Heath
McLaughlin, whose own story (not to mention initials) echoes
Harold's a little: After longtime work as an extra, the former
military pilot decided to produce a script himself, and with
investments from some Wisconsin dentists, picked this script out of
350 submitted in response to an ad in trade publications. The film
has played well at festivals, and it has an appealing innocence
that borders on naivete. McLaughlin's working on another film _
time will tell what he has learned from experience.

UNPARALLELED BAD TASTE, DONE BY THE MASTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TODD CAMP 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Writer/director John Waters was disgusting when disgusting
wasn't cool. Before the Pythons were vomiting in restaurants,
before Mel Brooks found flatulence funny and before the Farrelly
Brothers discovered a new kind of hair gel _ the granddaddy of the
gross-out was outdoing them all. And with the arrival of his latest
picture, ``Pecker,'' this weekend, Waters proves he can still turn
a stomach while getting a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Furlong is an amiable amateur photographer called
``Pecker'' _ a nickname he supposedly earned from pecking at his
food as a child. Armed with an old camera rescued from the junk
shop run by his mother (Texan Mary Kay Place), Pecker patrols his
lower-class Baltimore neighborhood snapping shots of angry
suburbanites, copulating rodents and his twisted little family.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the young shooter couldn't ask for better subject
matter than his Catholic grandmother talking to her ventriloquist
Virgin Mary doll; his foul-mouthed sister (Martha Plimpton)
introducing male strippers at The Fudge Palace, the local gay bar;
his best friend Matt (''Welcome to the Dollhouse's'' Brendan Sexton
III) showing off his shoplifting prowess; or his sullen-but-sexy
laundromat worker girlfriend Shelley (Christina Ricci).
</P>
<P>
   After he throws together a makeshift show at his day job _
slinging burgers in the local greasy spoon _ Pecker's pictures
capture the attention of a visiting art dealer (Lili Taylor) who
brings his twisted visions to folks who might really appreciate
them ... New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   He's an overnight sensation, of course, along with his
less-than-willing photo subjects, but after riding high on the
crest of big-figure sales, loquacious boot-licking from the
art-critic set and celebrity hobnobbing, Pecker and his pals are
given a crash course in the high price of fame.
</P>
<P>
   But fear not, Waters isn't about to let the Big Apple get the
last bite.
</P>
<P>
   Waters fans from way back have watched the filmmaker's wilder
days give way to more mainstream fare. After such tasteless titles
as ``Pink Flamingos'' and ``Desperate Living,'' Waters' more
contemporary films like ``Hairspray'' and ``Cry-Baby'' seem tame by
comparison. ``Pecker'' is his first picture in a while that should
please his hard-core fans while remaining approachable (albeit
disturbing) to the arthouse set.
</P>
<P>
   Professional brooder Furlong actually seems cheerful in this
one, and Ricci is delightful, as always. But Waters has never been
big on realistic portrayals. He likes his performers to take a cue
from their tacky surroundings and play it larger than life _ and
they don't disappoint. Throw in Waters' regulars Patricia Hearst
and Mink Stole, and you've got a deliciously tasteless, satirically
silly and unnervingly hilarious night at the movies.
</P>
<P>
   Would you expect anything less from the man who literally wrote
the book on bad taste?

<TEXT>
<P>
   (begin italics) ``Do I look bad?'' the soldier pleads.
</P>
<P>
   Half his face is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Frost hurriedly dresses the raw shreds that remain. There
are still men moaning on gurneys in the rain outside the operating
tent.
</P>
<P>
   Her hands shake from the chilling damp that seeps through the
canvas walls. Her thin leather boots are coated with mud. Blood is
smeared across her nurse's uniform.
</P>
<P>
   She tries to block out the sound of limbs dropping into enamel
pails as surgeons saw through mangled flesh and bones.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment she presses her hand against her eyes. Sometimes
the men in their misery make her cry.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   Eighty years later her hand still goes to her eyes when she
recalls that scene.
</P>
<P>
   At 105, Laura Frost Smith travels easily in her mind to 1918 and
the Western Front, a war zone that separated her from her youth.
</P>
<P>
   Today she is one of the oldest known living American veterans of
World War I, a war that marked the first time women officially
served in the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
   She is also my grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   I had mixed emotions on learning of this latest milestone in my
grandmother's life.
</P>
<P>
   Her other accomplishments are more dear to me _ the lemon cake
she baked when I was a child, the parade of hand-knit socks and
mittens for Christmas, her skilled watercolors, prized garden and
the stories she told of growing up on a farm near Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The war was almost never mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Her military service was such a small sliver of her life. Like a
single tree ring lost in the dense coil that holds a life together,
it hardly seemed significant as I was growing up.
</P>
<P>
   I could barely remember the contours of the war drawn in history
classes, let alone picture my grandmother serving at five of its
bloodiest fronts. To me they were just names printed on tiny brass
bars and clasped to the ribbon of the Victory Medal in a glass box
on her wall.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the women who served in the Great War are gone now.
Ignored when they came home and forgotten by subsequent
generations, most never had a chance to tell their stories.
</P>
<P>
   So I went in search of this part of my grandmother's life. I
visited her earlier this month at the Meadows care center in Los
Gatos, Calif., where she lives now. For three days we sat together
in the sun beside a lemon tree, while I looked for pathways through
her memory that would take me with her to that place and time.
</P>
<P>
   She is still beautiful, and though her eyesight and hearing are
failing, there are still flashes of her keen mind and wicked sense
of humor. She remembers.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't where I found the pieces I was looking for.
</P>
<P>
   I went back, instead, to the letters she sent home from the war,
and to a family memoir she wrote in her 90s.
</P>
<P>
   There, in her own words, I found a young woman I never knew, a
woman who went off to see the world, and in the process helped
change it.
</P>
<P>
   Her year at war not only shaped her life in ways I had never
understood, it had also helped shape mine.
</P>
<P>
   Give me girls
</P>
<P>
   Laura Frost was an unconventional woman even before she went to
war.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1893, she grew up on a small farm in East Taunton, Mass.
Her father, George, grew vegetables that her mother made into
pickles they sold in town.
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother, the youngest of three daughters, was given the
middle name ``Georgina,'' for the son her parents didn't have, and
she learned to work the land accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   She went to a one-room school where boys and girls had separate
entrances, but there was no such division of labor at home. ``Give
me girls every time,'' her father would tell her years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister and I proved to him we could do our share working
the farm,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So it seemed natural to do her share when the call went out for
volunteers to fight the war that had been raging across Europe
since 1914. Her graduation from nursing school nearly coincided
with the U.S. declaration of war on the Germans on April 6, 1917.
</P>
<P>
   Her training hospital, working with the Red Cross, organized
military Base 44. ``Most of my class signed up for it,'' she wrote
in her memoir. She was sworn in on Feb. 15, 1918, and sent to Fort
Oglethorpe, Ga., for training.
</P>
<P>
   She went to war for adventure. She had no idea how much her life
was about to change.
</P>
<P>
   When she signed up, women couldn't vote and men were deeply
suspicious of those who were educated. According to scientists of
the day, women's smaller brains were not equipped for higher
education, and too much thinking was believed to impair their
childbearing capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Only five years earlier, the sinking of the Titanic and the cry
of ``women and children first'' had inflamed arguments about female
roles in society. To traditionalists, the Titanic proved that women
belonged to a special class, one requiring protection by _ not
equality with _ men.
</P>
<P>
   That left no room for women on the battlefield. But some women
saw it differently.
</P>
<P>
   When the United States entered the war, there were 403 Army
nurses on active duty. By Armistice Day, 19 months later, more than
21,000 had enlisted and about 10,000 had seen duty overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Such a good time
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of the country, my grandmother entered the war
with high spirits and a certain innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know I have never had such a good time in my life as I
have had this last two weeks,'' she wrote from training camp on
March 4, 1918. ``One thing I have learned already _ and had to if I
was to live at all _ that is to dance. Can you imagine fox-trotting
and waltzing with majors and captains?''
</P>
<P>
   She was soon swept up in her first real romance _ a love affair
with a dashing first lieutenant. Pete Herzog wooed her with
dinners, dancing and shows _ heady experiences for a tomboy whose
social life had centered mostly on the annual clambake at her tiny
church or the occasional ride in a horse-drawn sleigh.
</P>
<P>
   In letters home, she referred often to her lieutenant. He taught
her military marching maneuvers and stood at attention as she
passed by in her first parade. Before they left for Europe, he gave
her a diamond service pin as a pledge of love, and she promised to
write him through the war.
</P>
<P>
   Though the romance thrilled her, she never lost sight of her
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Assigned to the psychiatric ward at training camp, she
encountered a shellshocked patient sent home from battle: ``The
first day I went into the ward after lunch, I found everyone
cringing into corners or under their beds. A young fellow was
brandishing a straight razor. I didn't know what was happening but
went right up to him and yelled: `Give me that!' He smiled and
handed me the open razor.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger of battle, however, still felt a long way off, and in
some ways the war seemed like a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so happy to think that we are at last on the way,'' she
wrote from training camp. ``. . . We'll soon have the Huns on the
run and be home in no time.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were signs that fantasies of war were about to end.
</P>
<P>
   One day a friend asked her to go horseback riding. She accepted,
but at the last minute changed her plans and asked a fellow nurse
to take her place.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was so pleased to think that she was going for a ride, and
in five minutes she was thrown and died three hours later,'' my
grandmother wrote home.
</P>
<P>
   Sobered by the death, the nurses marched behind her hearse in a
military funeral. ``I never realized what taps meant before, until
they sounded for her at the station,'' she wrote. ``None of us have
very much pep since it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 17, 1918, the base hospital moved by train from Georgia
to New York to prepare for the trip to France.
</P>
<P>
   The timing meant the nurses would get to march 60 blocks in New
York City's Fourth of July parade. It would be one of the first
times American military women had ever marched alongside men. It
would also provide her first glimpse of how the rest of the country
viewed women in the Army.
</P>
<P>
   On July 6, 1918, she wrote: ``It really was a wonderful parade.
... They didn't say much about the nurses in it. We thought we were
the whole show. They just said 400 (women) marched and there were
at least 1,400. It is funny, because a paper usually exaggerates so
much.''
</P>
<P>
   It made her feel important to march then, she said during my
recent visit. The irony is not lost on her, even all these years
later.
</P>
<P>
   When she came home after the war, people would barely notice.
</P>
<P>
   Over there
</P>
<P>
   On July 14, 1918, she sailed on the troop ship Northland for the
18-day trip to Liverpool and then Le Havre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never knew how many ships were in our convoy, but I guessed
about 18,'' she wrote in her memoir. ``That month, about 300,000
troops went over. We were told to throw nothing overboard, as any
floating objects would reveal our course to any lurking
submarine.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucked in her small Army trunk was a box camera and developing
fluid _ despite warnings they were not to take pictures.
</P>
<P>
   By Aug. 4, she had left Paris and was on duty in Evacuation No.
7, a field hospital in the VO Surg District in France.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it hadn't been the amputation ward, maybe the shock
wouldn't have been so devastating,'' she wrote. ``But helping dress
those quivering stumps and hearing the laughter and jokes in spite
of their misfortune was too much for me and I cried all that first
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they had made a mistake by putting us through that
experience so soon, but maybe it was for the good and I could stand
anything after that miserable week.''
</P>
<P>
   The nurses sent closest to the front were equipped with a
helmet, gas mask, mess kit and canteen. She was one of them.
</P>
<P>
   They headed straight into the horror of the first ``modern''
war. Poison gas, aerial bombardments and machine guns were being
used for the first time. In four years of madness, more than 65
million men would go to war. Many were slaughtered in the bellies
of trenches that gashed the length of France.
</P>
<P>
   The terrorist bullet that took the life of Archduke Franz
Ferdinand ended up gutting a generation. The casualties _ more than
8 million by war's end _ left a deep scar across several
continents.
</P>
<P>
   Mud and blood
</P>
<P>
   Mobile hospitals at the front worked frantically to save what
was left of men's bodies as they came in. But the damage was
frequently too great. Double amputations were common.
</P>
<P>
   Many died on the operating tables. Sometimes they arrived on
stretchers, scared yet hopeful, their young faces untouched. But
when their uniforms were cut away, they would be nearly shot in
two. Nurses could do nothing but hold their hands as they died.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the women spoke of their experiences, even decades later,
silenced as much by trauma as social norms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was too sad,'' my grandmother said during my recent visit.
``So many hurt boys. Seeing the stumps and their bones . . .'' She
could not finish.
</P>
<P>
   From her original hospital, my grandmother was dispatched closer
to the front. She went with Evac 5 to what had been a town on the
River Marne. The unit, totaling about 1,000 beds, received
casualties directly from the trenches. Each operating tent had 10
surgery tables in use around the clock. At full capacity, the
hospital had about 48 nurses, each handling 20 patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the wounded began to come in, the stretchers were laid on
the ground and the corpsmen stripped them of their muddy clothes
and deloused them, usually before we received them in the operating
tent,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The most seriously wounded were operated on right away, and
those who could stand the journey were evacuated to base hospitals
farther from the front.
</P>
<P>
   The nurses worked under primitive conditions, layering men's
socks and underwear under their uniforms for warmth, sleeping on
the ground or cots in their tents, sometimes subsisting on little
more than beans and hardtack. They worked eight hours on and eight
hours off, around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the afternoon off today for the first time,'' she wrote
home. ``With so much time on my hands I didn't know what to do so I
slept till supper time. Then tonight we went out to get water in
our canteens and took a little walk. . . . The moon looked so
pretty tonight shining on the ruins.''
</P>
<P>
   During the bitter-cold fall of 1918, rain drilled down
relentlessly. They pitched their camps in fields filled with
viscous, sucking mud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing we have to contend with is the mud,'' she
wrote home. ``The blankets on the cots hang over into it and then
they get all wet and so dirty you dread to put them on the patient.
Then the pillows and cots get wet through the tent. Believe me,
it's some mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight decades later, it isn't hard for her to remember what was
different from what she had expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mud,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the blood.''
</P>
<P>
   A long, long trail
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in their training had prepared them for the kind of
nursing they would have to do.
</P>
<P>
   The patients, especially the brain injuries, made them
heartsick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Margaret and I became very fond of one of our patients and
kept him several days, trying to get him to talk,'' she wrote. ``He
was only about 18 years old and had a bullet hole right in the
middle of his forehead. All he could say was `glass,' but he wasn't
paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he wanted something, we would keep asking him until we
hit the right thing and he would nod his head. One day Margaret
sang `Over There' to him, and he followed along saying all the
words. That was a great day for us. When he was evacuated, we went
to the train with him and sat by his litter until the train pulled
out.''
</P>
<P>
   They taught another brain-damaged patient to say, ``Good night,
nurse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He says, `Good night' for everything he wants,'' she wrote.
``They were singing to him yesterday and he joined in and said
`long, long trail' quite plainly. I couldn't stay to hear any more,
for it is going to be a long, long trail for him. We had quite a
time tonight trying to find out what he wanted and would you
believe it was a cigarette?''

<P>
   Shattered brains, bullet holes and severed limbs weren't the
only wounds they saw. The use of poisonous gases _ mustard gas,
chlorine, phosgene and other toxic aerosols _ increased toward the
war's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Germans were getting desperate now and used more and more
mustard gas,'' she wrote. ``Our casualties were 20 and 30 percent
gassed. It made huge blisters on them and they suffered painfully.
Even though they were cleaned, I sometimes got a whiff of the
miserable stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   For nurses, flu was even more deadly. More than 400 died in the
line of duty, most from Spanish influenza, a virulent strain that
swept the world in 1918 and 1919, killing 21 million.
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother fell sick with the flu immediately after the
Meuse-Argonne Offensive, one of the war's decisive battles.
</P>
<P>
   She spent several days in a coma. ``I came to one day and found
myself in a regular hospital bed in a little tent all by myself,''
she wrote. ``I hadn't seen a bed before, as all our patients were
put on army cots when they came in and that's what we slept on,
too. The head nurse took care of me and I'm sure she saved my
life.''

   ``Ronin'' has a brisk and merciless pace _ it's like a movie put
together by an assassin. It has its moments, but director John
Frankenheimer boils the ingredients _ action, international
terrorism, desperate men down on their luck _ until the film
collapses into a muddled stew.
</P>
<P>
   Robert De Niro takes a rare turn as an action hero. De Niro has
lately developed an indistinct quality; he's become the Unabomber
of performers, efficient, but making you wonder if you'd spotted
him on the premises or just someone who suggests him.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Ronin,'' he's Sam, a former CIA operative who joins a group
of dispossessed experts hired by a no-nonsense boss (Natascha
McElhone) to get their hands on a mysterious suitcase. These men _
Vincent (Jean Reno), Gregor (Stellan Skarsgard), Larry (Skipp
Sudduth) and Spence (Sean Bean) _ mossy with three-day growth, are
the ``Ronin'' of the movie, soldiers without a cause.
</P>
<P>
   Although the movie appears to be ``Mission: Impossible'' for the
AARP, it makes sense to assemble a group of misfits with
experience. (Reno, however, looks like he was born resembling a
45-year-old.) ``Ronin'' is reminiscent of ``The Dirty Dozen'' or
``The Wages of Fear.'' Each of the guys is a loser who's
unemployable in the intelligence/underworld community in Europe,
probably after the collapse of the Cold War; there's no place left
for them in the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronin'' could be looked upon as a metaphor for older leading
men and directors in Hollywood; Frankenheimer is in his 70s.
Wisely, the picture doesn't belabor that point; it's left for us to
discover this on our own.
</P>
<P>
   De Niro's Sam nods and snarls his lines as if he's doing an
imitation of the De Niro impression that Alec Baldwin toted out on
``Saturday Night Live.'' Many of them, all-business wisecracks,
were penned by David Mamet (under the pseudonym Richard Weisz).
</P>
<P>
   When De Niro tried a turn as an action hero 10 years ago, in
Martin Brest's ``Midnight Run,'' he seemed lost in The Land That
The Method Forgot. In ``Ronin,'' a movie that's whittled away to
mere filigree, he's a better fit, but it's not a role written for
him. And when one of the group turns out to be a traitor, the first
of several meaningless twists, the tension level is cranked up
superficially.
</P>
<P>
   The movie ends up resting on the shoulders of Jean Reno, who's
patient, loyal and sad, a ratty pooch who sticks with his pals.
</P>
<P>
   Frankenheimer proves he's better at action set pieces than any
young, music video-reverent director; there's a draftman's
confidence in his camera framing, even when the pursuit is on foot.
But it's not his low-key approach that makes the movie less than
what it could have been. It's that ``Ronin'' lacks emotional
undercurrents. It's cynical and uninvolving.

`CELEBRITY': JOSTLING AND STUMBLING TOWARD A FATEFUL 15 MINUTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At the opening of this year's New York Film Festival
at Lincoln Center Friday night, the scene will be one of
quintessential, flashbulb-popping New York life in the fast lane _
and some of that may even be offscreen.
</P>
<P>
   But the main attraction is a look at Manhattan's brand of
specious fame through Woody Allen's not unexpectedly jaundiced eye
in ``Celebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Long overdue to open the foremost film event in New York, a city
made magical by most of his 27 films, Allen presents a world in
which the VIP status of Joey Buttafuoco (seen fleetingly on a talk
show) makes as much sense as anything else.
</P>
<P>
   He envisions a barely imaginary television Green Room where the
Mafia don and the Klansman talk about the William Morris Agency,
and where the rabbi's main concern about the skinheads is that
they've eaten all the bagels.
</P>
<P>
   He wonders whether being able to provide Knicks season tickets
and hot restaurant reservations for relatives can be the highest
form of breadwinning in ``a culture that took a wrong turn
somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Famous for trashing hotel rooms? For being in a coma? For
reading the weather report on television? In the glitter-crazy
world of ``Celebrity,'' the only fate emptier than being famous for
practically nothing is not being famous at all.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what befalls the film's main character, a
journalist peering into the lives of the famous with his nose
pressed to the glass, when he embarks on a string of
neo-Felliniesque encounters with the rogue's gallery of celebrities
seen here.
</P>
<P>
   Playing this role in an exceptional feat of mimicry, Kenneth
Branagh assumes the corduroy mantle of Allen and takes on the full
panoply of self-effacing nervous mannerisms (``Really? Great,
great, 'cause I don't wanna be, uh ... '') as assiduously as if he
were tackling ``Richard III.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the film allows this character, a dolce vita hanger-on
lacking anything like the Mastroianni magnetism, to violate one of
the most basic rules of celebrity culture. Even at its most
fatuous, fame is about being one of a kind.
</P>
<P>
   And Allen is the only man who can save these tics from whiny
obsequiousness and, with such agile genius, make them work.
</P>
<P>
   So the journalist Lee Simon is one of the filmmaker's wearier
creations, in ways that deny ``Celebrity'' the bracing audacity of
recent, better Allen films like ``Deconstructing Harry'' and
``Everyone Says I Love You.'' And even with Branagh as his younger
alter ego, Allen finds no way to revitalize the character's
predictable worries about advancing his career and chasing
beautiful women.
</P>
<P>
   This film's central situation, involving the post-divorce
romances of Lee and his high-strung ex-wife, Robin (Judy Davis),
becomes little more than a pretext for watching fame crop up in the
most peculiar places. There are a handful of fabulous caricatures
in Allen's Manhattan sketchbook, but the film too easily allows
these peripheral figures to outshine its central story.
</P>
<P>
   Surprise: the most wildly famous figure whom Lee encounters
happens also to be this film's hottest star. In a devilishly
satirical sequence midway through the film, Leonardo DiCaprio
(uncannily well cast before the release of ``Titanic'') bursts into
the story while trashing a hotel room at the Stanhope and slapping
around his equally hysterical moll (actually Gretchen Mol). Just as
the police are being summoned, Lee arrives to pitch his screenplay
to the bad-boy wonder and is caught up in the frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's screenplay and the show-stopping DiCaprio are shrewdly
perfect when it comes to the star's whims, the entourage that lives
on his borrowed glory, and the cunning flattery with which this
actor keeps Lee dangling.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you writers are so sensitive!'' the young super nova
complains when Lee hesitates about joining him in the druggy orgy
that is rendered with especially evil glee.
</P>
<P>
   Says the groupie who's been relegated to Lee in quite a crowded
bedroom scene: ``I wrote some film scripts. You ever heard of
Chekhov? I write like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Several other guest-star segments in ``Celebrity'' stand out in
equally bright, witty relief. ``You're going to send off those
truffles to the president,'' Melanie Griffith's pampered movie
queen instructs her staff members, just before drifting into a very
funny brief encounter with Lee.
</P>
<P>
   In a sequence that frames the film, her character is seen making
a movie-within-the-movie that calls for her to get out of a car and
stride across the sidewalk. A woman this famous can even be
flattered for her brilliant body language in the atmosphere that
``Celebrity'' describes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yet another dazzling vignette presents Charlize Theron emerging
from her cocoon of clean-cut roles (as in ``Devil's Advocate'') to
play a stunning, imperious model who takes Lee in tow.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Allen shows a keenly acerbic eye for the scene he
sets (downtown hip, with Isaac Mizrahi as a painter who complains
about being too popular) while letting it upstage the putative
center of the film.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``Celebrity'' is filled with beautiful and famous faces,
it has plenty of opportunity to bog down between star turns, and
some of the episodes about the Simons are astonishingly flat. Lee's
high-school reunion, where he is filled with contempt for his aging
classmates and myopic self-involvement, is a sequence as dismal as
his quip: ``Ask not for whom the bell tolls _ or more accurately,
for whom the toilet flushes.''
</P>
<P>
   While Lee drifts among glamorous women (with Famke Janssen as a
svelte book editor and bewitchingly flirty Winona Ryder as an
ambitious waitress-actress), Robin fumes and tries desperate
measures.
</P>
<P>
   She visits a religious retreat where the priest with the
television show signs autographs. She goes to a plastic surgeon
(Michael Lerner) who's been dubbed ``the Michelangelo of
Manhattan'' by Newsweek.She begins dating a television producer
(Joe Mantegna) who takes her to a screening of a film he finds
pretentiously shot in black and white.
</P>
<P>
   (``Celebrity'' is, of course, also shot in black and white,
enhanced by the superb clarity of Sven Nykvist's cinematography.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Davis plays Robin in a harried, antic manner at first, then
softens sweetly as she evolves into the film's most unlikely
luminary. A scene in which she's taught about oral sex by a famous
prostitute (Bebe Neuwirth) provides another surprisingly
flat-footed moment, though Robin has a good answer to the question
of what oral sex makes her think about: ``The Crucifixion.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Davis also gets to deliver the film's obvious message in a
single unremarkable line: ``You can tell a lot about a society by
who it chooses to celebrate.'' But most of what you can tell from
the fun-house mirrors of ``Celebrity'' is what you already know.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's program begins with an inventive, abstract short,
Jeff Scher's ``Yours,'' with a breathless parade of thousands of
patterns and images incorporated into five minutes of a nostalgic
song. Also at the start of the evening is a clever, smoothly
animated film clip promoting the festival's sponsor, Grand Marnier.
This year's clip is as pleasing as last year's was unbearable. &QL;

<P>
   A different front
</P>
<P>
   The nurses coped with wrenching wounds and death, filth and the
flu, the threat of shells and poison gas. But they were also
fighting a battle on a different front.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving a letter from home with news that her town was
displaying a flag for the nurses, she wrote: ``I'm glad someone
appreciates the nurses. The patients are the only ones here that
do. ... We just have to fight for our very existence here.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, when the Army passed out tickets to receive donated
Christmas packages from America, they skipped the nurses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry about our Christmas, no one over here worries
about us, so why should you?'' she wrote her mother and father.
``We weren't given any cards or tickets or anything else, so we are
just out of luck. `S.O.L.' they say in the army. When I get back,
you won't understand my language, not because it is French or
German either.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their difficulties, the nurses found ways to endure, and
even raise their spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we were invited to dances,'' she wrote. ``The
English and French could go home for rest, but it was too far for
the Americans, so recreation was planned in plays and dances.''
</P>
<P>
   Humor helped them survive.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, they were loaded onto trains for transport.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (nurses) were fortunate to have a toilet on board, but the
men stopped along the way at different sidings,'' she wrote. ``One
of our nice doctors was caught with his pants down when the train
started up unexpectedly. He really got an ovation from the crowd as
he scrambled aboard clutching his clothes. We made fun out of every
little incident and were hilarious at times.''
</P>
<P>
   Letters helped, too _ especially from her lieutenant friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had a letter from Pete,'' she wrote home. ``He may be in the
next town for all I know. He censors his own mail but is a very
good soldier and wouldn't say a thing that wasn't right. Some
people at home think that your mail coming this way is opened, but
it isn't ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``... Marg Cooper got a letter from one of the girls at the base
today. It surely must be a wonderful place, but we are satisfied
with this wild and woolly life until the snow flies at least. ...
Our tent is pitched on a kind of a hill and even though I have my
cot propped up, my head is usually lower than my feet, and
sometimes I wake up and find the bunk has sort of skidded during
the night and my head is outside, with the flap of the tent forming
a bib. Oh it's a great life if you don't weaken. . . . It may not
be quite as comfortable as the little bungalows (at the base
hospital) . . . but I like it fine.''
</P>
<P>
   And when there were no letters, they sang to keep their courage
up.
</P>
<P>
   After pitching tents near Ypres, she wrote: ``. . . The boys
found three pianos while they were searching the dugouts. They say
some of the dugouts the Germans had were carpeted. Last night they
brought one of the pianos back to camp and put it up in the Red
Cross hut. Someone was clever enough to tune it and a lot of the
boys can play, so we had quite a concert.''
</P>
<P>
   They sang all the songs written for the war, sometimes devising
their own lyrics. For one called ``The Rose of No Man's Land,''
they substituted the words: `` 'Neath the war's red curse stands
the Cross Red Nurse. She's the rose of no man's land.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Army now
</P>
<P>
   The lighter moments helped them keep their fear in check. They
relocated the tent hospitals frequently, often on 24 hours notice,
so they could go where casualties were heaviest. They would pack 12
nurses to an ambulance and space their vehicles miles apart, so
planes wouldn't detect their moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The devastation along our route was unbelievable,'' she wrote.
``Houses just a pile of rubble, dead cows in the fields, bloated
bodies of horses along the muddy roads where rats were scurrying
out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they were several miles from the front, they were still
at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We soon learned the sound of a German Fokker plane,'' she
wrote. ``It didn't have the same droning sound of the Allied ones
and we hardly waited for the sound of the alarm to take cover. . .
. It seemed cruel to leave the bed patients, but (it was)
reasonable that someone should be left to take care of them in case
the hospital was bombed.''
</P>
<P>
   On the troop ship over, she had written her parents: ``. . . Now
mother, imagine us having such good times and everyone at home
worrying their heads off about us. You know, Uncle Sam is pretty
clever and I am sure I have never been safer in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Four months later, any romantic illusions she'd harbored about
the war had disappeared, replaced by an appreciation for the
paradox and futility of battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one at home has the faintest idea how they are getting
killed (here),'' she wrote home. ``... I'm sure no one realizes the
suffering of the boys. It's their spirit that affects me. I can
watch them amputate a leg and dress a wound that is open from the
hip down, but when a boy tells you he is sorry he lost (his leg)
because it puts him out and he can't go back, well I have to walk
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Daily, the medical teams fixed up men to be shot to pieces
again. At the same time, in the same tents, they worked to save
enemy prisoners _ the same men Allied soldiers were trying
desperately to kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of my ward there were several wounded German
prisoners, young towheaded, blue-eyed boys,'' she wrote. ``A guard
stood over them with a .45. Having American and German patients
together brought home the fact of how stupid any war is.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other absurdities.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1918, blacks and whites were kept separate even when sick
in the hospital,'' she wrote in her memoir. ``White orderlies were
supposed to give the personal care to the men, but when one refused
to give an enema to a black man, I was so angry I put up a screen
and took care of the patient myself. He was very grateful and that
was the only time I was ever thanked for giving an enema.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman who had signed her early letters home ``From your
soldier girl,'' and gaily referred to being ``in the Army now,''
had hardened into a pragmatic realist and passionate pacifist. She
would become a lifelong believer in equal rights.
</P>
<P>
   Coming home
</P>
<P>
   If the war began a personal transformation that defined the rest
of her life, it also began a transformation of women in general
back home.
</P>
<P>
   After more than 50 years of pressure from suffragists, it was
the women who served in WWI who finally shamed the government into
taking action on the right to vote.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1919, less than a year after the war ended, the U.S.
Senate passed the 19th Amendment. Women marked ballots for the
first time in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   By breaking the military's gender barrier, the 33,000 women who
served in WWI spurred other social changes. By WWII, women
encountered fewer barriers to serving, and more than 10 times that
number signed up. At war's end, thousands of them took up work in
fields previously dominated by men.
</P>
<P>
   But my grandmother couldn't know back then _ just as the war was
ending _ how it would affect her life or her country. She was
simply excited to be coming home safely.
</P>
<P>
   ``About Nov. 7th, we began to hear rumors that the armistice was
being planned,'' she wrote in her memoir. ``We didn't believe it,
for we still heard the guns and the wounded were still coming in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, one day, the 11th of November, everything became
quiet about 11 a.m. and you wondered what was different. There
wasn't a sound, for there were no birds to sing, or no cows to moo.
We still couldn't believe it possible, as we had so many patients.
A group of French trumpeters came in the afternoon and played for
us, so that was the only celebration we had.''
</P>
<P>
   By the Armistice, her unit had treated 15,000 casualties.
</P>
<P>
   It would be six more months before she got orders to go home.
She continued to care for the wounded, but with the war over, she
also spent time in Paris, Monaco and the French Alps.
</P>
<P>
   Though the shelling had stopped, the war continued to wound in
unexpected ways.
</P>
<P>
   While on leave in Nice, my grandmother bumped into a friend of
the first lieutenant she'd fallen in love with during training
camp, the man whose letters she read and reread when she was off
duty. She was told her lieutenant would arrive in the same city the
next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``With great expectation, Margaret and I went to the train to
meet him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had lost weight and looked very tired and just gave a nod
of recognition when we greeted him. We all got in a taxi and he saw
that we got off at our hotel, then he went on to where the officers
were staying.''
</P>
<P>
   She later learned he had been gassed and wounded, and his best
friend had been blown apart beside him in a trench two days before
the Armistice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw him again, and sent the little service pin back to
him by a messenger.''
</P>
<P>
   But heartache couldn't dampen her excitement at going home. On
May 31, 1919, she boarded the Cape Finesterre bound for America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming into New York harbor was an unforgettable event,'' she
wrote. ``Tugboats and fireboats came out to meet us and in my
exuberance, I flung my blue straw hat right at the Statue of
Liberty. Bands were playing and toilet paper was strung all over
the ship like confetti on a happy cruise ship.''
</P>
<P>
   She didn't know then that the celebration would be short-lived,
that she was returning to a country not ready to hear her stories
or those of the other women who served.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saying goodbye to all the friends we had made in the service
was very sobering,'' she wrote. ``On the train and the streetcar
home, I never felt so depressed and forlorn in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Though dressed in full uniform ``no one knew or noticed I was a
returning veteran.''
</P>
<P>
   Many years later, she said she knew how Vietnam veterans felt
when they they came home.
</P>
<P>
   After the war
</P>
<P>
   The war was rarely mentioned after her return.
</P>
<P>
   Though many of the nurses' experiences were more dramatic than
those of their husbands, boyfriends or brothers, they didn't talk
for fear of embarrassing the men. Social pressures against women
doing ``men's work'' also enforced their silence.
</P>
<P>
   But the war's imprint remained. It would influence my
grandmother's outlooks and actions for the rest of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Sick of the carnage of battle, she turned to obstetrical
nursing. ``I decided I had worked long enough with men,'' she
wrote. ``It was very pleasing and satisfactory work. The babies
were so lovely and everyone so happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Her nursing skills freed her from the family farm and gave her a
degree of economic independence still rare among women. Eager for
more adventure, she struck out for San Francisco to visit her
uncle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a graduate of a good school gave me prestige wherever I
wanted to go,'' she said later. ``They called me to the Children's
Hospital in San Francisco and I worked there for awhile. When I
thought it was time to return home (to Massachusetts), I tried to
get a job on the Dollar Line (cruise ship company) as far as New
York, but they said I would have to sign up for the trip around the
world. Sometimes I wish I had taken that cruise.''
</P>
<P>
   But by that time _ 1925 _ she was engaged to Wilson Smith, a
young shoe salesman who had grown up in the town next to hers. He
had served in the Navy on a submarine chaser during the war. They
married that year, when she was 32, relatively old for that era.
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother had two children _ the second, my father, when
she was 40. They lived first in Minneapolis and migrated in 1939 to
Seattle, where her husband sold shoes to Nordstrom and other stores
in his territory. Widowed in 1953, she moved to California in 1956
to be near her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   When my grandfather was alive, he was frequently on the road for
his work, so she lived a life not unlike a modern single mother,
filling many roles and fending for herself. It was a job the war
had taught her well.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, I was in awe of her. It seemed she could do
anything, from wiring a lamp to knitting a blanket. An accomplished
artist who painted and sculpted, she was always busy with her
hands.
</P>
<P>
   And her feminist leanings were not lost on me, her only
granddaughter, even at an early age.
</P>
<P>
   She used to tell me how she had run into two French officers on
cavalry horses at the beach. They let her ride but kept hold of her
reins, which wounded her pride. When one of them showed off by
riding up a steep sand dune and down the other side, she pulled her
horse free and rode up and down the same dune.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so angry,'' she would say, and laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Her legacy has been simple. She encouraged her children and five
grandchildren to follow our hearts, use our hands and speak our
minds.
</P>
<P>
   Today, when I ask her for advice, she always says the same
thing: ``Be yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Her quiet courage sustained us through the usual childhood woes
and deeper hurts as we got older.
</P>
<P>
   When she learned that my son _ her first great-grandchild _ was
deaf, she gamely picked up sign language in her 90s. Though her
gnarled, arthritic hands could barely shape the signs, they
communicated her love nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   When he died at age 7, her strength comforted me. She knew there
is the possibility of joy after such sorrow. The war had taught her
that.
</P>
<P>
   The war left other traces on her life as well.
</P>
<P>
   She went to the battlefields two years before women got the
vote. When she returned, she voted in every election until she was
103.
</P>
<P>
   Her patriotism, while not showy, ran deep. She would have
members of the military over for dinner on holidays and she always
put out the flag.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most enduring mark of my grandmother's
experience in WWI has been her lifelong recoil at the mention of
war.
</P>
<P>
   The few times she heard dinner-table talk of war or battlefield
exploits, she quickly stopped it.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, when I told her I was writing this article, she
was quiet for awhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wars are so unnecessary,'' she said finally.
</P>
<P>
   I realized, then, that although she has seldom spoken of it, the
war had spoken through her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen it,'' she would say when war talk came up. ``That's
why I'm a pacifist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there.''

   TEXAS-CARS-COX (Austin) _ Before there was a Motor Mile, back
when U.S. 183 was considered in the far reaches of Austin, before
Austinites had ever heard of a car named KIA, downtown was the
place to car shop. In the early 1900s, East Fifth Street, Texas,
was lined with dealers that sold Cadillacs and Chandlers, Indiana
Trucks and Studebakers. In recent years, downtown was home to such
dealers as McMorris Ford, Covert Buick and Capitol Chevrolet.
Today, they've all but disappeared. By R. Michelle Breyer.

   BIZ-WHEELCHAIR-CARS-NYT (Undated) _ All adaptive equipment for

<P>
   CARS-WILLIAMS-COLUMN-TEX (Undated) _ Forget everything you ever

rear-drive midsize coupe that Mercury dropped last year because of
slow sales and general buyer apathy. In its place, picture this: a
youthful-looking, compact, front-drive hatchback coupe with
cutting-edge design, an available V-6 engine and a price that
youthful buyers of all ages can afford. By G. Chambers Williams
III.
</P>
<P>
   AUTO-REVIEW-AZR (Undated) _ OK, all you wealthy dudes
contemplating a midlife crisis, listen up. Here's a road-burning
hot rod that won't offend Aunt Tillie or cause your ritzy neighbors
to roll their eyes. For the paltry sum of $50,000, you can drive a
275-horsepower ``wunderkind'' that accelerates like a rocket and
handles like a bobsled, all the while looking like any
standard-issue sedan from the Mercedes-Benz E-class. By Bob Golfen.

<P>
   AUTOS-COLUMN-BOS (Undated) _ Say goodbye to Buick Riviera. Once
again, having perfected a car, General Motors will kill it. If it's
anything the General can't stand, it would seem to be class. With
the '99 model year, Riviera enters the realm of collectible _ well
maybe the name is already there, at least when it's on a ragtop.
Although Buick has turned out more than a million cars bearing the
Riviera badge since the Riviera first showed up as a ``concept'' in
1963, only 3,000 convertibles were built spanning 1982-1985. By

   OUTLOOK-AUTOMOBILES-BLOOM (Undated) _ General Motors Corp. will
post a third-quarter loss because of recent strikes by the United
Auto Workers, while earnings will rise at Ford Motor Co. and
Chrysler Corp. on strong sales of high-profit trucks. The 54-day
strikes against GM at two Michigan parts plants, settled in late
July, had ripple effects throughout the industry. A shortage of GM
cars and trucks, for example, allowed all three companies to cut
third-quarter rebates to an average $1,300 a vehicle, down 23
percent from the second quarter. The lower price discounts and
continued cost-cutting helped profitability for all three
companies. Still, Detroit automakers' earnings are increasingly
threatened by economic problems that are damping demand in Latin
America and Asia. By John Lippert.
</P>
<P>
   CAR-DEALS-LADN (Los Angeles) _ Consumers shopping for a new car
this fall are in for a dose of sticker shock. But it won't be
painful; indeed, they should leave the dealerships smiling and
maybe with some cash in their pocket.  &QL; 
They will be reaping the benefits of a rare autumn buyers' market
as automakers offer lucrative incentives on the last of the 1998
models and, on numerous lots, are slashing prices on new 1999
models just hitting showroom floors. By Gregory J. Wilcox.

MEANWHILE, HALF-CRAZED AT THE LOCAL POOL HALL ... 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With his wounded baby doe eyes and oddly curled-up lips, Joaquin
Phoenix often resembles an overgrown little boy who has only
recently stopped sucking his thumb. It is this look more than
anything that has led to his being typecast as a lost, sweetly
bumbling perpetual adolescent, part fragile innocent, part
credulous patsy.
</P>
<P>
   And in David Dobkin's smart, spiffily photographed genre spoof,
``Clay Pigeons,'' Phoenix is snugly cast as a naive young cowboy
whose very niceness threatens to be his downfall.
</P>
<P>
   This self-consciously witty film about modern-day cowboys,
vixens, serial killers and law officers in contemporary Montana
partakes of the same off-kilter seriocomic esthetic as the Coen
Brothers' film ``Fargo.''
</P>
<P>
   Janeane Garofalo's pungent turn as a sarcastically urbane FBI
agent investigating a series of killings in the region lights up
the movie with the same kind of deadpan humor Frances McDormand
brought to the role of an intrepid Minnesota police detective in
``Fargo.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie's sensational opening scene finds Phoenix's character,
Clay, and his best friend, Earl (Gregory Sporleder), together in
the wilderness drinking beers and shooting target practice.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Earl picks up Clay's gun, aims it at his friend and
hysterically accuses him of having an affair with his wife, Amanda
(Georgina Cates). Before Clay realizes what has happened, Earl has
turned the gun on himself and committed suicide to make it appear
as though Clay murdered him.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking quickly, Clay piles his friend's dead body into the
driver's seat of his pickup truck and sends the vehicle over a hill
where it explodes in a fiery crash. No sooner has he returned to
town, where he works in a gas station, than he is accosted by
Amanda, a cold-blooded sexual predator who is simply thrilled that
her boring husband isn't around anymore to interfere with her fun.
</P>
<P>
   Horrified at Amanda's callousness, Clay rebuffs her when she
puts the moves on him. Rejected, Amanda spits venom like an angry
rattlesnake and after catching Clay in bed with another woman,
contrives her own lethal vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at the local pool hall, Clay is aggressively
befriended by a swaggering jocular stranger calling himself Lester
(Vince Vaughn), who has a weird look in his eye and wears a
half-crazed grin. On a fishing expedition they take together, what
should bob up from the depths of the lake but a woman's dead body.
As the fatalities escalate, Clay finds himself the chief suspect in
serial killings.
</P>
<P>
   Appearances to the contrary, ``Clay Pigeons'' isn't a suspense
movie about an innocent man desperately trying to clear his name.
The film, written by Matt Healy and directed by Dobkin in an
ostentatiously hip style that undercuts sentimentality or
melodrama, is really a character-driven shaggy-dog story whose
point may be that there is no point.
</P>
<P>
   Conjuring a bunch of sharply drawn oddballs who defy standard
western stereotypes, the movie lets their collisions determine the
story's tone and shape.
</P>
<P>
   This results in a film that delights by confounding
expectations. Vaughn's Lester is part shambling charmer, part
lunatic, and you're never sure when he's suddenly going to erupt
into a monster. Phoenix's Clay is a not-so-dumb country bumpkin
whose saving grace is a stubborn, almost shining integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garofalo, as Agent Shelby, a tough, smart city slicker who
finds herself in the boondocks, is the closest thing in the film to
an authorial voice. That voice is unimpressed with the lingering
Old West mystique that the rest of the film slyly debunks.
</P>
<P>
   When Lester spies Agent Shelby in a local bar and starts pouring
on the sweet talk, she flashes him a politely tolerant smile, nods
at the empty bar stool next to her and remarks, ``This seat is
saved.'' ``Who for?'' he asks. ``For the first guy not wearing
denim,'' she replies tartly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Clay Pigeons'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying
parent or adult guardian). It has extremely gory sequences, nudity
and sexual situations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CLAY PIGEONS
</P>
<P>
   Directed by David Dobkin; written by Matt Healy; director of
photography, Eric Edwards; edited by Stan Salfas; music by John
Lurie; production designer, Clark Hunter; produced by Ridley Scott
and Chris Zarpas; released by Gramercy Pictures. Running time: 104
minutes. This film is rated R. &QL;

LA COP DRAMA `BUDDY FARO' SIZZLES WITH STYLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a season that was supposed to be wall-to-wall silliness,
insanity and intellectual insults, how pleasing it has been to
watch a number of fall pilots roll off the network assembly line
looking polished, promising and even, dare I say, mechanically
daring.
</P>
<P>
   The latest series worth at least a three-episode look-see is
``Buddy Faro'' (8 p.m. CDT Friday), the CBS drama starring Dennis
Farina as the legendary '70s detective named in the title.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy ran Los Angeles a couple of decades back, moving and
grooving like a Brat Packer, the town's inside-outside man, a
private detective with all the angles, not to mention colorful
lines and clothes.
</P>
<P>
   After disappearing without a trace in 1978, he became his own
Trivial Pursuit question, a man who'd created his own ultimate
mystery.
</P>
<P>
   He resurfaces when a young, brainy investigator, Bob Jones
(Frank Whaley), is hired to find him, which he does in some tiny,
dusty Mexico town. Jones brings Buddy back to LA, where the two
solve a crime and, by episode's end, team up.
</P>
<P>
   In this age of the quick-trigger remote, tonight's episode is
bound to lose viewers early on while it's laying the foundation for
Buddy's entrance. But hang tough. ``Buddy Faro'' starts to crackle
as soon as a bearded Farina appears and opens his mouth, looking
like an alcoholic wolf man, sounding like what he is: a '70s man
living in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Created by Mark Frost (''Twin Peaks'') with Charles Haid as one
of the executive producers, ``Buddy Faro'' looks good (it's as
close to film noir as a TV series will venture) and is well cast
with Farina and even Whaley as the smart but socially clueless
private eye.
</P>
<P>
   But style does not a series make. The drama's success will hinge
on whether writers can come up with interesting, engaging plots to
keep things humming. Otherwise, Farina's swagger will be the only
thing worth returning for, and, in large doses, even the most
pleasurable pursuits get old.
</P>
<P>
   Also debuting Friday night:
</P>
<P>
   ``Two of a Kind'' (7 p.m. CDT, ABC) features the Olsen twins,
Mary-Kate and Ashley, who first came to prominence on ``Full
House'' as 9-month-olds. Here, they play pre-teens giving dad a
hard time. Mary-Kate is the tomboy with a passion for curve balls;
Ashley is the straight-A student whose passion is the boys who
throw curve balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two of a Kind'' is merely an updated ``Full House'' without
the sappiness. OK, without so much sappiness you want to drive a
dagger through your heart.
</P>
<P>
   Again, their father, Kevin (Christopher Sieber), is widowed, yet
there's another adult around. Carrie (Sally Wheeler) is a cute
college student hired as a baby sitter. Carrie's insistence on
telling Kevin that she's ``older than the usual student'' screams
out love interest!
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Olsen's built-in audience, decent writing and a
time slot in which ``Full House'' was a ratings winner, ``Two of a
Kind'' can't miss.
</P>
<P>
   If only the same could be said of ``Brother's Keeper'' (8:30
p.m. CDT, ABC). Porter (William Ragsdale) and his 8-year-old son,
Oscar (Justin Cooper), are living life blissfully when Porter's
brother, Bobby (Sean O'Bryan), arrives. He's a rich football player
who gets in trouble and must live with his brother or end his
career. (Yeah, right.)
</P>
<P>
   Since Porter is uptight and Bobby is loose, the culture-clash
jokes fly. Too bad none are all that funny.
</P>

`MONUMENT AVE.': GRITTY PALS WHO PREFER CAR THEFTS TO A JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A group of pals in Charlestown, a dingy Irish-American enclave
of Boston, are sitting around one night smoking cigarettes, downing
beers, sniffing cocaine and shooting the breeze.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, their rough-and-tumble conversation turns to movie
star breasts (real ones versus silicone), the Hollywood brat pack
(this is the mid-1980s) and the physical attributes of celebrity
dream girls. When the macho banter hits a lull, one of the friends
wearily allows that even if they were the last men on earth, their
fantasy lovers still wouldn't give them the time of day.
</P>
<P>
   The aimless, sullen bull session is one of many scenes in
``Monument Ave.'' that capture embattled, despairing camaraderie
with a force and naturalness that match anything you'll find in a
film by Martin Scorsese or Quentin Tarantino.
</P>
<P>
   So powerfully does the movie evoke the characters' mixture of
working-class desperation, defensive ethnic pride and love-hate
feelings toward their ingrown community that you begin to feel
trapped in this drab claustrophobic world from which booze and
drugs offer the only respite from a lurking hopelessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monument Ave.,'' which stars Denis Leary, in what may be the
role of his lifetime, is really a portrait of a proud but unhappy
community struggling to hold on. It is a world whose characters all
seem related to one another by blood and who maintain close family
ties abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The friends killing time together belong to a loosely-knit ring
of petty criminals who support themselves through organized car
theft.
</P>
<P>
   What keeps them in business is their fierce mutual loyalty and a
rigid code of silence whenever the law sticks its nose into their
business. The group's vague half-hearted justification for its
crimes is a Robin Hood attitude toward the much-despised
neighboring yuppies on whom they prey.
</P>
<P>
   But even more threatening than yuppies are blacks. In the film's
most hair-raising scene, the group, while driving around one night
in a friend's taxicab, spots a young black man on the sidewalk.
Leary's character, Bobby, who is already in an amphetamine-fueled
rage, insists they stop and drag the stranger into the car, where
he is terrorized with racial slurs and death threats before being
set free.
</P>
<P>
   The scene is as ugly and believable as any episode of racist
thuggery to be found in a recent film, and it insures that we not
view Bobby as the movie's nominal hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monument Ave.'' has a plot of sorts. One evening while the
group is sitting around in a neighborhood bar, an old pal named
Teddy (Billy Crudup), who has just been released from prison and is
already jittery from cocaine, shows up unexpectedly.
</P>
<P>
   There is lingering bad blood between Teddy and the group's
paranoid ringleader, Jackie (Colm Meaney). When Jackie suddenly
turns on Teddy and shoots him to death, the friends are horrified
but still maintain their code of silence when the police arriving
asking questions. (All claim to have been in the bathroom when the
shooting took place.)
</P>
<P>
   The story follows the escalating power struggle between Jackie
and Bobby, who is regarded as the leader's next in line.
Heightening the tension is the fact that Bobby is having a secret
affair with Jackie's girlfriend Katy (Famke Janssen), an alcoholic
coke-addicted wreck given to fits of violent jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby has also taken under his wing a cousin from overseas named
Seamus (Jason Barry) and acted as his mentor in petty crime.
</P>
<P>
   The film, directed by Ted Demme from a screenplay by Mike
Armstrong, is remarkable for the skill with which it gets under the
skins of its largely unsympathetic characters and makes you care
about them despite their bigotry and criminal tendencies. The
dialogue and the ensemble acting maintain a near-perfect pitch.
</P>
<P>
   By interspersing snippets of old home movies and color snapshots
of the men when they were children, the movie suggests the depth of
the ties that have bound these friends since they were born, as
well as the tragic downward trajectory of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   How quickly those grinning little boys dressed as cowboys and
aiming guns into the camera turned into glum blue-collar desperados
packing real guns in their pockets.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're unlucky to be stuck on these mean, shabby streets
for the rest of your life, is there an alternative to crime? Yes,
but it's not pretty. As Jackie warns Bobby, if he were banished
from the group he'd end up like his now-deceased father working at
a dead-end job in a wire foundry. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MONUMENT AVE.

WHAT KIND OF JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IS THIS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My fellow Americans: This isn't going to work, this presidential
impeachment business. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not only is it way too cumbersome, but _ worse _ it requires the
services of other human beings, and almost all of them bring to the
process far too much baggage to ignore. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just a quick look at the House Judiciary Committee reveals a
panoply of oddness so compelling that the American people have
every right to be suspect of this collection of folk. After all,
they look a lot like the American people themselves, and name me a
stranger lot than us. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For starters, many of the Judiciary Committee members are
lawyers. And if that isn't scary enough, one of them was married to
the late Sonny Bono. And if that doesn't give you pause, six of
them are from California. (Why, it makes me quake.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But here's a real killer: One of the members of the Judiciary
Committee was born and reared in Milwaukee. Don't they drink a lot
of beer in Milwaukee? Do you trust the future of this country to a
guy who represents a bunch of beer drinkers? (Well, yes, I do, too,
but I was just checking on what your own standards are.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My incomplete survey of a few of the individuals on the
Judiciary Committee will, I think, show you why _ even if you think
the president should be impeached _ this may not be the right
collection of folks to move that process forward. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And let's not even include the chairman, Henry Hyde, who
recently acknowledged that he, too, had an extramarital affair some
years ago. The most telling fact to me about Hyde is that he
represents, among other Chicago suburbs, Park Ridge, where Hillary
Rodham Clinton grew up. So there you have it. What do we have? you
ask. Well, I don't know exactly, but I'm sure we have something.
And, anyway, as I said, I won't even include Hyde in this rundown. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But consider Bill McCollum, a Republican who represents the
Orlando area. Do you know what that means? It means McCollum is
Mickey Mouse's congressman. Friends, surely we can do better than
that. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Or think of the ranking Democrat on the committee, John Conyers.
He's been around Congress since LBJ mercilessly whipped up on Barry
Goldwater. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Conyers, who represents part of Detroit, served on the Judiciary
Committee through the Watergate scandal. Now consider this: Detroit
has one of the worst baseball teams in the American League. And you
want a man who represents a bunch of losers like that helping to
make crucial decisions about the future of the presidency? Come
on. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's another committee problem: Elton Gallegly. He represents
the Simi Valley in California. Yes, THAT Simi Valley, where Ronald
Reagan's presidential library is located and where several years
ago a jury acquitted the police officers charged in the Rodney King
beating case _ an acquittal that sparked rioting in Los Angeles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you want a guy from a district like that passing judgment
on the libidinous leader of the Free World, but I don't. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another guy from a district with an inappropriate past is Bill
Jenkins, who represents part of Tennessee that was home to Andrew
Johnson, the only president ever impeached. (Though the Senate, by
one vote, failed to convict him.) How can anyone from Johnson's
district think about impeachment clearly? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, it just goes on and on. There's even a fellow on the
committee from New Jersey, of all places, Steven Rothman, who makes
the ridiculous argument that he's ``not going to make my decision
about whether to impeach the president from newspaper accounts.''
Why not? The rest of us do. &QL;

`RONIN': REAL TOUGH GUYS, REAL DERRING-DO 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A crew of tough customers assembles at the start of John
Frankenheimer's top-notch thriller, ``Ronin.'' Each of them is
seasoned and shrewd, but they've got nothing on the man behind the
camera when it comes to gritty professionalism.
</P>
<P>
   Directing like a world-weary Hitchcock with a taste for the
breathtaking car chase, Frankenheimer propels this tale of intrigue
through its tightly plotted paces with such conviction that he even
makes an action hero out of Robert De Niro. During this film's
moments of fiercest tension, I watched viewers at an early
screening quite literally biting their nails.
</P>
<P>
   Named for Japanese samurai shamed by the loss of their feudal
masters, ``Ronin'' presents a band of mercenaries who are assembled
for the mysterious mission of stealing a metal carrying case and
its unknown contents.
</P>
<P>
   The job is clearly deadly, since the case is desperately wanted
by Irish terrorists, scheming Russians and doubtless many others.
Working strictly for money, the mercenaries soon find themselves
gripped by deeper motives, not least of which is curiosity about
the tough-talking Irish beauty (Natascha McElhone) in charge of the
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Being genuinely worldly and unconventional, ``Ronin'' lifts a
knowing eyebrow at such provocative touches without becoming too
distracted from the job at hand.
</P>
<P>
   An extraordinary cast of actors, all on the same formidable
wavelength, match wits most impressively throughout the story.
Robert De Niro and Jean Reno form a camaraderie early in the story,
making this the most distinguished of buddy pictures, while
Jonathan Pryce and Stellan Skarsgaard give the story's maneuverings
a few more sinister shadings.
</P>
<P>
   With Sean Bean and Skipp Sudduth as two more of the hard cases
recruited for service, the early part of ``Ronin'' offers many
interesting opportunities for testing mettle. (One man's reflexes
in catching a coffee cup can be another man's key to his
character.) While carefully sizing up one another, the principals
sustain their cagey detachment in ways that give the film a
genuinely European flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Frankenheimer borrowed loosely from ``The Battle of Algiers'' in
creating a hard-edged, credible look that heightens mood without
overwhelming the action.
</P>
<P>
   That action is overwhelming in its own right, especially when
these gentlemen start their engines. Proving that the greatest
excitement an action film can offer is the spectacle of real
derring-do performed by real people, Frankenheimer stages three
sensational French chase sequences in settings that prove
astonishing, under the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Whether screeching through the narrow, twisting streets of
Nice's picturesque old district or (later) cutting a furious swath
through Paris at high speed (and against traffic, even in tunnels),
these scenes are nothing short of sensational. Frankenheimer
directs them in fast, efficient, no-frills fashion because no extra
frills are needed.
</P>
<P>
   With a cast that also features the commandingly dour French
actor Michael Lonsdale as a doctor with a fascination for samurai,
``Ronin'' can be watched as appreciatively for its hard-boiled
performances as for its visceral excitement.
</P>
<P>
   As Reno grows ever more comfortable and emblematic in American
action films, De Niro shows off a brooding, hard-guy panache with
its own brand of international appeal. &QL;

<P>
   (begin italics) ``Do I look bad?'' the soldier pleads.
</P>
<P>
   Half his face is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Frost hurriedly dresses the raw shreds that remain. There
are still men moaning on gurneys in the rain outside the operating
tent.
</P>
<P>
   Her hands shake from the chilling damp that seeps through the
canvas walls. Her thin leather boots are coated with mud. Blood is
smeared across her nurse's uniform.
</P>
<P>
   She tries to block out the sound of limbs dropping into enamel
pails as surgeons saw through mangled flesh and bones.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment she presses her hand against her eyes. Sometimes
the men in their misery make her cry.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   Eighty years later her hand still goes to her eyes when she
recalls that scene.
</P>
<P>
   At 105, Laura Frost Smith travels easily in her mind to 1918 and
the Western Front, a war zone that separated her from her youth.
</P>
<P>
   Today she is one of the oldest known living American veterans of
World War I, a war that marked the first time women officially
served in the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
   She is also my grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   I had mixed emotions on learning of this latest milestone in my
grandmother's life.
</P>
<P>
   Her other accomplishments are more dear to me _ the lemon cake
she baked when I was a child, the parade of hand-knit socks and
mittens for Christmas, her skilled watercolors, prized garden and
the stories she told of growing up on a farm near Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The war was almost never mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Her military service was such a small sliver of her life. Like a
single tree ring lost in the dense coil that holds a life together,
it hardly seemed significant as I was growing up.
</P>
<P>
   I could barely remember the contours of the war drawn in history
classes, let alone picture my grandmother serving at five of its
bloodiest fronts. To me they were just names printed on tiny brass
bars and clasped to the ribbon of the Victory Medal in a glass box
on her wall.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the women who served in the Great War are gone now.
Ignored when they came home and forgotten by subsequent
generations, most never had a chance to tell their stories.
</P>
<P>
   So I went in search of this part of my grandmother's life. I
visited her earlier this month at the Meadows care center in Los
Gatos, Calif., where she lives now. For three days we sat together
in the sun beside a lemon tree, while I looked for pathways through
her memory that would take me with her to that place and time.
</P>
<P>
   She is still beautiful, and though her eyesight and hearing are
failing, there are still flashes of her keen mind and wicked sense
of humor. She remembers.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't where I found the pieces I was looking for.
</P>
<P>
   I went back, instead, to the letters she sent home from the war,
and to a family memoir she wrote in her 90s.
</P>
<P>
   There, in her own words, I found a young woman I never knew, a
woman who went off to see the world, and in the process helped
change it.
</P>
<P>
   Her year at war not only shaped her life in ways I had never
understood, it had also helped shape mine.
</P>
<P>
   Give me girls
</P>
<P>
   Laura Frost was an unconventional woman even before she went to
war.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1893, she grew up on a small farm in East Taunton, Mass.
Her father, George, grew vegetables that her mother made into
pickles they sold in town.
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother, the youngest of three daughters, was given the
middle name ``Georgina,'' for the son her parents didn't have, and
she learned to work the land accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   She went to a one-room school where boys and girls had separate
entrances, but there was no such division of labor at home. ``Give
me girls every time,'' her father would tell her years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister and I proved to him we could do our share working
the farm,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So it seemed natural to do her share when the call went out for
volunteers to fight the war that had been raging across Europe
since 1914. Her graduation from nursing school nearly coincided
with the U.S. declaration of war on the Germans on April 6, 1917.
</P>
<P>
   Her training hospital, working with the Red Cross, organized
military Base 44. ``Most of my class signed up for it,'' she wrote
in her memoir. She was sworn in on Feb. 15, 1918, and sent to Fort
Oglethorpe, Ga., for training.
</P>
<P>
   She went to war for adventure. She had no idea how much her life
was about to change.
</P>
<P>
   When she signed up, women couldn't vote and men were deeply
suspicious of those who were educated. According to scientists of
the day, women's smaller brains were not equipped for higher
education, and too much thinking was believed to impair their
childbearing capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Only five years earlier, the sinking of the Titanic and the cry
of ``women and children first'' had inflamed arguments about female
roles in society. To traditionalists, the Titanic proved that women
belonged to a special class, one requiring protection by _ not
equality with _ men.
</P>
<P>
   That left no room for women on the battlefield. But some women
saw it differently.
</P>
<P>
   When the United States entered the war, there were 403 Army
nurses on active duty. By Armistice Day, 19 months later, more than
21,000 had enlisted and about 10,000 had seen duty overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Such a good time
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of the country, my grandmother entered the war
with high spirits and a certain innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know I have never had such a good time in my life as I
have had this last two weeks,'' she wrote from training camp on
March 4, 1918. ``One thing I have learned already _ and had to if I
was to live at all _ that is to dance. Can you imagine fox-trotting
and waltzing with majors and captains?''
</P>
<P>
   She was soon swept up in her first real romance _ a love affair
with a dashing first lieutenant. Pete Herzog wooed her with
dinners, dancing and shows _ heady experiences for a tomboy whose
social life had centered mostly on the annual clambake at her tiny
church or the occasional ride in a horse-drawn sleigh.
</P>
<P>
   In letters home, she referred often to her lieutenant. He taught
her military marching maneuvers and stood at attention as she
passed by in her first parade. Before they left for Europe, he gave
her a diamond service pin as a pledge of love, and she promised to
write him through the war.
</P>
<P>
   Though the romance thrilled her, she never lost sight of her
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Assigned to the psychiatric ward at training camp, she
encountered a shellshocked patient sent home from battle: ``The
first day I went into the ward after lunch, I found everyone
cringing into corners or under their beds. A young fellow was
brandishing a straight razor. I didn't know what was happening but
went right up to him and yelled: `Give me that!' He smiled and
handed me the open razor.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger of battle, however, still felt a long way off, and in
some ways the war seemed like a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so happy to think that we are at last on the way,'' she
wrote from training camp. ``. . . We'll soon have the Huns on the
run and be home in no time.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were signs that fantasies of war were about to end.
</P>
<P>
   One day a friend asked her to go horseback riding. She accepted,
but at the last minute changed her plans and asked a fellow nurse
to take her place.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was so pleased to think that she was going for a ride, and
in five minutes she was thrown and died three hours later,'' my
grandmother wrote home.
</P>
<P>
   Sobered by the death, the nurses marched behind her hearse in a
military funeral. ``I never realized what taps meant before, until
they sounded for her at the station,'' she wrote. ``None of us have
very much pep since it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 17, 1918, the base hospital moved by train from Georgia
to New York to prepare for the trip to France.
</P>
<P>
   The timing meant the nurses would get to march 60 blocks in New
York City's Fourth of July parade. It would be one of the first
times American military women had ever marched alongside men. It
would also provide her first glimpse of how the rest of the country
viewed women in the Army.
</P>
<P>
   On July 6, 1918, she wrote: ``It really was a wonderful parade.
... They didn't say much about the nurses in it. We thought we were
the whole show. They just said 400 (women) marched and there were
at least 1,400. It is funny, because a paper usually exaggerates so
much.''
</P>
<P>
   It made her feel important to march then, she said during my
recent visit. The irony is not lost on her, even all these years
later.
</P>
<P>
   When she came home after the war, people would barely notice.
</P>
<P>
   Over there
</P>
<P>
   On July 14, 1918, she sailed on the troop ship Northland for the
18-day trip to Liverpool and then Le Havre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never knew how many ships were in our convoy, but I guessed
about 18,'' she wrote in her memoir. ``That month, about 300,000
troops went over. We were told to throw nothing overboard, as any
floating objects would reveal our course to any lurking
submarine.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucked in her small Army trunk was a box camera and developing
fluid _ despite warnings they were not to take pictures.
</P>
<P>
   By Aug. 4, she had left Paris and was on duty in Evacuation No.
7, a field hospital in the VO Surg District in France.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it hadn't been the amputation ward, maybe the shock
wouldn't have been so devastating,'' she wrote. ``But helping dress
those quivering stumps and hearing the laughter and jokes in spite
of their misfortune was too much for me and I cried all that first
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they had made a mistake by putting us through that
experience so soon, but maybe it was for the good and I could stand
anything after that miserable week.''
</P>
<P>
   The nurses sent closest to the front were equipped with a
helmet, gas mask, mess kit and canteen. She was one of them.
</P>
<P>
   They headed straight into the hrror of the first ``modern''
war. Poison gas, aerial bombardments and machine guns were being
used for the first time. In four years of madness, more than 65
million men would go to war. Many were slaughtered in the bellies
of trenches that gashed the length of France.
</P>
<P>
   The terrorist bullet that took the life of Archduke Franz
Ferdinand ended up gutting a generation. The casualties _ more than
8 million by war's end _ left a deep scar across several
continents.
</P>
<P>
   Mud and blood
</P>
<P>
   Mobile hospitals at the front worked frantically to save what
was left of men's bodies as they came in. But the damage was
frequently too great. Double amputations were common.
</P>
<P>
   Many died on the operating tables. Sometimes they arrived on
stretchers, scared yet hopeful, their young faces untouched. But
when their uniforms were cut away, they would be nearly shot in
two. Nurses could do nothing but hold their hands as they died.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the women spoke of their experiences, even decades later,
silenced as much by trauma as social norms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was too sad,'' my grandmother said during my recent visit.
``So many hurt boys. Seeing the stumps and their bones . . .'' She
could not finish.
</P>
<P>
   From her original hospital, my grandmother was dispatched closer
to the front. She went with Evac 5 to what had been a town on the
River Marne. The unit, totaling about 1,000 beds, received
casualties directly from the trenches. Each operating tent had 10
surgery tables in use around the clock. At full capacity, the
hospital had about 48 nurses, each handling 20 patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the wounded began to come in, the stretchers were laid on
the ground and the corpsmen stripped them of their muddy clothes
and deloused them, usually before we received them in the operating
tent,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The most seriously wounded were operated on right away, and
those who could stand the journey were evacuated to base hospitals
farther from the front.
</P>
<P>
   The nurses worked under primitive conditions, layering men's
socks and underwear under their uniforms for warmth, sleeping on
the ground or cots in their tents, sometimes subsisting on little
more than beans and hardtack. They worked eight hours on and eight
hours off, around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the afternoon off today for the first time,'' she wrote
home. ``With so much time on my hands I didn't know what to do so I
slept till supper time. Then tonight we went out to get water in
our canteens and took a little walk. . . . The moon looked so
pretty tonight shining on the ruins.''
</P>
<P>
   During the bitter-cold fall of 1918, rain drilled down
relentlessly. They pitched their camps in fields filled with
viscous, sucking mud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing we have to contend with is the mud,'' she
wrote home. ``The blankets on the cots hang over into it and then
they get all wet and so dirty you dread to put them on the patient.
Then the pillows and cots get wet through the tent. Believe me,
it's some mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight decades later, it isn't hard for her to remember what was
different from what she had expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mud,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the blood.''
</P>
<P>
   A long, long trail
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in their training had prepared them for the kind of
nursing they would have to do.
</P>
<P>
   The patients, especially the brain injuries, made them
heartsick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Margaret and I became very fond of one of our patients and
kept him several days, trying to get him to talk,'' she wrote. ``He
was only about 18 years old and had a bullet hole right in the
middle of his forehead. All he could say was `glass,' but he wasn't
paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he wanted something, we would keep asking him until we
hit the right thing and he would nod his head. One day Margaret
sang `Over There' to him, and he followed along saying all the
words. That was a great day for us. When he was evacuated, we went
to the train with him and sat by his litter until the train pulled
out.''
</P>
<P>
   They taught another brain-damaged patient to say, ``Good night,
nurse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He says, `Good night' for everything he wants,'' she wrote.
``They were singing to him yesterday and he joined in and said
`long, long trail' quite plainly. I couldn't stay to hear any more,
for it is going to be a long, long trail for him. We had quite a
time tonight trying to find out what he wanted and would you
believe it was a cigarette?''
</P>
<P>
   Shattered brains, bullet holes and severed limbs weren't the
only wounds they saw. The use of poisonous gases _ mustard gas,
chlorine, phosgene and other toxic aerosols _ increased toward the
war's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Germans were getting desperate now and used more and more
mustard gas,'' she wrote. ``Our casualties were 20 and 30 percent
gassed. It made huge blisters on them and they suffered painfully.
Even though they were cleaned, I sometimes got a whiff of the
miserable stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   For nurses, flu was even more deadly. More than 400 died in the
line of duty, most from Spanish influenza, a virulent strain that
swept the world in 1918 and 1919, killing 21 million.
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother fell sick with the flu immediately after the
Meuse-Argonne Offensive, one of the war's decisive battles.
</P>
<P>
   She spent several days in a coma. ``I came to one day and found
myself in a regular hospital bed in a little tent all by myself,''
she wrote. ``I hadn't seen a bed before, as all our patients were
put on army cots when they came in and that's what we slept on,
too. The head nurse took care of me and I'm sure she saved my
life.''

CONQUERING THE SUMMIT OF A BAXTER STATE BEAUTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRED STETSON  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT KATAHDIN, Maine _ A soft, summit breeze nudges my face. In
the bright, midday sun, Millinocket and Moosehead lakes are distant
patches of blue amid an ocean of evergreens.
</P>
<P>
   A raven glides by, riding updrafts high over the great basins
below. My stomach turns as I look down into the deep, deep gray and
lichen-green rock amphitheaters. My pulse quickens at the thought
of balancing across the Knife Edge. This sharp ridge extends about
a mile from Pamola to Baxter peaks. In places, it narrows to two or
three feet. A misstep here means a fall of 1,000 feet _ or more.
</P>
<P>
   Indians called this Katahdin, the ``highest mountain.'' Today,
the mountain spirits _ one, a nasty creature with a terrible beak
and claws; another, a gigantic human form with stony eyebrows and
cheekbones _ are quiet. These mythical creatures do not throw
storms of rain, snow or sleet. They do not shroud the mountain with
chilling fog or blinding clouds. And they do not wrap the high
peaks in a killer hurricane. Instead, this day, Katahdin is but a
whisper. Katahdin is as calm as the two black ravens pecking about
on nearby slopes.
</P>
<P>
   On days like these, a hiker on the Knife Edge can talk downslope
with another some 2,000 feet below.
</P>
<P>
   Since early times, artists and writers have sought to capture
the mystique of this great mass. Unlike Native Americans who
respected the mountain spirits and stayed away, 19th-century white
men set foot on Katahdin, then encouraged other adventurers to join
them. As one historian wrote, Henry David Thoreau, who attempted an
ascent on Katahdin, ``...stood at the gateway of the woods and
opened them to all future comers with the key of poetic insight.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding were noted American landscape artists such as
Frederic Edwin Church and Lockwood deForest. In a 1944 Appalachia
magazine article, U.S. Navy Cmdr. Myron H. Avery of Lubuc, Maine,
eloquently described Katahdin's appeal: ``The wildness, the
ruggedness of the area, the unbroken forest expanse, the complete
absence of human invasion, and that which still fascinates today _
the varying aspects of sheer-walled cirques with the play of light
and shadow from the moon, the rising and setting sun. ...''
</P>
<P>
   From the south, Katahdin rises abruptly from the forest floor. A
series of connected peaks, the highest Baxter Peak at 5,267 feet,
form the mountain. Loose rocks cover the summit and look, as
Thoreau said, ``as if some time it had rained rocks.'' From another
perspective, a few miles to the east, the mountain resembles a
great pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Percival Baxter hiked Katahdin in the 1920s and vowed to
preserve this piece of wilderness. He tried, without success, to
convince the Maine Legislature to purchase the mountain peaks and
nearby terrain. So, from 1931 to 1962, he bought the land himself
and gave it to the state piece by piece, eventually totaling
201,018 acres. This is a massive 134-square-mile hunk of
northern-central Maine. Not only does Baxter State Park embrace
Katahdin with its alpine flora and unusual geology, but it also
encompasses more than a dozen peaks above 3,000 feet, some 175
miles of trails and acres of ponds, lakes and bogs.
</P>
<P>
   As a condition of his gift, Baxter asked that the area ``shall
forever be left in its natural wild state, forever be kept as a
sanctuary for wild beasts and birds and forever be used for public
forest, public park and public recreational purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   The evening before hiking Katahdin, I stayed at the Sweet
Lillian, a bed-and-breakfast in Millinocket. After a night of
tossing and turning (my bedroom window was less than 75 feet from a
state highway), I walked downstairs and joined other guests for a
hearty breakfast of pancakes, eggs, coffee and orange juice. The
Appalachian Mountain Club's ``Maine Mountain Guide'' described the
Abol Trail up a rock slide as ``dangerous.'' The AMC guide called
the 5.2-mile Hunt Trail ``steep and rough.''
</P>
<P>
   I preferred ``steep and rough.'' And, by 7:30 a.m., I was in my
car, headed north up the park road for the start of the Hunt Trail.
Four others joined me, including a father and son from Georgia who
planned to hike Katahdin, then walk south on the 2,000-mile
Appalachian Trail to their home state.
</P>
<P>
   After a 45-minute drive, we arrived at the Katahdin Stream
Campground, a beautiful, peaceful spot. The stream fed down into a
dark, calm pool, which was about 100 feet across and surrounded by
wooded campsites. Katahdin's southwest ridge rose up in the
background.
</P>
<P>
   The final northernmost section of the Appalachian Trail, the
Hunt Trail climbs gently for about a mile, then reaches Katahdin
Stream Falls. Here, water spills over four or five stages, each
about 25 feet high.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the trail steepens and passes through spruce trees. Coming
above the treeline, I faced a hump or ridge of boulders strewn down
the trail. Some boulders were so big I could not see over them.
They formed the crest of Katahdin's southwest shoulder. Dashes of
white paint marked the trail, which I followed closely. Deviations
of a few feet often led to dead-ends or blind alleys. In a couple
of places, boulders were so large that metal hand holds pounded
into the rocks were needed to continue an ascent.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, I began to breathe heavily. I even wondered if this
climb were possible for a slightly out-of-shape 53-year-old. But,
in a few minutes, voices came down the trail, and a hiker paused
for a welcome chat. The worst was behind me, he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Continuing along, I noticed a curious sight: rows of trees
laying on their sides, trunks exposed. From afar, they looked like
long, wavy rows of aligned porcupine quills. Later, I learned these
are ``fir waves,'' unusual growth patterns of balsam fir. Once
through the boulders, I walked over a sandy, level shelf and
completed one more half-mile-long, steep spine.
</P>
<P>
   Then I started across the broad, flat Tablelands. Here, the
trail crosses solid, serrated and loose granite, tinged by lichen
to a greenish hue. After another half-mile-long incline, the trail
reaches Thoreau's Spring. A few inches deep and small enough to
leap over on this day, the spring sits clear and still where the
Hunt and Abol trails intersect. During drier months, the spring may
disappear. From here, the Hunt Trail curves northeast, rising
gently to Baxter Peak and passing alpine flowers and sedge grasses.
</P>
<P>
   Though only a mile from Thoreau Spring to Baxter Peak, the
summit seems elusive. The more you hike, the more the final goal
appears out of reach. The trail continues northeast, past the
flanks of the aptly named Tablelands. Finally, I reached the summit
and looked over the great, rocky basins.
</P>
<P>
   To the south was Millinocket Lake, a vast pool dotted with green
islands and ringed with an irregular shoreline of bays and coves.
White smoke billowed from the Great Northern Paper Co. plant.
</P>
<P>
   Today, I would not attempt to cross the Knife Edge. A few years
ago, I struggled over a similar ridge in Hawaii. I came away somber
and chastened. On the descent, the biggest worry was finding steps
over the boulders. How inconsequential. How trivial compared to the
struggles of those who confront dangerous weather.
</P>
<P>
   Upon reaching an inviting, flat granite slab, I lay down, sucked
the last drops of water from a plastic jug, and finished off my
carrots and a few handfuls of gorp. When I stood up, my legs felt
loose and rubbery _ as loose and rubbery as a puppet's. Once back
at my car, after nearly 10 hours of hiking, I flopped into the
front seat, drove out of the park and returned to The Sweet Lillian
bed-and-breakfast in Millinocket.
</P>
<P>
   Though I had no reservation, the owner welcomed me, found a room
(away from highway traffic) and offered a glass of red wine. I took
a long shower, ate a slow, relaxing meal at a nearby restaurant,
then went straight to bed. I fell into a deep sleep, as writer
Christine Jerome once said, as if I'd been ``poleaxed.''

   The entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well, not only in the
many new start-ups spawned by the revved-up economy, but inside
corporate America. The New York Times examines this attitude in
ENTREPRENEURS, a special news section filled with instructive
stories on ventures that worked _ and some that didn't _ along with
information useful to anyone interested in enterprise, no matter
what the scale.

   The entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well in both large and
small businesses, reports Times writer Louis Uchitelle in this
cover feature. It's certainly a prime competitive weapon in big
business. Witness Merck &AMP; Company, the giant pharmaceutical
corporation, whose scientists are encouraged to scout outside the
company for promising new research that might lead to a future
drug. Then there are the millions of Americans who believe that the
entrepreneurial spirit resides mainly in small companies with fewer
than 100 employees. Here, self-employment is a big phenomenon,
particularly among workers who have been laid off by corporations.
Uchitelle is a staff writer for The Times.

   John Shoch, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, scans the room
at Bucks, a folksy cafe in Woodside, Calif., and notes that he
recognizes about half the financiers, hardware engineers and
software hackers who are seated. Shoch is doing what he does best:
``surfing,'' or looking for the next big thing in the nation's
technology heartland. What will it be? Is it wireless data? Is the
time finally right for interactive digital television? John
Markoff, a staff writer for The New York Times, reports on the
blinding pace of Silicon Valley and what seems to be everyone's
pastime _ catching the next big wave. Markoff is co-author of the
book ``Takedown: The Pursuit and Capture of America's Most Wanted
Computer Criminal'' (Hyperion, 1996).

   It may not be easy to spell, but entrepreneurialism is all the
rage among potential MBAs. Driven by student and alumni demand, no
field is hotter today in business studies. Whereas a generation ago
the goal of top MBA graduates was to join a Fortune 500 company and
climb the corporate ladder, students' most fervent desire nowadays
seems to be to come up with a marketable idea, start a company and
work for themselves. Ethan Bronner, national educational
correspondent for The New York Times and author of ``Battle for
Justice: How the Bork Nomination Shook America'' (Norton, 1989),
explains why in this feature.

   Donald Katz, the 46-year-old author of three highly acclaimed
nonfiction books, is a rather unlikely entrepreneur. His
three-year-old Internet start-up, Audible Inc., offers custom audio
information delivered on demand over the Web to portable devices
you can listen to any time and anywhere, say, while jogging or
driving to work. Tom Redburn, the business enterprise editor for
The New York Times, interviews Katz, whose experiences provide
insight into the obstacles and confusions that arise when
nonbusiness types go into business in a big way. Redburn has
written for The International Herald Tribune and the Los Angeles

   Ken Hakuta's story is inspiring. He's the inventor of the Wacky
Wall Walker, those slime-covered plastic creatures that ooze down
vertical surfaces. The beauty of it is that Hakuta didn't even come
up with the idea: All he did was license the toy from Japan for a
tiny fraction of the amount he made. Now he's a millionaire! There
are a ton of ideas out floating around, reports Neil Strauss. But
who has the time _ and money _ to make them happen? Strauss
doesn't, which is why he is giving away his top 10 get-rich-quick
schemes in this humorous feature for those who want to pursue them:
portable baby sitters ... address books, cell phones and wallets
that beep when they're lost ... public egg banks. Strauss is a
staff writer for The Times.

<P>
   When Bettina Richards was an artist-and-repertory executive for
big recording companies, she didn't like the way they treated
musicians. Her favorite bands were ignored if they weren't best
sellers; one lead singer, who went on to make a gold album, was
told he shouldn't be singing at all. In 1992, she started her own
company: Thrill Jockey Records. It would release music she cared
about and let the musicians decide what to release, how to package
it and run their careers. A profile by Jon Pareles.

   At age 10, Harold S. Blue, now the chairman of Proxymed Inc., a
health-care information-services company, hired playmates to shovel
driveways instead of doing the work himself. He paid them $3 of the
$5 he collected. As a boy growing up in India, Vinod Gupta, the
founder of infoUSA Inc., a seller of business information in Omaha
with projected sales this year of $250 million, caught frogs and
sold them to a research laboratory for lunch money. Like other
successful entrepreneurs, these men seemed to have a natural bent
for seizing opportunities. What defines them? Brent Bowers,
co-author with Harold Geneen of the book ``The Synergy Myth'' (St.
Martin's Press, 1996), attempts to answer this question in this
feature.

 &UR; By LAURA MANSNERUS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Countless small-business owners have forged ahead
optimistically, ignoring the fact that they should have gotten
legal and accounting guidance before entertaining customers.
Lawyers are usually not a happy part of the plan for a new
business. Neither are accountants, investment advisers or other
professionals whose job it is to protect a business from the things
entrepreneurs would rather not think about. Laura Mansnerus, a
staff writer for The New York Times, explains why the suits should
be consulted before the grand opening.

   The entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well in both large and
small businesses, reports Times writer Louis Uchitelle in this
cover feature. It's certainly a prime competitive weapon in big
business. Witness Merck &AMP; Company, the giant pharmaceutical
corporation, whose scientists are encouraged to scout outside the
company for promising new research that might lead to a future
drug. Then there are the millions of Americans who believe that the
entrepreneurial spirit resides mainly in small companies with fewer
than 100 employees. Here, self-employment is a big phenomenon,
particularly among workers who have been laid off by corporations.
Uchitelle is a staff writer for The Times.

   John Shoch, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, scans the room
at Bucks, a folksy cafe in Woodside, Calif., and notes that he
recognizes about half the financiers, hardware engineers and
software hackers who are seated. Shoch is doing what he does best:
``surfing,'' or looking for the next big thing in the nation's
technology heartland. What will it be? Is it wireless data? Is the
time finally right for interactive digital television? John
Markoff, a staff writer for The New York Times, reports on the
blinding pace of Silicon Valley and what seems to be everyone's
pastime _ catching the next big wave. Markoff is co-author of the
book ``Takedown: The Pursuit and Capture of America's Most Wanted
Computer Criminal'' (Hyperion, 1996).

   It may not be easy to spell, but entrepreneurialism is all the
rage among potential MBAs. Driven by student and alumni demand, no
field is hotter today in business studies. Whereas a generation ago
the goal of top MBA graduates was to join a Fortune 500 company and
climb the corporate ladder, students' most fervent desire nowadays
seems to be to come up with a marketable idea, start a company and
work for themselves. Ethan Bronner, national educational
correspondent for The New York Times and author of ``Battle for
Justice: How the Bork Nomination Shook America'' (Norton, 1989),
explains why in this feature.

three-year-old Internet start-up, Audible Inc., offers custom audio
information delivered on demand over the Web to portable devices
you can listen to any time and anywhere, say, while jogging or
driving to work. Tom Redburn, the business enterprise editor for
The New York Times, interviews Katz, whose experiences provide

nonbusiness types go into business in a big way. Redburn has

   Ken Hakuta's story is inspiring. He's the inventor of the Wacky
Wall Walker, those slime-covered plastic creatures that ooze down

up with the idea: All he did was license the toy from Japan for a
tiny fraction of the amount he made. Now he's a millionaire! There
are a ton of ideas out floating around, reports Neil Strauss. But
who has the time _ and money _ to make them happen? Strauss
doesn't, which is why he is giving away his top 10 get-rich-quick
schemes in this humorous feature for those who want to pursue them:
portable baby sitters ... address books, cell phones and wallets
that beep when they're lost ... public egg banks. Strauss is a

   When Bettina Richards was an artist-and-repertory executive for
big recording companies, she didn't like the way they treated
musicians. Her favorite bands were ignored if they weren't best
sellers; one lead singer, who went on to make a gold album, was
told he shouldn't be singing at all. In 1992, she started her own
company: Thrill Jockey Records. It would release music she cared
about and let the musicians decide what to release, how to package
it and run their careers. A profile by Jon Pareles.

   At age 10, Harold S. Blue, now the chairman of Proxymed Inc., a
health-care information-services company, hired playmates to shovel
driveways instead of doing the work himself. He paid them $3 of the
$5 he collected. As a boy growing up in India, Vinod Gupta, the
founder of infoUSA Inc., a seller of business information in Omaha
with projected sales this year of $250 million, caught frogs and
sold them to a research laboratory for lunch money. Like other
successful entrepreneurs, these men seemed to have a natural bent
for seizing opportunities. What defines them? Brent Bowers,
co-author with Harold Geneen of the book ``The Synergy Myth'' (St.

   Countless small-business owners have forged ahead
optimistically, ignoring the fact that they should have gotten
legal and accounting guidance before entertaining customers.
Lawyers are usually not a happy part of the plan for a new

professionals whose job it is to protect a business from the things
entrepreneurs would rather not think about. Laura Mansnerus, a
staff writer for The New York Times, explains why the suits should

   &UR; IN THE VALLEY OF THE GOLD &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (1,100 words) &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN MARKOFF &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Shoch, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, scans the room
at Bucks, a folksy cafe in Woodside, Calif., and notes that he
recognizes about half the financiers, hardware engineers and
software hackers who are seated. Shoch is doing what he does best:
``surfing,'' or looking for the next big thing in the nation's
technology heartland. What will it be? Is it wireless data? Is the
time finally right for interactive digital television? John
Markoff, a staff writer for The New York Times, reports on the
blinding pace of Silicon Valley and what seems to be everyone's
pastime _ catching the next big wave. Markoff is co-author of the
book ``Takedown: The Pursuit and Capture of America's Most Wanted
Computer Criminal'' (Hyperion, 1996).

   It may not be easy to spell, but entrepreneurialism is all the
rage among potential MBAs. Driven by student and alumni demand, no
field is hotter today in business studies. Whereas a generation ago
the goal of top MBA graduates was to join a Fortune 500 company and
climb the corporate ladder, students' most fervent desire nowadays
seems to be to come up with a marketable idea, start a company and
work for themselves. Ethan Bronner, national educational
correspondent for The New York Times and author of ``Battle for
Justice: How the Bork Nomination Shook America'' (Norton, 1989),
explains why in this feature.

with projected sales this year of $250 million, caught frogs and
sold them to a research laboratory for lunch money. Like other

Lawyers are usually not a happy part of the plan for a new

professionals whose job it is to protect a business from the things
entrepreneurs would rather not think about. Laura Mansnerus, a

`PECKER': HMM, IS IT BECAUSE HE EATS LIKE A BIRD? 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finding hilarity in John Waters' latest movie title is the basic
prerequisite for enjoying the goofy ingenuity of his new film.
Remember that Waters proudly establishes himself as perhaps the
first filmmaker to accompany his directorial credit with a shot of
rats mating, and you'll be nicely attuned to ``Pecker'' and its
ebulliently trashy fun.
</P>
<P>
   As the title character, allegedly nicknamed Pecker because he
eats like a bird, Edward Furlong plays the happy, innocent
shutterbug at the center of this giddy satire. Pecker takes
pictures just because he loves to, and because, like Waters, he
thinks art is anywhere and everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The film watches what happens when Pecker's photographs of his
inner-city Baltimore neighborhood somehow catch the fancy of
Manhattan's art establishment (where Lili Taylor sums up the local
attitude by telling Pecker that she loves his look). ``Flavor of
Month Causes Tizzy in Art World'' reads the newspaper headline that
nicely summarizes this plot.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they call art up in New York, young man, looks like just
plain misery to me,'' says one stalwart in Baltimore (a city so
deeply revered here that Christina Ricci, as Pecker's girlfriend,
kisses the pavement at the Baltimore bus station after returning
from a trip to Manhattan). The film finds its share of amusement in
that attitude, too.
</P>
<P>
   The film watches as Pecker's pictures of his loved ones _
including the raucously funny Martha Plimpton as his sister, who
works in a gay bar where she calls everyone Mary, and the
grandmother (Jean Schertler) whose own Mary is a religious statue
she treats like a ventriloquist's dummy _ become famous as
``Pecker's delicious photographs of his culturally challenged
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ricci, whose character runs a laundromat and who takes to
Waters' lowlife milieu with the perfect, faux-naove ease, is
shocked to read that ``some paper named the Village Voice called me
a stain goddess!''
</P>
<P>
   When the fallout gets worse than that and Pecker's artistic
freedom starts to evaporate, the film shows hints of seriousness
without jeopardizing its jokey tone. In fact, Waters himself is the
best evidence that it's possible to wow the pretentious without
sacrificing a Pecker-like aesthetic at all.
</P>
<P>
   Drifting mischievously through ``Pecker'' are Mary Kay Place as
Pecker's mother, who runs a thrift shop and advises a homeless
couple not to be afraid of fashion; Lauren Hulsey as a little
Baltimore girl who has an eating disorder and is terrified by
fashionable vegetables in New York City; Brendan Sexton III,
Pecker's best friend, who's made his own art form out of
shoplifting; Cindy Sherman as herself, and Patricia Hearst as the
Warholian epitome of tacky New York glamor.
</P>
<P>
   Raunchy gay bar scenes contrast with the film's homey kitsch in
Baltimore and ratchet up its culture clash quotient an extra
notch. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Pecker'' is rated R. It includes nudity, strip bar scenes and
as many sneaky double-entendres as Waters can come up with. He can
come up with a lot. &QL;

<P>
   A different front
</P>
<P>
   The nurses coped with wrenching wounds and death, filth and the
flu, the threat of shells and poison gas. But they were also
fighting a battle on a different front.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving a letter from home with news that her town was
displaying a flag for the nurses, she wrote: ``I'm glad someone
appreciates the nurses. The patients are the only ones here that
do. ... We just have to fight for our very existence here.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, when the Army passed out tickets to receive donated
Christmas packages from America, they skipped the nurses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry about our Christmas, no one over here worries
about us, so why should you?'' she wrote her mother and father.
``We weren't given any cards or tickets or anything else, so we are
just out of luck. `S.O.L.' they say in the army. When I get back,
you won't understand my language, not because it is French or
German either.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their difficulties, the nurses found ways to endure, and
even raise their spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we were invited to dances,'' she wrote. ``The
English and French could go home for rest, but it was too far for
the Americans, so recreation was planned in plays and dances.''
</P>
<P>
   Humor helped them survive.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, they were loaded onto trains for transport.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (nurses) were fortunate to have a toilet on board, but the
men stopped along the way at different sidings,'' she wrote. ``One
of our nice doctors was caught with his pants down when the train
started up unexpectedly. He really got an ovation from the crowd as
he scrambled aboard clutching his clothes. We made fun out of every
little incident and were hilarious at times.''
</P>
<P>
   Letters helped, too _ especially from her lieutenant friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had a letter from Pete,'' she wrote home. ``He may be in the
next town for all I know. He censors his own mail but is a very
good soldier and wouldn't say a thing that wasn't right. Some
people at home think that your mail coming this way is opened, but
it isn't ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``... Marg Cooper got a letter from one of the girls at the base
today. It surely must be a wonderful place, but we are satisfied
with this wild and woolly life until the snow flies at least. ...
Our tent is pitched on a kind of a hill and even though I have my
cot propped up, my head is usually lower than my feet, and
sometimes I wake up and find the bunk has sort of skidded during
the night and my head is outside, with the flap of the tent forming
a bib. Oh it's a great life if you don't weaken. . . . It may not
be quite as comfortable as the little bungalows (at the base
hospital) . . . but I like it fine.''
</P>
<P>
   And when there were no letters, they sang to keep their courage
up.
</P>
<P>
   After pitching tents near Ypres, she wrote: ``. . . The boys
found three pianos while they were searching the dugouts. They say
some of the dugouts the Germans had were carpeted. Last night they
brought one of the pianos back to camp and put it up in the Red
Cross hut. Someone was clever enough to tune it and a lot of the
boys can play, so we had quite a concert.''
</P>
<P>
   They sang all the songs written for the war, sometimes devising
their own lyrics. For one called ``The Rose of No Man's Land,''
they substituted the words: `` 'Neath the war's red curse stands
the Cross Red Nurse. She's the rose of no man's land.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Army now
</P>
<P>
   The lighter moments helped them keep their fear in check. They
relocated the tent hospitals frequently, often on 24 hours notice,
so they could go where casualties were heaviest. They would pack 12
nurses to an ambulance and space their vehicles miles apart, so
planes wouldn't detect their moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The devastation along our route was unbelievable,'' she wrote.
``Houses just a pile of rubble, dead cows in the fields, bloated
bodies of horses along the muddy roads where rats were scurrying
out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they were several miles from the front, they were still
at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We soon learned the sound of a German Fokker plane,'' she
wrote. ``It didn't have the same droning sound of the Allied ones
and we hardly waited for the sound of the alarm to take cover. . .
. It seemed cruel to leave the bed patients, but (it was)
reasonable that someone should be left to take care of them in case
the hospital was bombed.''
</P>
<P>
   On the troop ship over, she had written her parents: ``. . . Now
mother, imagine us having such good times and everyone at home
worrying their heads off about us. You know, Uncle Sam is pretty
clever and I am sure I have never been safer in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Four months later, any romantic illusions she'd harbored about
the war had disappeared, replaced by an appreciation for the
paradox and futility of battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one at home has the faintest idea how they are getting
killed (here),'' she wrote home. ``... I'm sure no one realizes the
suffering of the boys. It's their spirit that affects me. I can
watch them amputate a leg and dress a wound that is open from the
hip down, but when a boy tells you he is sorry he lost (his leg)
because it puts him out and he can't go back, well I have to walk
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Daily, the medical teams fixed up men to be shot to pieces
again. At the same time, in the same tents, they worked to save
enemy prisoners _ the same men Allied soldiers were trying
desperately to kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of my ward there were several wounded German
prisoners, young towheaded, blue-eyed boys,'' she wrote. ``A guard
stood over them with a .45. Having American and German patients
together brought home the fact of how stupid any war is.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other absurdities.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1918, blacks and whites were kept separate even when sick
in the hospital,'' she wrote in her memoir. ``White orderlies were
supposed to give the personal care to the men, but when one refused
to give an enema to a black man, I was so angry I put up a screen
and took care of the patient myself. He was very grateful and that
was the only time I was ever thanked for giving an enema.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman who had signed her early letters home ``From your
soldier girl,'' and gaily referred to being ``in the Army now,''
had hardened into a pragmatic realist and passionate pacifist. She
would become a lifelong believer in equal rights.
</P>
<P>
   Coming home
</P>
<P>
   If the war began a personal transformation that defined the rest
of her life, it also began a transformation of women in general
back home.
</P>
<P>
   After more than 50 years of pressure from suffragists, it was
the women who served in WWI who finally shamed the government into
taking action on the right to vote.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1919, less than a year after the war ended, the U.S.
Senate passed the 19th Amendment. Women marked ballots for the
first time in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   By breaking the military's gender barrier, the 33,000 women who
served in WWI spurred other social changes. By WWII, women
encountered fewer barriers to serving, and more than 10 times that
number signed up. At war's end, thousands of them took up work in
fields previously dominated by men.
</P>
<P>
   But my grandmother couldn't know back then _ just as the war was
ending _ how it would affect her life or her country. She was
simply excited to be coming home safely.
</P>
<P>
   ``About Nov. 7th, we began to hear rumors that the armistice was
being planned,'' she wrote in her memoir. ``We didn't believe it,
for we still heard the guns and the wounded were still coming in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, one day, the 11th of November, everything became
quiet about 11 a.m. and you wondered what was different. There
wasn't a sound, for there were no birds to sing, or no cows to moo.
We still couldn't believe it possible, as we had so many patients.
A group of French trumpeters came in the afternoon and played for
us, so that was the only celebration we had.''
</P>
<P>
   By the Armistice, her unit had treated 15,000 casualties.
</P>
<P>
   It would be six more months before she got orders to go home.
She continued to care for the wounded, but with the war over, she
also spent time in Paris, Monaco and the French Alps.
</P>
<P>
   Though the shelling had stopped, the war continued to wound in
unexpected ways.
</P>
<P>
   While on leave in Nice, my grandmother bumped into a friend of
the first lieutenant she'd fallen in love with during training
camp, the man whose letters she read and reread when she was off
duty. She was told her lieutenant would arrive in the same city the
next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``With great expectation, Margaret and I went to the train to
meet him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had lost weight and looked very tired and just gave a nod
of recognition when we greeted him. We all got in a taxi and he saw
that we got off at our hotel, then he went on to where the officers
were staying.''
</P>
<P>
   She later learned he had been gassed and wounded, and his best
friend had been blown apart beside him in a trench two days before
the Armistice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw him again, and sent the little service pin back to
him by a messenger.''
</P>
<P>
   But heartache couldn't dampen her excitement at going home. On
May 31, 1919, she boarded the Cape Finesterre bound for America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming into New York harbor was an unforgettable event,'' she
wrote. ``Tugboats and fireboats came out to meet us and in my
exuberance, I flung my blue straw hat right at the Statue of
Liberty. Bands were playing and toilet paper was strung all over
the ship like confetti on a happy cruise ship.''
</P>
<P>
   She didn't know then that the celebration would be short-lived,
that she was returning to a country not ready to hear her stories
or those of the other women who served.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saying goodbye to all the friends we had made in the service
was very sobering,'' she wrote. ``On the train and the streetcar
home, I never felt so depressed and forlorn in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Though dressed in full uniform ``no one knew or noticed I was a
returning veteran.''
</P>
<P>
   Many years later, she said she knew how Vietnam veterans felt
when they they came home.
</P>
<P>
   After the war
</P>
<P>
   The war was rarely mentioned after her return.
</P>
<P>
   Though many of the nurses' experiences were more dramatic than
those of their husbands, boyfriends or brothers, they didn't talk
for fear of embarrassing the men. Social pressures against women
doing ``men's work'' also enforced their silence.
</P>
<P>
   But the war's imprint remained. It would influence my
grandmother's outlooks and actions for the rest of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Sick of the carnage of battle, she turned to obstetrical
nursing. ``I decided I had worked long enough with men,'' she
wrote. ``It was very pleasing and satisfactory work. The babies
were so lovely and everyone so happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Her nursing skills freed her from the family farm and gave her a
degree of economic independence still rare among women. Eager for
more adventure, she struck out for San Francisco to visit her
uncle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a graduate of a good school gave me prestige wherever I
wanted to go,'' she said later. ``They called me to the Children's
Hospital in San Francisco and I worked there for awhile. When I
thought it was time to return home (to Massachusetts), I tried to
get a job on the Dollar Line (cruise ship company) as far as New
York, but they said I would have to sign up for the trip around the
world. Sometimes I wish I had taken that cruise.''
</P>
<P>
   But by that time _ 1925 _ she was engaged to Wilson Smith, a
young shoe salesman who had grown up in the town next to hers. He
had served in the Navy on a submarine chaser during the war. They
married that year, when she was 32, relatively old for that era.
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother had two children _ the second, my father, when
she was 40. They lived first in Minneapolis and migrated in 1939 to
Seattle, where her husband sold shoes to Nordstrom and other stores
in his territory. Widowed in 1953, she moved to California in 1956
to be near her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   When my grandfather was alive, he was frequently on the road for
his work, so she lived a life not unlike a modern single mother,
filling many roles and fending for herself. It was a job the war
had taught her well.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, I was in awe of her. It seemed she could do
anything, from wiring a lamp to knitting a blanket. An accomplished
artist who painted and sculpted, she was always busy with her
hands.
</P>
<P>
   And her feminist leanings were not lost on me, her only
granddaughter, even at an early age.
</P>
<P>
   She used to tell me how she had run into two French officers on
cavalry horses at the beach. They let her ride but kept hold of her
reins, which wounded her pride. When one of them showed off by
riding up a steep sand dune and down the other side, she pulled her
horse free and rode up and down the same dune.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so angry,'' she would say, and laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Her legacy has been simple. She encouraged her children and five
grandchildren to follow our hearts, use our hands and speak our
minds.
</P>
<P>
   Today, when I ask her for advice, she always says the same
thing: ``Be yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Her quiet courage sustained us through the usual childhood woes
and deeper hurts as we got older.
</P>
<P>
   When she learned that my son _ her first great-grandchild _ was
deaf, she gamely picked up sign language in her 90s. Though her
gnarled, arthritic hands could barely shape the signs, they
communicated her love nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   When he died at age 7, her strength comforted me. She knew there
is the possibility of joy after such sorrow. The war had taught her
that.
</P>
<P>
   The war left other traces on her life as well.
</P>
<P>
   She went to the battlefields two years before women got the
vote. When she returned, she voted in every election until she was
103.
</P>
<P>
   Her patriotism, while not showy, ran deep. She would have
members of the military over for dinner on holidays and she always
put out the flag.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most enduring mark of my grandmother's
experience in WWI has been her lifelong recoil at the mention of
war.
</P>
<P>
   The few times she heard dinner-table talk of war or battlefield
exploits, she quickly stopped it.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, when I told her I was writing this article, she
was quiet for awhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wars are so unnecessary,'' she said finally.
</P>
<P>
   I realized, then, that although she has seldom spoken of it, the
war had spoken through her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen it,'' she would say when war talk came up. ``That's
why I'm a pacifist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there.''

`URBAN LEGEND' AUDIENCE WILL HEAR ECHOES OF `SCREAM'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to tell who's dumber at Pendleton College: the
students, who frequently walk alone even though a homicidal maniac
is on the loose; or the faculty, who won't believe that there's a
homicidal maniac on the loose despite overwhelming evidence and the
school's troubled past.
</P>
<P>
   The dumbness is part of ``Urban Legend's'' appeal. Watching this
movie, you can't help but feel intellectually superior to its
characters. It's the type of movie you enjoy not because it's fun,
but because you can make fun of it. But although the characters and
the script are pretty stupid, the movie isn't as dumb as it looks.
Sure, you might enjoy mocking it, but you'll spend YOUR money to
get in _ money that will wind up in the filmmakers' pockets. A lot
of money, judging from the success of ``Scream'' and ``I Know What
You Did Last Summer,'' the obvious inspirations for this movie.
</P>
<P>
   It's a neat trick: Making you feel smart while insulting your
intelligence, playing to the lowest common denominator and copying
what has already worked. You know what screenwriter Silvio Horta
did last summer (well, last fall): He saw a hit slasher movie,
screamed ``I can do that!,'' and by Halloween, he had a deal on his
hands. Then 26-year-old director Jamie Blanks hopped on the terror
train, raided teen-oriented TV shows for his cast, threw in a
couple of veterans like Robert Englund and John Neville, and added
some self-referential in-jokes (a couple of which are admittedly
very funny) to the script.
</P>
<P>
   It's as assembly-line as the plot, in which the one smart,
virginal student (Alicia Witt, as if four years on ``Cybill''
wasn't punishment enough) starts seeing her friends die in ways
straight out of urban legends. Because half of Horta's work was
done for him, all he had to do was come up with some linking scenes
to chain the killings together. Not to spoil anything, but these
include a bit about scratching on a car roof and another about a
dog in a microwave. Apparently, the killer has a thing against
anyone who has sex, fresh skin or a Stabbing Westward CD on the
boom box.
</P>
<P>
   The attractive young cast _ Jared Leto, Rebecca Gayheart,
``Dawson's Creek's'' Joshua Jackson _ is ... well, attractive and
young, giving mostly by-the-numbers performances. Although when the
killer is revealed, that particular cast member's acting switches
to an over-the-top style that has to be seen to be believed. It's
so enjoyably bad that it has to be intentional, a deliberate
attempt to get laughs by looking ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is just absurd enough to be entertaining _ although
its eyes-on-the-box-office cynicism is more disturbing than its
slasher-film content. It's hard to imagine the movie getting much
praise, even if you cut its youthful writer, director and cast a
lot of slack. Those bad reviews will have them licking their wounds
_ all the way to the bank.

`DIRTY LAUNDRY': CAN A LAUNDRYMAN BE TAKEN TO THE CLEANERS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Creating a comedy is like making a souffle. Two chefs can work
with the same ingredients and follow the same recipe, yet one
result will be airy and delightful; the other, heavy and flat.
</P>
<P>
   So it is with ``Dirty Laundry,'' which illustrates the
proposition that a script filled with comic situations doesn't
necessarily lead to comic results.
</P>
<P>
   Written by Michael Normand and directed by him and Robert
Sherwin, ``Dirty Laundry'' tells the story of the early midlife
crisis of Joey Greene, the dry-cleaning king of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   When first encountered, in the men's room of a convention of the
National Laundrymen's Association, Joey (Jay Thomas), is worried
about his thinning hair and his business.
</P>
<P>
   His marriage isn't in great shape, either, although he says he
still loves his good-looking wife, Beth (Tess Harper), who writes
for a magazine about people with poor emotional lives. In the last
couple of years, Joey has slept with Beth only once.
</P>
<P>
   And when Joey seeks the services of a psychiatrist, he is
advised to try sex with another woman. ``She wasn't a prostitute;
she was a prescription,'' Joey says in the film's best line, after
Beth surprises them together.
</P>
<P>
   Before Beth discovers Joey's dalliance, the audience discovers
that Beth has succumbed to the charms of her black chiropractor,
Lowel Bower (Stanley Earl Harrison), who is having relationship
problems of his own.
</P>
<P>
   So when Beth, who like her husband is white, learns she is
pregnant and decides to have the baby, she is not sure who the
father is and fears her infidelity will be exposed.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers pad out their work with characters like Chloe
(Erin Underwood) the Greenes' college-age adopted daughter and
Joey's elderly parents (Tresa Hughes and Michael Marcus), who
exemplify marriages that adjust, endure and overcome problems
through the decades.
</P>
<P>
   There are efforts to milk humor out of the psychiatrist,
dry-cleaning customers with complaints, letters sent by readers to
Beth, Joey's love of cooking, a dating service and bits of business
on the periphery of the action.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from Ms. Harper, who gives a spirited performance,
``Dirty Laundry'' exudes a tired, lifeless air. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Dirty Laundry'' is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying
parent or guardian). It includes impolite language and sexual
situations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DIRTY LAUNDRY
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Robert Sherwin and Michael Normand; written by
Normand; director of photography, John Newby; edited by Andrew
Morreale; music by James Legg; production designer, John Paino;
produced by Robert E. DiMilia and Sherwin; released by Artistic
License. Running time: 97 minutes. This film is rated R. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WITH: Jay Thomas (Joey Greene), Tess Harper (Beth Greene), Tresa
Hughes (Betty Greene), Michael Marcus (Max Greene), Stanley Earl
Harrison (Lowel Bower) and Erin Underwood (Chloe Greene). &QL;

FINALLY, A COLUMN COMPLETELY SAFE FOR CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Parents, you need not worry even a little about diverting any
young person's eyes from this column. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike nearly every other column in every paper in the country
in the last few weeks, this one will make no mention of oral sex. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nor will you find a word here about that disgusting Oval Office
cigar incident that would require you to dream up some lame
explanation to tell your curious kids about what in the world was
going on. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And there won't be a single word printed here having to do with
when sex is really sex and when, by contrast, it's simply
inappropriate intimate contact, whether engaged in by a president
and an intern or by anyone else in the whole wide world. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This being a safe-lex column, it will contain no ponderous
discussion at all about marital infidelity or sexual addiction, two
topics that have filled nearly every time slot on radio and TV in
recent weeks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nor will I offer you a detailed and disgusting history of
presidential prevarication _ starting with that ridiculous story
about George Washington allegedly confessing a cherry tree
massacre, passing on to Lyndon Johnson's many fibs about Vietnam,
plowing through Richard Nixon's non-denial denials in Watergate and
winding up with Bill Clinton looking us in the eye and denying he
had sexual relations with ``that woman.'' None of that. Not a
whisper. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And sex and lies aren't the only icky topics I will avoid just
so you may feel free to let your kids read my words today, if you
want. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, sex and lies are the biggies I'm avoiding, but I am
determined to child-proof this entire column by skipping any
discussion of several other frightening topics that would require
you to answer your kids' embarrassing questions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So today _ and maybe today only _ you will find nothing in here
about international terrorism. No pipe bombs, no sarin nerve gas,
no biological weapons of any kind that keep you and your children
up at nights worrying. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You will find no full passenger airplanes exploding in this
column, either because of terrorists or from simple, if mysterious,
mechanical failure. Beyond that, no graphic words will paint
pictures here of deadly car crashes on our interstate highways,
killing more of the thousands of people we knock off in that way
each year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And here's something for which to be profoundly grateful: This
column will contain not a peep about the appalling level of
substance abuse in this country. You will find no mention here of
marijuana or crack, no word about underage drinking or the carnage
that adult alcohol consumption causes in our culture. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying by my silence that those and other issues aren't
worthy of attention. Rather, I'm saying that you will not need to
worry about finding those difficult topics discussed here in this
column, which I've made safe for the tender eyes of the younger
generation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   White-collar crime, too, will go uncommented upon here today.
There is no reason to give youngsters ideas about using their
computers to rip off corporations and individuals or using their
higher math skills to defraud employers by clever use of numbers on
expense reports and such. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And while we're avoiding things, this column also will skip past
environmental disaster, divorce and the breakdown of family life,
the failures of our educational system, corporate welfare and
illegal insider trading. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's because today this squeaky clean column will be about
nothing that's in the news. Have a nice day. And give my best to
your precious kids. &QL;
</P>

 &HT;    BILLION-DOLLAR BUILDING PROJECT ALMOST HUNG UP ON $250 SHOWER
CURTAIN
 &HT;    FOR RELEASE SATURDAY, SEPT. 26
 &HT;    A PHOTO HAS BEEN PLACED ON THE NATIONAL FOLDER ON THE COX SERVER
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ But for a $250 shower curtain, the $1.3 billion
federal building project might have slid quietly toward a contract
award.
</P>
<P>
   That unexpected bump in the road came as a major annoyance for
Sen. John Warner, R-Va., who for years has been shepherding plans
for the new U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, proposed for his
state. Then citizens watchdog groups discovered the offending
shower curtain among hundreds of other extravagant items on a list
of $64 million in furnishings for the complex.
</P>
<P>
   The National Taxpayers Union, a 300,000-member organization,
took up a crusade on radio talk shows, and ABC-TV ran a news spot
earlier this month lampooning the project.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is unclear whether such criticism will force a
re-evaluation of the project, it spurred Warner to call a Senate
subcommittee hearing on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This went on the airwaves of America and it made us look like
fools,'' the senator said, glowering at a panel of consultants and
officials and demanding to know how a shower curtain could cost
$250. The grilling was held late in the afternoon, when news
coverage is usually unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel R. Collins, an accountant whose firm of Deva &AMP; Associates
had produced the furnishings list for the Patent office project,
tried haltingly to explain. ``The shower curtain is not a shower
curtain,'' he said, but an entire assembly of hardware for the
shower curtains for a planned fitness center. The $1,000 ``coat
rack'' was actually a coat closet, he said, and an item listed as
-- $309 ``ash urn'' included a chair.
</P>
<P>
   Patents and Trademarks Commissioner Bruce A. Lehman, who
reminded the senators that his agency is solely supported by the
fees that it charges, told Warner: ``I'm just going to swear to you
right now that we are not going to spend that kind of money for
those kinds of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Such explanations did little to satisfy skeptics, who have
dubbed the project the ``Taj Mahal'' and warned that it could
become the next major sinkhole for federal dollars, after the
costly new Ronald Reagan Office Building. The Reagan building,
first proposed to cost under $400 million, came in earlier this
year at $800 million. But that structure is at least owned by the
federal government. The 2.4 million-square-foot Patent headquarters
would cost almost twice as much for slightly less office space over
20 years. And it would be leased, not owned.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, supporters cite Deva &AMP; Associates findings to argue
that a new consolidated complex would save $72 million over the
costs of remaining in 18 older buildings scattered in Arlington,
Va., across the Potomac River from the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents fired back at Wednesday's hearing with a new private
study by the Arthur Andersen consulting firm projecting that,
rather than a saving money, the move would increase costs by $47.7
million. The review was ordered by Charles E. Smith Companies, the
current landlord, which is fighting to keep the Patent and
Trademark Office (PTO) in its buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The new study concluded that government estimates had not
anticipated cost overruns or delays that occur with most federal
construction projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the very least, the Andersen study means more analysis is
necessary,'' said National Taxpayers Union official
</P>
<P>
   Pete Sepp in an interview. ``If this much money is at stake,
what's the harm in taking a few more months to see if the option
PTO wants to pursue is the best one?''
</P>
<P>
   Sepp told Warner's hearing that Congress should consider whether
it would be more cost effective to renovate the buildings now under
lease.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said they expect a signed
contract by year's end under a lease plan that sets the rent at
$1.3 billion over 20 years, plus $135 million for relocating the
agency, which is scheduled to have 7,100 workers by the time the
building is constructed early in the next century. Supporters said
those ceilings were firm.
</P>
<P>
   However, at the hearing, Robert A. Peck, public buildings
commissioner for the General Services Administration was asked by
Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., ``Will you come back and ask for
more?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never say never,'' Peck said.
</P>
<P>
   Sepp said he plans to keep up his campaign against the project.
``I'm going to keep hammering on the air about this,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   My father was a young and energetic broker employed by a big
textile company, an immigrant's son prospering for the first time,
when his boss summoned him one day and said that because of
corporate setbacks, my father would have to accept a wage cut.
</P>
<P>
   He refused.
</P>
<P>
   Impetuously, he and another young broker resigned, rented an
office on Worth Street, and within a year they were earning more
than they ever had. They not only brokered trades in cotton cloth,
but purchased cloth themselves, gambling on resale at quick
profits.
</P>
<P>
   My father was an entrepreneur or, more precisely, he exhibited
some of the characteristics of an entrepreneur. The concept _ to
break with routine, to innovate, to seize an opportunity, to
develop something new _ is as old as capitalism. But the word
itself and the characteristics it suggests have become popular
among Americans only in the last 15 years as everyone, not just
immigrants and their children, struggles for a place in a rapidly
changing, increasingly competitive economy.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate America is spending billions of dollars on the
restless, entrepreneurial endeavor to develop popular new products
or to rejigger old ones to boost sales.
</P>
<P>
   Only a volatile stock market threatens to curtail this energy by
depriving entrepreneurs, particularly small entrepreneurs, of some
of the financing they need to carry out their ideas. Big companies
have more cash savings to draw on and easier access to credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entrepreneurial activity became a concern to the general
public in the 1980s, when we all thought that the United States was
falling behind, and that the rest of the world, particularly Japan,
would sink us,'' said William J. Baumol, an economist and historian
at New York University. ``As soon as people started worrying about
this, they said that Japan was entrepreneurial and America had lost
the spirit of entrepreneurship. And we began self-consciously to
reacquire that spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   My father, getting started in the 1920s, never thought of
himself as an entrepreneur. For him, the entrepreneurial spirit, a
term coming into vogue in his final years, resided exclusively in
energetic small-business owners.
</P>
<P>
   Small business has a role, of course. Starting a business, being
your own boss, risking your savings, operating with high energy _
all these characteristics appear in the evolving definition of the
entrepreneurial spirit, first described in the early 1800s by
Jean-Baptiste Say, a French economist.
</P>
<P>
   But innovation and invention are its essence. And while a Sam
Walton (Wal-Mart) or a Steven Jobs (Apple) or a James Clark and
Marc Andreessen (Netscape) still emerge from the ranks of the
lone-wolf entrepreneurs, innovation and invention occur as often
today in big companies as in small ones. More often, probably.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has happened is that entrepreneurial innovation has
become the prime competitive weapon, and industry can no longer
wait for the occasional geniuses to come along with something
new,'' Baumol said. ``Companies have had to routinize invention and
innovation. And the big companies have the money to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Merck &AMP; Company, the giant pharmaceutical corporation, certainly
does. Its scientists, who develop drugs at Merck's laboratories,
are encouraged to take on the additional task of scouting outside
the company for promising new research or new technologies that
might lead to the development of a future drug.
</P>
<P>
   When they find this promising outside research they make their
case to a Merck board for money to finance or to buy the outside
research or to form a partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``An entrepreneur to me,'' said Bennett M. Shapiro, the
executive vice president of Merck's worldwide basic research, ``is
someone who picks up something not going on at Merck, but is
important to the future development of a drug, and then makes the
case for why we should fund a relationship, as if he were an
independent entrepreneur appealing to venture capitalists for
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of Merck's 5,000 scientists are so entrepreneurial, but
those who are, and succeed in bringing valuable research to Merck,
get handsome payoffs in stock options.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the entrepreneurial flexibility now evident in big
companies, millions of Americans appear to believe that the
entrepreneurial spirit resides mainly in small companies; that is,
owner-operated companies with fewer than 100 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The great attention focused on Silicon Valley start-ups feeds
this view. So do venture capitalists, who buy into the start-ups,
hoping that their innovative products will run up big sales,
quickly raising the value of the venture capitalist's investment.
</P>
<P>
   The Small Business Administration and the National Federation of
Independent Business, a powerful Washington lobbying group
representing small companies, also foster the perspective that
small companies are the chief source of entrepreneurial activity.
For this reason, among several others, small companies should get
government support in the form of special tax breaks and special
exemptions from some regulations. Or so the argument goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the rawest sense of entrepreneurial,'' said William Dennis,
the federation's director of research, ``if I establish a new firm,
I have taken an entrepreneurial act. I have acted in the belief
that I know something others don't, and I am exploiting an
advantage others do not have.''
</P>
<P>
   That is an appealing thought at a time when self-employment is a
big phenomenon, particularly among immigrants and among workers who
have been laid off by corporations. By this definition, a Korean
immigrant, for example, is entrepreneurial if he sets up a flower
kiosk on a street corner, acting on an insight that, in his view, a
competitor on the opposite corner has failed to grasp. He is acting
on the belief that he will draw more customers because his new
kiosk is closer than his competitor's to a bus stop.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists agree that starting a business is
entrepreneurial. But if the Korean immigrant's kiosk survives and
he then presides over a routine daily operation, as most small
business owners do, is he still entrepreneurial?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is no, unless he regains that status by giving his
operation another entrepreneurial kick. David Allen, who founded
Allen Associates in the Boston suburb of Ayer, fits this pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after earning an engineering degree 35 years ago, Allen
began a company to manufacture and sell a wire-and-sponge device
that he had invented and patented to keep corsages moist. The
device sold, and for 20 years, he earned a steady five-figure
income. His entrepreneurial start-up faded into a
nonentrepreneurial, day-to-day operation.
</P>
<P>
   When their two sons became teen-agers in the early '80s, Marie
Allen joined her husband, bringing to the enterprise a background
in, and a yen for, marketing. She soon hit on a way to increase
sales revenues from the 600 wholesale florists who were her
husband's customers.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling to regional trade shows, Allen said: ``We look for
promising new products that people are trying to introduce into the
floral industry, but cannot manage to sell. Marie takes them to
market with our products; we currently are selling 25 different
items to our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Annual revenue for the Allens has nearly quadrupled to $1.1
million from $300,000, when Mrs. Allen came aboard 15 years ago,
and it has reawakened the family business.
</P>
<P>
   From Adam Smith's day, the entrepreneurial spirit, in one guise
or another, has been a huge source of change and expansion for the
capitalist market system. The great early-20th century economist,
Joseph A. Schumpeter, gave the concept its modern, expansive twist,
defining an entrepreneur as someone who breaks with routine.
</P>
<P>
   The entrepreneurial function, he wrote, ``does not essentially
consist in either inventing anything or otherwise creating the
conditions which the enterprise exploits. It consists in getting
things done'' right down to ``making a success of a particular kind
of sausage or toothbrush.''

<P>
   WOODSIDE, Calif. _ John Shoch, a Silicon Valley venture
capitalist, scans the room at Bucks, a folksy cafe in this affluent
bedroom community, and notes that he recognizes about half the
financiers, hardware engineers and software hackers who are seated.
</P>
<P>
   Shoch is doing what he does best. He calls it ``surfing'':
looking for the next big thing in the nation's technology
heartland. He is a key player in a remarkably efficient system that
brings together vast pools of capital and good ideas.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs everywhere in Silicon Valley that the region is
no longer an unconnected bunch of competitors located near the
Stanford University campus, which gave birth to the valley's first
company, Hewlett-Packard Company.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, changing jobs in Silicon Valley Inc. is now as simple
as turning into a new driveway on the way to work, or as simple an
idea as the newly created garage.com, which matches entrepreneurs
with venture-capital firms.
</P>
<P>
   A walk down University Avenue in Palo Alto, increasingly the
valley's brain center, will take you past the brand-new offices of
Accel Partners, one of the valley's premier venture-capital firms.
The partners are upstairs; downstairs,
``entrepreneurs-in-residence'' are busy incubating start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   This financing mechanism has created the semiconductor chip, the
digital watch, video games, the personal computer and most recently
the commercial Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Time in the valley seems compressed. This is evident from the
exploding megahertz ratings of microprocessor chips to the
ballooning megabyte storage capacities of memory chips and disk
drives, making everything move faster at an ever-increasing rate.
Around the valley it is best described as living on Internet time.
</P>
<P>
   For Shoch, whose firm, Asset Management, has just completed a
$100 million-plus fund, these are both heady and nervous times.
</P>
<P>
   Surfing, in Shoch's parlance, means catching the next big wave
of technology innovation. And despite the fact that there are more
and more billions of venture-capital dollars flowing into the
valley each year, it is complicated. (The recent stock-market
jitters have left venture capitalists here nervous but still
enthusiastic; in short, holding their breath.)
</P>
<P>
   While the pace of change has become predictable, charting the
direction of change is still an art form.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you'll paddle furiously to catch a wave that fails
to materialize,'' Shoch said. ``While at other times the wave will
appear suddenly and you'll find yourself paddling just as furiously
to try to catch it before it leaves you behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Silicon Valley venture capitalists have made their
reputation by finding and riding a certain wave. For example, in
1989 John Hummer and Ann Winblad established the first
venture-capital firm to focus exclusively on software companies,
just when the software industry was blossoming.
</P>
<P>
   And there are legendary figures, like John Doerr, a partner at
Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield &AMP; Byers. Doerr has had the knack of
making the best investments spanning three eras: personal
computers, workstations and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, everyone was convinced that the next big
thing would be interactive digital television. The vision: Happy
families would sit in their living rooms in front of their TVs and
bank, shop, communicate with other people and be entertained. The
living room has so far not proven to be the right place for
interacting with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Missteps like these have led to absurdities like a Florida
market trial in which a Silicon Valley company tried to hook up TV
sets to computer workstations that had been fine-tuned to pump
movies and digital information into homes. The concept failed
because it cost more than many families want to spend: $25,000
each.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson, of course, is that in Silicon Valley the term
``visionary'' usually describes a job title and not an ability. If
you pressure venture capitalists over a meal at Il Fornaio in Palo
Alto, they will confess that they expect a shakeout and acknowledge
that they are concerned about the huge capital flows coming into
the valley.
</P>
<P>
   One consequence can be seen in the remarkable appreciation of
the value of new deals _ there is just too much money chasing too
few great ideas.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment the risks seem to be outweighed by the
incredible opportunities inspired by the emergence of cyberspace.
While everyone was looking the other way, the Internet sneaked up
on Silicon Valley and sent the venture-capital community racing to
finance start-ups like Netscape Communications, Yahoo, Excite,
Infoseek and Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of the Internet has cranked up the valley's economy to
a feverish pitch. Companies like Apple Computer and Sun
Microsystems have been reinvigorated by the boom in Internet
commerce. There are so many new companies being formed that initial
public offerings are no longer the typical outcome for a start-up.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than five times as many companies created each
year as there are available IPO dollars. Consequently, acquisition
has become an endgame for most start-ups, according to Technologic
Partners, a firm that monitors venture capital in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   That in turn has made the valley even more of a technology
hothouse, attracting a new kind of venture backer _ large
technology companies like AT&AMP;T, Lucent, Intel and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, although Intel executives once referred to the valley's
venture community as ``vulture capitalists'' because they would
entice employees away to start to new chip ventures, the company is
now running the valley's largest venture fund, valued at more than
$300 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the boom-time atmosphere, there are signs that the
Internet wave is cresting and that Silicon Valley is entering one
of those periods between new technologies and new industries.
</P>
<P>
   Today there is no certainty about the next big thing after the
Internet, but everyone is looking. Is it wireless data or is the
time finally right for interactive digital television?
</P>
<P>
   Some believe that the valley is on the brink of an epochal
shift, perhaps from the world of electronic to optical computing.
Such a shift has been predicted for many years by some of the
valley's best thinkers. The world of optical computing is much more
in tune with the communications-rich future that now seems all
around.
</P>
<P>
   The common wisdom here, however, is that any new invention is
subject to the ``15-year'' rule: It usually takes at least 15 years
for a new technology to make it from the laboratory to the market.
</P>
<P>
   In a world where timing is everything _ the right investment at
the wrong moment can be just as disastrous as making the wrong bet
_ a venture capitalist can be left with a lot of sleepless nights,
even in the best of times.

<P>
   EVANSTON, Ill. _ As the sun begins its pink descent behind the
neo-Gothic spire of Deering Library, two barefoot students lazily
toss a Frisbee across a great expanse of lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Four flights up, in Northwestern University's Leverone Hall, 18
students and a professor are gathered around a classroom table.
</P>
<P>
   The talk this July evening is not of Dante or of the
pre-Socratics. It is of angel investors, price-earnings ratios and
what it means to work for a company so young that its founders
still have no desks or no telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   The students, led by Steven Rogers, a clinical professor of
management, are spending their summer working for start-up
companies in the area in what may turn into full-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
   All the students are in the master's of management program of
Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management, one of scores of
business schools that over the last five years have built programs
and majors in entrepreneurship studies, an arresting mix of the
plainly pragmatic and the utterly ephemeral.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by student and alumni demand, no field is hotter today in
business studies than that of entrepreneurship. Whereas a
generation ago the goal of top MBA graduates was to join a Fortune
500 company and climb the corporate ladder, students' most fervent
desire nowadays seems to be to come up with a marketable idea,
start a company and work for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   According to Murray Low, who directs entrepreneurship studies at
Columbia University, scholarship in the field is exploding.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s there were only a few scholarly journals
devoted to new businesses. Today there are 26, most of them started
in the last five years. In 1980, there were 18 entrepreneurship
chairs at business schools. Today there are more than 200.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Katz of St. Louis University, who has been tracking this
growth, says that in a 1991 study of the approximately 300
accredited business schools in the country, a couple dozen were
found to offer some course work in entrepreneurship. Today, about
120 of them offer it as a major.
</P>
<P>
   While defining entrepreneurship studies remains problematic,
scholars in the field agree that its sudden popularity has several
roots. First, the corporate downsizing of the '80s changed the view
that a good corporate job meant long-term security.
</P>
<P>
   Second, technology and globalization have changed the way the
world does business. A product's shelf life has been greatly
reduced, and challenges from remote places mean that companies need
flexibility, which is a challenge for large, formal hierarchies of
traditional corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, scholars say, young people have grown up in an
environment that emphasizes independence and self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entrepreneurship is really about the three P's: pride, passion
and perseverance,'' said A. Barry Merkin, a clinical professor of
entrepreneurship at Kellogg. ``It's about risk-taking, boldness and
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The best analogy, Merkin noted, is to sports. ``Intuitive
qualities are essential, but few can reach real heights without
coaching,'' he said. ``There are basic things to learn, like
accounting and finance, but also narrower areas like writing a
business plan, raising capital. I also try to give my students a
feeling of what it is like to go through something like this, the
tensions and frustrations, because folks who go into this without
realizing what they are doing will face nervous breakdowns, heart
attacks and divorce.''
</P>
<P>
   These are not matters, either the business plans or the heart
attacks, most academics with Ph.D.'s want to teach or to study.
There is a lack of reliable data on start-up companies, and without
data it is hard to produce rigorous scholarship, the grist of
academic careers.
</P>
<P>
   This has created a split, because alumni are donating truckloads
of dollars to set up centers and chairs in entrepreneurship, yet
there are no scholars to fill them.
</P>
<P>
   New York University is a good example. Its Stern School of
Business has four endowed chairs of entrepreneurship, two unfilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see entrepreneurship as a word in search of a meaning in the
academic sense,'' said George Daly, Stern's dean. ``Academics sort
themselves into these little silos, and entrepreneurship is not
easily matched for them. But the role being played by small,
innovative enterprises in our society is phenomenal and should be
studied. The challenge is to persuade academics to look beyond
their own boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Business schools are increasingly turning to practitioners
rather than scholars to teach entrepreneurship, either alone or
paired with a more traditional professor. That is why Merkin of
Kellogg is called a ``clinical professor,'' on the model of medical
school professors who are M.D.s rather than Ph.D.'s. This, too, has
caused tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally speaking, tenured professors consider businessmen
without Ph.D's to be lower-life forms,'' said Kenneth P. Morse, the
founder of high-tech ventures and managing director of the
Entrepreneurship Center at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology Sloan School of Management. ``But there were 1 million
start-ups in the world last year, and anyone who wants to be
involved in such a start-up has a lot to learn _ how to pick the
funding, how to give a raise, how not to run out of money. This is
different from what used to be taught.''
</P>
<P>
   Young scholars are beginning to take the plunge. One is Paul A.
Gompers, an associate professor of business administration at
Harvard Business School. Gompers acknowledges the difficulty in
gathering data but says the field is too exciting to allow that to
be a barrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get data from private consulting firms or through large
pension funds or endowments that provide access to their files,''
Gompers said. ``A lot of it is hand-collected. I'm putting together
data on 1,300 firms, collecting a complete financial history, their
boards of directors, scales of compensation to study how they
operate and grow. I have hired 10 to 15 research assistants during
the course of this project over the last two and a half years.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, much of what goes on at entrepreneurship centers
today consists of students going through the motions of setting up
new ventures, and sometimes actually doing the ventures. Business
school has turned into a kind of laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Business-plan competitions, both local and national, have grown
rapidly in scale with students presenting their plans to venture
capitalists and competing for donated prize money to help them set
up companies.
</P>
<P>
   One such winner was Evan Schumacher, a 29-year-old native of
Boston who finished at Northwestern this spring. His plan called
for setting up a software company that tracks global shipping,
freight and customs management for international firms.
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher won the Kellogg competition and took his plan to
Austin, Tex., in May for national finals. He was a finalist, and as
he walked off the stage after his presentation, his wireless
microphone still clipped to his lapel, a man in the audience
approached him and asked how much he needed.
</P>
<P>
   The man became the company's first angel investor, in for
$250,000. The company, Celarix, was born at the end of June in
Chicago. So far, it has raised $500,000 from investors and is
planning to raise another $1 million to $2 million from venture
capitalist firms. A third employee will join the company this
month.

 By TOM REDBURN 
 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   WAYNE, N.J. _ Drive west from Manhattan, through the Lincoln
Tunnel and into the thick of one of the many commercial
bloodstreams that feeds the suburban beast engulfing New York City.
Go about 20 miles from the Hudson River to a nondescript office
building that overlooks a 14-theater multiplex and a warehouse-size
Costco. That is where you'll find, on the third floor, a modest
little company called Audible Inc., which just happens to have
outsize ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   It's an unlikely location, certainly, for a three-year-old
Internet start-up, one that hopes to create a big audience for
something completely different: custom audio information delivered
on demand over the Web to portable devices you can listen to any
time and anywhere, say, while jogging or driving to work.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the guy who founded the company, Donald Katz, who is
46 and the author of three highly acclaimed nonfiction books, is a
rather unlikely entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Katz never marched to anyone's beat but his own. In starting
Audible, he drew on his own experiences as a writer combined with
the thirst to create something new from the seemingly limitless
potential of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Audible seeks to wed the oldest of human technologies, the
spoken word, with the newest of technologies,'' he said with
characteristic ardor. ``We want to be a leader in teaching the
Internet to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Translating that vision into a successful business will not be
easy. Audible is losing plenty of money.
</P>
<P>
   The company has about 35 employees, its own portable player and
a Web site (www.audible.com) where users can immediately download
from a selection of 16,000 hours of copyrighted audio files
containing everything from traditional read-aloud books like Frank
McCourt's ``Angela's Ashes'' ($9) to bundles of advice ($3 to $13)
from the Harvard Business Review and such. For all its success in
building a new infrastructure, however, the company is just
beginning to attract paying customers.
</P>
<P>
   Katz is accustomed to taking risks. For two decades, from the
time he left graduate school at the London School of Economics in
1975, Katz was a free-lance journalist.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '80s, Katz turned his attention to money and
business. Originally from Chicago, he decided to write a book about
Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Company, his hometown giant.
</P>
<P>
   Sears, the once-great store of the American middle class and one
of the most secretive corporations in the country, was in the midst
of an immense crisis. Katz persuaded Edward Telling, its chief
executive, to give him carte blanche access to the company. The
book, ``The Big Store,'' took six years to research and write.
</P>
<P>
   Katz followed with two other books that also required him to
open closed doors, one a look at the post-World War middle-class
experience told through a single extended family that revealed its
most intimate secrets, and the other an inside look at Nike and its
reclusive chairman, Phil Knight.
</P>
<P>
   In business, surprisingly, Katz did find a subject worthy of
epic treatment. And he discovered he had a taste for it.
</P>
<P>
   With Ed Lau, his college roommate who moved into the computer
industry, Katz began to develop an idea for a business that would
deliver radio programs and audio books through the Internet. His
next book project, on the convergence of digital technologies, was
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something I couldn't write into reality,'' Katz said.
``I had to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He found a fresh outlet for the powers of persuasion that had
opened so many doors in his writing career. The first big convert
was Tim Mott, now a wealthy private investor in Ketchum, Idaho, who
is renowned in Silicon Valley as a co-founder of Electronic Arts,
the computer-game maker, and Macromedia, a software company
specializing in multimedia graphic-design applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get calls all the time about start-up ideas, and I probably
look at least one business plan a week,'' Mott said. ``Over the
course of five years, I've seen, maybe, four that I wanted to
commit money and time. This was one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   With Mott as chairman, they made the round of venture-capital
firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim's business experience and Don's visionary ideas were a
powerful combination,'' said Kevin Compton, a partner at Kleiner
Perkins who became their chief backer there. ``Three minutes into
conversation you could just feel his passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Audible is built around the premise that lots of people are
willing to pay regularly to fill their time _ on the go _ with
constantly changing packages of verbal packages of entertainment,
news and practical advice.
</P>
<P>
   Even more promising is the potential for pumping millions of
mobile workers full of management information, corporate training
and ``time-shifted'' business news while traveling.
</P>
<P>
   To make all that possible, Audible had to design its own
portable player. It is roughly the size and shape of an electric
razor, holds two hours of audio and plugs into a personal computer
through a cradle similar to one used in hand-held computers. People
can carry the battery-powered gadget anywhere, listen to it through
headphones or play clips in a car stereo system.
</P>
<P>
   Programs are stored on a computer, ready to refill the player as
soon as it is returned to its cradle, which remains attached to the
computer.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, though, the player is also an Achilles heel. It
is relatively expensive, costing $200 as a stand-alone purchase.
Two hours is not enough storage time, particularly since lots of
audio books run three to four hours. And it is not easy for the
technologically challenged to try.
</P>
<P>
   To overcome these drawbacks, Audible is developing a
second-generation player with greater abilities and is exploring
new pricing plans similar to those used to sell mobile-phone
services, in which buyers would receive the player at a steep
reduction if they sign up for a subscription.
</P>
<P>
   Relying mostly on word of mouth, Audible says it has attracted
more than 5,000 customers and shipped about 3,000 players. Those
using the player spend an average of about $20 a month on fresh
content.
</P>
<P>
   But Audible's real ace in the hole is not the player but the
rights it has painstakingly sewn up with dozens of content
providers. It is introducing new programs _ from an audio digest of
The Wall Street Journal to National Public Radio's ``Fresh Air''
program _ that will be sent automatically to a subscriber's
computer.
</P>
<P>
   And it will adapt all Audible's products so they can be played
on a variety of portable devices, beginning with the hand-held
organizers powered by Microsoft's Windows CE software.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the recent stock-market turmoil, Audible's outside
investors, who own about 56 percent of the company (the founders
and employees own the rest) remained cautious about going public,
insisting they do not intend to sell stock until the company is
generating a growing and predictable revenue stream.
</P>
<P>
   Which is a good thing, given the uncertainty about even the most
promising Internet ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no in-between,'' said Paul Hawken, the author of
``Growing a Business'' and an entrepreneur who co-founded Smith &AMP;
Hawken, the mail-order garden-supply company. ``Either Audible will
be a billion-dollar-plus company or it will be wallpaper. I suspect
it will be the former.''

   Whenever I look at my bank statement, I think of Ken Hakuta, aka
Dr. Fad. Best known as the inventor of the Wacky Wall Walker, he
made some $20 million from slime-covered plastic creatures that
ooze down vertical surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of it is that Hakuta didn't even come up with the
idea: All he did was license the toy from Japan for a tiny fraction
of the amount he made. Now he's a millionaire and is a prominent
figure on the lecture and convention circuits.
</P>
<P>
   With one simple idea he achieved the American dream _ money and
fame.
</P>
<P>
   There are countless Hakutas _ inventors of the pet rock, sliced
bread, the rolling lint remover, the better mousetrap. And I want
to be one. But I'm too busy writing articles like this one to
follow up on any get-rich-quick schemes, and I can't seem to put
the energy into starting a corporation dedicated to carrying out my
ideas. So I have decided to give them away.
</P>
<P>
   1. Some clever wag has beaten me to the idea of portable gyms:
trainers who park outside your home in vans full of exercise
equipment. But no one has come up with portable baby sitters. Tired
of having to constantly call home during a dinner date to check on
your child or to leave a movie early to deal with a small
emergency? With a portable baby sitter, your child can follow you
around on your date or outing in an RV with toys, a bed and a
licensed sitter. Now you can look in on your little one during
theater intermissions and deal with a crisis without abandoning
your plans.
</P>
<P>
   2. Copyright millennium slogans or register Web site domain
names that corporations will eventually want to buy from you. Some
examples of slogans include ``A new car for a new millennium'' or
``Relief for the morning after the millennium.'' For Web sites, you
could try to cut yourself in on a piece of Mr. Hakuta's millions
and register a wackywallwalker.com.
</P>
<P>
   3. The inventions of tow ropes and chairlifts revolutionized
skiing, enabling entrepreneurs to open ridiculously overpriced ski
resorts. So where are the surf resorts? Tow ropes, jet skis and
above-water conveyer belts could drop surfers off at their favorite
wave and save them from exhausting, time-consuming paddling. Of
course, some surfers will complain that paddling to the wave is
integral to the sport, but soon surfing anywhere besides a resort
will seem as antiquated as hiking uphill to ski.
</P>
<P>
   4. The best entrepreneurs come up with products nobody has heard
of and then persuade the public that it can't live without them.
Here is my candidate: by developing a system to measure the sense
of smell (akin to the eye-chart test), an entrepreneur can make a
fortune by inventing smelling aids for people with deficient
olfactory nerves.
</P>
<P>
   5. Create a line of address books, cell phones, wallets and
purses that, like cordless telephones, beep when they're lost. Even
better, for obsessive message-checkers not satisfied with pagers,
devise a key chain or a small toy that lights up whenever their
answering machine takes a call. In addition, a huge market has
opened up in Japan for cellular phone accessories that could be
exploited in America: different styles of straps and antennae,
trinkets to make phones ring differently and lights that flash when
the phone rings.
</P>
<P>
   6. Become an apartment broker in a competitive city like New
York or San Francisco. But instead of representing realtors or
buildings, start a trustworthy company that represents renters.
They can tell you exactly what they want, then you find it and pay
a deposit to reserve the apartment until they can see it. To corner
the market, you could pay apartment owners a fee to give you a copy
of their listing on the same day they send it to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   7. There are sperm banks, but no public egg banks. These would
be for working women who don't want to have children until they
retire. This way, women can finally stop the ticking of that
biological clock by depositing an egg when they're in their 20s or
30s. The egg will then be preserved until a woman is ready to rear
a child.
</P>
<P>
   8. The best ice cream in the world is Bertillon, a French
delicacy with flavors so precise that anyone marketing it in
America could revolutionize the ice-cream business the way Jelly
Bellys cornered the jelly bean market. This is not a joke, but a
way to a better society.
</P>
<P>
   9. One reason people drive when they're drunk is because they
don't want to have to take a cab home and then wake up in the
morning without their car. By creating an 800-IM-DRUNK line in
car-oriented cities like Los Angeles and Dallas, this problem could
be solved. The service would actually drive a chauffeur to a
restaurant, club or house to take the inebriated client home (or
even to another bar or party) in his or her own car.
</P>
<P>
   10. I was recently notified that someone had taken my idea of
making custom fortune cookies for parties. But kids' dolls could be
personalized in a similar way by having a talking toy like Tickle
Me Elmo or Teletubby and replacing its voice chip with a homemade
one. It could either have personalized messages (``Get to work,
George'') or just undoll-like comments. (``Gee whiz, cover up your
bellybutton, it looks obscene.'')
</P>
<P>
   Space prohibits me from elaborating on more ideas. But with
hundreds of thousands of people reading this, it seems very likely
that within the next 24 hours these baker's-dozen recommendations
will soon be patented and put into development.

 &HT;    
 By JON PARELES 
 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   When Bettina Richards was an artist-and-repertory executive for
big recording companies, she didn't like the way they treated
musicians. Her favorite bands were ignored if they weren't best
sellers; one lead singer, who went on to make a gold album, was
told he shouldn't be singing at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't happy,'' Richards said. ``I was making money, but I
couldn't talk to anyone about the great show I saw last night or
the great record I found. It was a job.''
</P>
<P>
   So in 1992, she started her own company: Thrill Jockey Records,
named after a gang of delinquents in a B movie. It would release
music she cared about and let the musicians decide what to release,
how to package it and run their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted a company where the artists' expectations and the
labels' abilities were in line,'' she said. ``I don't think major
labels are inherently evil or out to destroy the world. I just
don't happen to use music that fits their system.''
</P>
<P>
   That music, Richards said, is simply ``what I like.'' Thrill
Jockey is a leading outlet for what some critics have named
``post-rock'': instrumentals that elude categorization as jazz, pop
tunes or dance music. The label's best-selling band is Tortoise,
whose most recent album has sold nearly 100,000 worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   But Thrill Jockey has also released albums by the
neo-Appalachian duo Freakwater, two women who sing about hard
times; the electronic group Oval, which has built compositions on
the sounds of skipping CDs; and the Nerve, a peppy alternative-rock
band.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of freaky, left-of-center stuff that she puts out,
but at the same time there's a big enough audience so that she can
make a living,'' said Nic Harcourt, the creative music director of
KCRW-FM in Santa Monica, Calif., and the host of the station's
``Morning Becomes Eclectic,'' a program that the music business on
the West Coast follows closely.
</P>
<P>
   In six years, Thrill Jockey has released 60 albums (both as CDs
and old-fashioned vinyl LPs), singles and EPs. All but three
releases have broken even or turned a profit. By contrast, 80
percent to 90 percent of albums from major labels post losses.
</P>
<P>
   But Thrill Jockey works on a grass-roots scale, seeking sales in
thousands rather than millions; its typical release breaks even
with sales of 1,500 CDs and 500 LPs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Thrill Jockey's profit was $183,000, and while that
is probably less than what Columbia Records spends on catering, it
is a success story in independent rock.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, Richards, who is 33 years old, did everything
herself, from signing talent to lining up band interviews. Now
Thrill Jockey has three other full-time employees and one part
timer and is about to buy its own small building.
</P>
<P>
   Richards started Thrill Jockey while working four days a week at
Pier Platters, an alternative-rock record store in Hoboken, N.J.
She ran the label from her third-floor walk-up apartment on Avenue
C in Manhattan, carrying mail-order CDs to UPS because she didn't
ship enough to qualify for a pickup.
</P>
<P>
   Her capital was $20,000 from her grandmother, $10,000 from her
father and the $5,000 from her savings account; she has never
needed another infusion. Her business advisers were people who had
started their own labels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was constantly asking advice from people: cheaper places to
press things, ways to cut corners,'' she said. ``One thing about
independently distributed record labels is that you don't get this
competitive feeling. As long as you are willing to reciprocate with
information, people are happy to give it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Richards moved from New York to Chicago, where her main
manufacturer and distributor, Touch and Go, is based. Rent and
taxes are considerably lower than they are in New York, she noted.
</P>
<P>
   Many independent companies are stepping stones for bands that
hope to be discovered by major labels. By contract, the smaller
labels then share in the profits from the major-label releases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to spend my time as a farm label,'' Richards
said. ``From a business standpoint, it would be better to have
bands bound to contracts so I'd get a piece of their future. But I
don't want to make money from a system I don't support.''
</P>
<P>
   Thrill Jockey makes unusually generous deals with musicians.
Once an album breaks even, the label and the musicians each get 50
percent of the gross receipts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the net comes down, they actually get more than me,''
Richards said. Contracts are often literally a handshake.
</P>
<P>
   Richards chooses bands that, she thinks, can benefit from the
scale of her company and will stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``If becoming famous is their primary focus, then we're not the
right label for them,'' she said. ``But if they want to continue to
make music and live off that, then that's a goal we can achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   Thrill Jockey records most albums for under $3,000, one
three-hundredth of what a band like U2 spends, and advertises
sparingly. Video clips tend to be made by friends of the bands or
as projects by art students, though they have been shown
occasionally on MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Thrill Jockey depends largely on the unpaid promotion of college
radio stations and reviews in the press, but it also uses club disk
jockeys and skateboarding magazines to reach consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each record is totally different,'' Richards said. ``It's not
as if I sold a really great new garbage can or a nice clock. Your
most popular band this year could be completely unpopular next
year. My company has to be flexible and adapt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want my company to stay in business and do well,'' Richards
said. ``But the creative stuff was always the motivation that
sparked it. It wasn't, I see a way to make money better. It was, I
can make this artist's experience better.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lot of work,'' Richards added. ``But it never feels
like a job.''

   Even as children, many of them spotted a business angle nobody
else did, and milked it for all it was worth.
</P>
<P>
   At age 10, Harold S. Blue, now the chairman of Proxymed Inc., a
health-care information-services company in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
figured he could make more money if he hired playmates to shovel
driveways instead of doing the work himself. He paid them $3 of the
$5 he collected and even had the presence of mind to ply his trade
outside his neighborhood so that the mothers wouldn't catch on to
his scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was out of high school, Blue owned and operated two
drug stores.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy growing up in a village in India 100 miles north of New
Delhi, Vinod Gupta, the founder of infoUSA Inc., a seller of
business information in Omaha with projected sales this year of
$250 million, caught frogs at a swamp and sold them to a research
laboratory for lunch money.
</P>
<P>
   In college, he rented entire passenger-train cars to make a
36-hour trip to New Delhi, and then sold seat tickets individually
for a quick 25 percent profit.
</P>
<P>
   Not every successful business owner can boast of such an early
flair for salesmanship. But even those who drifted or were pushed
into entrepreneurial careers seem to have a natural bent for
seizing opportunities that make competitors wonder why on earth
they didn't think of that themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Is that what defines them? They are an eclectic lot who operate
ventures that vary from grocery stores to Internet start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Donald J. Jonovic, a consultant in Cleveland who has advised
hundreds of family businesses, says he never fails to be astonished
by the ``raw diversity'' of American entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at some of them and you ask, `My God, how'd that
happen?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a country that prides itself on individualism and counts
literally millions of entrepreneurs, it is a question worth asking.
Small businesses, roughly defined as ventures controlled by their
founders and taking in less than $250 million in revenue a year,
are an enormous force in the American economy.
</P>
<P>
   But what drives their owners to strike out on their own rather
than take refuge in the predictability and perks of salaried jobs?
</P>
<P>
   The experts, of course, have their views. Jonovic says true
entrepreneurs are marked by a combination of ``tunnel-vision
dedication'' and supreme self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   David G. Winter, a professor of psychology at the University of
Michigan, said they are propelled by a zeal to excel at whatever
they do, a trait he calls ``achievement motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have this optimism, this exuberance, this boldness,''
Winter said, which can take the form of restlessness, especially if
their business grows into a larger, bureaucratic organization they
can't control. If that happens, he said, ``they may be so unable to
deal with it that they get dismissed by their board. Or they may
quit and start all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said entrepreneurs often display a streak of
authoritarianism because they believe their method is the only way
to do things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing their best is what matters most to them, as opposed to a
concern with friendship or power,'' Winter said.
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurs, he added, tend to come from middle-class
backgrounds, not blue-collar homes or wealthy families, ``which
still view small business as a step downward into vulgar trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonovic said that many entrepreneurs are tightfisted, not out of
greed but because each dollar they earn represents a small fraction
of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew a successful entrepreneur who ended up in a nursing
home and wouldn't pay for a private room because he wanted to keep
his estate above $1 million,'' Jonovic said.
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurs themselves cite a long list of self-defining
characteristics and attributes: decisiveness, resilience, focus, a
love of battle, a penchant for risk-taking, workaholism, good
social skills.
</P>
<P>
   But as they recount their histories, two core themes leap out,
flip sides of the same coin: They want to be their own boss, and
they show an uncanny knack for detecting opportunities that others
missed.
</P>
<P>
   For most entrepreneurs, it all begins with the realization that
working for somebody else just isn't a choice.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to go it alone can be liberating, but it can also
be scary because it means cutting off the corporate safety net.
</P>
<P>
   Eric B. Segal, the president of the Kenzer Corp., an
executive-recruiting firm in New York, recalls the near-panic he
and his partner, Robert D. Kenzer, felt in the early days of
running their company in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Segal had been a corporate executive in the retail industry, but
quit a high-paying job after he got what he viewed as an
insufficient raise. As he and Kenzer scrambled to find clients, he
said, he kept thinking: Where's the check? Where's Mommy?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are rules you learn from working in big business, but
nobody's prepared for flying without the net until you do it,''
said Segal, who is 55. ``It's frightening. I see a lot of corporate
guys who can't make the conversion.''
</P>
<P>
   But many entrepreneurs insist that the absence of security is a
small price to pay for the freedom to operate at their own pace and
on their own scale.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Yellin, a small-business consultant who works out of her
Manhattan apartment, says she is determined to remain a one-person
show earning just enough money to live comfortably and ``feed my
cat Fancy Feasts.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Yellin is quick to see business possibilities in
humdrum circumstances. A telemarketing specialist who has made an
instructional tape titled ``Warming Up to Cold Calling,'' Yellin,
46, has even figured out how to turn phone pitches she receives at
home to her financial advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of the callers are terrible at selling,'' she said.
``That gives me an opportunity to call their bosses and say, `You
should book me for some training.'''

 By LAURA MANSNERUS 
 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Deborah L. Jacobs, lawyer-turned-writer, gave a heartfelt
compliment to the young man who arrived with his helper to clean
her house in Brooklyn recently: the name of his service was awfully
clever. But she wasn't going to leave it at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you trademarked it?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   He had not, he told Jacobs, who happened to be the author of
``Legal Smarts for Small Business.'' And that answer worried her,
enough that she will not disclose the name of the young
entrepreneur's business until he has finished scurrying around to
obtain trademark protection.
</P>
<P>
   After all, a name that isn't trademarked can be used by someone
else unless the first person brings out expensive legal artillery
to stop the competition.
</P>
<P>
   It was just one example, Jacobs said, of how small-business
owners forge ahead optimistically, figuring that nothing can go
wrong, when they should part with a few hundred dollars, or a few
thousand depending on the legal task, for a lawyer who, by training
and temperament, can anticipate everything going wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``How far can an entrepreneur get without a lawyer?'' she said.
``Pretty far. But it can cost you a lot, a whole lot, later.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers are usually not a happy part of the plan for a new
business. Neither are accountants, investment advisers or other
professionals whose job it is to protect a business from the things
entrepreneurs would rather not think about.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the typical entrepreneurial attitude,'' said Fred S.
Steingold, a lawyer in Ann Arbor, Mich., and the author of ``The
Legal Guide for Starting and Running a Small Business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to get along with their business, and they're not
detail-oriented,'' he said. ``They're impatient. That's what makes
them good entrepreneurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Some tiny service businesses, of course, start and run fine
without professional advice; a dog walker or a window washer can
obtain a business license (and probably should in many cities, for
tax reasons), file a Schedule C and never pay for a consultation.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a retail or a professional business, Jacobs said, ``as a
sole proprietor you can absolutely hang out your shingle without
consulting a lawyer, although if you're operating out of your house
you might want to check the zoning rules.''
</P>
<P>
   But any other form of ownership _ partnership and any type of
corporation _ requires legal and probably accounting guidance.
</P>
<P>
   On the complexity scale, the simplest is a partnership, which
most experts say should begin with a written agreement spelling
out, for example, what happens if one owner dies or quits the
business. This is well-charted territory, especially since the
Uniform Partnership Act governs in almost all states, and by
following legal guides for the general public and form books that
contain standard agreements, most people can do the paperwork and
whatever modifications they want.
</P>
<P>
   But even Steingold, whose publisher, Nolo Press, produces
self-help books and software, suggests that a lawyer review an
agreement. He gives the same advice for forming a simple
corporation _ with the preliminary note that owners might want to
first ask a lawyer whether they need to incorporate.
</P>
<P>
   (The main advantage, ordinarily, is protection of the individual
owners from legal liabilities. There are tax advantages and
disadvantages, too, best sorted out by an accountant.)
</P>
<P>
   The paperwork _ state filing papers, articles of incorporation
and shareholder provisions _ is manageable for most people; Nolo
Press, among others, publishes general guides and versions specific
to several states, including New York and California.
</P>
<P>
   Having a lawyer review the documents is fairly painless: in
Steingold's case, about an hour of his time, or $175. For handling
the whole process, his flat fee in most cases is $600. (In big
cities, where costs are generally higher, charges can run as high
as $2,000.)
</P>
<P>
   As for buying a business, whatever you plan to do, Steingold
said, self-education and self-representation won't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need advice on whether to buy the assets or just the
corporate shell,'' he said. ``The typical purchase agreement is
pretty complicated. There are all kinds of decisions about how it's
going to be financed. Then there are 10 to 20 documents that show
up at a closing.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people, he said, will come into a lawyer's office with a
proposed sales contract that originated with the seller or came
from a form book, ``but it would be difficult for somebody who
doesn't have any legal experience to go through a closing.''
</P>
<P>
   Do-it-yourself accounting is not recommended either, but
entrepreneurs can keep bills down by doing the prep work. Software
programs offer simplified bookkeeping tasks and enable people to
monitor cash-flow statements and projections.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone starting a business should be thoroughly immersed in
those numbers anyway, said Ginny Beauchamp, the vice president of
the National Association for the Self-Employed in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Beauchamp added, however small the business, ``having an
accountant do audits a couple times a year is a very good idea, and
if your business is growing by leaps and bounds, obviously you need
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the simplest sole proprietorships can do without
accountants for tax planning and preparation. Businesses can get in
trouble for failing to keep up with changes in tax law, as many did
several years ago when they failed to amend their Keough plans.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a quarter of small-business owners were delinquent in
filing new plans with the Internal Revenue Service, many because
they were unaware of the new requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs said small-business owners, whether through
cost-consciousness or hopeful ignorance, make two mistakes in
circumventing lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   First, she said, they wave off legal advice until they are in
trouble. She mentioned the entrepreneur who spent hundreds of
thousands of dollars making a CD-ROM called ``The First Electronic
Jewish Bookshelf.'' His product brought a warning letter from
Microsoft, which was using the term ``bookshelf.'' At that point,
the entrepreneur had to get a lawyer and enter extremely expensive
settlement negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Second, she said, ``many attempt to play amateur lawyer.''
Jacobs recommends self-help books to pare legal costs and identify
business concerns. Nolo's, she advised, ``are very well researched
and well written and provide great background.'' Even after
practicing law for six years, she does not hesitate to hire others.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I need a specialized kind of legal help, I hire the best
expert I can,'' she said. ``I would no sooner be an amateur in the
legal field than I would be an amateur electrician and rewire my
house.''

`SKIN AND BONE': HUSTLERS WITH CHICKENS? WAIT, THERE'S FANTASY,
TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ghislaine sounds pretty casual when she calls a client to say,
``I'm going to have to cancel your afternoon beating.'' The same is
true when she explains to someone else that a client used a
branding iron on poor Robby, and when she reports, ``One of my
chickens got kidnapped or something.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Skin and Bone,'' Ghislaine (Nicole Dillenberg), a brunette
with harsh makeup and an omnipresent car phone, runs a male
prostitution service in Los Angeles, specializing in fantasy
encounters. She seems to be a symbol for the hard-hearted city and
the show biz industry that keeps it alive.
</P>
<P>
   Everett Lewis, the writer and director of ``Skin and Bone,''
would probably say he was using the experiences of young male
hustlers, who are also, of course, would-be actors, to make a
statement about power, desire and self-delusion.
</P>
<P>
   But when this bleak, disjointed movie appears on the screen, it
often comes across as if it had been planned like a pornographic
feature: OK, this time let's make it a milkman and a lonely
housewife and we'll give them each three lines before they get down
to business. What other kind of thinking could produce the scene in
which Harry (B. Wyatt), the old pro, instructs Dean (Alan Boyce),
the new boy, in the proper use of a riding crop on a client?
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, many scenes require the male leads to be nearly
or completely naked.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis does one thing right, and he does it several times. He
effectively mixes us up as to what's real and what isn't. It's hard
to tell when a client-hustler interaction begins and ends, and
whether a particular scene, involving two men in police uniforms,
is a fantasy paid for by the hour, a television show being filmed
or a real-life crime.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the point. Real life has consequences, and the
question of whether the bullets _ literal or metaphorical _ are
real or blanks matters. Billy (Garrett Scullin), a young hustler
who gets his start posing for the 12 Months of Bondage calendar,
finds that out.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime moviegoers have seen the dehumanizing audition scene a
thousand times. The talented but unknown and unappreciated young
actor is asked, by a cavalier producer or casting director, to turn
around and to take off his shirt, and feels as if he's being
treated like a piece of meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skin and Bone'' has a scene like that, too, but it packs a
particular wallop because we've just seen the same character at
work as a hustler. And the audition is clearly 10 times as
demeaning.
</P>
<P>
   The film's strongest message is, in fact, a questioning of the
actor's trade. After a middle-aged customer changes his mind about
what he wants to do with the young hustler he has paid for, the
younger man shouts: ``I am not a whore! I'm an actor! I sell
fantasies!''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' point seems to be that it's all the same. What's the big
difference, he asks, between acting out the fantasies of one rich
old man or those of a few million ticket buyers? &QL;

 By LOUIS UCHITELLE 
 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   My father was a young and energetic broker employed by a big
textile company, an immigrant's son prospering for the first time,
when his boss summoned him one day and said that because of
corporate setbacks, my father would have to accept a wage cut.
</P>
<P>
   He refused.
</P>
<P>
   Impetuously, he and another young broker resigned, rented an
office on Worth Street, and within a year they were earning more
than they ever had. They not only brokered trades in cotton cloth,
but purchased cloth themselves, gambling on resale at quick
profits.
</P>
<P>
   My father was an entrepreneur or, more precisely, he exhibited
some of the characteristics of an entrepreneur. The concept _ to
break with routine, to innovate, to seize an opportunity, to
develop something new _ is as old as capitalism. But the word
itself and the characteristics it suggests have become popular
among Americans only in the last 15 years as everyone, not just
immigrants and their children, struggles for a place in a rapidly
changing, increasingly competitive economy.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate America is spending billions of dollars on the
restless, entrepreneurial endeavor to develop popular new products
or to rejigger old ones to boost sales.
</P>
<P>
   Only a volatile stock market threatens to curtail this energy by
depriving entrepreneurs, particularly small entrepreneurs, of some
of the financing they need to carry out their ideas. Big companies
have more cash savings to draw on and easier access to credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entrepreneurial activity became a concern to the general
public in the 1980s, when we all thought that the United States was
falling behind, and that the rest of the world, particularly Japan,
would sink us,'' said William J. Baumol, an economist and historian
at New York University. ``As soon as people started worrying about
this, they said that Japan was entrepreneurial and America had lost
the spirit of entrepreneurship. And we began self-consciously to
reacquire that spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   My father, getting started in the 1920s, never thought of
himself as an entrepreneur. For him, the entrepreneurial spirit, a
term coming into vogue in his final years, resided exclusively in
energetic small-business owners.
</P>
<P>
   Small business has a role, of course. Starting a business, being
your own boss, risking your savings, operating with high energy _
all these characteristics appear in the evolving definition of the
entrepreneurial spirit, first described in the early 1800s by
Jean-Baptiste Say, a French economist.
</P>
<P>
   But innovation and invention are its essence. And while a Sam
Walton (Wal-Mart) or a Steven Jobs (Apple) or a James Clark and
Marc Andreessen (Netscape) still emerge from the ranks of the
lone-wolf entrepreneurs, innovation and invention occur as often
today in big companies as in small ones. More often, probably.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has happened is that entrepreneurial innovation has
become the prime competitive weapon, and industry can no longer
wait for the occasional geniuses to come along with something
new,'' Baumol said. ``Companies have had to routinize invention and
innovation. And the big companies have the money to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Merck &AMP; Company, the giant pharmaceutical corporation, certainly
does. Its scientists, who develop drugs at Merck's laboratories,
are encouraged to take on the additional task of scouting outside
the company for promising new research or new technologies that
might lead to the development of a future drug.
</P>
<P>
   When they find this promising outside research they make their
case to a Merck board for money to finance or to buy the outside
research or to form a partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``An entrepreneur to me,'' said Bennett M. Shapiro, the
executive vice president of Merck's worldwide basic research, ``is
someone who picks up something not going on at Merck, but is
important to the future development of a drug, and then makes the
case for why we should fund a relationship, as if he were an
independent entrepreneur appealing to venture capitalists for
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of Merck's 5,000 scientists are so entrepreneurial, but
those who are, and succeed in bringing valuable research to Merck,
get handsome payoffs in stock options.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the entrepreneurial flexibility now evident in big
companies, millions of Americans appear to believe that the
entrepreneurial spirit resides mainly in small companies; that is,
owner-operated companies with fewer than 100 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The great attention focused on Silicon Valley start-ups feeds
this view. So do venture capitalists, who buy into the start-ups,
hoping that their innovative products will run up big sales,
quickly raising the value of the venture capitalist's investment.
</P>
<P>
   The Small Business Administration and the National Federation of
Independent Business, a powerful Washington lobbying group
representing small companies, also foster the perspective that
small companies are the chief source of entrepreneurial activity.
For this reason, among several others, small companies should get
government support in the form of special tax breaks and special
exemptions from some regulations. Or so the argument goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the rawest sense of entrepreneurial,'' said William Dennis,
the federation's director of research, ``if I establish a new firm,
I have taken an entrepreneurial act. I have acted in the belief
that I know something others don't, and I am exploiting an
advantage others do not have.''
</P>
<P>
   That is an appealing thought at a time when self-employment is a
big phenomenon, particularly among immigrants and among workers who
have been laid off by corporations. By this definition, a Korean
immigrant, for example, is entrepreneurial if he sets up a flower
kiosk on a street corner, acting on an insight that, in his view, a
competitor on the opposite corner has failed to grasp. He is acting
on the belief that he will draw more customers because his new
kiosk is closer than his competitor's to a bus stop.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists agree that starting a business is
entrepreneurial. But if the Korean immigrant's kiosk survives and
he then presides over a routine daily operation, as most small
business owners do, is he still entrepreneurial?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is no, unless he regains that status by giving his
operation another entrepreneurial kick. David Allen, who founded
Allen Associates in the Boston suburb of Ayer, fits this pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after earning an engineering degree 35 years ago, Allen
began a company to manufacture and sell a wire-and-sponge device
that he had invented and patented to keep corsages moist. The
device sold, and for 20 years, he earned a steady five-figure
income. His entrepreneurial start-up faded into a
nonentrepreneurial, day-to-day operation.
</P>
<P>
   When their two sons became teen-agers in the early '80s, Marie
Allen joined her husband, bringing to the enterprise a background
in, and a yen for, marketing. She soon hit on a way to increase
sales revenues from the 600 wholesale florists who were her
husband's customers.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling to regional trade shows, Allen said: ``We look for
promising new products that people are trying to introduce into the
floral industry, but cannot manage to sell. Marie takes them to
market with our products; we currently are selling 25 different
items to our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Annual revenue for the Allens has nearly quadrupled to $1.1
million from $300,000, when Mrs. Allen came aboard 15 years ago,
and it has reawakened the family business.
</P>
<P>
   From Adam Smith's day, the entrepreneurial spirit, in one guise
or another, has been a huge source of change and expansion for the
capitalist market system. The great early-20th century economist,
Joseph A. Schumpeter, gave the concept its modern, expansive twist,
defining an entrepreneur as someone who breaks with routine.
</P>
<P>
   The entrepreneurial function, he wrote, ``does not essentially
consist in either inventing anything or otherwise creating the
conditions which the enterprise exploits. It consists in getting
things done'' right down to ``making a success of a particular kind
of sausage or toothbrush.''

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   WOODSIDE, Calif. _ John Shoch, a Silicon Valley venture
capitalist, scans the room at Bucks, a folksy cafe in this affluent
bedroom community, and notes that he recognizes about half the
financiers, hardware engineers and software hackers who are seated.
</P>
<P>
   Shoch is doing what he does best. He calls it ``surfing'':
looking for the next big thing in the nation's technology
heartland. He is a key player in a remarkably efficient system that
brings together vast pools of capital and good ideas.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs everywhere in Silicon Valley that the region is
no longer an unconnected bunch of competitors located near the
Stanford University campus, which gave birth to the valley's first
company, Hewlett-Packard Company.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, changing jobs in Silicon Valley Inc. is now as simple
as turning into a new driveway on the way to work, or as simple an
idea as the newly created garage.com, which matches entrepreneurs
with venture-capital firms.
</P>
<P>
   A walk down University Avenue in Palo Alto, increasingly the
valley's brain center, will take you past the brand-new offices of
Accel Partners, one of the valley's premier venture-capital firms.
The partners are upstairs; downstairs,
``entrepreneurs-in-residence'' are busy incubating start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   This financing mechanism has created the semiconductor chip, the
digital watch, video games, the personal computer and most recently
the commercial Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Time in the valley seems compressed. This is evident from the
exploding megahertz ratings of microprocessor chips to the
ballooning megabyte storage capacities of memory chips and disk
drives, making everything move faster at an ever-increasing rate.
Around the valley it is best described as living on Internet time.
</P>
<P>
   For Shoch, whose firm, Asset Management, has just completed a
$100 million-plus fund, these are both heady and nervous times.
</P>
<P>
   Surfing, in Shoch's parlance, means catching the next big wave
of technology innovation. And despite the fact that there are more
and more billions of venture-capital dollars flowing into the
valley each year, it is complicated. (The recent stock-market
jitters have left venture capitalists here nervous but still
enthusiastic; in short, holding their breath.)
</P>
<P>
   While the pace of change has become predictable, charting the
direction of change is still an art form.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you'll paddle furiously to catch a wave that fails
to materialize,'' Shoch said. ``While at other times the wave will
appear suddenly and you'll find yourself paddling just as furiously
to try to catch it before it leaves you behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Silicon Valley venture capitalists have made their
reputation by finding and riding a certain wave. For example, in
1989 John Hummer and Ann Winblad established the first
venture-capital firm to focus exclusively on software companies,
just when the software industry was blossoming.
</P>
<P>
   And there are legendary figures, like John Doerr, a partner at
Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield &AMP; Byers. Doerr has had the knack of
making the best investments spanning three eras: personal
computers, workstations and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, everyone was convinced that the next big
thing would be interactive digital television. The vision: Happy
families would sit in their living rooms in front of their TVs and
bank, shop, communicate with other people and be entertained. The
living room has so far not proven to be the right place for
interacting with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Missteps like these have led to absurdities like a Florida
market trial in which a Silicon Valley company tried to hook up TV
sets to computer workstations that had been fine-tuned to pump
movies and digital information into homes. The concept failed
because it cost more than many families want to spend: $25,000
each.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson, of course, is that in Silicon Valley the term
``visionary'' usually describes a job title and not an ability. If
you pressure venture capitalists over a meal at Il Fornaio in Palo
Alto, they will confess that they expect a shakeout and acknowledge
that they are concerned about the huge capital flows coming into
the valley.
</P>
<P>
   One consequence can be seen in the remarkable appreciation of
the value of new deals _ there is just too much money chasing too
few great ideas.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment the risks seem to be outweighed by the
incredible opportunities inspired by the emergence of cyberspace.
While everyone was looking the other way, the Internet sneaked up
on Silicon Valley and sent the venture-capital community racing to
finance start-ups like Netscape Communications, Yahoo, Excite,
Infoseek and Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of the Internet has cranked up the valley's economy to
a feverish pitch. Companies like Apple Computer and Sun
Microsystems have been reinvigorated by the boom in Internet
commerce. There are so many new companies being formed that initial
public offerings are no longer the typical outcome for a start-up.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than five times as many companies created each
year as there are available IPO dollars. Consequently, acquisition
has become an endgame for most start-ups, according to Technologic
Partners, a firm that monitors venture capital in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   That in turn has made the valley even more of a technology
hothouse, attracting a new kind of venture backer _ large
technology companies like AT&AMP;T, Lucent, Intel and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, although Intel executives once referred to the valley's
venture community as ``vulture capitalists'' because they would
entice employees away to start to new chip ventures, the company is
now running the valley's largest venture fund, valued at more than
$300 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the boom-time atmosphere, there are signs that the
Internet wave is cresting and that Silicon Valley is entering one
of those periods between new technologies and new industries.
</P>
<P>
   Today there is no certainty about the next big thing after the
Internet, but everyone is looking. Is it wireless data or is the
time finally right for interactive digital television?
</P>
<P>
   Some believe that the valley is on the brink of an epochal
shift, perhaps from the world of electronic to optical computing.
Such a shift has been predicted for many years by some of the
valley's best thinkers. The world of optical computing is much more
in tune with the communications-rich future that now seems all
around.
</P>
<P>
   The common wisdom here, however, is that any new invention is
subject to the ``15-year'' rule: It usually takes at least 15 years
for a new technology to make it from the laboratory to the market.
</P>
<P>
   In a world where timing is everything _ the right investment at
the wrong moment can be just as disastrous as making the wrong bet
_ a venture capitalist can be left with a lot of sleepless nights,
even in the best of times.

<P>
   EVANSTON, Ill. _ As the sun begins its pink descent behind the
neo-Gothic spire of Deering Library, two barefoot students lazily
toss a Frisbee across a great expanse of lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Four flights up, in Northwestern University's Leverone Hall, 18
students and a professor are gathered around a classroom table.
</P>
<P>
   The talk this July evening is not of Dante or of the
pre-Socratics. It is of angel investors, price-earnings ratios and
what it means to work for a company so young that its founders
still have no desks or no telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   The students, led by Steven Rogers, a clinical professor of
management, are spending their summer working for start-up
companies in the area in what may turn into full-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
   All the students are in the master's of management program of
Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management, one of scores of
business schools that over the last five years have built programs
and majors in entrepreneurship studies, an arresting mix of the
plainly pragmatic and the utterly ephemeral.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by student and alumni demand, no field is hotter today in
business studies than that of entrepreneurship. Whereas a
generation ago the goal of top MBA graduates was to join a Fortune
500 company and climb the corporate ladder, students' most fervent
desire nowadays seems to be to come up with a marketable idea,
start a company and work for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   According to Murray Low, who directs entrepreneurship studies at
Columbia University, scholarship in the field is exploding.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s there were only a few scholarly journals
devoted to new businesses. Today there are 26, most of them started
in the last five years. In 1980, there were 18 entrepreneurship
chairs at business schools. Today there are more than 200.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Katz of St. Louis University, who has been tracking this
growth, says that in a 1991 study of the approximately 300
accredited business schools in the country, a couple dozen were
found to offer some course work in entrepreneurship. Today, about
120 of them offer it as a major.
</P>
<P>
   While defining entrepreneurship studies remains problematic,
scholars in the field agree that its sudden popularity has several
roots. First, the corporate downsizing of the '80s changed the view
that a good corporate job meant long-term security.
</P>
<P>
   Second, technology and globalization have changed the way the
world does business. A product's shelf life has been greatly
reduced, and challenges from remote places mean that companies need
flexibility, which is a challenge for large, formal hierarchies of
traditional corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, scholars say, young people have grown up in an
environment that emphasizes independence and self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entrepreneurship is really about the three P's: pride, passion
and perseverance,'' said A. Barry Merkin, a clinical professor of
entrepreneurship at Kellogg. ``It's about risk-taking, boldness and
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The best analogy, Merkin noted, is to sports. ``Intuitive
qualities are essential, but few can reach real heights without
coaching,'' he said. ``There are basic things to learn, like
accounting and finance, but also narrower areas like writing a
business plan, raising capital. I also try to give my students a
feeling of what it is like to go through something like this, the
tensions and frustrations, because folks who go into this without
realizing what they are doing will face nervous breakdowns, heart
attacks and divorce.''
</P>
<P>
   These are not matters, either the business plans or the heart
attacks, most academics with Ph.D.'s want to teach or to study.
There is a lack of reliable data on start-up companies, and without
data it is hard to produce rigorous scholarship, the grist of
academic careers.
</P>
<P>
   This has created a split, because alumni are donating truckloads
of dollars to set up centers and chairs in entrepreneurship, yet
there are no scholars to fill them.
</P>
<P>
   New York University is a good example. Its Stern School of
Business has four endowed chairs of entrepreneurship, two unfilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see entrepreneurship as a word in search of a meaning in the
academic sense,'' said George Daly, Stern's dean. ``Academics sort
themselves into these little silos, and entrepreneurship is not
easily matched for them. But the role being played by small,
innovative enterprises in our society is phenomenal and should be
studied. The challenge is to persuade academics to look beyond
their own boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Business schools are increasingly turning to practitioners
rather than scholars to teach entrepreneurship, either alone or
paired with a more traditional professor. That is why Merkin of
Kellogg is called a ``clinical professor,'' on the model of medical
school professors who are M.D.s rather than Ph.D.'s. This, too, has
caused tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally speaking, tenured professors consider businessmen
without Ph.D's to be lower-life forms,'' said Kenneth P. Morse, the
founder of high-tech ventures and managing director of the
Entrepreneurship Center at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology Sloan School of Management. ``But there were 1 million
start-ups in the world last year, and anyone who wants to be
involved in such a start-up has a lot to learn _ how to pick the
funding, how to give a raise, how not to run out of money. This is
different from what used to be taught.''
</P>
<P>
   Young scholars are beginning to take the plunge. One is Paul A.
Gompers, an associate professor of business administration at
Harvard Business School. Gompers acknowledges the difficulty in
gathering data but says the field is too exciting to allow that to
be a barrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get data from private consulting firms or through large
pension funds or endowments that provide access to their files,''
Gompers said. ``A lot of it is hand-collected. I'm putting together
data on 1,300 firms, collecting a complete financial history, their
boards of directors, scales of compensation to study how they
operate and grow. I have hired 10 to 15 research assistants during
the course of this project over the last two and a half years.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, much of what goes on at entrepreneurship centers
today consists of students going through the motions of setting up
new ventures, and sometimes actually doing the ventures. Business
school has turned into a kind of laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Business-plan competitions, both local and national, have grown
rapidly in scale with students presenting their plans to venture
capitalists and competing for donated prize money to help them set
up companies.
</P>
<P>
   One such winner was Evan Schumacher, a 29-year-old native of
Boston who finished at Northwestern this spring. His plan called
for setting up a software company that tracks global shipping,
freight and customs management for international firms.
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher won the Kellogg competition and took his plan to
Austin, Tex., in May for national finals. He was a finalist, and as
he walked off the stage after his presentation, his wireless
microphone still clipped to his lapel, a man in the audience
approached him and asked how much he needed.
</P>
<P>
   The man became the company's first angel investor, in for
$250,000. The company, Celarix, was born at the end of June in
Chicago. So far, it has raised $500,000 from investors and is
planning to raise another $1 million to $2 million from venture
capitalist firms. A third employee will join the company this
month.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   WAYNE, N.J. _ Drive west from Manhattan, through the Lincoln
Tunnel and into the thick of one of the many commercial
bloodstreams that feeds the suburban beast engulfing New York City.
Go about 20 miles from the Hudson River to a nondescript office
building that overlooks a 14-theater multiplex and a warehouse-size
Costco. That is where you'll find, on the third floor, a modest
little company called Audible Inc., which just happens to have
outsize ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   It's an unlikely location, certainly, for a three-year-old
Internet start-up, one that hopes to create a big audience for
something completely different: custom audio information delivered
on demand over the Web to portable devices you can listen to any
time and anywhere, say, while jogging or driving to work.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the guy who founded the company, Donald Katz, who is
46 and the author of three highly acclaimed nonfiction books, is a
rather unlikely entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Katz never marched to anyone's beat but his own. In starting
Audible, he drew on his own experiences as a writer combined with
the thirst to create something new from the seemingly limitless
potential of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Audible seeks to wed the oldest of human technologies, the
spoken word, with the newest of technologies,'' he said with
characteristic ardor. ``We want to be a leader in teaching the
Internet to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Translating that vision into a successful business will not be
easy. Audible is losing plenty of money.
</P>
<P>
   The company has about 35 employees, its own portable player and
a Web site (www.audible.com) where users can immediately download
from a selection of 16,000 hours of copyrighted audio files
containing everything from traditional read-aloud books like Frank
McCourt's ``Angela's Ashes'' ($9) to bundles of advice ($3 to $13)
from the Harvard Business Review and such. For all its success in
building a new infrastructure, however, the company is just
beginning to attract paying customers.
</P>
<P>
   Katz is accustomed to taking risks. For two decades, from the
time he left graduate school at the London School of Economics in
1975, Katz was a free-lance journalist.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '80s, Katz turned his attention to money and
business. Originally from Chicago, he decided to write a book about
Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Company, his hometown giant.
</P>
<P>
   Sears, the once-great store of the American middle class and one
of the most secretive corporations in the country, was in the midst
of an immense crisis. Katz persuaded Edward Telling, its chief
executive, to give him carte blanche access to the company. The
book, ``The Big Store,'' took six years to research and write.
</P>
<P>
   Katz followed with two other books that also required him to
open closed doors, one a look at the post-World War middle-class
experience told through a single extended family that revealed its
most intimate secrets, and the other an inside look at Nike and its
reclusive chairman, Phil Knight.
</P>
<P>
   In business, surprisingly, Katz did find a subject worthy of
epic treatment. And he discovered he had a taste for it.
</P>
<P>
   With Ed Lau, his college roommate who moved into the computer
industry, Katz began to develop an idea for a business that would
deliver radio programs and audio books through the Internet. His
next book project, on the convergence of digital technologies, was
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something I couldn't write into reality,'' Katz said.
``I had to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He found a fresh outlet for the powers of persuasion that had
opened so many doors in his writing career. The first big convert
was Tim Mott, now a wealthy private investor in Ketchum, Idaho, who
is renowned in Silicon Valley as a co-founder of Electronic Arts,
the computer-game maker, and Macromedia, a software company
specializing in multimedia graphic-design applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get calls all the time about start-up ideas, and I probably
look at least one business plan a week,'' Mott said. ``Over the
course of five years, I've seen, maybe, four that I wanted to
commit money and time. This was one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   With Mott as chairman, they made the round of venture-capital
firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim's business experience and Don's visionary ideas were a
powerful combination,'' said Kevin Compton, a partner at Kleiner
Perkins who became their chief backer there. ``Three minutes into
conversation you could just feel his passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Audible is built around the premise that lots of people are
willing to pay regularly to fill their time _ on the go _ with
constantly changing packages of verbal packages of entertainment,
news and practical advice.
</P>
<P>
   Even more promising is the potential for pumping millions of
mobile workers full of management information, corporate training
and ``time-shifted'' business news while traveling.
</P>
<P>
   To make all that possible, Audible had to design its own
portable player. It is roughly the size and shape of an electric
razor, holds two hours of audio and plugs into a personal computer
through a cradle similar to one used in hand-held computers. People
can carry the battery-powered gadget anywhere, listen to it through
headphones or play clips in a car stereo system.
</P>
<P>
   Programs are stored on a computer, ready to refill the player as
soon as it is returned to its cradle, which remains attached to the
computer.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, though, the player is also an Achilles heel. It
is relatively expensive, costing $200 as a stand-alone purchase.
Two hours is not enough storage time, particularly since lots of
audio books run three to four hours. And it is not easy for the
technologically challenged to try.
</P>
<P>
   To overcome these drawbacks, Audible is developing a
second-generation player with greater abilities and is exploring
new pricing plans similar to those used to sell mobile-phone
services, in which buyers would receive the player at a steep
reduction if they sign up for a subscription.
</P>
<P>
   Relying mostly on word of mouth, Audible says it has attracted
more than 5,000 customers and shipped about 3,000 players. Those
using the player spend an average of about $20 a month on fresh
content.
</P>
<P>
   But Audible's real ace in the hole is not the player but the
rights it has painstakingly sewn up with dozens of content
providers. It is introducing new programs _ from an audio digest of
The Wall Street Journal to National Public Radio's ``Fresh Air''
program _ that will be sent automatically to a subscriber's
computer.
</P>
<P>
   And it will adapt all Audible's products so they can be played
on a variety of portable devices, beginning with the hand-held
organizers powered by Microsoft's Windows CE software.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the recent stock-market turmoil, Audible's outside
investors, who own about 56 percent of the company (the founders
and employees own the rest) remained cautious about going public,
insisting they do not intend to sell stock until the company is
generating a growing and predictable revenue stream.
</P>
<P>
   Which is a good thing, given the uncertainty about even the most
promising Internet ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no in-between,'' said Paul Hawken, the author of
``Growing a Business'' and an entrepreneur who co-founded Smith &AMP;
Hawken, the mail-order garden-supply company. ``Either Audible will
be a billion-dollar-plus company or it will be wallpaper. I suspect
it will be the former.''

   Whenever I look at my bank statement, I think of Ken Hakuta, aka
Dr. Fad. Best known as the inventor of the Wacky Wall Walker, he
made some $20 million from slime-covered plastic creatures that
ooze down vertical surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of it is that Hakuta didn't even come up with the
idea: All he did was license the toy from Japan for a tiny fraction
of the amount he made. Now he's a millionaire and is a prominent
figure on the lecture and convention circuits.
</P>
<P>
   With one simple idea he achieved the American dream _ money and
fame.
</P>
<P>
   There are countless Hakutas _ inventors of the pet rock, sliced
bread, the rolling lint remover, the better mousetrap. And I want
to be one. But I'm too busy writing articles like this one to
follow up on any get-rich-quick schemes, and I can't seem to put
the energy into starting a corporation dedicated to carrying out my
ideas. So I have decided to give them away.
</P>
<P>
   1. Some clever wag has beaten me to the idea of portable gyms:
trainers who park outside your home in vans full of exercise
equipment. But no one has come up with portable baby sitters. Tired
of having to constantly call home during a dinner date to check on
your child or to leave a movie early to deal with a small
emergency? With a portable baby sitter, your child can follow you
around on your date or outing in an RV with toys, a bed and a
licensed sitter. Now you can look in on your little one during
theater intermissions and deal with a crisis without abandoning
your plans.
</P>
<P>
   2. Copyright millennium slogans or register Web site domain
names that corporations will eventually want to buy from you. Some
examples of slogans include ``A new car for a new millennium'' or
``Relief for the morning after the millennium.'' For Web sites, you
could try to cut yourself in on a piece of Mr. Hakuta's millions
and register a wackywallwalker.com.
</P>
<P>
   3. The inventions of tow ropes and chairlifts revolutionized
skiing, enabling entrepreneurs to open ridiculously overpriced ski
resorts. So where are the surf resorts? Tow ropes, jet skis and
above-water conveyer belts could drop surfers off at their favorite
wave and save them from exhausting, time-consuming paddling. Of
course, some surfers will complain that paddling to the wave is
integral to the sport, but soon surfing anywhere besides a resort
will seem as antiquated as hiking uphill to ski.
</P>
<P>
   4. The best entrepreneurs come up with products nobody has heard
of and then persuade the public that it can't live without them.
Here is my candidate: by developing a system to measure the sense
of smell (akin to the eye-chart test), an entrepreneur can make a
fortune by inventing smelling aids for people with deficient
olfactory nerves.
</P>
<P>
   5. Create a line of address books, cell phones, wallets and
purses that, like cordless telephones, beep when they're lost. Even
better, for obsessive message-checkers not satisfied with pagers,
devise a key chain or a small toy that lights up whenever their
answering machine takes a call. In addition, a huge market has
opened up in Japan for cellular phone accessories that could be
exploited in America: different styles of straps and antennae,
trinkets to make phones ring differently and lights that flash when
the phone rings.
</P>
<P>
   6. Become an apartment broker in a competitive city like New
York or San Francisco. But instead of representing realtors or
buildings, start a trustworthy company that represents renters.
They can tell you exactly what they want, then you find it and pay
a deposit to reserve the apartment until they can see it. To corner
the market, you could pay apartment owners a fee to give you a copy
of their listing on the same day they send it to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   7. There are sperm banks, but no public egg banks. These would
be for working women who don't want to have children until they
retire. This way, women can finally stop the ticking of that
biological clock by depositing an egg when they're in their 20s or
30s. The egg will then be preserved until a woman is ready to rear
a child.
</P>
<P>
   8. The best ice cream in the world is Bertillon, a French
delicacy with flavors so precise that anyone marketing it in
America could revolutionize the ice-cream business the way Jelly
Bellys cornered the jelly bean market. This is not a joke, but a
way to a better society.
</P>
<P>
   9. One reason people drive when they're drunk is because they
don't want to have to take a cab home and then wake up in the
morning without their car. By creating an 800-IM-DRUNK line in
car-oriented cities like Los Angeles and Dallas, this problem could
be solved. The service would actually drive a chauffeur to a
restaurant, club or house to take the inebriated client home (or
even to another bar or party) in his or her own car.
</P>
<P>
   10. I was recently notified that someone had taken my idea of
making custom fortune cookies for parties. But kids' dolls could be
personalized in a similar way by having a talking toy like Tickle
Me Elmo or Teletubby and replacing its voice chip with a homemade
one. It could either have personalized messages (``Get to work,
George'') or just undoll-like comments. (``Gee whiz, cover up your
bellybutton, it looks obscene.'')
</P>
<P>
   Space prohibits me from elaborating on more ideas. But with
hundreds of thousands of people reading this, it seems very likely
that within the next 24 hours these baker's-dozen recommendations
will soon be patented and put into development.

 &HT;    
 By JON PARELES 
 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   When Bettina Richards was an artist-and-repertory executive for
big recording companies, she didn't like the way they treated
musicians. Her favorite bands were ignored if they weren't best
sellers; one lead singer, who went on to make a gold album, was
told he shouldn't be singing at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't happy,'' Richards said. ``I was making money, but I
couldn't talk to anyone about the great show I saw last night or
the great record I found. It was a job.''
</P>
<P>
   So in 1992, she started her own company: Thrill Jockey Records,
named after a gang of delinquents in a B movie. It would release
music she cared about and let the musicians decide what to release,
how to package it and run their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted a company where the artists' expectations and the
labels' abilities were in line,'' she said. ``I don't think major
labels are inherently evil or out to destroy the world. I just
don't happen to use music that fits their system.''
</P>
<P>
   That music, Richards said, is simply ``what I like.'' Thrill
Jockey is a leading outlet for what some critics have named
``post-rock'': instrumentals that elude categorization as jazz, pop
tunes or dance music. The label's best-selling band is Tortoise,
whose most recent album has sold nearly 100,000 worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   But Thrill Jockey has also released albums by the
neo-Appalachian duo Freakwater, two women who sing about hard
times; the electronic group Oval, which has built compositions on
the sounds of skipping CDs; and the Nerve, a peppy alternative-rock
band.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of freaky, left-of-center stuff that she puts out,
but at the same time there's a big enough audience so that she can
make a living,'' said Nic Harcourt, the creative music director of
KCRW-FM in Santa Monica, Calif., and the host of the station's
``Morning Becomes Eclectic,'' a program that the music business on
the West Coast follows closely.
</P>
<P>
   In six years, Thrill Jockey has released 60 albums (both as CDs
and old-fashioned vinyl LPs), singles and EPs. All but three
releases have broken even or turned a profit. By contrast, 80
percent to 90 percent of albums from major labels post losses.
</P>
<P>
   But Thrill Jockey works on a grass-roots scale, seeking sales in
thousands rather than millions; its typical release breaks even
with sales of 1,500 CDs and 500 LPs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Thrill Jockey's profit was $183,000, and while that
is probably less than what Columbia Records spends on catering, it
is a success story in independent rock.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, Richards, who is 33 years old, did everything
herself, from signing talent to lining up band interviews. Now
Thrill Jockey has three other full-time employees and one part
timer and is about to buy its own small building.
</P>
<P>
   Richards started Thrill Jockey while working four days a week at
Pier Platters, an alternative-rock record store in Hoboken, N.J.
She ran the label from her third-floor walk-up apartment on Avenue
C in Manhattan, carrying mail-order CDs to UPS because she didn't
ship enough to qualify for a pickup.
</P>
<P>
   Her capital was $20,000 from her grandmother, $10,000 from her
father and the $5,000 from her savings account; she has never
needed another infusion. Her business advisers were people who had
started their own labels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was constantly asking advice from people: cheaper places to
press things, ways to cut corners,'' she said. ``One thing about
independently distributed record labels is that you don't get this
competitive feeling. As long as you are willing to reciprocate with
information, people are happy to give it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Richards moved from New York to Chicago, where her main
manufacturer and distributor, Touch and Go, is based. Rent and
taxes are considerably lower than they are in New York, she noted.
</P>
<P>
   Many independent companies are stepping stones for bands that
hope to be discovered by major labels. By contract, the smaller
labels then share in the profits from the major-label releases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to spend my time as a farm label,'' Richards
said. ``From a business standpoint, it would be better to have
bands bound to contracts so I'd get a piece of their future. But I
don't want to make money from a system I don't support.''
</P>
<P>
   Thrill Jockey makes unusually generous deals with musicians.
Once an album breaks even, the label and the musicians each get 50
percent of the gross receipts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the net comes down, they actually get more than me,''
Richards said. Contracts are often literally a handshake.
</P>
<P>
   Richards chooses bands that, she thinks, can benefit from the
scale of her company and will stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``If becoming famous is their primary focus, then we're not the
right label for them,'' she said. ``But if they want to continue to
make music and live off that, then that's a goal we can achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   Thrill Jockey records most albums for under $3,000, one
three-hundredth of what a band like U2 spends, and advertises
sparingly. Video clips tend to be made by friends of the bands or
as projects by art students, though they have been shown
occasionally on MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Thrill Jockey depends largely on the unpaid promotion of college
radio stations and reviews in the press, but it also uses club disk
jockeys and skateboarding magazines to reach consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each record is totally different,'' Richards said. ``It's not
as if I sold a really great new garbage can or a nice clock. Your
most popular band this year could be completely unpopular next
year. My company has to be flexible and adapt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want my company to stay in business and do well,'' Richards
said. ``But the creative stuff was always the motivation that
sparked it. It wasn't, I see a way to make money better. It was, I
can make this artist's experience better.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lot of work,'' Richards added. ``But it never feels
like a job.''

   Even as children, many of them spotted a business angle nobody
else did, and milked it for all it was worth.
</P>
<P>
   At age 10, Harold S. Blue, now the chairman of Proxymed Inc., a
health-care information-services company in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
figured he could make more money if he hired playmates to shovel
driveways instead of doing the work himself. He paid them $3 of the
$5 he collected and even had the presence of mind to ply his trade
outside his neighborhood so that the mothers wouldn't catch on to
his scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was out of high school, Blue owned and operated two
drug stores.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy growing up in a village in India 100 miles north of New
Delhi, Vinod Gupta, the founder of infoUSA Inc., a seller of
business information in Omaha with projected sales this year of
$250 million, caught frogs at a swamp and sold them to a research
laboratory for lunch money.
</P>
<P>
   In college, he rented entire passenger-train cars to make a
36-hour trip to New Delhi, and then sold seat tickets individually
for a quick 25 percent profit.
</P>
<P>
   Not every successful business owner can boast of such an early
flair for salesmanship. But even those who drifted or were pushed
into entrepreneurial careers seem to have a natural bent for
seizing opportunities that make competitors wonder why on earth
they didn't think of that themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Is that what defines them? They are an eclectic lot who operate
ventures that vary from grocery stores to Internet start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Donald J. Jonovic, a consultant in Cleveland who has advised
hundreds of family businesses, says he never fails to be astonished
by the ``raw diversity'' of American entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at some of them and you ask, `My God, how'd that
happen?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a country that prides itself on individualism and counts
literally millions of entrepreneurs, it is a question worth asking.
Small businesses, roughly defined as ventures controlled by their
founders and taking in less than $250 million in revenue a year,
are an enormous force in the American economy.
</P>
<P>
   But what drives their owners to strike out on their own rather
than take refuge in the predictability and perks of salaried jobs?
</P>
<P>
   The experts, of course, have their views. Jonovic says true
entrepreneurs are marked by a combination of ``tunnel-vision
dedication'' and supreme self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   David G. Winter, a professor of psychology at the University of
Michigan, said they are propelled by a zeal to excel at whatever
they do, a trait he calls ``achievement motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have this optimism, this exuberance, this boldness,''
Winter said, which can take the form of restlessness, especially if
their business grows into a larger, bureaucratic organization they
can't control. If that happens, he said, ``they may be so unable to
deal with it that they get dismissed by their board. Or they may
quit and start all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said entrepreneurs often display a streak of
authoritarianism because they believe their method is the only way
to do things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing their best is what matters most to them, as opposed to a
concern with friendship or power,'' Winter said.
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurs, he added, tend to come from middle-class
backgrounds, not blue-collar homes or wealthy families, ``which
still view small business as a step downward into vulgar trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonovic said that many entrepreneurs are tightfisted, not out of
greed but because each dollar they earn represents a small fraction
of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew a successful entrepreneur who ended up in a nursing
home and wouldn't pay for a private room because he wanted to keep
his estate above $1 million,'' Jonovic said.
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurs themselves cite a long list of self-defining
characteristics and attributes: decisiveness, resilience, focus, a
love of battle, a penchant for risk-taking, workaholism, good
social skills.
</P>
<P>
   But as they recount their histories, two core themes leap out,
flip sides of the same coin: They want to be their own boss, and
they show an uncanny knack for detecting opportunities that others
missed.
</P>
<P>
   For most entrepreneurs, it all begins with the realization that
working for somebody else just isn't a choice.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to go it alone can be liberating, but it can also
be scary because it means cutting off the corporate safety net.
</P>
<P>
   Eric B. Segal, the president of the Kenzer Corp., an
executive-recruiting firm in New York, recalls the near-panic he
and his partner, Robert D. Kenzer, felt in the early days of
running their company in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Segal had been a corporate executive in the retail industry, but
quit a high-paying job after he got what he viewed as an
insufficient raise. As he and Kenzer scrambled to find clients, he
said, he kept thinking: Where's the check? Where's Mommy?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are rules you learn from working in big business, but
nobody's prepared for flying without the net until you do it,''
said Segal, who is 55. ``It's frightening. I see a lot of corporate
guys who can't make the conversion.''
</P>
<P>
   But many entrepreneurs insist that the absence of security is a
small price to pay for the freedom to operate at their own pace and
on their own scale.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Yellin, a small-business consultant who works out of her
Manhattan apartment, says she is determined to remain a one-person
show earning just enough money to live comfortably and ``feed my
cat Fancy Feasts.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Yellin is quick to see business possibilities in
humdrum circumstances. A telemarketing specialist who has made an
instructional tape titled ``Warming Up to Cold Calling,'' Yellin,
46, has even figured out how to turn phone pitches she receives at
home to her financial advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of the callers are terrible at selling,'' she said.
``That gives me an opportunity to call their bosses and say, `You
should book me for some training.'''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Deborah L. Jacobs, lawyer-turned-writer, gave a heartfelt
compliment to the young man who arrived with his helper to clean
her house in Brooklyn recently: the name of his service was awfully
clever. But she wasn't going to leave it at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you trademarked it?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   He had not, he told Jacobs, who happened to be the author of
``Legal Smarts for Small Business.'' And that answer worried her,
enough that she will not disclose the name of the young
entrepreneur's business until he has finished scurrying around to
obtain trademark protection.
</P>
<P>
   After all, a name that isn't trademarked can be used by someone
else unless the first person brings out expensive legal artillery
to stop the competition.
</P>
<P>
   It was just one example, Jacobs said, of how small-business
owners forge ahead optimistically, figuring that nothing can go
wrong, when they should part with a few hundred dollars, or a few
thousand depending on the legal task, for a lawyer who, by training
and temperament, can anticipate everything going wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``How far can an entrepreneur get without a lawyer?'' she said.
``Pretty far. But it can cost you a lot, a whole lot, later.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers are usually not a happy part of the plan for a new
business. Neither are accountants, investment advisers or other
professionals whose job it is to protect a business from the things
entrepreneurs would rather not think about.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the typical entrepreneurial attitude,'' said Fred S.
Steingold, a lawyer in Ann Arbor, Mich., and the author of ``The
Legal Guide for Starting and Running a Small Business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to get along with their business, and they're not
detail-oriented,'' he said. ``They're impatient. That's what makes
them good entrepreneurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Some tiny service businesses, of course, start and run fine
without professional advice; a dog walker or a window washer can
obtain a business license (and probably should in many cities, for
tax reasons), file a Schedule C and never pay for a consultation.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a retail or a professional business, Jacobs said, ``as a
sole proprietor you can absolutely hang out your shingle without
consulting a lawyer, although if you're operating out of your house
you might want to check the zoning rules.''
</P>
<P>
   But any other form of ownership _ partnership and any type of
corporation _ requires legal and probably accounting guidance.
</P>
<P>
   On the complexity scale, the simplest is a partnership, which
most experts say should begin with a written agreement spelling
out, for example, what happens if one owner dies or quits the
business. This is well-charted territory, especially since the
Uniform Partnership Act governs in almost all states, and by
following legal guides for the general public and form books that
contain standard agreements, most people can do the paperwork and
whatever modifications they want.
</P>
<P>
   But even Steingold, whose publisher, Nolo Press, produces
self-help books and software, suggests that a lawyer review an
agreement. He gives the same advice for forming a simple
corporation _ with the preliminary note that owners might want to
first ask a lawyer whether they need to incorporate.
</P>
<P>
   (The main advantage, ordinarily, is protection of the individual
owners from legal liabilities. There are tax advantages and
disadvantages, too, best sorted out by an accountant.)
</P>
<P>
   The paperwork _ state filing papers, articles of incorporation
and shareholder provisions _ is manageable for most people; Nolo
Press, among others, publishes general guides and versions specific
to several states, including New York and California.
</P>
<P>
   Having a lawyer review the documents is fairly painless: in
Steingold's case, about an hour of his time, or $175. For handling
the whole process, his flat fee in most cases is $600. (In big
cities, where costs are generally higher, charges can run as high
as $2,000.)
</P>
<P>
   As for buying a business, whatever you plan to do, Steingold
said, self-education and self-representation won't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need advice on whether to buy the assets or just the
corporate shell,'' he said. ``The typical purchase agreement is
pretty complicated. There are all kinds of decisions about how it's
going to be financed. Then there are 10 to 20 documents that show
up at a closing.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people, he said, will come into a lawyer's office with a
proposed sales contract that originated with the seller or came
from a form book, ``but it would be difficult for somebody who
doesn't have any legal experience to go through a closing.''
</P>
<P>
   Do-it-yourself accounting is not recommended either, but
entrepreneurs can keep bills down by doing the prep work. Software
programs offer simplified bookkeeping tasks and enable people to
monitor cash-flow statements and projections.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone starting a business should be thoroughly immersed in
those numbers anyway, said Ginny Beauchamp, the vice president of
the National Association for the Self-Employed in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Beauchamp added, however small the business, ``having an
accountant do audits a couple times a year is a very good idea, and
if your business is growing by leaps and bounds, obviously you need
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the simplest sole proprietorships can do without
accountants for tax planning and preparation. Businesses can get in
trouble for failing to keep up with changes in tax law, as many did
several years ago when they failed to amend their Keough plans.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a quarter of small-business owners were delinquent in
filing new plans with the Internal Revenue Service, many because
they were unaware of the new requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs said small-business owners, whether through
cost-consciousness or hopeful ignorance, make two mistakes in
circumventing lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   First, she said, they wave off legal advice until they are in
trouble. She mentioned the entrepreneur who spent hundreds of
thousands of dollars making a CD-ROM called ``The First Electronic
Jewish Bookshelf.'' His product brought a warning letter from
Microsoft, which was using the term ``bookshelf.'' At that point,
the entrepreneur had to get a lawyer and enter extremely expensive
settlement negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Second, she said, ``many attempt to play amateur lawyer.''
Jacobs recommends self-help books to pare legal costs and identify
business concerns. Nolo's, she advised, ``are very well researched
and well written and provide great background.'' Even after
practicing law for six years, she does not hesitate to hire others.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I need a specialized kind of legal help, I hire the best
expert I can,'' she said. ``I would no sooner be an amateur in the
legal field than I would be an amateur electrician and rewire my
house.''

   CALIFORNIA -- CADELE. East Bay representatives lashed out at
Republicans for their handling of the investigation into President
Clinton, saying that the president is being used as a political
whipping boy. Also, they talk about what may happen: Miller, for
one, thinks some sort of congressional compromise will be reached,
thus saving Clinton's presidency. Stricherz
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO -- PARK. (Probable.) Sen. Wayne Allard is attaching an
amendment to the FAA bill that would permanently ban all commercial
flights over Rocky Mountain National Park. At the same time, Allard
is upset over the park's use of helicopters to airlift thousands of
pounds of gravel to repair trails in the park. Zaret
</P>
<P>
   -- SKAGGS/SCHAEFER (Working.) Project. Zaret
</P>
<P>
   CONNECTICUT -- SMOG. The Environmental Protection Agency today
announced new pollution restrictions to reduce smog in Connecticut
and 21 other eastern states. Maggi
</P>
<P>
   -- COP. The Senate version of Rep. James H. Maloney's school
resource office bill passes a Senate committee. (Brief.) Maggi
</P>
<P>
   GEORGIA -- DEFENSE. The House is expected to vote today on the
$270.5 billion defense authorization bill, which has implications
for tritium and military retirees. (Brief.) Williams
</P>
<P>
   ILLINOIS -- BRIEFS. Column for Sunday. (Working.) Eckstein
</P>
<P>
   INDIANA -- FAST TRACK. About 700 steel workers rallied on
Capitol Hill against fast-track legislation Thursday, calling on
House members to reject the special negotiating authority they fear
will cost blue-collar workers their jobs. Wolfberg
</P>
<P>
   LOUISIANA -- LACANE. Several parishes in Louisiana were declared
disaster areas, including Acadia Parish outside Lafayette.
Louisiana lawmakers are allowing these areas to apply for
federal-emergency relief. Stricherz
</P>
<P>
   MICHIGAN -- EPA. New regulations announced by the Environmental
Protection Agency are opposed by Michigan's Department of
Environmental Quality, which says utility companies will likely
absorb the brunt of the new regulations. Wolfberg
</P>
<P>
   MULTICHANNEL -- TAXNET. A bill that would restrict states from
imposing new taxes on the Internet has probably been caught up in
partisan wrangling over HMO reform. Maggi
</P>
<P>
   NEVADA -- INTERNET. Sen. Bryan is pushing for legislation that
would restrict marketing practices on the Internet. An overview of
the bill and pros and cons. Preston
</P>
<P>
   OHIO -- SMOG. The EPA today ordered Ohio and 21 other states to
curb smog-causing chemicals. Ohio is one of the hardest hit by the
national strategy, which EPA officials hope will cut the state's
output of smog-causing emissions 36 percent by 2007. Gorman
</P>
<P>
   -- OXLEY-INTERNET-PORN. The Commerce Committee sent a bill,
sponsored by Rep. Mike Oxley, R-Findlay, to the House today that
would prevent children from gaining access to Internet porn sites
by requiring commercial online pornographers to obtain proof of age
before granting users access to their sites. The bill has drawn
criticism from the ACLU and other free-speech advocates for
limiting the rights of adults to visit pornography sites. Hurt
</P>
<P>
   -- LIVESTOCK-WASTE. How would the proposed joint strategy
introduced last week by the USDA and EPA to manage livestock waste
differ from the regulations already in place in Ohio? Would it pose
a greater burden on livestock farmers? Would it effectively address
the waste problems threatening Ohio waterways? (Working.) Hurt
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH CAROLINA -- CENSUS. South Carolina's poverty rate fell by
more than 3 percent in the past two years, tying the Palmetto State
with Mississippi for the sharpest decline in poverty in the nation.
Williams
</P>
<P>
   WISCONSIN -- CANCER. Gov. Tommy Thompson's wife was in
Washington Thursday to receive an award for her work on behalf of
those with cancer. Butler
</P>
<P>
   -- SENSENBRENNER. As second in command of the Judiciary

`FANTASY ISLAND': BREATHTAKING VIEWS, INSUFFICIENT WIT  
 `CUPID': A WISTFUL EXERCISE IN FANTASY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(lh) 
 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suppress that wish, buddy. You might have it hurled back into
your gut until you understand what an idiot you were to dream it in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   That's the bleak premise behind ``Fantasy Island,'' one of two
shows with vaguely supernatural themes that begin Saturday night on
ABC. ``Fantasy Island,'' of course, is a new version of the 1978-84
series, which cannot be recalled without involuntarily screeching
``De plane! De plane!'' in the manner of Herve Villechaize. Go
ahead. It cannot be helped.
</P>
<P>
   Some broad strokes of the original have been retained by the
producers, including Barry Sonnenfeld, who has made witty movies
like ``Men in Black'' and guided the ABC summer series ``Maximum
Bob.'' Here, each episode brings several travelers to an island
resort where the mysterious host, Mr. Roarke, promises to deliver
their hearts' desires.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of the suave Ricardo Montalban, dressed in white,
Mr. Roarke is now the brooding Malcolm McDowell, dressed in (you're
getting ahead of the story, aren't you?) black. He greets his
guests at the seaplane dock and tells them, ``You must never tell
anyone of your experiences on this island,'' because ``no one would
ever believe you.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Roarke is assisted by the hulking Cal (Louis Lombardi) and
the delicate Harry (Edward Hibbert), who seem to be more prisoners
than staff members, and by the sleek Ariel (Madchen Amick), who
makes fantasies materialize by assuming the form of any person.
</P>
<P>
   The episode's visitors _ all young, attractive and as
interchangeable as light bulbs _ have arrived with selfish goals.
In the course of the hour, Mr. Roarke, who seems to know everything
and can change time and tide at will, grimly teaches them lessons
about life's true priorities. (Example of his wisdom: ``Death
doesn't hurt. It's life that hurts.'') So who is he? So who cares?
</P>
<P>
   The show, filmed in Hawaii, offers some breathtaking views of
vast open spaces. But it's the small open spaces in the concept,
where the wit should be, that knock ``Fantasy Island'' off the
itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   The most imaginative element of the show is confined to brief
opening and closing sequences, set in a rumpled travel agency
presided over by Fisher and Clia (Fyvush Finkel and Sylvia Sidney),
who greet startled strangers by name and trundle them off the
island. The real magic is in the sly glances of these veteran
character actors.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   `Cupid,' ABC's other Saturday-night exercise in fantasy is much
more wistful, although it jumps off from the sad fact that romance
is in a sorry state these days. Cupid is falling down on the job.
This has not escaped attention on Mount Olympus, where the gods
have called Cupid on the carpet, stripped him of his magic powers
and banished him to earth until he unites 100 loving couples.
</P>
<P>
   Cupid (Jeremy Piven) lands in Chicago. Explaining his identity
and mission lands him in a mental hospital, where he meets Dr.
Claire Allen (Paula Marshall), a psychiatrist and advice author.
For him, life revolves around the heart. For her, it's the head. He
thinks she's wrong. She thinks he's crazy.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening episode, Cupid accepts a more conventional
mortal-type name, Trevor Hale, and is released from the hospital
with the proviso that his progress must be monitored by Claire. He
joins her therapy group for lonely singles, where she warns him not
to undermine her efforts. He retorts: ``And being the Roman god of
love for 3,000 years has prepared me for _ what? A desk job at
Hallmark?''
</P>
<P>
   Trevor also lands a bartender's job at an Irish pub. If he can't
make his 100 matches in those two settings, Cupid's in the wrong
line of work (not to mention his writers).
</P>
<P>
   Claire, too, is single, of course. Maybe there's a suppressed
romantic trapped within her cool, professional exterior. Could she
be smitten with this rumpled, balding guy who just wants everyone
to be in love?
</P>
<P>
   If you think with your heart and not your head, you might come
back to find out. Is it a date?

`URBAN LEGEND': THE GUY LOOKS LIKE FREDDY KRUEGER? NAH, TOO
OBVIOUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You know you're in trouble when you get to college to find that
your folklore professor is Freddy Krueger, the dean is the
Well-Manicured Man from ``The X-Files,''and it's the 25th
anniversary of a dormitory massacre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Urban Legend'' is a teen-age moviegoer's dream. It has
familiar young television stars, familiar older stars with cult
followings (Robert Englund as the aforementioned professor, John
Neville as the dean), an edgy sense of humor, a tricky plot and
characters too genre-savvy for their own good. Maybe there will be
an oversaturation of ``Scream''-inspired horror films someday soon,
but this one feels fresh.
</P>
<P>
   Someone at Pendleton University, the fictional safest college in
the United States, is committing murders in the style of
contemporary urban folk tales. There's an ax murderer lurking in
the back seat of a car, a boy hanged in the secluded spot where he
and a girl were parked, a killer on the telephone calling from
within the victim's house, even a pet in a microwave.
</P>
<P>
   Alicia Witt (Zoey, the smart-mouthed daughter on CBS's
``Cybill'') is Natalie, whose biggest problem at the beginning of
the film is her creepy Goth roommate's active sex life.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Gayheart, of ``Scream 2,'' is Natalie's best friend,
Brenda. Jared Leto (Claire Danes' dream guy on ABC's ``My So-Called
Life'') is Paul, the blue-eyed student reporter whom both girls are
attracted to. Joshua Jackson (Pacey of the WB's ``Dawson's Creek'')
is everybody's pal Damon.
</P>
<P>
   If you crack up when Damon's car radio suddenly blares the first
five notes of the song that begins ``I don't want to wait,'' you're
in home territory.
</P>
<P>
   Natasha Gregson Wagner is Michelle, the unfortunate first
victim, but older moviegoers won't need to be told that; they'd
know Natalie Wood's daughter anywhere. Loretta Devine, from
``Waiting to Exhale,'' plays the only admirable adult, a campus
security officer who likes to practice her pistol-firing stance
while watching Pam Grier movies.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences may guess the identity of the killer, although clues
point in several different directions toward the end of the film,
but the original motive is skillfully hidden until the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately, the final encounters take place on a dark and
stormy night (although the rain stops mysteriously just long enough
for Natalie and Brenda to run, terrified, through the woods for a
few minutes). One clue to keep in mind: in the chilly Northeast,
lots of people own parkas with fur-lined hoods.
</P>
<P>
   The film's director, Jamie Blanks, is 26 and making his
feature-film debut. The screenwriter, Silvio Horta, graduated from
film school in 1996. Nice work. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Urban Legend'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying
parent or adult guardian). It includes profanity, sexual situations
and references, and vivid but not gory depictions of ax murders and
other homicides. &QL;
</P>

   COKE-MEETING _ Coca-Cola Co. fell as much as 1 1/16 to 56 15/16
on the news that it will hold an analysts' meeting Friday before
U.S. markets open. Some expect the company to say it's scaling back
third-quarter and full-year earnings estimates. It derives about
two-thirds of its profit overseas, where economic troubles have cut
earnings of many multinational companies. Coca-Cola wouldn't
elaborate on the nature of the meeting other than to say it would
``update'' analysts on earnings and volume. (Atlanta

   CURRENCY _ When a country devalues its money it's bowing to
economic problems. In doing so it's also seeking the economic
advantage of being able to sell its products more cheaply overseas.
But when a group of countries slice away at their currencies in a
fairly short period they're possibly igniting a trade war, a beggar
thy neighbor round of price cuts. (Chambers, Atlanta

   WOMEN-REECE Gabriella Reece gained fame as a volleyball player
but is no longer in an organized league and isn't heard from much
because of her athletics. That doesn't seem to matter to her and
the markets, who plaster her all over magazine covers and in

   WOMEN-LPGA _ No women's sports entity is more closely associated
with lesbianism than the LPGA tour, and it has suffered because of
it. The organization, while not discouraging that aspect of the
tour, seems to be emphasizing the heterosexual side, which includes
day-care services for players. But they still welcome an
association with lesbian groups to one of their biggest events, the
Dinah Shore tournament. Since media focused on the tour after
homophobic remarks for a CBS announcer, the circuit has enjoyed
great growth. (Schultz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH PHOTO

offering each for the more reasonable price of $115, ``the true

<TEXT>
<P>
   A different front
</P>
<P>
   The nurses coped with wrenching wounds and death, filth and the
flu, the threat of shells and poison gas. But they were also
fighting a battle on a different front.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving a letter from home with news that her town was
displaying a flag for the nurses, she wrote: ``I'm glad someone
appreciates the nurses. The patients are the only ones here that
do. ... We just have to fight for our very existence here.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, when the Army passed out tickets to receive donated
Christmas packages from America, they skipped the nurses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry about our Christmas, no one over here worries
about us, so why should you?'' she wrote her mother and father.
``We weren't given any cards or tickets or anything else, so we are
just out of luck. `S.O.L.' they say in the army. When I get back,
you won't understand my language, not because it is French or
German either.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their difficulties, the nurses found ways to endure, and
even raise their spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we were invited to dances,'' she wrote. ``The
English and French could go home for rest, but it was too far for
the Americans, so recreation was planned in plays and dances.''
</P>
<P>
   Humor helped them survive.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, they were loaded onto trains for transport.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (nurses) were fortunate to have a toilet on board, but the
men stopped along the way at different sidings,'' she wrote. ``One
of our nice doctors was caught with his pants down when the train
started up unexpectedly. He really got an ovation from the crowd as
he scrambled aboard clutching his clothes. We made fun out of every
little incident and were hilarious at times.''
</P>
<P>
   Letters helped, too _ especially from her lieutenant friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had a letter from Pete,'' she wrote home. ``He may be in the
next town for all I know. He censors his own mail but is a very
good soldier and wouldn't say a thing that wasn't right. Some
people at home think that your mail coming this way is opened, but
it isn't ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``... Marg Cooper got a letter from one of the girls at the base
today. It surely must be a wonderful place, but we are satisfied
with this wild and woolly life until the snow flies at least. ...
Our tent is pitched on a kind of a hill and even though I have my
cot propped up, my head is usually lower than my feet, and
sometimes I wake up and find the bunk has sort of skidded during
the night and my head is outside, with the flap of the tent forming
a bib. Oh it's a great life if you don't weaken. . . . It may not
be quite as comfortable as the little bungalows (at the base
hospital) . . . but I like it fine.''
</P>
<P>
   And when there were no letters, they sang to keep their courage
up.
</P>
<P>
   After pitching tents near Ypres, she wrote: ``. . . The boys
found three pianos while they were searching the dugouts. They say
some of the dugouts the Germans had were carpeted. Last night they
brought one of the pianos back to camp and put it up in the Red
Cross hut. Someone was clever enough to tune it and a lot of the
boys can play, so we had quite a concert.''
</P>
<P>
   They sang all the songs written for the war, sometimes devising
their own lyrics. For one called ``The Rose of No Man's Land,''
they substituted the words: `` 'Neath the war's red curse stands
the Cross Red Nurse. She's the rose of no man's land.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Army now
</P>
<P>
   The lighter moments helped them keep their fear in check. They
relocated the tent hospitals frequently, often on 24 hours notice,
so they could go where casualties were heaviest. They would pack 12
nurses to an ambulance and space their vehicles miles apart, so
planes wouldn't detect their moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The devastation along our route was unbelievable,'' she wrote.
``Houses just a pile of rubble, dead cows in the fields, bloated
bodies of horses along the muddy roads where rats were scurrying
out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they were several miles from the front, they were still
at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We soon learned the sound of a German Fokker plane,'' she
wrote. ``It didn't have the same droning sound of the Allied ones
and we hardly waited for the sound of the alarm to take cover. . .
. It seemed cruel to leave the bed patients, but (it was)
reasonable that someone should be left to take care of them in case
the hospital was bombed.''
</P>
<P>
   On the troop ship over, she had written her parents: ``. . . Now
mother, imagine us having such good times and everyone at home
worrying their heads off about us. You know, Uncle Sam is pretty
clever and I am sure I have never been safer in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Four months later, any romantic illusions she'd harbored about
the war had disappeared, replaced by an appreciation for the
paradox and futility of battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one at home has the faintest idea how they are getting
killed (here),'' she wrote home. ``... I'm sure no one realizes the
suffering of the boys. It's their spirit that affects me. I can
watch them amputate a leg and dress a wound that is open from the
hip down, but when a boy tells you he is sorry he lost (his leg)
because it puts him out and he can't go back, well I have to walk
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Daily, the medical teams fixed up men to be shot to pieces
again. At the same time, in the same tents, they worked to save
enemy prisoners _ the same men Allied soldiers were trying
desperately to kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of my ward there were several wounded German
prisoners, young towheaded, blue-eyed boys,'' she wrote. ``A guard
stood over them with a .45. Having American and German patients
together brought home the fact of how stupid any war is.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other absurdities.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1918, blacks and whites were kept separate even when sick
in the hospital,'' she wrote in her memoir. ``White orderlies were
supposed to give the personal care to the men, but when one refused
to give an enema to a black man, I was so angry I put up a screen
and took care of the patient myself. He was very grateful and that
was the only time I was ever thanked for giving an enema.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman who had signed her early letters home ``From your
soldier girl,'' and gaily referred to being ``in the Army now,''
had hardened into a pragmatic realist and passionate pacifist. She
would become a lifelong believer in equal rights.
</P>
<P>
   Coming home
</P>
<P>
   If the war began a personal transformation that defined the rest
of her life, it also began a transformation of women in general
back home.
</P>
<P>
   After more than 50 years of pressure from suffragists, it was
the women who served in WWI who finally shamed the government into
taking action on the right to vote.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1919, less than a year after the war ended, the U.S.
Senate passed the 19th Amendment. Women marked ballots for the
first time in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   By breaking the military's gender barrier, the 33,000 women who
served in WWI spurred other social changes. By WWII, women
encountered fewer barriers to serving, and more than 10 times that
number signed up. At war's end, thousands of them took up work in
fields previously dominated by men.
</P>
<P>
   But my grandmother couldn't know back then _ just as the war was
ending _ how it would affect her life or her country. She was
simply excited to be coming home safely.
</P>
<P>
   ``About Nov. 7th, we began to hear rumors that the armistice was
being planned,'' she wrote in her memoir. ``We didn't believe it,
for we still heard the guns and the wounded were still coming in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, one day, the 11th of November, everything became
quiet about 11 a.m. and you wondered what was different. There
wasn't a sound, for there were no birds to sing, or no cows to moo.
We still couldn't believe it possible, as we had so many patients.
A group of French trumpeters came in the afternoon and played for
us, so that was the only celebration we had.''
</P>
<P>
   By the Armistice, her unit had treated 15,000 casualties.
</P>
<P>
   It would be six more months before she got orders to go home.
She continued to care for the wounded, but with the war over, she
also spent time in Paris, Monaco and the French Alps.
</P>
<P>
   Though the shelling had stopped, the war continued to wound in
unexpected ways.
</P>
<P>
   While on leave in Nice, my grandmother bumped into a friend of
the first lieutenant she'd fallen in love with during training
camp, the man whose letters she read and reread when she was off
duty. She was told her lieutenant would arrive in the same city the
next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``With great expectation, Margaret and I went to the train to
meet him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had lost weight and looked very tired and just gave a nod
of recognition when we greeted him. We all got in a taxi and he saw
that we got off at our hotel, then he went on to where the officers
were staying.''
</P>
<P>
   She later learned he had been gassed and wounded, and his best
friend had been blown apart beside him in a trench two days before
the Armistice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw him again, and sent the little service pin back to
him by a messenger.''
</P>
<P>
   But heartache couldn't dampen her excitement at going home. On
May 31, 1919, she boarded the Cape Finesterre bound for America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming into New York harbor was an unforgettable event,'' she
wrote. ``Tugboats and fireboats came out to meet us and in my
exuberance, I flung my blue straw hat right at the Statue of
Liberty. Bands were playing and toilet paper was strung all over
the ship like confetti on a happy cruise ship.''
</P>
<P>
   She didn't know then that the celebration would be short-lived,
that she was returning to a country not ready to hear her stories
or those of the other women who served.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saying goodbye to all the friends we had made in the service
was very sobering,'' she wrote. ``On the train and the streetcar
home, I never felt so depressed and forlorn in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Though dressed in full uniform ``no one knew or noticed I was a
returning veteran.''
</P>
<P>
   Many years later, she said she knew how Vietnam veterans felt
when they they came home.
</P>
<P>
   After the war
</P>
<P>
   The war was rarely mentioned after her return.
</P>
<P>
   Though many of the nurses' experiences were more dramatic than
those of their husbands, boyfriends or brothers, they didn't talk
for fear of embarrassing the men. Social pressures against women
doing ``men's work'' also enforced their silence.
</P>
<P>
   But the war's imprint remained. It would influence my
grandmother's outlooks and actions for the rest of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Sick of the carnage of battle, she turned to obstetrical
nursing. ``I decided I had worked long enough with men,'' she
wrote. ``It was very pleasing and satisfactory work. The babies
were so lovely and everyone so happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Her nursing skills freed her from the family farm and gave her a
degree of economic independence still rare among women. Eager for
more adventure, she struck out for San Francisco to visit her
uncle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a graduate of a good school gave me prestige wherever I
wanted to go,'' she said later. ``They called me to the Children's
Hospital in San Francisco and I worked there for awhile. When I
thought it was time to return home (to Massachusetts), I tried to
get a job on the Dollar Line (cruise ship company) as far as New
York, but they said I would have to sign up for the trip around the
world. Sometimes I wish I had taken that cruise.''
</P>
<P>
   But by that time _ 1925 _ she was engaged to Wilson Smith, a
young shoe salesman who had grown up in the town next to hers. He
had served in the Navy on a submarine chaser during the war. They
married that year, when she was 32, relatively old for that era.
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother had two children _ the second, my father, when
she was 40. They lived first in Minneapolis and migrated in 1939 to
Seattle, where her husband sold shoes to Nordstrom and other stores
in his territory. Widowed in 1953, she moved to California in 1956
to be near her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   When my grandfather was alive, he was frequently on the road for
his work, so she lived a life not unlike a modern single mother,
filling many roles and fending for herself. It was a job the war
had taught her well.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, I was in awe of her. It seemed she could do
anything, from wiring a lamp to knitting a blanket. An accomplished
artist who painted and sculpted, she was always busy with her
hands.
</P>
<P>
   And her feminist leanings were not lost on me, her only
granddaughter, even at an early age.
</P>
<P>
   She used to tell me how she had run into two French officers on
cavalry horses at the beach. They let her ride but kept hold of her
reins, which wounded her pride. When one of them showed off by
riding up a steep sand dune and down the other side, she pulled her
horse free and rode up and down the same dune.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so angry,'' she would say, and laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Her legacy has been simple. She encouraged her children and five
grandchildren to follow our hearts, use our hands and speak our
minds.
</P>
<P>
   Today, when I ask her for advice, she always says the same
thing: ``Be yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Her quiet courage sustained us through the usual childhood woes
and deeper hurts as we got older.
</P>
<P>
   When she learned that my son _ her first great-grandchild _ was
deaf, she gamely picked up sign language in her 90s. Though her
gnarled, arthritic hands could barely shape the signs, they
communicated her love nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   When he died at age 7, her strength comforted me. She knew there
is the possibility of joy after such sorrow. The war had taught her
that.
</P>
<P>
   The war left other traces on her life as well.
</P>
<P>
   She went to the battlefields two years before women got the
vote. When she returned, she voted in every election until she was
103.
</P>
<P>
   Her patriotism, while not showy, ran deep. She would have
members of the military over for dinner on holidays and she always
put out the flag.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most enduring mark of my grandmother's
experience in WWI has been her lifelong recoil at the mention of
war.
</P>
<P>
   The few times she heard dinner-table talk of war or battlefield
exploits, she quickly stopped it.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, when I told her I was writing this article, she
was quiet for awhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wars are so unnecessary,'' she said finally.
</P>
<P>
   I realized, then, that although she has seldom spoken of it, the
war had spoken through her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen it,'' she would say when war talk came up. ``That's
why I'm a pacifist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there.''

SHANDLING KEEPS BUSY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Garry Shandling finished the last season of his
television hit, ``The Larry Sanders Show,'' in high style. He was
not only co-writer of a finale that many critics described as
perhaps the best episode in the series (in contrast to the last
episodes of ``Seinfeld'' or ``Ellen''), but he also won his first
Emmy in the process. Even as he held the coveted award that
evening, he was being asked what would come next.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is an answer: movies.
</P>
<P>
   Shandling is filming ``Town and Country,'' which also stars
Warren Beatty, Diane Keaton and Goldie Hawn. (``I haven't asked,
but from my perspective, I'm the best-looking man in the movie,''
Shandling said.) He also plays a role in the forthcoming film
version of the play ``Hurlyburly,'' with Sean Penn, Chazz
Palminteri and Kevin Spacey.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more important, Columbia Tri-Star Pictures just
gave the green light to the first movie he has written, ``What
Planet Are You From?'' It is a comedy in which he expects to star.
</P>
<P>
   Shandling did not want to say much about the script, which he
said he had been developing for the last four years, except that it
involved an alien arriving on Earth to impregnate a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He discovers, of course, that it's more difficult than
expected, and he has to marry,'' Shandling said. ``He's not trained
for that, and all hell breaks loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Shandling said that he might eventually create more television
shows, but that he did not expect to star in them. ``In other
words, I would get someone better than me,'' he said. For now,
though, he said he was eager to explore a new medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really anxious to do a feature to see creatively what it
will be like to have a little more time to focus on the details,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   This has been an unusually productive time for Shandling. He
said that last week he finished the manuscript for a book, ``The
Larry Sanders Story: Confessions of a Late Night Talk Show Host,''
in which, among other things, he makes up fictional exploits with
real people, like an encounter with Cybill Shepherd, who made a
guest appearance on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had hoped to take several months off after the show, but it
hasn't worked out,'' Shandling lamented.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he said that he had been following the Clinton
scandals, and that, like many people, he was perplexed and
startled, but that it had made him think about the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' he said, ``a really dumb person is someone who
goes to the White House and sees the president and says, `You know,
this office is not perfectly round.' And the president says, `It's
oval, which means something different.' But that's another
story.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is a great deal of science to the art of moviemaking, and
one of the scientifically proven truths is that you never release a
potential blockbuster in September because people are busy with
school or the new television season, unless, of course, the movie
is what critics characterize as a formulaic action comedy from a
fledgling director.
</P>
<P>
   Huh?
</P>
<P>
   Just about everyone was surprised by the performance last
weekend of ``Rush Hour,'' which set records with a startling $33
million at the box office for its opening weekend. (Janet Maslin,
reviewing the movie in The New York Times, called it a ``lively but
routine action story.'')
</P>
<P>
   Never before has a film done so well in what is regarded as the
dead season of early fall, in between the high seasons of summer
and late fall and holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is overwhelming,'' said Brett Ratner, the director of
``Rush Hour,'' which stars Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker and was
released by New Line Cinema. ``For myself, to be honest, I said
that I'll dance naked down Sunset Boulevard if this does $20
million.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the wonder of the success is the fact that Ratner is
just 28; this is his second movie.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Goldman, the president for marketing at New Line, a
Time Warner unit, said that he, too, was stunned by the figures,
but that for months the studio had worked hard to focus audiences
on the characters, not the story, and that was what seemed to have
made the difference.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything in this movie you've seen before,'' Ratner
admitted. ``The way to make it work is the casting, and they really
did have great chemistry.''
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the degree of the success is the fact that the
movie cost roughly $35 million to make and now appears likely to
clear $100 million at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   For Ratner, who comes from a background of making music videos,
the results are both gratifying and liberating. He now has more
clout in Hollywood and thus the ability to make what he wants to
make.
</P>
<P>
   He said his next project was likely to be a remake of the
obscure 1976 movie ``The Killing of a Chinese Bookie,'' about
gangsters and lowlifes.
</P>
<P>
   For Ratner, who grew up in an affluent family in Miami Beach,
this is not just the fantasy of a young man with a dark
imagination. He said that as a youngster, he had met the gangster
Meyer Lansky. Ratner said he had often walked his dog with Lansky
on Tony Collins Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a Jewish kid from Miami Beach, but this stuff was
around me as a kid,'' he said. ``If I wasn't a filmmaker, I'd want
to be a gangster. Well, not really a gangster, but in the casino
business. That's what I knew as a kid.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Everything about the movie ``American History X'' is serious,
from its subject, skinheads and racism, to its director, Humpty
Dumpty.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's not really Humpty Dumpty, but it almost was. Yes,
something is amiss in this new movie, which is scheduled to be
released by New Line on Oct. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The movie stars Edward Norton and Edward Furlong and was
directed by the multimedia artist and powerful personality Tony
Kaye. Kaye, who is used to exerting a great deal of creative
control over his projects, from museum installations on the
homeless to television commercials for Volkswagen, Volvo and Nike,
was also the director of photography and camera operator on the
film, his first feature-length movie.
</P>
<P>
   But control has become the center of a dispute between Kaye and
New Line. Kaye produced an edited version of the film but then
asked to do further work reshaping it. New Line eventually lost
patience, saying it was going to release his last version, which
prompted Kaye to ask that his name be removed and the pseudonym
Alan Smithee be used.
</P>
<P>
   The Directors' Guild rejected that proposal, as well as Kaye's
next suggestion, that Humpty Dumpty be listed as the director. So,
against his wishes, he will be listed as the director.
</P>
<P>
   New Line is moving ahead and says it is proud of what it regards
as a powerful look at a difficult subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still think what we're releasing represents Tony Kaye's
vision of the movie until he developed a whole new radical take on
what he wanted to do,'' said Michael DeLuca, the president of New
Line Productions.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye did not return repeated calls seeking comment, but he has
been quoted in news reports criticizing New Line, describing the
version to be released as a ``rape, a total abuse of creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie cost just $9.5 million, and DeLuca said it was never
expected to be a blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, we didn't make the movie to make a lot of money,'' he
said. ``Movies about race don't exactly burn up the box office. We
made this because it's important to talk about these things.''
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Norton plays a racist in Southern California who
goes to prison and emerges a changed man, seeking to redeem
himself. He clashes with his younger brother, Furlong, who is still
a member of a hate group. The film is filled with invective against
Jews, blacks, Koreans and other immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   For DeLuca, the experience has been an embarrassment, but not a
total surprise, given Kaye's reputation as an artist with a passion
for pursuing his vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the potential was there for these kinds of displays,''
DeLuca said. ``This was a first for me. Sure, I'd work with Kaye
again, if the conditions were right.''

<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies and film series currently playing in
theaters. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `THE AVENGERS,' starring Uma Thurman, Ralph Fiennes, Sean
Connery and Eileen Atkins. Directed by Jeremiah Chechik (PG, 100
minutes). Sometimes major movie studios should be afraid to screen
expensive fiascoes for the press, but they go ahead anyway. ``The
Avengers'' is Warner Brothers' would-be blockbuster that actually
had its light hidden beneath a bushel until opening day, and no
wonder. With pseudo-suave repartee that would make Austin Powers
blush and with so many shades of ``Howard the Duck'' that one scene
depicts man-size pastel teddy bears sitting around a conference
table, it's a film to gall fans of the old television series and
perplex anyone else. I can't remember another Friday morning show
where I heard actual cries of ``Ugh!'' on the way out the door
(Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `BLADE,' starring Wesley Snipes, Stephen Dorff, Traci Lords and
Kris Kristofferson. Directed by Stephen Norrington (R, 120
minutes). Vampires are plotting to take over the world, and the
only person who can save the planet is a vampiric half-human
superhero named Blade. So much fake blood drips, gushes, explodes
and congeals in this hyperkinetic science-fiction horror film
adapted from a popular comic book that there's barely a scene that
isn't drenched in red. Snipes' Blade is a low-rent Arnold
Schwarzenegger imitation dressed in a ludicrous mixture of black
leather and what look like car seat belts. There's lots of morphing
and Hong Kong action movie-style acrobatics. Dorff is the bratty
leader of the young vampire rebels. The visuals are garish, the
acting wretched (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `54,' starring Ryan Phillippe, Salma Hayek, Neve Campbell, Mike
Myers, Lauren Hutton and Michael York. Directed by Mark Christopher
(R, 89 minutes). Christopher's botched history of Studio 54, the
notorious late-'70s disco and celebrity hangout, should have been a
depraved Manhattan answer to ``Saturday Night Fever.'' Instead, it
is a juiceless mishmash that can't decide whether it's a nightclub
history, a comedy (Myers' crude ``Saturday Night Live''-style
caricature of Steve Rubell) or a contemporary variation on the
fable of the prodigal son. Phillippe, playing a 19-year-old Jersey
City nobody who ascends from busboy to star bartender at the club,
does throw off an occasional spark. But the movie is so afraid to
confront the character's self-promoting bisexuality that he never
really comes alive (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `FIRELIGHT,' starring Sophie Marceau and Stephen Dillane.
Written and directed by William Nicholson (R, 103 minutes). Stella
Dallas meets Jane Eyre in this high-toned Victorian-era
bodice-ripper about a beautiful Swiss governess (Ms. Marceau) who
is hired by a married English aristocrat to bear a child when his
wife is unable to conceive. Years later, she tracks him down and
becomes the governess to his spoiled young daughter, who doesn't
know that her teacher is also her biological mother. Using flash
cards, she tricks the intransigent little brat into learning to
read, among other good deeds. Ms. Marceau and Dillane strike
sparks, and the movie's canny mixture of sex and suds makes for
slick, low-grade ``Masterpiece Theater''-style entertainment
(Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE GOVERNESS,' starring Minnie Driver and Tom Wilkinson.
Directed by Sandra Goldbacher (R, 114 minutes). It is the early
1840s, and Rosina (Ms. Driver), a headstrong young Sephardic Jewish
woman living in London, poses as a Gentile to get a job as a
governess for the Cavendish family on a remote Scottish island.
Falling in love with the skittish, devoutly Christian head of the
household (Tom Wilkinson), a gentleman inventor with whom she has a
stormy affair, she becomes his collaborator in the invention of
photography. The ravishingly handsome film works on several levels:
as a proto-feminist fable, a meditation on still photography and
its relation to real life, and a portrait of lovers whose religious
difference becomes an unbridgeable emotional gap. Ms. Driver holds
the picture with a solid performance that falls short of great
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `A MERRY WAR,' starring Richard E. Grant and Helena Bonham
Carter. Directed by Robert Bierman (not rated, 101 minutes).
Skillfully adapted from George Orwell's satirical 1936 novel,
``Keep the Aspidistra Flying,'' the witty period piece, set in
1930s London, follows the descent into poverty of Gordon Comstock
(Grant), a successful London ad man who quits his copywriting job
to be a full-time poet. The subjects skewered include young artists
with delusions of grandeur and snobbish aristocrats with socialist
pretensions. Ms. Bonham Carter is Gordon's sweetheart who patiently
waits out a narcissistic seizure that Grant portrays with an
engaging comic buoyancy (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `NEXT STOP WONDERLAND,' starring Hope Davis and Alan Gelfant.
Directed by Brad Anderson (R, 111 minutes). Will Erin (Ms. Davis),
an attractive, introspective night-shift nurse, and Alan (Gelfant),
a plumber and aspiring marine biologist who was obviously meant for
her, collide on the streets of Boston and live happily ever after?
The setup of this romantic comedy about dating in the '90s may seem
cliched, but the witty, beautifully acted and edited film refreshes
the genre with the acuteness of Anderson's observations about
people and middle-class urban life in general. Ms. Davis creates a
wonderfully complex portrait of an idealistic introvert coping with
loneliness, disappointment and pressures from all sides, including
(in the movie's funniest scenes) some ardently self-centered
suitors who answer a personal ad. A rich Brazilian bossa nova score
gives the movie the mood of bittersweet longing (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `ONE TRUE THING,' starring Meryl Streep, Renee Zellweger and
William Hurt. Directed by Carl Franklin (PG-13, 120 minutes). This
film adaptation of the novel by Anna Quindlen _ a former columnist
for The New York Times _ about an ambitious New York journalist
forced to move back in with her parents to care for her dying
mother strikes a sad and universal chord. And Ms. Streep and Ms.
Zellweger are beautifully matched as a mother and daughter who
achieve a grown-up understanding during this anguished time. But
the movie treads the line between soap opera and serious drama and
has far too many cute and sentimental touches. Its structure _ the
story is told in flashbacks that make the mother's death a kind of
whodunit (she dies from an overdose of morphine) _ also cheapen the
movie without ruining it (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `PERMANENT MIDNIGHT,' starring Ben Stiller and Elizabeth Hurley.
Directed by David Veloz (R, 85 minutes). As Jerry Stahl recounts in
his 1995 memoir, drug addiction turned him into a skittish,
distracted, hugely self-involved individual. Since he happened to
be working as a television writer in Hollywood, no one really
noticed. The film version of his story plunges fearlessly into the
self-inflicted humiliations that went with this story. In a
first-rate, rivetingly caustic performance, Stiller plays a man on
a fashionably decadent slide all the way to rock bottom. The
character's clearest sign of dysfunction is his inability to
appreciate Elizabeth Hurley as his ravishing, high-powered wife
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `ROUNDERS,' starring Matt Damon, Edward Norton, John Malkovich,
John Turturro and Gretchen Mol. Directed by John Dahl (R, 120
minutes). Though this tale of poker fever finally adds up to less
than meets the eye, what does meet the eye (and ear) is
mischievously entertaining. Inspired by Martin Scorsese's brand of
irresistible lowlife and aided by a splendid rogues' gallery of a
cast, the director of ``The Last Seduction'' takes his audience
into a poker demimonde of abundant color. As the actors make the
most of rascally roles (Malkovich has a field day with a Russian
accent), the story leads to settings as varied as the Elks Hall in
Binghamton and a Russian Turkish bath. Dahl may not have new
thoughts on the gambler's life, but he makes this guided tour worth
the trip (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `SAVING PRIVATE RYAN,' starring Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Tom
Sizemore, Jeremy Davies, Edward Burns and Adam Goldberg. Directed
by Steven Spielberg (R, 168 minutes). Spielberg's soberly
magnificent new film is the finest war movie of our time. Turning
back the clock to restore passion and meaning to the genre, he
works in a spirit of urgent communication to look at war as if it
had not been looked at before. Tour-de-force battle scenes are
frank without sensationalism, and the same great storyteller who
made you believe there was an extraterrestrial hiding in the closet
has made this an irresistibly vibrant, gripping tale. Hanks
continues to astonish with admirable modesty, and the rest of the
casting is comparably inspired. As he did with ``Schindler's
List,'' Spielberg has made a landmark film of devastating power
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `A SOLDIER'S DAUGHTER NEVER CRIES,' starring Leelee Sobieski,
Kris Kristofferson, Barbara Hershey and Anthony Roth Costanzo.
Directed by James Ivory (R, 120 minutes). Working without a classic
at hand, the Merchant-Ivory team adapts a novel by Kaylie Jones,
James Jones' daughter, into a colorful panorama weakened by
autobiographical sprawl. With no real narrative shapeliness and a
loosely anecdotal pace, it vividly recalls the coming-of-age of a
sensitive young woman who (though well played by 14-year-old Ms.
Sobieski) remains a more slender, peripheral figure than the film's
ambitions require. Moving from Paris to America, it succeeds more
at evoking detail and atmosphere than in finding the heart of her
story (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY,' starring Cameron Diaz, Ben
Stiller and Matt Dillon. Directed by Peter and Bobby Farrelly (R,
119 minutes). Sometimes Western civilization declines in
deliriously funny style. Hence this proudly obnoxious comedy is a
hoot in every sense, deserving a smidgen of disapproval and a whole
lot of helpless laughter. Set in motion by a prom, a crush and a
cruel, cruel zipper, this paean to low humor works ridiculously
well because it never stoops to being mean-spirited or (despite all
appearances) authentically inane. The principal cast is bright and
appealing, with Ms. Diaz at her most beautiful and blithe. Do note
that this film strives hard for something to offend everyone, and
that a tolerance for the Farrellys' zit jokes is unfortunately
required (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `WITHOUT LIMITS,' starring Billy Crudup and Donald Sutherland.
Directed by Robert Towne (PG-13, 118 minutes). In telling the story
of mercurial track star Steve Prefontaine, a screenwriter known for
enriching screenplays with unruly, unpredictable life, creates a
surprisingly resonant portrait. Thanks to Crudup's charismatic
performance as a runner with the attitudes of a rock star, this can
be watched as one more sports film, complete with exciting race
sequences. But it's not truly about winning, losing or even playing
the game; instead, Towne considers the philosophical distance
between the brash Prefontaine and his formidable coach, Bill
Bowerman (expertly played by Sutherland). The film's wisdom lies in
its thoughtful way of balancing these two (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS,' starring Jason Patric, Ben
Stiller, Aaron Eckhardt, Catherine Keener, Amy Brenneman and
Nastassja Kinski. Written and directed by Neil LaBute (R, 100
minutes). Three men obsessed with one another's sexual performance
are at the core of this second film from the director of ``In the
Company of Men.'' The new movie is so blunt at times, and so
unrelievedly talky and dark at others, that it cries out for the
velvet glove of ``Manhattan,'' a much more seductive film about
sexual opportunism and urbane cruelty. Yet even when LaBute's
material feels mannered or unremittingly sour, it sustains a
psychic ferocity that commands attention. The intricate web of
lies, failures and brutal revelations here is strong stuff, and
it's the work of an original filmmaker who takes no prisoners
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   Film Series
</P>
<P>
   `KEATON CLASSICS.' Buster Keaton in all his classic glory comes
to the screen of the Film Forum on Sunday in the start of a series
devoted to the great silent screen comedian. The opening bill
includes ``The General'' (1926), Keaton's spectacular retelling of
the Civil War's Great Locomotive Chase, and three of the master's
two-reel comedies: ``The Electric House,'' ``One Week'' and ``The
High Sign.'' In all, the series will present 13 features, including
``The Navigator'' (1924), ``Steamboat Bill Jr.'' (1928) and
``Sherlock Jr.'' (1923), as well as 19 of the two-reelers. Some of
the screenings will have a live piano accompaniment by Steve
Sterner; most of the others, synchronized musical scores. The
series will continue on nine Mondays through Nov. 23 at the Film
Forum, 209 W. Houston St., in the South Village. Tickets: $8.50;
$4.50 for Film Forum members. Screening schedule and information:
(212) 727-8110 (Lawrence Van Gelder).

POLICE SAY TETRIS PARTNER KILLED FAMILY, SELF 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ While he wrestled with the financial
difficulties of his San Francisco-based software company, Vladimir
Pokhilko watched from the sidelines as business partners and
friends readied the relaunch of Tetris, the world's most popular
video game.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently pushed to the edge, Pokhilko _ president of AnimaTek,
a San Francisco-based software design company _ killed his
39-year-old wife, Elena Fedotova, and their 12-year-old son, Peter
Pokhilko, before killing himself, the police said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A business associate said that Pokhilko, 43, had been wrestling
with company problems brought on, in part, by the current upheaval
in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to those pressures, said Henk Rogers, who helped found
AnimaTek in 1988, was a push to get more financing to create
software that would yield ``Hollywood-type'' computer effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in the middle of raising money,'' Rogers said. ``It
was nothing out of the ordinary. Nothing that we couldn't see past
the end of.''
</P>
<P>
   But sometime Monday night, at the family's home, the police
believe Pokhilko killed his family and then himself. Pokhilko hit
Fedotova, a popular yoga instructor, and eter, a seventh-grader,
with a hammer, and repeatedly stabbed them with a hunting knife,
apparently as they slept.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he stabbed himself once in the throat with the knife, the
police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfathomable that someone would do this to themselves and
a child,'' said Palo Alto police spokeswoman Tami Gage.
</P>
<P>
   A close family friend called the police at 3:30 p.m. Tuesday,
after he arrived at the family home, having failed in repeated
attempts to reach the family by phone.
</P>
<P>
   The police found the pajama-clad bodies of Fedotova and Peter in
their beds. There was no sign of a struggle, indicating they were
sleeping when they were attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Pokhilko's body was found in Peter's room, with the hunting
knife in his hand, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the knife, the police recovered the hammer believed
to have been used in the attacks, and they found a note.
Investigators would not discuss the contends of the letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a suicide note,'' Gage said. ``We don't even know
who wrote the note or how significant it might be.''

</P>
<P>
   Pokhilko's company, AnimaTek, emerged from a partnership formed
in Moscow more than a decade ago with Rogers and Russian computer
scientist Alexey Pajitnov, who invented the video game Tetris in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   Pajitnov based Tetris, which entails lining up stacks of blocks
as they drop to the bottom of a computer screen, on an ancient
Roman puzzle called Pentamino.
</P>
<P>
   Pokhilko, a Russian clinical psychologist and a longtime friend
of Pajitnov's, had been experimenting with using puzzles as
psychological tests when Pajitnov first showed him his invention,
Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   Pokhilko immediately saw the mass appeal of the puzzle and
convinced him it would make a great computer game. The partners
began collaborating to publish Tetris, but their plans were
derailed by Soviet authorities, who in 1986 demanded that Pajitnov
sign over all rights to the game.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Pokhilko and Pajitnov teamed to create digital
diversions, including El-Fish, a virtual aquarium.
</P>
<P>
   During the 10 years the Soviet government brokered deals with
Nintendo, Atari and other video-game makers, Pajitnov lost an
estimated $40 million in royalties.
</P>
<P>
   One of those who brokered the largest license agreement was
Rogers, whose Japan-based Bullet Proof Software locked in the
rights to sell Tetris to its largest market, the hand-held
gaming-device industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the biggest market for Tetris,'' Rogers said.
``That's what made the game huge.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Soviet restrictions expired and Tetris rights
reverted to Pajitnov, who had immigrated to the United States five
years earlier with Pokhilko.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers had helped the pair open AnimaTek International Inc., a
software development company creating computer-generated terrains
and characters for the gaming industry. Pokhilko became president
of the company. Rogers was the chairman and largest stockholder.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Soviet rights to Tetris expired, Rogers said, he
formed the Tetris Company, which bought the rights to the game.
Rogers also launched Blue Planet Software, which he said was to
publish the next-generation Tetris computer games, including
versions that would allow players to conduct Tetris matches over
the Internet. Pokhilko was a part of it.
</P>
<P>
   The new version is expected to be a big hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of anticipation around (the new Tetris),'' said
Cindy Blair, publisher of the San Francisco-based Game Developer
magazine. ``It's huge. It's one of the biggest games, ever.''

DIRECTOR LIMNS WOMEN'S LIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Viewed one by one on tape, a director's films usually follow a
gradual progression. In the case of Marleen Gorris, however, the
oeuvre sprints right up to the brink of oblivion before taking a
prodigious leap into the ranks of the acclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's hard to imagine a more radical shift in content
and style, accomplished in the space of 3 films made over 12 years,
from Ms. Gorris's harshly violent ``Question of Silence'' in 1983
(on video from First Run Features) to the elegant, deeply
reflective ``Mrs. Dalloway,'' her praised 1997 adaptation of
Virginia Woolf's novel, to be released on Tuesday by BMG.
</P>
<P>
   Between the two films, Ms. Gorris, who is Dutch, worked on other
projects and then wrote and directed ``Antonia's Line'' in 1995
(released on video by BMG), a richly pastoral and loving story
about four generations of women as seen through the recollections
of an aged matriarch.
</P>
<P>
   Often described as a feminist director, Ms. Gorris began as an
exceedingly angry one, and on the most rudimentary terms. In ``A
Question of Silence,'' three women _ one accused of shoplifting and
two others who don't know her or each other _ confront the store
owner and spontaneously stomp him to death, earning general
approval from women as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   In her next film, ``Broken Mirrors'' (1985), the lot of women in
a brothel is compared to the fate of a woman held captive by a
serial killer who starves his victims to death.
</P>
<P>
   But over the next decade her perspective changed. Rage had
dissipated. ``You have expressed something that is important to
you,'' Ms. Gorris said in a recent interview. ``You aren't so angry
and you go on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Antonia's Line'' begins and ends on the day Antonia (Willeke
van Ammelrooy) dies at age 90. In her reminiscences, her daughter,
a lesbian, wants a child, and Antonia arranges a fruitful one-night
liaison. (Bring on a man, handsome and wordless.)
</P>
<P>
   Her granddaughter is a prodigy and has her own daughter. With
men around as minor functionaries, the women bond and thrive down
the decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never talked about women's lives as happy occasions,''
Ms. Gorris said. ``I decided, wouldn't it be nice if they were
raised in a kind of harmony with life and death.'' The movie won
the Academy Award for best foreign film.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Mrs. Dalloway' was very much a result of having won the
Oscar,'' Ms. Gorris said. ``I was offered a lot of scripts, and
this was one of the few I thought was interesting.'' Written by the
actress Eileen Atkins, this is the first film Ms. Gorris directed
that she didn't write herself.
</P>
<P>
   The year is 1923, and the matronly Clarissa Dalloway (Vanessa
Redgrave) reflects on a life that might have seen her married as
the young Clarissa (Natascha McElhone) to the adventurous Peter
Walsh (Alan Cox). Instead, she chose to play it safe with the
sweet, monied and pedestrian Richard Dalloway (played as an older
man by John Standing).
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes me feel less afraid,'' the young Clarissa explains.
So, as happens in Woolf's story, men are around, if only as
choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``My films are about a woman's decision in a male-dominated
world,'' Ms. Gorris said. ``I will remain interested in that
issue.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chinese Box
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong, shrouded and caught in transition, provides
appropriately shifting ground for a frustrated affair between John
(Jeremy Irons), a reporter, and Vivian (Gong Li), the beautiful
mistress of a shady wheeler-dealer (Michael Hui).
</P>
<P>
   Wandering the city with a video camera, John, who has leukemia,
balances his infatuation with the city and his obsession with a
woman whose ambitions and background inhibit an open relationship.
And so it is with Hong Kong, evasive and unwilling to reveal itself
in a lyrical film, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times,
whose ``elegiac echoes linger long after the final credits have
rolled.''

<P>
   Life isn't easy for a tart-tongued conure (a member of the
parrot family) who talks as much as Paulie. As the pet and friend
of a little girl with a speech defect, he is banished by her
family, which doesn't believe he talks at all. That lands him in a
pawn shop, where he is bought by a widow (Gena Rowlands) who takes
him cross-country in hopes of a reunion with the girl.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, Paulie works as a song-and-dance bird, is
kidnapped, becomes a cat burglar and ends up locked away in the
basement laboratory of an animal-behavior researcher (Bruce
Davison), where he tells his story to a sympathetic janitor (Tony
Shalhoub).

Diamond by night.
</P>
<P>
   Stripping in turn leads to appearances at bachelor parties and
Diana's transformation into a pistol-packin' mama. But the humor
stays broad and ``campy moments and a luridly colorful look (with
cinematography by Malik Sayeed) may give this no-flair, no-frills B

<P>
   &UR; BYE WEEK (BUFFALO, MIAMI, NEW ENGLAND, JETS) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GAME OF THE WEEK: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Seattle (3-0) vs. Pittsburgh (2-1)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Seattle (3) _ 100-yard rushing games. Pittsburgh (18)
_ Kordell Stewart career TD runs.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Seattle has surprised many fans. For many others, the
Steelers' showing in Miami on last Sunday was a big surprise.
Pittsburgh wasn't just shut out but were also shut down. All
around. Big turnovers and a pressing game by Stewart was where it
started. But QB Stewart turns things around with his arm and with
his legs. He should and will run more and his passing will improve,
too. The Pittsburgh run defense must deal deftly with backs Ricky
Watters and Ahman Green. The Seahawks put on a show, a talented
bunch at every turn, but Pittsburgh answers.
</P>
<P>
   Steelers, 17-10.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUNDAY, 1 P.M. GAMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE (3-0) VS. TENNESSEE (1-2)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Jaguars (14-6) _ Brunell's record as starter. Oilers
(311.3) _ Yards allowed per game.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: When the Jaguars and Oilers meet, it usually means a
close game. All six games in their series have been decided by 8 or
fewer points and Jacksonville has won four. Rookie back Fred Taylor
will be asked to do more for the Jaguars in the running game and
Mark Brunell continues to do his thing: Escape the rush and make
zinging, accurate throws downfield. He is by far one of the
league's most accurate deep passers. The Oilers have high hopes and
need this game to build on those hopes. Look for receiver Yancey
Thigpen and the Oilers offensive line to be heroes. Oilers, 24-22.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA (1-2) VS. ST. LOUIS (1-2)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Cardinals (5) _ NFC-most fumbles earned. Rams (272.0)
_ Tony Banks passing yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: When Rams quarterback Tony Banks covered the football
and went running toward the end zone again in the closing seconds
and scored and beat Buffalo on last Sunday, it was a fun sight. The
week before, vs. Minnesota, Banks tried it in nearly an identical
situation and missed the goal line by inches as the clock expired,
forcing a Rams loss. It told you two things about Banks _ he has
courage and he is intent on doing things his way in becoming a
big-time NFL quarterback. This is another step _ lifting his team
to .500. Cardinals, 24-13.
</P>
<P>
   DENVER (3-0) VS. WASHINGTON (0-3)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Broncos (6.78) _ Avg. yards gained on 1st downs.
Redskins (-8) _ Turnover differential.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Washington can still move the football, just not far
enough or long enough and without turnovers arising. But the
defense is under siege. This team is in big trouble. It goes 0-4.
Broncos, 36-23.
</P>
<P>
   GREEN BAY (3-0) VS. CAROLINA (0-2)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Packers (310) _ Offensive yards per game. Panthers
(346) _ Offensive yds. per game.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Could it be that the Carolina offense is averaging more
yards per game than Green Bay's? Who would think that possible? But
Carolina is also minus 4 in turnover differential while Green Bay
is plus 1. And another thing: Green Bay gives up an average of 76.3
yards fewer than Carolina on defense. Too much Brett Favre throwing
to Antonio Freeman for Carolina to handle. Too much Reggie White
and LeRoy Butler on defense for Carolina to handle. Too much Green
Bay. Packers, 27-20.
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY (2-1) VS. PHILADELPHIA (0-3)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Chiefs (+8) _ Turnover differential. Eagles (-5) _
Turnover differential.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: The turnover game says plenty about these teams. The
Chiefs win turnover battles _ they protect the ball and steal it.
The Eagles lose turnover battles _ they toss it away and don't
steal it enough. Enough said. Chiefs, 20-9.
</P>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (2-0) VS. INDIANAPOLIS (0-3)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Saints (1) _ Turnovers in `98. Colts (8) _ Peyton
Manning interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: The Saints keep it simple. They run it and and stop the
run. They play hard and smart. At least, through two games. Playing
the Colts gives them a chance to be 3-0 for the first time since
1993. Jim Mora, the Colts coach, sees his old team, a team he
coached for 11 seasons. Sean Dawkins, now with the Saints, played
five years with the Colts, including last year. Dawkins gets to
enjoy the reunion more than Mora. For Dawkins, a nice homecoming.
Saints, 19-17.
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND (1-2) VS. DALLAS (2-1)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Raiders (2-0) _ Record at Texas Stadium. Cowboys
(62-35) _ Record vs. AFC.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Dallas has earned 26 rushing first downs. That is the
most in the NFL. That means that Dallas coach Chan Gailey is
complementing nicely for the loss of Troy Aikman at quarterback.
Gailey is finding different ways to get his backs the ball in
different situations, up the middle, off tackle and around the
ends. And it is working, thanks to a hard-working offensive line.
Dallas sees the future when it tries to defend Raiders back
Napolean Kauffman. He can be a blur. But Dallas wins the game on
special teams. Cowboys, 29-21.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUNDAY 4 P.M. GAMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA (2-0) VS. SAN FRANCISCO (2-0)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Falcons (7-1) _ Record in last 8. 49ers (7.7) _
Garrison Hearst avg. yds. per carry.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Atlanta knows how huge this game is for its season and
its psyche. The Falcons cannot win the NFC West without beating the
49ers and they have not won in San Francisco since 1991. The 49ers
have won 12 of the last 16 in this series. Steve Young has passed
for more yards (4,055) vs. the Falcons than vs. any team. Running
back Garrison Hearst makes the 49ers running game energetic and the
49ers have won 9 consecutively at home. Chris Chandler, the Atlanta
quarterback, has thrown at least one touchdown pass in 14
consecutive games. This is a good show. 49ers, 27-10.
</P>
<P>
   GIANTS (1-2) VS. SAN DIEGO (2-1)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: _ Giants (12) _ Maynard punts inside 20. Chargers
(89.0) _ AFC No-1 rush defense.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Bad news for the Giants _ the punter, Brad Maynard, has
been a star so far this season with a league-most punts landing
inside the 20. Nice to have an effective punter, but when that has
been the highlight through three games, you are in trouble. The
Giants running game faces the best run defense so far in the AFC.
The last time the Giants visited the West Coast, they tripped all
over themselves in a loss to the Raiders and they have not played
in San Diego since 1989. No way rookie quarterback Ryan Leaf is as
horrible as he was last week vs. Kansas City. He and the Chargers
defense give the Giants more to ponder. Chargers, 23-16.
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA (3-0) VS. CHICAGO (0-3)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Vikings (3) _ Robert Griffith interceptions. Bears (1)
_ No. 1 NFC pass defense.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: The Bears are actually good at something. They have the
best pass defense in the NFC. Actually, the Bears can take the ball
away on defense; they rank among the league's best there. So, why
haven't they won yet.? Not enough big plays. Not enough
consistency. Some tough luck. They battle a Vikings defense that is
tied with Miami with 10 takeaways; safety Robert Griffith has
three, on interceptions. Dennis Green is 9-4 vs. the Bears. He
makes a living beating them. Make it one more time. Vikings, 20-13.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUNDAY NIGHT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (1-2) VS. BALTIMORE (1-2)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Bengals (+4) _ Turnover differential. Ravens (+5) _
Turnover differential.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: These teams are over the top in taking the ball away
more than giving it away. This bodes for an entertaining game and
also indicates that the team that makes fewer turnovers prevails.
That would be the Ravens. They start Eric Zeier instead of Jim
Harbaugh and Zeier is playing well (42 of 72 for 602 yards with 3
touchdowns and 1 interception, a 93.6 passer rating). Zeier's
passing rating is higher than Bengals quarterback Neil O'Donnell's
(91.1). Zeier even leads the AFC in fourth-quarter passing yards
(289). Zeier and the Ravens run defense wins it. Ravens, 14-6.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MONDAY NIGHT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY (1-2) VS. DETROIT (0-3)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Buccaneers (0) _ Trent Dilfer interceptions. Lions (0)
_ Interceptions earned.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Detroit is swirling in controversy (quarterback Scott
Mitchell's immaturity) and bad play. Notorious slow starters, this
is where the Lions begin to rise. Rookie quarterback Charlie Batch
settles in and Barry Sanders runs out of the Bucs' grasp. In the
end, it is decided on the Tampa Bay offense vs. the Detroit
defense. Detroit is such an emotionally-stressed team that the
glare of Monday night offers a salve to bruised egos. They respond.
Lions, 23-13.

 &HT;    TRIPP TAPES MIGHT NOT BE RELEASED, HYDE SAYS
 &HT;    400&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The tapes that Linda Tripp secretly made of
telephone conversations with Monica Lewinsky may not be released
next week with other evidence given to Congress by Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry
Hyde said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than the actual tapes, the Illinois Republican said, the
committee may release an edited transcript.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of conversations last year, Lewinsky told Tripp
about her White House affair with President Clinton and, allegedly,
about attempts to cover it up. It was Tripp's decision to give
Starr the tapes that spurred an eight-month investigation that is
now likely to lead to hearings on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linda Tripp's tapes are very long. They are very garrulous.
There is a lot of information that really does not pertain to this
investigation,'' said Hyde. ``There is information there that
really could be embarrassing to innocent people, third parties.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to alter tapes,'' he explained. ``On the other
hand, there is information that should be released. We can redact
transcripts of the taped material and release those. That, so far,
seems to be the best way.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on Hyde's committee questioned whether the real
Republican motive was to withhold evidence that was damaging to
Tripp's motives and methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``My suspicion is that if Republicans thought the tapes hurt the
president, they wouldn't hesitate to release them,'' said Rep.
Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Nadler said he hadn't heard the tapes and noted that Starr's
report indicated they may have been altered. If there are questions
of authenticity, the FBI should verify the tapes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it makes no sense to release the transcript and not the
tape,'' Nadler said. ``You either release both or you don't release
either.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can anyone think of a principled justification for releasing
the videotape of the president but not the audio tape of Linda
Tripp?'' asked Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass. ``The Republicans started
out saying they were going to treat the president like everybody
else. Well, apparently, Linda Tripp isn't everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Frank noted that the committee Democrats had opposed
last week's massive release of evidence and ``are going to be
consistent. I don't think we're going to be for releasing those
tapes either, although obviously the transcript ought to be
released.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla., said withholding the Tripp tapes
would continue the pattern of partisanship by the committee's
majority Republicans. Although he hadn't heard the Tripp tapes,
Wexler said he wants the evidence released but all at once, in a
fair manner, rather than being dribbled out.
</P>
<P>
   Both Tripp and Lewinsky had been exiled from White House jobs to
the Pentagon, and the tapes reportedly recount Lewinsky confiding
her most intimate thoughts with Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really sorry for everything that happened,'' a tearful
Lewinsky told the grand jury as she finished her testimony. ``And I
hate Linda Tripp.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the grand jury testimony, e-mail and other evidence
already released by Congress indicates that Tripp practically
assembled the case before going to Starr.
</P>
<P>
   It was Tripp, Lewinsky told the grand jury, who was at least
partly responsible that the semen-stained Gap dress was never
cleaned, thus preserving genetic evidence of the sexual
relationship between Clinton and Lewinsky. Lewinsky said Tripp
``told me that I should put it in a safe deposit box because it
could be evidence one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky testified that she told her friend that would never
happen. But then ``she told me I looked fat in the dress'' and
loaned her a jacket to wear to an event instead, Lewinsky recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky also said Tripp urged her not to sign an affidavit in
the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit denying both the affair and
obtaining presidential assistance in securing a job. Lewinsky said
she had already signed and misled Tripp about the timing.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has raised suspicions about the audio tapes, noting that
some seem to have been altered or copied. Tripp has denied
duplicating or altering the tapes. It is illegal to tape someone
without their knowledge in Maryland, and a state grand jury is
investigating the case.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said that probe would not affect the decision on whether to
release the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, frankly, think an impeachment inquiry takes precedence over
the grand jury in Maryland,'' he explained. ``The information that
should go out should go out, but there's an awful lot there that
shouldn't go out.''

 &HT;    BY NICHOLE MONROE
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ American colleges and universities are slowly
losing their grasp of the world's international students as an
increasing number turn to other countries for their post-secondary
educations, a team of educators, businesses and government agencies
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The influx of international students to the United States may
have stagnated because of high costs, lack of access to information
and maltreatment, said participants at the International Higher
Education Summit Conference held at the U.S. State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, the number of international students hosted by some
non-U.S. countries has increased by as much as 10 times, while the
rate in the United States has slowed from 5.3 percent increase in
1990-91 to a 0.9 percent rise in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competition by other countries has ... increased
dramatically,'' said Nancy Cole, president of Educational Testing
Service, a nonprofit organization that develops and administers
achievement, occupational and admissions tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Union and Latin
America have all increased marketing efforts aimed at students in
Southeast Asia, the largest provider of international students,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the University of Texas at Austin, which ranks No. 7 in the
country in its number of foreign students, has seen its numbers
dwindle. After reaching a peak in 1994 of 4,200 students, that
number had gone down to 3,403 by 1996-97, said Richard Lariviere,
associate vice president for international programs.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lariviere was unsure what caused the decline, he said
the unversity has strict admissions standards for international
students, and UT has tried to limit the number of students it
accepts to keep enrollment under 49,000.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when there is an increased interdependence on other
countries for the nation's economic and cultural well-being, the
loss of foreign students can mean the loss of crucial contacts with
future world leaders, said Joseph Duffey, director of the U.S.
Information Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``International students bring unique features to American
colleges and universities which are important to U.S. relations and
the world, `` Duffy said. ``The knowledge of other cultures which
these students bring to American youth, and the understanding of
the U.S. which they take back to their own countries helps form the
basis for future contacts between the United States and the rest of
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Conference participants said one reason for the slowed growth
may be that the foreign students often run into barriers when
coming to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, they said, universities assume foreign students
have access to program descriptions, course schedules and other
materials when they may not. Although many universities post such
information on the Internet, many students, particularly those in
some African countries, may not have access.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, participants said universities don't recruit
agressively enough and the U.S. government often makes it difficult
for students to obtain visas for themselves and their spouses.
</P>
<P>
   However, said Ralph Hines of the Department of Education,
although the government recognizes the rich resources international
students can bring, the federal agency is somewhat limited by its
own mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our standpoint ... our mandate is to train Americans,''
said Hines, acting head of the Education Department's Office of
Higher Education Programs.
</P>
<P>
   Some authorities suggested one way to solve the problem of
dwindling foreign students is for government, universities and
businesses to establish clear goals and policies on international
education, said Keith Geiger, director of USIA's Office of Academic
Programs.
</P>
<P>
   Such policies might include ensuring that enough informational
material is available in embassies, libraries and campuses
worldwide, creating special provisions that would allow foreign
students to work in the United States and developing a campus
atmosphere that reflects the interests of an international
community.
</P>
<P>
   Hines said the latter goal is of the utmost importance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students go where they feel they're accepted and where there's
a level of mobile effort,'' he said.

   UNDATED _ In a season that was supposed to be wall-to-wall
silliness, insanity and intellectual insults, how pleasing it has
been to watch a number of fall pilots roll off the network assembly
line looking polished, promising and even, dare I say, mechanically
daring. The latest series worth at least a three-episode look-see

<P>
   UNDATED _ Despite likable characters and performances, ``Just
Write'' just doesn't feel quite right. It seems like a

who's really just a person like everyone else. But it's a daydream

   FILM-URBAN LEGEND &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ It's hard to tell who's dumber at Pendleton College:
the students, who frequently walk alone even though a homicidal
maniac is on the loose; or the faculty, who won't believe that
there's a homicidal maniac on the loose despite overwhelming
evidence and the school's troubled past. The dumbness is part of
``Urban Legend's'' appeal. By ROBERT PHILPOT. Story has moved in

<P>
   FILM-RONIN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ ``Ronin'' has a brisk and merciless pace _ it's like a
movie put together by an assassin. It has its moments, but director
John Frankenheimer boils the ingredients _ action, international
terrorism, desperate men down on their luck _ until it collapses
into a muddled stew. By ELVIS MITCHELL. Story has moved in ``e''

   UNDATED _ Writer/director John Waters was disgusting when
disgusting wasn't cool. Before the Pythons were vomiting in
restaurants, before Mel Brooks found flatulence funny and before
the Farrelly Brothers discovered a new kind of hair gel _ the
granddaddy of the gross-out was outdoing them all. And with the

after the house and the car. A pool? A grand piano? A Jacuzzi? How
about your funeral? The average cost for an adult funeral is a
whopping $7,800, according to the funeral industry. That makes the
funeral business big business. By TERESA MCUSIC. Story has moved in

THE GORE OPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c. 1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During his Watergate troubles, President Richard
Nixon argued that impeachment requires an indictable offense, a
tougher standard than that described by President Gerald Ford, who
said an impeachable offense is merely what Congress says it is.
</P>
<P>
   In his memoirs, Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., former minority
counsel of the 1973 Senate committee that investigated the
Watergate crimes, recalls that Democratic chairman Sam Ervin agreed
with Nixon on that high standard. ``I think you do have to have an
indictable offense before you can impeach him,'' Thompson quotes
Ervin as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury investigating charges of a cover-up and
obstruction of justice eventually set the stage for impeachment by
naming Nixon an unindicted co-conspirator in February 1974, five
months before he was forced to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Legal scholars generally believe that the constitutional
separation of powers bars the judicial branch from indicting a
sitting president for wrongdoing. But a president could be
vulnerable to criminal charges after leaving office, which is why
Ford felt obliged to issue a pardon for his mentor Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   It is also why Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's office is
spreading the word in the legal community that he intends to indict
President Clinton if Clinton resigns. There is even the suggestion
that Starr may indict Clinton after his term ends in two years if
the president manages to survive a congressional impeachment
process.
</P>
<P>
   We cannot know whether Starr is actually determined to send
Clinton to jail, although it seems possible based on his enraged
pursuit of the president thus far. He could be merely using the
threat of indictment to scare the White House into refusing to
consider the resignation option, forcing the president to endure
the full long and painful process of impeachment hearings in the
House and a trial in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Committee chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said his
panel will vote early next month on whether to ask the full House
to authorize impeachment hearings. With Congress set to adjourn
Oct. 9, Hyde's timetable would freeze the matter until after the
Nov. 3 election.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP-controlled committee is very likely to vote for an
impeachment inquiry and the Republican-led House seems certain to
authorize such hearings. But nothing further would happen until
next year, under a new and perhaps more heavily Republican
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's report to Congress lists 11 counts on which he believes
the president has committed impeachable and indictable offenses.
But several are extremely flimsy, particularly his outrageous
effort to distort the president's legitimate legal maneuvers in
self-defense into illicit obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Starr failed to include in his report any references to other
pending business in his office: Whitewater, misuse of FBI files and
travel office shenanigans. Increasingly credible leaks from Starr's
office indicate that despite four years of probing he has been
unable to prove presidential corruption on those issues.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of all the controversy, the case against Clinton
basically comes down to the question of lying under oath about sex.
It's terrible stuff. Clinton ought to be punished, and will be.
</P>
<P>
   But the concept of putting behind bars a president or former
president _ the elected leader of the free world, mind you _ over a
personal issue that did not affect public policy is an obscene
distortion of our judicial principles.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that doesn't mean Starr won't try to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has moved from being a prosecutor to being a persecutor, a
dangerous maniac who defies due process, privacy and civil rights
and has set himself above the law.
</P>
<P>
   He could not get a conviction from a liberal, pro-Clinton
District of Columbia jury, but he has convened another grand jury
in suburban Virginia that might be more conservative and inclined
to be morally judgmental.
</P>
<P>
   And that brings us to Vice President Albert Gore. If the
president does resign, he will need protection from his White House
successor against a possible indictment. It is impossible to
believe that Gore would not pardon his friend and mentor, just as
Ford pardoned Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Political legend has it that Ford lost the 1976 presidential
election because voters resented the Nixon pardon, but that is not
entirely correct. Ford lost the election because Ronald Reagan
mounted a strong primary challenge against him and badly damaged
Ford's reputation in the process. The coast was clear for Jimmy
Carter to defeat the incumbent Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Gore could probably pardon Clinton without undue electoral
retaliation; a majority of voters still tell the pollsters they
don't want Clinton impeached, let alone indicted. And people
understand loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has a lot to gain if Gore were to win the presidency in
the year 2000. If an unfriendly Republican disinclined toward a
pardon is in the White House in two years, when Starr will still
have the legal authority to go after him, Clinton would be in deep
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has other political problems as he faces a year 2000
presidential campaign, but that's a different subject.

FANCY GOODS WITH AN AURA OF A BETTER LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Mass., N.Y.)  (js) 
 BY WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Social betterment may be a universal impulse, but Americans have
always taken the pursuit to a new level. Even in the 1750s, the
colonists eking out a living in Deerfield, Mass., were also busily
trying to improve themselves morally, intellectually and materially
_ between Indian raids and harvests, that is. We see this in
``Pursuing Refinement in Rural New England: 1750-1850,'' an
exhibition at the Flynt Center of Early New England Life, a new
museum run by Historic Deerfield that opens to the public Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The center is named for the Henry N. Flynt family of Greenwich,
Conn., which helped to save and restore 14 historic houses on
Deerfield's mile-long, tree-lined Main Street over the last 40
years. For the new center, situated in a field behind Main Street,
a Philadelphia architect, Tony Junker of Ueland Junker McCauley
Nicholson, designed a 27,000-square-foot building that looks like a
nearby Colonial tobacco barn. It is the color of the local
sandstone.
</P>
<P>
   For the new show, the curator of Historic Deerfield, Philip Zea,
was able to cull from Deerfield's 22,000 objects a number of
consumer goods that were especially prized at the time. They range
from fancy imported goods, like a man's salmon-colored silk
waistcoat from England, a porcelain soup tureen from China and
mirrors from northern Europe, to local wares: skillful
interpretations of high-style Boston furniture, silver tankards and
pewter teapots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to show the way they really were,'' Zea said. ``And
why they placed so much importance on education, polite
conversation, manners and fancy goods.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, it's hard to imagine the isolation of the early settlers.
Leigh Keno, a Manhattan dealer who specializes in fine American
antiques, said: ``You have to remember _ Deerfield was 105 miles
from Boston, the center of the universe, the source of style and
fashion. It was a four-day trip by carriage, and it wasn't an
inexpensive trip.'' Were the settlers who acquired the games
tables, teapots, pianos and Chinese export porcelains _ all
evidence of leisure time _ social climbers?
</P>
<P>
   No, said Richard Bushman, a history professor at Columbia
University and author of ``The Refinement of America: Persons,
Houses, Cities'' (Knopf, 1992), the book that inspired the
exhibition. ``These objects represented a higher way of life, a
step up from the barbarians,'' he said. ``They also thought of law,
science, morality and even manners as evolving from this way of
living.''
</P>
<P>
   Bushman said: ``This whole culture was a culture of
presentation. Not that they were big-time entertainers _ they
weren't _ but there was an indication that you had cultivation if
you participated in the higher things in life.'' (Is this any
different from attending the opera once a year, today?)
</P>
<P>
   The yearning for refinement was felt at all levels of society.
At the top there were the rural elite, known as the ``mansion
people'' in western Massachusetts: magistrates, merchants,
ministers and militia officers. One of them, John Worthington
(1719-1800), ordered for his marriage the silver-embroidered salmon
waistcoat that is in the show.
</P>
<P>
   They were resilient, too. One minister, the Rev. John Williams
(1664-1729), was kidnapped by Indians with others in his
congregation during the famous 1704 attack on Deerfield. They were
taken to Canada. In 1707, after he was released in a prisoner
exchange, what did he do? As we see in the show, he commissioned
his portrait, at a time when only 2 percent of the population had
their portraits painted.
</P>
<P>
   The urge for refinement extended to society's lowest levels.
``Everyone had a little something,'' Bushman said. ``They would
start with a silver teaspoon or a teacup, then move on.''

</P>
<P>
   When you realize how rare and precious each bolt of silk or
silver teapot was, you approach auctions and fairs with a fresh
eye. For example, you will look differently at the Early American
needlework, textiles and hooked rugs at the Decorative Arts and
Textiles Antiques Show this weekend. The Stella show begins Friday,
running from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m., and continues through 5 p.m. Sunday
at the Gramercy Park Armory in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Dodge of Montague Center, Mass., has a child's quilt, a
white-on-white Marseilles example from 1850, at the show. He
recently sold a woman's pocket _ the precursor of today's
pocketbook _ not unlike the one in the show at Deerfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman's pocket was an extension of her self-worth, pride and
fine skill with a needle,'' Zea writes in the catalog. ``She tied
it around her waist as a separate workbag rather than sewing it
into the lining of her gown. Pockets held personal items.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Ziegler of Epping, N.H., is selling a hand-loomed,
multicolored runner at the show. Rugs were another opportunity to
show off one's skills. The Deerfield show has a circa-1825 wool and
linen rug that won a $1 cash prize in 1825 for its design.
</P>
<P>
   The coming auctions also feature objects that would have been
valued in Colonial times in Deerfield.
</P>
<P>
   One unusual cherry high chest in Christie's American furniture
sale on Oct. 8 is thought to have been made in Connecticut or
Massachusetts between 1730 and 1750. Instead of a bonnet top or a
flat top, it has three stepped shelves on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is extremely rare to have a high chest with its original
steps,'' said Martha Willoughby, an American furniture specialist
at Christie's. ``The form has no English precedents. The steps were
meant to display china, to show off one's exotic imports from the
East.'' Estimate: $60,000 to $90,000.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's Fine Americana sale on Oct. 10 includes several pieces
that ``mansion people'' would have coveted. Lot 320 is a Queen Anne
cherry scallop-top dressing table made in Connecticut about 1740 to
1760. Leslie Keno of Sotheby's (Leigh Keno's brother) said the
extremely wavy curve of the overhanging scalloped top was a feature
of Connecticut River Valley furniture. ``To my knowledge, this
extreme degree of scalloping would not appear in England,'' he
said. ``It's purely American. The interplay of S-curves makes the
piece come alive.'' Estimate: $60,000 to $90,000.
</P>
<P>
   Such pieces approach the apex of what New England colonists
considered refinement. It is a pity that Historic Deerfield does
not collect the artifacts of the settlers' Indian neighbors. In its
American Indian art sale in Boston on Oct. 3, Skinner is selling a
pair of exquisite Iroquois women's moccasins, made in New England,
that are tanned, beaded, stitched and intricately decorated with
porcupine quills colored red, yellow and blue. The lower part of
the design on the cuff is geometric and may represent a flowing
stream, said Lori Nevins, a Skinner specialist. Estimate: $8,000 to
$10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner also has a round birch-bark box from the Micmac tribe of
Maine. The tan, gray and white cover is designed with motifs
abstracted from nature that are pieced out in quillwork in
repeating geometric devices. Estimate: $1,800 to $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Historic Deerfield should peek outside the stockade in
examining refinement in rural New England.

   &UR; NATIONAL FORECAST for Friday, September 25, 1998. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Hurricane Georges wobbled into the open waters off the
north coast of Cuba, after spending nearly 18 hours over land.
After the interaction with land greatly disrupted the hurricane's
circulation, high resolution satellite images revealed a
strengthening trend as the storm drew warmth and moisture from the
tepid waters of the Florida Straits.
</P>
<P>
   Further strengthening is expected Friday, as Hurricane Georges
batters the Florida Keys and parts of South Florida with tropical
squalls and gusty winds. Tides will run several feet above normal,
especially in the Keys. Extensive flooding and overwash on Highway
One, which links the Keys with south Florida, is anticipated.
Hurricane force winds will occur within 50 miles of the storm's
center, primarily on its northern flank. Hurricane Georges will
reach the eastern Gulf of Mexico Friday afternoon, then continue on
a west-northwest to northwest path into Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Milder winds will develop over the Northeast and Middle Atlantic
States. A weakening disturbance will generate plenty of clouds, but
only a couple of showers are possible near the central
Appalachians. Overall, it will be much duller than Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A weak cold preceded by patchy showers will slice through the
Great Lakes into the central Plains. Scattered thunderstorms will
be triggered in the warm air ahead of the front in the western Ohio
valley.
</P>
<P>
   The Northwest will be unsettled as a vigorous jet stream
disturbance approaches. Clouds and showers will be abundant from
the northern Rockies to the Washington Coast. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Focus: Crowded Atlantic &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Late on Wednesday, Tropical Storm Karl swirled to life 320 miles
east-northeast of the island of Bermuda in an already crowded
Atlantic Ocean. At the same time, Hurricane Georges was battering
Cuba, while Hurricane Ivan was heading northward over the eastern
Atlantic, and Hurricane Jeanne was strengthening west of the Cape
Verde Islands. This marks only the third time since the formal
naming of tropical cyclones began in 1953 that four named tropical
storms or hurricane have roamed the Atlantic Ocean simultaneously.
The record of four was first set in 1961 before being tied in 1995
and now in 1998.

`COLD WAR': FROM THE BOLSHEVIKS TO THE BERLIN WALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(lh) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A history of the Cold War, which ran for close to half a century
and was played out on several continents, is no small undertaking.
In recognition of the subject's scope, CNN's new series allows it
24 episodes, one a week beginning on Sunday with an introduction to
Soviet-American relations and concluding next spring with the fall
of the Berlin Wall. It's an ambitiously conceived, intelligently
executed project.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the main events, like the Berlin airlift, the Cuban
missile crisis and, of course, the Vietnam War have been treated
before on television, but they are infused with fresh drama by
newly unearthed and reconstructed newsreels, demonstrating once
again the ingenuity of enterprising researchers.
</P>
<P>
   An international team of historians has guided the producers in
getting the story, as British co-executive producer Jeremy Isaacs
puts it, ``roughly right,'' no small aspiration given so
wide-ranging and contentious a matter. They are abetted by hundreds
of interviews with important players, including former heads of
state, and the complex narrative is sharply written by the likes of
Neal Ascherson, Ian Buruma, Germaine Greer and William Shawcross
and delivered as effectively as you'd expect by Kenneth Branagh.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night's opening hour begins with the Bolshevik Revolution
and the brief intrusion by U.S. and British troops on the side of
the White Russian counter-revolutionaries, signaling what would
prove to be decades of mutual suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   The uneasy World War II alliance against Germany having ended
with a divided Europe, the Cold War more or less officially starts
next week with Winston Churchill's resounding Fulton, Mo., speech:
``From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an Iron
Curtain has descended across the Continent.''
</P>
<P>
   As the subsequent episodes demonstrate, Churchill's imagery was,
if anything, modest. The chronicle carries us briskly through the
Marshall Plan and the Korean War; the rise of Joseph McCarthy and
the death of Joseph Stalin; the West's political commotions of the
1960's and the crushing of independence movements in Eastern
Europe. Hot wars in the Middle East, Africa and Latin America are
seen from a Cold War perspective.
</P>
<P>
   The chapters overlap, the themes are adroitly interwoven. Events
have moved so fast that the maneuverings over nuclear power, which
shadowed all Cold War calculations, now seem like ancient history,
and Mikhail Gorbachev, who presided over the breakup of what Ronald
Reagan memorably called an ``evil empire,'' seems almost a marginal
figure. Yet the half-century legacy of the Cold War continues to
reverberate in a shaky Russia and a United States trying to sort
out its responsibilities in a newly perplexing world.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers will have no trouble taking exception to the series'
slant on matters that have not lost their powers of controversy,
whether it be over Vietnam or Nicaragua or Star Wars, or, indeed,
the question of which side did more to incite the Cold War in the
first place. Nothing here is likely to put such disputes to rest,
(the judgments are pretty much mainstream American history). But as
an effort to give coherence and drama to the great ideological
conflict of our time, ``Cold War'' is an estimable television
achievement.

MAKING THE MOVE TO SECOND GRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday Oct. 1)  
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There we were, all the second-grade parents, sitting in those
Lilliputian chairs with our knees jammed up against the desks.
</P>
<P>
   It was curriculum night at Knight Elementary, and we were
getting a peek into the world our children inhabit when we drop
them off at 7:50 each morning.
</P>
<P>
   Our son's teacher, a grandmotherly steel magnolia who has been
teaching elementary school for 35 years, was explaining the
proposed topics for this semester.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of the first unit's work _ a hand-colored map of the
continents, math work sheets, a ``night writer'' journal and the
reading text _ were on top of each desk. Each child had drawn their
house on top of their folder.
</P>
<P>
   Adam had done a fair rendition of our new home on yellow
construction paper, with birds in the sky and smoke coming from the
chimney, although the second floor had a medieval turret coming out
of the roof that I didn't remember seeing the last time I looked.
</P>
<P>
   In science, the class was learning the difference between Alive,
Not Alive and Once Living. Beside the example of Alive (a fish),
Adam had drawn a shark, a bat and a ``wall'' (whale). So far, so
good.
</P>
<P>
   Beside the example for Not Alive (a car), he had drawn a jet, a
ship and a car. OK, well, a little redundant, but at least his car
was green.
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting part, though, was his take on Once Living:
Godzilla, a log, a feather, and a long rectangle with a fluffy
thing at the top and a stick figure frantically waving his arms
next to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A flower in vase?'' his teacher had written beside it,
optimistically.
</P>
<P>
   I thought not. But I had to ask when we got home just to be
sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``A flower in a vase?'' Adam repeated, with disdain. ``That's a
guy in a building that was blown up. You know, Once Living. He's
not living anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Yep. I thought so. We'll just leave that as ``flower in vase''
in the teacher's book.
</P>
<P>
   During curriculum night, we also learned there would be 15 new
spelling words a week.
</P>
<P>
   The D'Nealian handwriting method would be used, to make the
transition to script easier. And, of course, there would be weekly
visits to the new computer lab, which will eventually make the
aforementioned handwriting drills obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   (This is the Class of 2008, after all, which will be doing high
school term papers by linking Web pages.)
</P>
<P>
   A collective gasp went up when we realized our 7 and 8 year
olds, just a few years out of nap time and finger paints, would be
receiving number and letter grades this year.
</P>
<P>
   The grading scale was the strict one: A, 92 to 100; B, 83 to 91;
C, 74 to 82; D, 70 to 73; U, 69 and below. I have never understood
this scale. Why do A, B and C have nine-point windows of
opportunity, while D has a narrow four-point window, and U has a
69-point football field?
</P>
<P>
   I've always preferred the rounder, more friendly 90 to 100, 80
to 89, 70 to 79 and 60 to 69, myself. U still covers a lot of
ground, but at least you have four 10-point cushions before you get
there.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the evening grew on, I warmed to the idea. If this is
the scale they'll have in middle and high school, why not start
now?
</P>
<P>
   At least they'll be used to it. This, of course, was before my
son brought home the math test where he missed two problems and got
an 82.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way,'' I said to my husband, after the kids were asleep,
``do you miss two problems and get a C.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You do when there are only 11 problems on the test,'' Jim
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But look at how well he did on these nine. And he only missed
this problem by one, because he miscounted the fish. Hey, look at
this, one of the fish is hiding behind a log. That's not math. It's
underwater surveillance,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only one math paper,'' said my husband, with irritating
logic, as I kept looking for more dirty tricks on the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want him to get an image of himself as a C student,''
I said. ``Labels start young, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   I was starting to feel real antipathy for that renegade fish,
lurking in the seaweed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Adam will rally with self-esteem intact,'' Jim said.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, he got 100 on the next spelling test, and I was
slightly reassured. I put the paper on the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, Charlie. Tuna casserole for everyone, tonight.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ You take a 3-year-old to a ball game at your peril.
That's what I heard. I had waited until my daughter was 5 before
escorting her to her first game. But with second children, things
always feel accelerated. My son had seen Eddie Murphy in ``Dr.
Dolittle.'' He laughed at the questionable jokes.
</P>
<P>
   It was time for a game. Friends told me I was mad. He will not
last to the second inning, one warned. And worse, said another, you
will never see the game.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they were right. Perhaps I was pushing the child,
playing Leopold Mozart to my son's Wolfgang: ``Explain the infield
fly rule, boy!''
</P>
<P>
   But then I thought of all those little children you see on
television during games, sitting on the laps of their moms and
dads, wearing baseball caps that are about eight sizes too large
and clutching in their slender arms souvenir drink cups, pennants
and mascot teddy bears. And those were for night games. I was
thinking of a Sunday afternoon. Those children appeared to be
well-adjusted. Why not mine?
</P>
<P>
   I lowered my expectations. Two innings would be fine, I
reasoned. Three would be a triumph. Never mind how long we stay; we
will go to a game. He will see the great expanse of outfield green.
He will hear the crack of ball against bat. He will eat a lot of
bad food.
</P>
<P>
   So there we sat, in the upper deck of Yankee Stadium in the
Bronx: Jake, my son; Eliza, my daughter, and I. My wife, for whom
sports events hold all the appeal of a sea voyage in steerage,
begged off.
</P>
<P>
   We were joined by friends, Tommy and his son, Clayton, who at 4
had been to half a dozen ball games and would serve, I decided, as
the essential peer influence should Jake weaken and decide it was
time to go. (``Leave now? Before hitting up the old man for an
autographed baseball complete with its own display stand? Sit.'')
</P>
<P>
   I took along 10 apple juice packs. I bought popcorn, fries,
chicken fingers, a big pretzel and a hot dog at the stadium. All
this before the first pitch. We arrived for the tail end of batting
practice, with no less a show than Darryl Strawberry driving tee
shots into the bleachers. What a moment, I thought, for a quick
lesson on the rudiments of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy tries to hit the ball with his bat, Jake,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   My son turned to me with wide and innocent eyes and replied:
``Daddy, look. The sky is light blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Pity the poor Upper West Side parent who can let no event pass
without the search for meaning. The first baseball game is no
exception. My son was, after all, already a veteran of two New York
Liberty games. (These events are made far more accessible to young
children by the halftime and time-out shows, including one with the
dog who catches 100 frisbees.) But baseball games are different, if
only because they come with history, communal and personal.
</P>
<P>
   A first game is a rite of sorts, a formal induction into the
world of fandom. At the risk of sounding a bit too much like George
Will (``Did you see how he lay down that sacrifice bunt, my child?
That is America at its best''), first games with our children
inevitably evoke memories of first games with our parents.
</P>
<P>
   I was 9 on the Saturday morning my father suggested that my
brother and I head out to the Polo Grounds and see the Mets. This
was 1962, and I believe the Dodgers beat them, 10 to 3. And, yes, I
remember the first view of the endless and dazzling green of the
outfield and how everything else around us felt very dark and old.
</P>
<P>
   Now on the way to the ball park, I asked my daughter, who is 8,
what she remembered about her first game. ``How hot it was in the
sun and how you told me not to get ice cream because it would melt
and that I should wait until we move to the shade,'' she said.
``How you were rude to those people when you asked if we could move
to closer seats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you know I gave that usher $10 so we could sit in those
seats?'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   I once asked Carl Erskine, my father's contemporary who pitched
for the great Brooklyn Dodger teams of the 1950s, what he
remembered about his first game.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled how he and his family got up early for the long
drive to Crosley Field in Cincinnati, how they arrived just as the
players were arriving, how the players arrived by taxi and how they
looked ``sharp'' in jackets and ties. His family arrived before the
big iron gate opened, he said, because his father always liked to
be early.
</P>
<P>
   There, at the center of this 60-year-old memory, was his father,
just as I can recall my own father, standing between us. I suspect
that we would all like to believe that our children will remember
us at moments such as these, even if that memory is about our being
too aggressive in finding better seats.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot imagine what my son will recall from his first game. I
suspect that it will have little to do with the game itself. By the
second inning, he and Clayton were playing with dinosaurs. Hint:
pack more toys than you think you can carry _ and talking role
models.
</P>
<P>
   My daughter joined in the grown-up chitchat, offering such
asides as: ``Babe Ruth? The fat guy?''
</P>
<P>
   We were still there in the third inning. And the fifth. And on
through ``Take Me Out to the Ball Game'' and the seventh-inning
stretch. Miracle of miracles. Then Jake decided we needed to eat.
The ice cream man was nowhere to be found.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, at this point, had cut a three-run Kansas City lead
to one and were poised to tie. No matter. I searched the aisles,
knowing that an ice cream bar, consumed in our shady perch, could
take me to the bottom of the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   The final, crucial innings of a 3-year-old's first ball game
recall Jon Krakauer's description of the final push to the summit
of Mount Everest: it is no longer a matter of skill but of
endurance.
</P>
<P>
   And timing. The ice cream man appeared. I called to him, as if
screaming for oxygen. He saw me and offered one final challenge.
Not for this vendor the simple passing of high-priced snacks. No,
he had to throw. I signaled for four. The dad in front of us
offered his son's mitt. I liked my chances better barehanded.
</P>
<P>
   They came flying. Butterfingers that I am, I could not afford an
error. And like the great team playing before me, I committed none.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees tied and went on to win. And as Mariano Rivera
punched out the final Kansas City batter, there sat Jake, having
gone the distance, a complete game first time out.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' he said, ``was great.'' What ``that'' was, however,
was not clear. Still, he was happy, and that was enough.
</P>
<P>
   Or almost. With ritual comes the desire to believe that the
memory of the event will endure. So risking the worst sort of
sentimentality, I found myself imagining a conversation, 50 years
hence, between my daughter and son.
</P>
<P>
   My daughter asks her brother: ``Do you remember when Dad took us
to see the '98 Yankees? You remember, Tino, Cone and Derek Jeter?''
</P>
<P>
   My son, now middle-aged and trying to recall memories of an age
when recollections come only in bits and pieces, smiles and
replies, ``Wasn't that the time he had to catch all that ice
cream?''
</P>

FEMINIST ORGANIZATIONS COME TO CLINTON'S DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Leaders of prominent feminist organizations joined
forces Thursday to decry the role of President Clinton in the White
House sex scandal but to urge that he not be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``While women are angry and do not condone his conduct, women
want President Clinton to remain in office,'' 12 feminist
organizations declared in a joint statement. ``We believe, and the
women of this nation concur, that Mr. Clinton's actions are not
impeachable.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Ireland, the president of the National Organization for
Women, told a news conference that while she was offended by the
president's behavior, ``it does not rise to the level of
impeachable offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Pioneering feminist activist Betty Friedan joined in, saying:
``It does not serve women to try to hound this president out of
office on charges of sexual misdoing.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``I fear that we are on the brink of an era of sexual
McCarthyism.''
</P>
<P>
   The group _ which also includes Eleanor Smeal, president of the
Feminist Majority, Dolores Huerta, co-founder of the United Farm
Workers, and Yvonne Scruggs-Leftwich, executive director of the
Black Leadership Forum _ called on their supporters to press their
elected officials to oppose Clinton's removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   The women said Clinton has done more for women's rights than any
modern president, despite his alleged crimes and admitted sexual
misdeeds with a young intern in his employ.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we allow this (impeachment) process to continue,'' said
Kathy Rodgers, the executive director of the NOW Legal Defense and
Education Fund, ``the interests of women in particular will be
buried in the muck for generations to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Smeal warned that the sex scandal threatens to depress female
voter turnout in the Nov. 3 off-year congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not allow our disgust or disillusionment to keep women
from the polls in November,'' Smeal said.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the spokeswomen expressed concern about three Senate
races in which the female incumbents _ Sens. Barbara Boxer,
D-Calif., Carol Moseley-Braun, D-Ill., and Patty Murray, D-Wash. _
face tough fights. The three were voted into the Senate in 1992,
which feminists dubbed the Year of Women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We risk not only losing the gains of the Year of Women in 1992
in the 1998 congressional elections, but we risk years of
reactionary control of both Houses of Congress and perhaps the
presidency itself,'' Smeal said.
</P>
<P>
   If the three women senators lost their seats and if the
Republican majority in the Senate increased from its current 55
seats, Clinton's veto power would be diminished because of the
greater likelihood that his political foes could muster the 66
votes needed to override.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's veto of a bill banning late-term abortions was
sustained by only three votes in the Senate last week.
</P>
<P>
   The feminist leaders said their show of support for Clinton was
not coordinated with the White House or with the Democratic
National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Other organizations that signed the joint statement of support
for Clinton were: the National Council of Negro Women; the National
Council of Women's Organizations; the National Asian Pacific Legal
Consortium; Black Women United for Action; Wider Opportunities for
Women; the Black Leadership Forum; and the Women's Institute for
Freedom of the Press.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee will vote in early October on
whether to recommend that the House authorize an impeachment
investigation against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Any such probe would be based on Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr's 445-page report that centers around Clinton's affair with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and alleges 11 possible
grounds for impeachment, including allegations of perjury,
obstruction of justice, witness tampering and abuse of power in an
effort to conceal the relationship.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two years ago, the National Theater of Greece came to
New York with a whirling, incantatory ``Electra,'' so throbbingly
alive you could hear its heartbeat. The company has returned to
town, and this time has cooled things off considerably, importing a
severe new version of ``Medea'' that puts much more stock in a
display of style than the delivery of substance.
</P>
<P>
   The production, which opened on Wednesday night at City Center
and runs through Sunday, replaces life's blood with ice water.
Although it is performed in modern Greek with English supertitles,
and is populated by characters from Corinth and Athens, the look
and feel suggest an art film from Scandinavia. No doubt, on its
second visit the troupe, led by the director Niketi Kontouri,
wanted to show off other colors. But did so many of them have to be
shades of white?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kontouri's handiwork is admirably disciplined; there is not
a hair out of place, not a stylized gesture wasted in a two-hour
presentation that is closer in spirit to performance art or dance.
The actors are technically accomplished yet impassive; they strike
attitudes rather than express depth. The audience is deliberately
prevented from feeling much toward the characters; and although the
English translation is absolutely clear, the story has little power
to penetrate, to shock. It all passes in a fitful pageant,
beautiful in spite of the tale's ugliness.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Medea,'' in fact, featuring the exotic Karyofyllia
Karabeti in the demanding title role, is never less than visually
arresting. The 12 women of Corinth, wearing helmets of white fabric
that give them the appearance of mummified soldiers, strike
dramatic poses as the lighting bisects them at odd angles. Other
times, they make bird noises as they stretch long elastic bands
around the keening Ms. Karabeti, who wears a knit dress with a red
train and a streak of makeup of identical color through her hair
and down her forehead. The elastic bands are extensions of the
ocher-colored backdrop, which divides into dozens of flexible,
vertical strips, suspended and separable like the strings of a
harp.
</P>
<P>
   These interior-decorator touches are tasteful, but their
function is far from clear in the story of a betrayed wife who
horrifically takes revenge on her unfaithful husband by slaying
their children. Among 44 classical plays that survive, ``Medea'' is
one of the starkest and most wildly emotive, a relentless descent
to the slaughterhouse, and its central role is a magnet for
powerhouse actresses: Diana Rigg and Zoe Caldwell are among the
performers who've made a triumph of it in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Kontouri seems uninterested in any dramatic buildup. Her
ideas are cerebral, yes, and also intentionally uninvolving. That
Medea's sons are disappointingly represented by a pair of life-size
dolls (white, naturally) provides a sense of the emotional remove
at which the director keeps us. And the play's staging is so
formalized as to seem part of a legal proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   For long stretches, characters walk out, plant themselves center
stage and recite, a routine that reinforces a static tendency in
the script. One advantage, though, is that the eye is freed to
linger over the titles projected on the screen above the stage,
because rarely does anything move below.
</P>
<P>
   The striking Ms. Karabeti, as angular and balletic as a flamenco
dancer, is by far the most watchable aspect of this ``Medea''
(pronounced in Greek, by the way, as MEE-dee-ah). Her grace and
beauty may not be apparent to her brutish lout of a husband Jason
(Lazaros Georgakapoulos), given to utterances like ``It's natural
for a woman to be angry when her husband is marrying again,'' but
we know a domestic goddess when we see one. Ms. Karabeti beats her
breast, collapses artfully like a broken bird and stares angrily
into the middle distance, announcing her defeat _ ``I'm utterly
destroyed!'' she says, in a hundred different ways _ while planning
her macabre victory.
</P>
<P>
   Still, unlike the devastating London-born ``Electra'' now
running at the McCarter Theater in Princeton, N.J., ``Medea''
betrays no authentic sense of human toll. The actors talk until
they stop, and we, in the end, aren't the wiser.

 &HT;    A sporting tome of too much OT, not enough holding
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL SEPTEMBER 27: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Carolyn Nizzi Warmbold
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was not by accident that God created the world in the shape
of a ball,'' writes Dixie Gibbs, coach's wife. ``As a girl, when I
watched men pass the pigskin, pitch the curveball, perfect the jump
shot, I understood that they were playing war. What I didn't
understand was that it wasn't just a stupid ball they held in their
hands, but the whole world being tossed about from man to man _
like a game of keep away. From me.''
</P>
<P>
   Dixie, who gives new meaning to the term ``football widow,''
learns that lesson the hard way. She drops out of college to marry
Mac Gibbs, star quarterback at Birmingham University who becomes a
high school coach in Beasley, Ala. Thus begins a life mostly minus
Mac, especially after he is hired as quarterback coach at his alma
mater, ``Ham U.'' He's so busy that she raises their two kids
alone, and it only gets worse after he is named head coach,
replacing the legendary Catfish Bomar. The Gibbses move into a big
house where her job is to throw lavish parties after each game.
Looking at the detritus from one of these shindigs, she feels as if
she has ``given a moving performance ... It's a Scarlett O'Hara
moment.'' And we all know how Scarlett's marriages turned out. The
Gibbses' love and Mac's career travel roads that are rockier than a
1-10 season.
</P>
<P>
   This comic novel with a serious heart is ingeniously told
through alternating women's narratives: those of mothers, sisters
and especially coaching wives whom Dixie befriends over the years.
There are perhaps too many undifferentiated voices, but author
Nanci Kincaid's experience as the spouse of two college football
coaches (her present husband is the head football coach at the
University of Arizona) makes the story ring true. More important,
Kincaid is a master of nuance and timing. When you least expect it,
her characters come up with gems: ``There's something interesting
about boys who're willing to give up their names and become numbers
for a night,'' Dixie muses as she drives a bevy of high school
cheerleaders to a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Balls'' is a defining Southern book that is not afraid to
discuss race or religion or what it's like to be a woman in a man's
world. Read it, laugh and file it on your shelf right next to ``The
Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.''
</P>
<P>
   Balls. By Nanci Kincaid. Algonquin. $21.95.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A winning comic novel with a serious heart.

 &HT;    Ronin: A crackling action-suspense-thriller that's fun and
smart.
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The title ``Ronin'' suggests an old Japanese monster movie.
``Ronin Meets Godzilla'' or ``Rodan vs. Ronin.''
</P>
<P>
   The name is Japanese, all right, but it refers to debased
heroes, not inflated monsters. The ronin were shamed Japanese
samurai who had failed to defend their liege. Now masterless, they
were fated to roam the countryside as mercenaries, hiring out their
talents to whomever could pay them.
</P>
<P>
   The ``ronin'' in John Frankenheimer's crackling action-suspense
film are modern-day warriors. Formerly employed by the CIA or the
KGB _ or whoever _ they too are masterless now that the Cold War is
over. And they too are for hire.
</P>
<P>
   A multinational team of specialists _ Robert De Niro, Jean Reno,
Stellan Skarsgard (``Good Will Hunting'') and Sean Bean _ are
brought together by a young Irish woman (Natascha McElhone) working
for a mysterious boss (Jonathan Pryce). Their assignment, complete
with a Hitchcockian twist, is to retrieve a suitcase that has
become the object of a deadly cat-and-mouse game between Irish
terrorists and the Russian mafia.
</P>
<P>
   Frankenheimer tosses in some other Hitchcock touches as well:
the glamorous locations (Paris, the French Riviera); the action
scene that takes place at a well-known French landmark (the ancient
arena at Arles); the cool, keep-your-eyes-open professionalism
that's lacking in so many of today's paper-thin action-suspensers.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the movie is pure Frankenheimer. As in his famous
``The Manchurian Candidate,'' there's an important scene about the
whereabouts of a hidden sniper. The ``Grand Prix'' master also
treats us to two car chases _ one through the narrow, twisting
roads in and around Nice, the other through the heart of Paris,
including several omigosh dives into the city's crowded underground
tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   David Mamet's script _ he did the rewrite under a pseudonym _ is
a canny match for Frankenheimer's bold, self-assured visual style.
Asked if he's ever killed anyone, De Niro's character shrugs and
says, ``I hurt somebody's feelings once.'' And there's even a
terse, not-dwelt-upon moral. Sure, these people are in it for the
money, but they're also in it for something more. Something that
has to do with honor. And pride.
</P>
<P>
   By the time ``Ronin'' is all over, you may realize that it
doesn't necessarily all add up and that we don't really know much
more about the characters than we did at the beginning. But a great
ride is a great ride. And that's what ``Ronin'' gives us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronin''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robert De Niro and Jean Reno. Directed by John Franken-
</P>
<P>
   heimer. Rated R for language and violence. At metro theaters. 1
hour, 58 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Solid, smart and entertaining.

 &HT;    Country sensation Shania Twain has jolted a genre while making a
big splash in pop mainstream
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everybody's got a bead drawn on Shania Twain.
</P>
<P>
   Let's get the checklist.
</P>
<P>
   She's the woman who _ thanks to her affection for hip-huggers
and midriff-exposing tops _ introduced the bellybutton to country
music.
</P>
<P>
   And though she thought herself homely as a child, Twain's
fashion-runway poise and wholesome, shapely good looks marked the
arrival of ``centerfold country'' made popular by singers suspected
to have been former spokesmodels.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old Canadian vocalist, who performs Saturday in
Atlanta on her first-ever tour, has been dubbed ``Country Spice''
by one tweaky rock critic, but her appeal is more than skin deep.
Record sales of more than 14 million speak to that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems natural at the moment, but it's hard to emphasize how
revolutionary this was, even a couple of years ago,'' says Bruce
Feiler, author of ``Dreaming Out Loud: Garth Brooks, Wynonna Judd,
Wade Hayes and the Changing Face of Nashville'' (Avon). ``Earlier
in the decade, you had Wynonna, Reba McEntire, Mary Chapin
Carpenter, all big, strong women. But Shania has brought sass and
sex into a pretty slow-changing genre. What Garth did was define
the country male persona as a huggable cowboy in a hat. Shania has
defined the female persona as an edgy woman with attitude. In the
way that Garth signaled the rise of the hunk, Shania signaled the
rise of the country babe.''
</P>
<P>
   Twain, who was not available for an interview, is married to
longtime rock 'n' roll producer Robert John ``Mutt'' Lange, who
made his reputation with hit pop and hard-rock albums by the Cars,
Bryan Adams, Def Leppard and AC/DC. Because of her husband's
influence (he shares credit on all of her songs), the implication
has been that the albums the couple has collaborated on, ``The
Woman in Me'' and ``Come on Over'' (both Mercury), are thinly
disguised Def Leppard epics that have been genetically (pro-woman
themes) and generically (a nod or two to country conventions, like
fiddles and corny double-entendres) altered to fool the faithful.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicious minds want to know: Can she really sing?
</P>
<P>
   ``As it turns out, (Twain) has a perfectly serviceable, if
unremarkable voice,'' wrote free-lance critic John T. Davis in the
Austin American-Statesman after a recent concert. ``That, combined
with a formidable store of energy, an ironclad determination to
ingratiate herself with the audience and a pre-existing string of
country and pop radio and video hits, was all Twain needed to keep
the crowd on its feet through much of a show that weighed in at two
hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as on her wildly successful videos, Twain in person
projected a sort of unthreatening, PG-rated sexuality that kept the
guys rapt without ever threatening the women who determine which
records sell best in today's country music marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   We don't want romance, / We only wanna dance, / We're gonna let
our hair hang down,'' she sings on the party anthem ``Man! I Feel
Like a Woman!'' Elsewhere on ``Come on Over,'' Twain's third and
latest album, the singer asserts her post-feminist independence,
counseling a would-be swain that ``If You Wanna Touch Her, Ask!''
and, on ``Honey, I'm Home,'' enjoying some role reversal: ``Honey,
I'm home and I had a hard day. / Pour me a cold one and, oh, by the
way, / Rub my feet, gimme something to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   By virtue of her success and the nature of it, however, Twain
has caused controversy. But it may simply be that she's been
misappreciated because she launched her career as a country singer
and then became bigger than the genre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is she a valid pop artist? Without a doubt,'' says Chris
Marino, the Nashville-based Americana editor for the radio trade
journal The Gavin Report. ``A lot of country stations resent that.
They fostered this woman's career, and she sort of leaves. But she
is what she is, and she's a pop star.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino, whose beat is the ever more populous crossroads where
country meets alternative rock, places Twain's stardom as part of a
larger trend: country artists unblinkingly accepted by mainstream
pop radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faith Hill, she's crossing over,'' he says. ``There's a really
huge, concerted effort right now to make Alan Jackson a pop star.
But they're so huge that they can transcend all sorts of barriers.
If (songwriter) Keiran Kane sang `I'll Go on Loving You' (Jackson's
new hit), they wouldn't even listen to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny,'' Marino continues. ``Country music's having a
tough time. The ratings are dropping all across the nation. So in
order for these record companies to sell huge numbers, they have to
take it to pop radio.''
</P>
<P>
   To millions of listeners cruising around between suburbia and
the sticks, though, there's no argument. ``You're Still the One,''
Twain's current single, is pure pop, a lilting ode to domestic
fidelity that is country mostly because of its theme _ and the
audience whose ideals, worries and shopping patterns it reflects.
The singer, whose crossover dreams come true on VH-1 and onstage
with big-time pop divas like Mariah Carey and Celine Dion, may not
be hip enough for Lilith Fair, but she's got a stronger link to the
demographics. ``Shania doesn't know what's going on in rural
Alabama,'' says Feiler, ``but she has a keen pop cultural sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The satellite dish is as much an accessory in the South as the
barbecue pit,'' he continues. ``Shania came to town and was who she
was and the moment was right for her.''
</P>
<P>
   TWAIN TIDBITS
</P>
<P>
   -- Born: Eileen Regina Edwards in Windsor, Ontario, on Aug. 28,
1965.
</P>
<P>
   -- Married: To record producer Robert John ``Mutt'' Lange, 46,
six months after meeting him in June 1993.
</P>
<P>
   -- Albums: ``Shania Twain'' (1993), ``The Woman in Me'' (1995),
``Come on Over'' (1997).
</P>
<P>
   -- How she got her stage name: It's an Ojibwa Indian word for
``on my way.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Dramatic true-life story: When Twain's parents died in a car
crash in 1987, she took responsibility for her four younger
siblings.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   -- On the (belly)button: ``Everyone and their brother bares
their bellybutton once in a while,'' the singer told writer Bruce

fun and quite clean.''
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Dollar, c. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   WHAT THE CRITICS SAY
</P>
<P>
   -- Chicago Sun Times: ``Opening with `Man! I Feel Like a Woman,'
Shania Twain strutted center stage and didn't hesitate to show off
a voice of stunning limitations.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Newsday: ``Music often seemed secondary at Twain's show. Her
songs are a Frankenstein's monster of pop, rock and country. ... It
was Twain's display of affection for the audience that ultimately
charged her show with enough energy to bring the crowd to its
feet.''
</P>
<P>
   -- The New York Times: ``Onstage, Twain was as skillful as she
needs to be. (She) placed herself at the center of a spectacle with
smoke bombs, motorized platforms and perpetually smiley musicians.
It's not a flexible or spontaneous show.''
</P>
<P>
   -- The Boston Herald: ``Twain could stand to let it rip more
often vocally.''
</P>
<P>
   -- The Boston Globe: Twain showed her inexperience at times _
she sounds better in the studio than onstage at this point _ but
she surely can't be accused of a lack of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Minneapolis Star Tribune: Twain was certainly pleasant,
well-meaning, attractive, but somehow just not that captivating.
Fun at parties, maybe, but kind of boring, and fairly graceless
over time.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Los Angeles Times: ``Twain showed she could handle all the
notes with ease and that the beauty in the videos wasn't just built
around careful camera angles. ... (But) what we're left with is
someone who, like so many artists in the '90s, has tapped into the
commercial momentum of country music but done little to enrich
it.''
</P>
<P>
   -- USA Today: ``Twain isn't a terribly polished performer, but
her overwhelming earnestness and honesty count for something. In
winning over the packed house _ which cheered her as if she were
Streisand _ those were her main weapons.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: Surest sign of autumn: Muscadines
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL SEPTEMBER 27: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   My neighbor Mr. James Bagwell said his muscadines are a sight,
and if my children and I hurry we can get in a picking before
they're gone.
</P>
<P>
   I started to explain the conflicts I have _ and they are many _
but I remembered the late summers of my childhood, when the Myers
children from across the creek and I got rich picking scuppernongs.
Five cents a quart they paid us, and, of course, all we could eat.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Bagwell, who is not only an experienced man of the soil but
a graduate of the University of Georgia ag school, undertook to
educate me.
</P>
<P>
   All these native grapes are muscadines. The golden ones got
named scuppernongs by some mishap, but they are still members of
the same dark purple family. Muscadines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bullaces,'' I put in. ``We called them bullaces at home.''
</P>
<P>
   He said they're still called that in South Georgia, but,
changing the subject, if my young'uns and I want some, come pick.
It's the best late summer-early fall invitation we've had since Roy
Wyatt got hold of a cider press and invited us over to press
apples.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I am partial to scuppernongs. I like the name. Some
say it was borrowed from a river in North Carolina. And I love the
sweet, tawny fruit. We had two ancient arbors at home. Grandmother
Sibley said she picked scuppernongs when she was a little girl, and
that was many, many long years before the Myerses and I came along.
</P>
<P>
   They always earmarked some for wine, which was made by an old
recipe handed down to the males in the family for generations. When
they ran out of males, they gave the recipe to the family doctor. I
often wonder what he did with it.
</P>
<P>
   The wine, a glorious golden brew, was saved for Thanksgiving and
Christmas and other ceremonial occasions. I remember that my
father, who was a teetotaler, broke out a bottle when the Mobile
boy I had been bringing to the country broke down and asked my hand
in marriage.
</P>
<P>
   To go to the Bagwells' and pick muscadines will be a suitable
beginning of fall for me. I remember that when the Myers children
and I scrambled over the scuppernong arbor, the opening of school
was imminent and there was almost always a hurricane brewing in the
gulf. Reliable signs of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have unmistakable signs in fields and woods. Goldenrod is
holding carnival in old waste places. Sweet gum trees wear bangles
of gold among their green leaves.
</P>
<P>
   The black walnut tree in my back yard is dropping its fruit in
the grass, where the power mower will beat me and the children to
it.
</P>
<P>
   The persimmon has produced bountifully. I've picked up one or
two of what Euell Gibbons called ``sugar plums,'' but not enough to
make a loaf of bread or a pudding, both wonderful dishes beholden
to the persimmon tree.
</P>
<P>
   White panicles of bloom on the ash tree are turning bronze, and
the dogwoods are suddenly no longer summertime green but veering
toward yellow and scarlet.
</P>
<P>
   Even the bittersweet berries by the chimney are turning from
green to gold, and a few have gone on to break open and spill their
bright red seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Now we will have muscadines to confirm the fall. I wonder if I
can get Mrs. Virginia Callaway's recipe for muscadine pie again.

 &HT;    `At the end of the day, that's what I am. A professional movie
director.'
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his 40-year career, John Frankenheimer has directed more than
150 television shows, as well as such classic films as ``The
Manchurian Candidate,'' ``Seven Days in May,'' ``Grand Prix,''
``Black Sunday'' and ``Birdman of Alcatraz.'' In this decade alone,
he's won four best director Emmys for his TV movies ``Against the
Wall,'' ``The Burning Season,'' ``Andersonville'' and, most
recently, ``George Wallace.''
</P>
<P>
   His new movie, ``Ronin,'' opens in theaters today. The title
refers to samurai who have lost their masters. Robert De Niro stars
as a former CIA agent who, now that the Cold War is over, has
become a gun for hire _ a ronin, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Frankenheimer, 68, recently spoke about his new movie and his
career from his home in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've won four Emmys in a row. Why leave television now and
return to features?
</P>
<P>
   A: I didn't want to go out of feature films with ``The Island of
Dr. Moreau'' as the last one I did. I'm better than that. I didn't
want everyone to say, ``He couldn't make it in features.'' I wanted
people to know I do TV because I want to, not because I have to. I
choose to do cable TV. It's not something I do just because I can't
play with the big boys.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why choose ``Ronin''?
</P>
<P>
   A: What I wanted to do on my next film was something that plays
into things I do well. I've always done that kind of serpentine,
things-aren't-what-they-appear-to-be material very well. Another
strong point for me were the car chases. In 1951, in my college
(Williams) yearbook, where it says things like ``most likely to
succeed,'' mine says ``highway menace.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is ``Ronin'' somehow a tribute to professionalism, to the
idea of doing your job regardless?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think it is. I really identify with the concept of
``Ronin.'' Picture my lord and master as being CBS television. When
they cut us all loose in 1960, we went out and earned our living
doing what we do. Which was directing. We became ronin.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could it also be said that professionalism is what your
career has been all about?
</P>
<P>
   A: At the end of the day, that's what I am. A professional movie
director. My definition of the difference between an amateur and a
professional is, an amateur does something only when he or she
wants to do it. A professional does it when he or she doesn't want
to do it. There are days when I haven't wanted to be on set, but I
go. I'm an amateur cook. An amateur race-car driver. An amateur
tennis player. But I am a professional movie director.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you worried that audiences won't understand the title?
</P>
<P>
   A: The title was the original writer's idea and I liked it. We
came up with other titles that we didn't like. And one advantage is
that it stays the same throughout the world. ``The Manchurian
Candidate'' became ``Un Crime dans la Tete'' (``A Crime in the
Head'') in France. So mention ``Manchurian Candidate'' in Paris,
and they don't know what you're talking about.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, I think it's up to the MGM marketing department to
explain the title through ads and TV spots. That way people won't
think they're going to see a picture where De Niro plays a guy
named Ronin.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You once told me that director Henry Hathaway came on your
first movie set and warned you that making one compromise a day
meant that, over 25 days, you'd made 25 compromises. Did you make
any compromises here?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not a one. Though maybe I'll look at something five years
from now and say that was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you remember the first time you saw or heard the phrase
``veteran director John Frankenheimer?''
</P>
<P>
   A: (Laughs.) I think it was about eight years ago. I hate the
term, but you just get over it. In the '50s, I was ``young
director.'' Then there was a window where I was just ``director.''
Then it's ``veteran.'' But that beats the alternative, which is
``former.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Any feelings about George Wallace dying the same night as the
Emmy Awards?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was really ironic. Almost eerie. We didn't know until
after we'd won and were at dinner. But I remember he told me, ``I
hope I live long enough to see it,'' and I said, ``I hope so too,
and I hope you like it.'' As it turned out, he loved it. He ran it
every day.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You made ``Andersonville'' in Georgia, just outside Newnan.
Any impressions of Georgia or Atlanta?
</P>
<P>
   A: Happy impressions. I loved shooting there. I loved the crew.
I loved where we lived. I loved Atlanta. I'm not just saying this
because I'm talking to an Atlanta newspaper, but if I didn't live
in Southern California, Atlanta is the only other place in the
States I might want to live. I love the climate. I love that they
play so much tennis. It doesn't have the intense claustrophobic
pressure that you find in New York or Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   There's a chance I'll be back next spring to shoot ``The Good
Shepherd.'' It's the best script I've ever read. By Eric Roth, the
guy who wrote ``Forrest Gump.'' It's the story of the first 20
years of the CIA, told through a family. Sort of a ``Godfather''
movie about the CIA. It takes place all along the East Coast, so
maybe we'll do something in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You had a close relationship with Bobby Kennedy. Have you
ever considered making a movie about him?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, but I haven't really got a handle on how to do it.
There've been so many good documentaries. There's so much film of
him available. What I'd like to do would be from JFK's death
through Bobby's death. That's the period that interests me. I saw
this man change before my eyes. I saw him become great. And that's
so hard to dramatize. Greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In 1991 you listed Martin Scorsese, Mike Nichols, Peter Weir
and, especially, Francis Ford Coppola as directors you admire. Any
new names?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'd have to add Anthony Minghella (``The English Patient'').
And James Cameron. Such an impressive job he did on ``Titanic.''
And Curtis Hanson (``L.A. Confidential''). I'm crazy about him.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is ``The Iceman Cometh'' still your favorite of your films?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't think so. I may be too close to it, but now ``George
Wallace'' is. And there are those who think ``Against the Wall'' is
the best thing I ever did.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's next?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm about to sign a long-term exclusive arrangement with TNT.
We're going to do a lot of stuff that I'm very excited about.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You once said that Fred Zinneman (the director of ``High
Noon,'' among other films) said that 65 to 75 were his best years.
How are they working out for you?
</P>
<P>
   A: So far, he's been right. So far, it's been a hell of a ride.
And I've got seven more years to go.''

 &HT;    Welcome sparks illuminate `Firelight'
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Firelight'' could use a little more fire and a lot lighter
touch.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this thoughtful period drama from writer-turned-director
William Nicholson (``Shadowlands'') has some very good things to
offer: a solid dramatic core, a half-dozen intriguing characters,
serious themes, passionate romance and a beautifully effective
evocation of the Victorian world of the 1830s.
</P>
<P>
   In a delicately mysterious prologue, a lovely young woman named
Elisabeth (Sophie Marceau) is undergoing an odd interrogation. An
older woman asks her questions fed to her by an unseen male behind
a screen. He wants to know her background (Swiss), her education
(drawing, French) and why she needs the money (to pay her father's
debts). An agreement is reached. Elisabeth will act as a surrogate
mother, bearing the anonymous man a child and handing it over,
along with any future claims on it. But during the three days the
two spend together, conducting their ``business,'' it slowly
becomes clear that both are more affected by their business partner
than either expected.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to seven years later. The child, a willful, sad brat named
Louisa (Dominique Belcourt), has the run of the baronial English
country house she shares with her doting father, Charles (Stephen
Dillane of ``Welcome to Sarajevo'').
</P>
<P>
   On a more obvious level, ``Firelight'' is a spin on the ``Jane
Eyre'' genre of Gothic romance. We have the handsome, imperious
master; the sensitive, loving servant; the inconvenient wife. But
the movie is actually about a different kind of bond, one between
parent and child.
</P>
<P>
   Charles' father (Joss Ackland, looking as if he stepped out of
``The Pickwick Papers'') is a party-loving spendthrift who neither
understands his responsible son nor cares to admit that he's
running through what's left of the family money.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there's Louisa and Elisabeth, the rebellious,
lonely child who so badly needs a mother and the reserved, loving
mother who cannot make herself known. Their battle of wills calls
to mind Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke in ``The Miracle Worker.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson is far too fond of swelling music and portentous looks
that slow the movie's pace. And a dollop of feminist wisdom blurted
out by Elisabeth to her charge is nice to hear but jarringly
anachronistic.
</P>
<P>
   Still, on the whole, ``Firelight'' burns with intelligence,
craft and psychological resonance. It's a movie that respects both
its characters and its audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Firelight''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sophie Marceau and Stephen Dillane. Directed by William
Nicholson. Rated R for brief sex and nudity. 1 hour, 44 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Smolders rather than burns, but romantics won't
mind.

 &HT;    More dumb jokes, keen satire from John Waters
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The idea of John Waters is always better than his movies.
Whether mocking mainstream films or lecturing about the subversive
joys of camp, he's an ideal fly in Hollywood's ointment. But while
his buoyant ``Hairspray'' (1988) suggested that he had finally
fused his outsider's viewpoint with a slick filmmaking savvy, his
subsequent flicks have been as doggedly second-rate as the
Baltimore thrift stores he adores.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about ``Pecker'' is the title, with that
schoolboy giggle built into it. (You know Waters picked it just
from imagining people saying it aloud at the box office.)
</P>
<P>
   Pecker is the nickname of a cheerful kid (Edward Furlong) who
earned the moniker from being a slight eater. A better name would
be Clicker, because he skips around Baltimore shooting grainy
photographs of real life: rats mating in a trash can, a woman
shaving her legs on the bus.
</P>
<P>
   His mother (Mary Kay Place) takes a look at his verite prints
and sighs, ``If only you could concentrate on pretty scenery or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   The joke is that a New York art dealer (Lili Taylor) stumbles
onto Pecker's stuff and whisks him to Manhattan to be the next big
thing. Success unsettles his working-class family, alienates his
best pal, Matt (Brendan Sexton III), and makes his girlfriend,
Shelley (Christina Ricci), feel insecure about her life as a
laundry manager.
</P>
<P>
   This no-place-like-home plot line is merged with a mild parody
of the New York art scene, which comes about 10 years too late to
have any edge. Celebrity photographers Cindy Sherman and Greg
Gorman even show up as themselves, since the satire remains so
tame. Waters has also watered down his famed shock value, though he
goes for titters with jokes about pubic hair, drag kings and a
strip-club ritual called ``teabagging.''
</P>
<P>
   A few jokes come through on the strength of characterization.
Raucous Martha Plimpton struts around in a hot-curlered fright wig,
playing Pecker's sister, who works as the emcee in a gay strip
club. This doesn't sit well with her Catholic grandmother, who has
converted her Virgin Mary statue into a ventriloquist's dummy.
Another good running gag: Pecker's sister Little Chrissy (Lauren
Hulsey) is a pint-size demon fueled entirely by sugar products.
</P>
<P>
   Furlong is an amiable lead. But Ricci, so adept at humanizing
extreme roles (``The Opposite of Sex,'' ``Buffalo 66''), can't get
a handle on playing a simple girl who doesn't get this whole
``art'' thing. She comes off as stiff as some of the
``personalities'' that populate Waters' movies (Mink Stole and
Patricia Hearst make their obligatory cameos).
</P>
<P>
   But what can you expect? It's a John Waters movie. Like him or
lump him, he's unique. Besides, aesthetically, he's made himself
unassailable: How can you complain that he's in poor taste, or a
sloppy filmmaker, when he's turned those things into his signature?
</P>
<P>
   At the end of ``Pecker,'' someone offers a toast to ``the end of
irony.'' The moment rings false. That's because Waters' conflicted
mix of dumb jokes and keen satire, of the beer-hall gritty and the
fairy-tale fabulous, is in its way as self-conscious as the most
pretentious, unreal art you could hope to find in a New York
gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pecker''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci. Written and
directed by John Waters. Rated R for profanity and sexual humor.
One hour, 27 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Another missed opportunity from the Baltimore
director who isn't Barry Levinson.

 &HT;    `Soldier's Daughter' a subtle study of family
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   James Ivory's family study, ``A Soldier's Daughter Never
Cries,'' is as piecemeal as it is perceptive. It's more like
vignettes from a personal diary than a cohesive, linear film. But
what it lacks in narrative it makes up for in character and
emotional nuance.
</P>
<P>
   The picture is based on Kaylie Jones' semi-autobiographical
novel about growing up with a famous novelist father in the 1960s
and '70s. The famous dad in question was James Jones, best known
for ``From Here to Eternity'' and ``The Thin Red Line,'' both set
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the title. But as the main character, here called Channe,
says in a tearful tete-a-tete with her hospitalized father (Kris
Kristofferson), he's always told her that a soldier's daughter
never cries. But she's not a soldier's daughter, she protests;
she's a writer's daughter. Kristofferson takes a small pause, then
says, ``That's OK then. They cry all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Exquisite little moments like these give ``A Soldier's
Daughter'' its distinctive flavor. The movie is Channe's memoir
divided into three short stories, each focusing on someone
important in her life. The first, ``Billy,'' introduces us to
Channe's family, the Willises, living in Paris in the 1960s while
Dad works on a book. Mom (an excellent Barbara Hershey) loves their
glamorous expatriate life _ cocktail parties, poker games, visiting
intelligentsia, etc. So does their little daughter, Channe (Luisa
Conlon). But then they adopt a young French boy named Benoit
(Samuel Gruen). How he adapts to his new family _ and vice versa _
has the unforced charm of a Truffaut film about childhood.
</P>
<P>
   The second section, ``Francis,'' takes us into Channe's (LeeLee
Sobieski) teenage years. Still in school in Paris, her best friend
is Francis (Anthony Roth Costnazo), a flamboyant, sensitive,
self-dramatizing, opera-loving outcast. Channe is devoted to him,
even though she thinks he ``acts like a girl.''
</P>
<P>
   In the third section, ``Daddy,'' the family returns to the
States and finds an America very different from the one they left.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's scattered approach may be off-putting for some.
There's no main relationship or story line to grab onto, just a
series of events, large and small, centering on this one family
which, compared with most movie families, is generally happy,
loving and pretty close to normal. The relationship between
Kristofferson and Sobieski stands out, simply because it's more
affecting and clear-cut by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   What counts here is the quiet accumulation of detail. We see how
the tapestry of memory is woven out of people and incidents that
may not, on an objective scale, deserve equal impact in our lives.
Ivory shows us how someone relatively minor _ say, a kid you knew
for one semester in junior high _ can have a place alongside
someone as important as your mother or father. The same might be
said of this thoughtful, imperfect movie. It's likely to stay with
you after showier, more immediately satisfying films have faded
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B

   Starring Kris Kristofferson, Barbara Hershey and LeeLee
Sobieski. Directed by James Ivory. Rated R for language and sexual
situations. 2 hours, 4 minutes.

 &HT;    `Legend' a far-fetched fright fest
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in the 1980s, we had Andrew McCarthy, Ally Sheedy, Rob Lowe
_ the Brat Pack. Now we've got the Splat Pack.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently it's illegal to make a Hollywood horror flick without
a cast member from ``Dawson's Creek'' or ``Party of Five.'' In
``Urban Legend,'' the ``Creek''-ster is Joshua Jackson, playing
Damon, a bleach-blond student at picturesque Pendleton College. In
case we miss the connection, at one point a car radio blasts the
``Dawson's Creek'' theme song.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a joke about Noxzema, because spokesmodel Rebecca
Gayheart plays another student, Brenda. Oh, and one last bit of
slasher-flick self-consciousness: The movie mimics the opening of
``Scream'' by offing a student played (like Drew Barrymore) by a
starlet from a famous acting family.
</P>
<P>
   The postmodern games don't get in the way of some OK suspense
and a clever concept: What if a serial killer decided to off
students by imitating urban legends? You know the ones. The baby
sitter and the goon calling from an upstairs phone. The gang
members driving without headlights, ready to kill the first driver
who flashes them. The dog/cat/baby in the microwave. And, of
course, the various awful things that can happen to couples parked
in Lovers' Lane.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks seem to center on Natalie (Alicia Witt, TV's
``Cybill''), who naturally has a dark secret in her past. Jared
Leto plays Paul, a dreamboat student whom Brenda also likes. The
older cast includes ex-Freddy Krueger Robert Englund as a professor
specializing in urban legends, John Neville as the dean and Loretta
Devine as a security guard who watches old Pam Grier movies for
inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Urban Legend'' is slickly made, amusingly played, instantly
forgettable. It mixes and matches plot devices and tricks from the
``Scream'' flicks and ``I Know What You Did Last Summer.'' While
it's scarier than ``Disturbing Behavior,'' director Jamie Blanks
leans on the tired trick of having people jump into the frame for
cheap shock value. You may wonder how a school with an enrollment
in the thousands seems to have only 20 students by its storm-tossed
ending. And honestly, would even the craziest killer ambush
somebody from the back seat of a car and ax the driver's head while
the car is zooming along at full speed?
</P>
<P>
   That's not scary, that's suicidal. And silly. But if you're
willing to suspend a huge amount of disbelief _ well, that's what
urban legends are about, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``Urban Legend''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Alicia Witt, Jared Leto. Directed by Jamie Blanks.
Rated R for gore, profanity and attempts to make a dog drunk. 1
hour, 39 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Some laughs, some scares, nothing special.

   Growing tea is in the bag for owners of `plantation'
</P>
<P>
   (EMBARGOED UNTIL SEPTEMBER 27: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
</P>
<P>
   By Celine Bufkin
</P>
<P>
   WADMALAW ISLAND, S.C.Mack Fleming greets his visitors with an
easy laugh and a little self-deprecating humor. There are hundreds
of them, pilgrims to his humble farm about 18 miles southeast of
Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   They come on the first Saturday of the month, April through
October, to learn about tea firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   ``America's only tea plantation,'' though a potentially
impressive claim, is no big, slick corporate operation. Calling the
127-acre plot a plantation might be stretching it a bit, even.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a farm,'' says Sarah Fleming, Mack's daughter, the CEO
(``chief executive offspring'') who works public relations and
tours and runs the company's mail-order business. With her two dogs
in tow, she shows up at the office on a busy Friday, preparing for
the Charleston Tea Plantation's monthly tour. The next day, more
than 600 people will take advantage of the free history lesson and
iced beverages and, she hopes, take home lots of stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The Charleston Tea Plantation actually began in the early 1960s
as an experiment by the Lipton Tea Co. Tea wasn't grown in the
United States at all, but political and trade situations overseas _
particularly in China _ had threatened to stifle the tea supply
coming into the country. So Lipton acquired centuries-old tea
plants from China and Argentina and started working on making them
grow in the Carolina Lowcountry.
</P>
<P>
   Mack Fleming, a native South Carolinian and horticulturist with
two degrees from Clemson University, started with the Lipton
experiment in 1963 and became director of research in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   When trade with China reopened in 1972, Lipton lost interest in
its little project, says Fleming. So he and an acquaintance,
third-generation tea taster William Barclay (Bill) Hall, bought the
property from Lipton and started their own company, the Charleston
Tea Plantation.
</P>
<P>
   The two men have been compared often but mostly contrasted:
Fleming is the Southern gentleman, locally trained horticulturist,
neatly dressed and well-trimmed. Hall has wild, long hair and wears
nifty little spectacles. His accent is still primarily Canadian,
but long stays in England, Argentina and the United States have
rounded it out. Until recently, he lived on a boat in Charleston;
now he stays on the farm as a sort of self-described hermit.
</P>
<P>
   For Fleming, the key to the whole thing is the plants.
</P>
<P>
   The rows and rows of them look like the camellia bushes growing
in your own yard. Botanically speaking, the tea is camellia
sinensis, and these bushes comprise more than 300 numbered clones
from tea plants roughly 200 years old. Their genetic material has
been coddled and preened, encouraged to thrive in the particular
elevation and climate of its home here in the Deep South.
</P>
<P>
   As horticulturist and chief electrician, Fleming makes the tea
grow and gets it into production. He determines harvest days (about
twice a month from April to October), makes sure his 3-year-old,
computer-assisted underground irrigation system is working properly
and takes care of propagation.
</P>
<P>
   For Hall, who spent a four-year apprenticeship in England _
tasting between 800 and 1,000 cups of tea every day to be able to
determine what country, region and plantation each came from _ it's
all about freshness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tea does not improve with age,'' says Hall. ``One of our
advantages is the tea gets from the field to the shelves in about a
month,'' as opposed to six months or more with most foreign teas.
Tea ordered through the plantation's mail-order company might be
only a week old, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking over the plantation, Fleming and Hall have been
trying to get their home-grown tea varieties _ sold under the
American Classic Tea brand _ in grocery stores and pantries across
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, American Classic Tea has been available in South
Carolina and most of North Carolina, and in Wal-Mart stores under
the Sam's Choice brand. The men recently sealed a deal with Publix
to carry the brand in Georgia; it's already at Harris Teeter and
Bi-Lo, plus specialty and gourmet stores.
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   The Charleston Tea Plantation's last tour of the season is
October 3, every half-hour beginning at 10 a.m. with the last tour
at 1:30 p.m. Free. For information and mail orders, call
1-800-443-5987.

 &HT;    Comedian proclaims `I'm having fun' with new baby, movie, album,
and nightclub
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_The comedian, once described as so hyperactive that he
could make caffeine nervous, must have had something slipped into
his soda.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Tucker is still. And so quiet that you have to lean in to
hear him. That means he isn't speaking in the signature
high-pitched twang that broadcasts his Southern origins (Decatur,
Georgia). And he is not, at least at this moment, the motor-mouth
who made memorable appearances in the movies ``Dead Presidents,''
``The Fifth Element,'' ``Friday'' and ``Money Talks.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because the 26-year-old co-star of ``Rush Hour,'' now
in movie theaters and doing well at the box office, had his first
child two days earlier. And, as he says, he's feeling ``really
spiritual and just kind of blessed right now.'' Or is it that he's
been doing the promotional thing since stepping off the red-eye
flight from Los Angeles around 5 a.m.?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, this may well be a glimpse of the ``feeling, magical,
`Forrest Gump' or `Color Purple' kind of role'' Tucker says he
wants to play.
</P>
<P>
   At the Chris Tucker Comedy Cafe in Midtown's Rio Mall, which he
plans to open in time for Laffapalooza, an urban arts festival
taking place Oct. 1-4, the comedian explains himself.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You seem really relaxed. Is this Chris Tucker unplugged?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, I'm just kind of taking this all in. I'm having fun. In
fact, I'm kind of surprised at how everything is coming together
with the club and the movie and everything. I'm screaming on the
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What made you decide to open a club here?
</P>
<P>
   A: I decided like a year or two years ago that I needed a place
to work out when I came home. And then I wanted a place where the
kids could come. If a kid has a dream to be whatever he wants to
be, play the piano or do comedy or sing, this will be a place to
come and show off that talent. So we'll have a night for the kids.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You got your start a bit differently, though.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah, I started doing comedy in talent shows at Columbia High
School(Ga.). I think I was like in the eighth grade. And when I
performed and got my first big roar, that's when I realized that
that's what I wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Before that realization, what were you thinking you wanted to
be?
</P>
<P>
   A: I didn't know what I was going to do. I knew I wasn't going
(in the) Army or Marines because that just wasn't me. And I didn't
know about college because I didn't even like high school. So I'm
just glad that I found out what I wanted to do early in my life.
And it's worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You're co-starring in a big movie with Jackie Chan. And I've
read you're getting $7 million for this secret agent movie you
wrote that pop singer Mariah Carey will be in. What's happening
with ``OO-Soul''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, it's in pre-production. So if that comes together,
we'll start filming it. But I have a lot of other projects in the
works, too. I have my stand-up comedy movie coming out. I'm getting
ready to shoot it. And we're going to release that in theaters
probably around Christmastime or the first of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Anything else?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've got a comedy album coming out. We're going to do a
soundtrack with the release of the stand-up movie. And there are
other movies I'm looking at, other roles.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about the new role you just took on: daddy?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah, I just had my first baby boy. He was born on a Sunday,
so he's a blessed baby. We (he and his girlfriend of two years)
still haven't decided on a name. It might be Chris, Christian, we
don't know.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There must be a lot going on in your head right now. Your
first child's in L.A., and you're here.
</P>
<P>
   A: All I'm really thinking is how much of a blessing he is,
because I see his birth as an opportunity to be better. When you
have a child, you have to be better than you were before they came.
You have to work even harder at not making mistakes, because you're
trying to teach him. So I think this is going to mature me and make
me a better person. Broaden my horizons personally and
professionally.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Not to be disrespectful, but don't you think you've been
basically playing Chris Tucker _ or at least who the public knows
as Chris Tucker _ in all your movies?
</P>
<P>
   A: I do. I do. I mean ... I play me. My main movies have been
``Friday'' and ``Money Talks.'' And ``Rush Hour,'' I think it's one
of the best movies I've done. And now I want to just keep venturing
out. I want to do dramas, something like ``Color Purple.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: You have to admit, though, Chris Tucker in ``The Color
Purple'' sounds like a comedy sketch.
</P>
<P>
   A: Let somebody laugh at me doing my serious role, and I'll
smack them upside the head.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Tucker has finally entered the building.

 &HT;    Biting side of feminism revealed
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL SEPTEMBER 27: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Carolyn Nizzi Warmbold
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lack of imagination is not Fay Weldon's problem in her
hilarious, caustic novel about the British women's rights movement
in the last three decades.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, several feminists hold a consciousness-raising session
in London. While one, Daffy, has sex with Stephanie's husband
upstairs, the others decide to start the feminist Medusa Press. So
liberated do they feel that they strip and dance until Zoe's
husband arrives and demands that she dress and bring their toddler,
Saffron, back home. Zoe succumbs to his chauvinist pigotry, but the
others bring Medusa to life.

   What a group they are: the heady Alice; the seductive and
wealthy Layla; Stephanie, who leaves her kids to be raised by
Daffy; and the sensible Nancy, who runs the office at a pittance of
a salary. Medusa thrives with the times, while the characters'
personal lives proceed in ironic fits and starts.
</P>
<P>
   When Zoe kills herself, it sets off a chain reaction that will
ultimately threaten Medusa. Saffron learns a harsher feminism and
grows up to become a mainstream publishing shark with the looks of
Ally McBeal and the instincts of a press baron. Weldon humorously
contrasts the difference between feminist generations but remains
sympathetic, if clear-eyed, in her characterizations.

LINDBERGH: GRIPPING NARRATIVE, INSUFFICIENT ANALYSIS
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Publication notes at end of review.)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On May 20, 1927, a handsome 25-year-old pilot named Charles A.
Lindbergh took off from Roosevelt Field on Long Island, N.Y., in a
tiny, single-engine plane. To keep the plane from becoming too
heavy, he took only the barest essentials: a small rubber raft (in
case he was forced down at sea), a knife, some flares and matches,
fishing equipment and five sandwiches. There was no radio and no
sextant.
</P>
<P>
   When the ``Kid Flyer'' touched down in Paris, 33 hours, 30
minutes and 30 seconds later, he had become the most famous man in
the world _ the ``first superstar,'' as A. Scott Berg puts it, of
the new age of technology.
</P>
<P>
   Often thrilling, but disturbingly opaque, Berg's new biography
of Lindbergh turns that historic flight into a narrative tour de
force _ a cogent and thoroughly gripping account that conveys to
the reader all the magic, danger and courage of the young pilot's
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   A similar narrative prowess informs Berg's account of the 1932
kidnapping of Lindbergh's infant son and the subsequent trial of
Bruno Richard Hauptmann _ an account that reads, at once, as a
harrowing thriller and a sobering study in the unreckoned
consequences of fame.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the reader is made to realize that the media circus
surrounding the O.J. Simpson trial and the death of Diana, Princess
of Wales _ including ruthless paparazzi, celebrity book deals and
product tie-in promotions _ is nothing new, that it began decades
ago with Charles Lindbergh.
</P>
<P>
   As he notes in this volume's acknowledgments, Berg _ the author
of earlier biographies of editor Maxwell Perkins and movie producer
Sam Goldwyn _ was granted full access to Lindbergh's voluminous
archives (filling nearly 2,000 boxes) by the pilot's widow, Anne
Morrow Lindbergh, who also supplied him with her papers, including
some 60 years of diaries.
</P>
<P>
   In the earlier portions of ``Lindbergh,'' Berg uses his copious
talents as a writer _ a ferocious eye for detail, an easy command
of anecdote and an instinctive sense of drama _ to turn all that
material into an absorbing narrative that possesses all the
immediacy and power of a novel.
</P>
<P>
   It is when Lindbergh starts dabbling in politics and science
that Berg's willfully nonanalytic approach _ his reluctance to
interrupt his story with psychological insights, historical context
or simple authorial assessments _ begins to run into problems. Berg
fails to grapple fully with Lindbergh's sympathetic responses to
Nazi Germany. He offers only vague, unsubstantiated testaments to
the pilot's supposedly underappreciated work in the fields of
medical research, rocketry, conservation and anthropology. And he
fails to examine the pilot's isolationist politics and
anti-Semitism in any meaningful way.
</P>
<P>
   The Lindbergh who emerges from this book is a restless,
emotionally reticent man _ by turns cold, dreamy, stoical and
self-absorbed. As Berg tells it, many of Lindbergh's ancestors
``were prideful to the point of arrogance _ rebels so far apart
from the rest of society as to be above the law,'' and the pilot
inherited both a ``deeply private nature'' and the nonconformist's
``innate understanding that greatness came at the inevitable price
of being misunderstood.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   A shy, aloof boy, Lindbergh was the son of two sadly mismatched
parents who spent much of the time apart, and his experience of
their contentious marriage seems to have left him with a lasting
sense of displacement.
</P>
<P>
   Although his marriage to Anne Morrow, the daughter of an
American ambassador, was a love match, their relationship soon
became a one-sided affair, with Lindbergh setting the agenda and
Anne doing her best to accommodate and please. After the birth of
each of their six children, Berg observes, Lindbergh would take his
wife away on a long plane journey _ often weeks in length _ as a
way of ``weaning'' her from her children. He bristled at her
displays of emotion (even in the wake of the kidnapping) and
rebuked her when she complained of writer's block.
</P>
<P>
   Anne's growing independence, which sprang largely from
Lindbergh's encouraging her to find her own voice as a writer,
apparently provoked ``greater intolerance'' on his part. Lindbergh
was constantly on the road, on business or pleasure, and Anne, Berg
suggests, began to welcome his long absences from home.
</P>
<P>
   Although the highly private Lindbergh loathed his own celebrity,
he determined to use it to promote causes he believed in, including
commercial aviation, conservation and, during the early '40s, the
isolationist America First movement, which aimed to keep the United
States out of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Lindbergh was not simply concerned about the adverse effects the
war might have on America; he saw the conflict as marginal to the
country's interests. In one speech, he asserted that it was not a
war ``in which our civilization is defending itself against some
Asiatic intruder,'' that it was ``not a question of banding
together to defend the white race against foreign invasion.''
</P>
<P>
   He complained that American Jews were pushing the country into
the war, and declared that ``their greatest danger to this country
lies in their large ownership and influence in our motion pictures,
our press, our radio and our government.''
</P>
<P>
   During a trip to Berlin in 1938, Lindbergh accepted a decoration
for his services to world aviation from Goering, and he would speak
frequently of his admiration for aspects of Nazi Germany. ``I
shared the repulsion that democratic peoples felt in viewing the
demagoguery of Hitler, the controlled elections, the secret
police,'' he explained. ``Yet I felt that I was seeing in Germany,
despite the crudeness of its form, the inevitable alternative to
decline _ a challenge based more on the drive to achieve success
despite established `right' and law.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Berg quotes such damning statements by Lindbergh, and
also quotes anti-Semitic passages that were expurgated from
Lindbergh's published diaries, he does little to explain why, in
his words, the pilot ``buried his head in the sand when confronted
with the crimes of inhumanity that repelled so many others.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, Berg sounds as though he were trying to rationalize
Lindbergh's actions. He writes that ``the Lindberghs were hardly
alone in being swayed by Hitler's magnetism.'' He writes that
Lindbergh's interest in ``race betterment'' _ which came at the
same time that Nazi Germany was obsessed with eugenics _ was an
unfortunate ``coincidence that would not be lost on future
detractors.''
</P>
<P>
   And he argues that Lindbergh's critics often judged him by his
fanatical followers (like the Rev. Charles Edward Coughlin),
although Lindbergh himself ``never associated with any pro-Nazi or
anti-Semitic organization; he never attended any Bund meetings; and
since more than four months before the outbreak of war in Europe,
he had neither consorted nor consulted with anyone known to have
any connections with the Third Reich.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Berg's depiction of Lindbergh as ``naive in war as
he had been in peace'' is insufficient _ particularly when
Lindbergh never recanted his most explosive isolationist
statements, when he never even conceded, as his wife did, that ``we
were both very blind, especially in the beginning, to the worst
evils of the Nazi system.'' It is a serious flaw in a biography, a
flaw that casts a dark shadow over the dazzling writerly
achievement on display in the first half of this uneven volume.

 &HT;    Explosive saxophonist takes jazz improv to new heights
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL SEPTEMBER 27: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Branford Marsalis was at a jazz festival in France three years
ago when something caught his ear. It was a version of the standard
``Yesterdays,'' but the musician playing it wasn't making any nods
toward convention. ``He was going out,'' the saxophonist and former
``Tonight Show'' band leader recalls, ``but I could hear the
melody, dude. I thought, `Wow! This is the (stuff) I like.'''
</P>
<P>
   When he went to investigate, Marsalis came face to face with
David S. Ware, a tenor saxophonist who, more so than most of his
peers, has doggedly adhered to a strong, specific vision of what
jazz improvisation needs to be: raucous at times, big-shouldered,
ecstatic, yet laced with intricate details that require high levels
of musicianship and a buzzing psychic hotline between band members.
That Ware was, at the time, releasing albums on a record label
better known for its catalog of punk-rock titles didn't faze
Marsalis. Neither did the volatility of the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can hear the tradition in his playing,'' says Marsalis,
who, as a new creative consultant to Columbia Records jazz
department made Ware the first artist he signed to the label.
``There's a parallel to classical music. People say they love
classical music, but they don't know Shostakovich. It's about
advanced melody. It's in the tradition and extends it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the public has a chance to investigate that thesis. ``Go See
the World,'' Ware's domestic major-label debut after a dozen prior
albums, hit record shelves last week. The New Jersey native, 48, a
former Manhattan cabdriver and teen protege of saxophone colossus
Sonny Rollins, is touring behind the disc. His quartet performs
Monday in Atlanta, at the First Existentialist Congregation in
Candler Park.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ware's live performances, the album aspires to be
mind-blowingly audacious, and is, partly because the musicians
never shirk the risks necessary to reach their goal. Given to
graceful interludes that can swiftly churn into galvanizing
exchanges of high-energy invention, the group is fluid enough to
briskly adapt to variations in Ware's gale-force gusts, yet remains
rooted in a mutual, fundamental grasp of structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We speak the same language, we're using the same alphabet,''
Ware says. ``We're able to balance our abstractions with our more
solid sense of melody and harmony. It's the girth of their
vocabulary, man. They have that ability to listen and hear, and
make the correct choices in any given situation. That's what talent
does, natural talent is capable of that.''
</P>
<P>
   An ideal example of the musician's thinking is his new album's
centerpiece, a 16-minute version of ``The Way We Were,'' which
redeems Marvin Hamlisch's treacly ballad _ a 1974 hit for Barbra
Streisand _ as an improvisational epic. It partakes of the
venerable jazz tradition of turning popular song into the raw
material of complex, melodic exploration. Ware takes two full
minutes before he introduces that melody. He teases it out as a
series of distinct fragments. Robust soul shouts, piercing cries,
roadhouse swagger, the spontaneous lyricism of birdsong, a fleet
sequence of notes that rushes by like the blurred glimpse of a
subway train: It's all there. Halfway through, pianist Matthew
Shipp recasts the theme on piano, taking it straight before a
brief, frenetic deconstruction _ Godzilla meets Bambi _ which leads
back to the original line. At various points, the rainbow flurry
that drummer Susie Ibarra conjures on the trap set _ a reflection
of her training in such Indonesian percussive traditions as gamelan
and kulintang _ and the eerie, theremin-like effect of bassist
William Parker's bowing create an unusual range of harmonic
textures.
</P>
<P>
   ``David's the kind of person, like Cecil Taylor or Sonny
Rollins, that does not need a band,'' says Parker, 47, who first
met the saxophonist in 1973. ``If you take away their band, you can
just listen to them. Whenever you play with people who don't need a
band, it's a particular challenge as to what to do. There has to be
a reason for you to be up there playing.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as Parker notes, ``the quartet is definitely a family,''
and its collective strengths mark it as formidable.

 &HT;    Shaw strikes up band for Boston's ailing Ozawa
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somebody get Robert Shaw a Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   Just four days after wrapping up the National Symphony
Orchestra's Beethoven Festival in Washington, Atlanta's senior
maestro had to hail a jet to Boston on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Symphony Orchestra conductor Seiji Ozawa, who was
suffering from a viral infection he caught in Russia, had dropped
out of his season opener at the last minute. Still a wunderkind at
82, Shaw hopped a plane, went straight to the hall and conducted
without a rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the fun and games part, to see if we could start and
finish together,'' said the chuckling maestro, calling from the
Boston airport Thursday before returning to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   As luck would have it, it was Ozawa's 25th anniversary concert,
and the gala dinner had sold about $500,000 in tickets. ``To say we
were fortunate is an understatement,'' said Boston Symphony
managing director Mark Volpe. ``I'm not sure there is another
conductor who would have conducted the Beethoven Ninth with no
rehearsal.''
</P>
<P>
   Pshaw. It was a piece of cake.
</P>
<P>
   In his review Thursday, Boston Globe classical music critic
Richard Dyer hailed Shaw as ``the godfather of American choral
singing'' and rhapsodized: ``Shaw's professional experience with
the Beethoven Ninth now exceeds half a century; his view is
spacious, lucid, humane, and surpassingly humble; he does not
impose himself on the work, but instead tries to share all the
qualities his experience has found in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said his rendering would have been a lot less nuanced if
United Parcel Service hadn't been able to track down the musicians'
orchestral markings, which were headed to Atlanta from Washington.
The parcel service got the music to Shaw about an hour before he
left Atlanta. He arrived in Boston around 4 p.m., warmed up his
four soloists and made the 6:30 p.m. curtain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a buzz by the fourth movement,'' Volpe said. ``You
could feel the excitement building. He was in great form. He was
certainly appreciated by all in Boston.''

   HURRICANE-GEORGES _ MIAMI _ Southern Florida continued to brace
for the approaching storm on Thursday, as Hurricane Georges
appeared to be taking a sounthernmost track across the Caribbean.
By early morning, the storm _ which was still barely a hurricane _
was skimming the northern coast of Cuba, leaving 50 dead in its
wake in other parts of the Caribbean. Developing. (Emling, Cox News

</P>
<P>
   JOURNAL-HURRICANE _ MIAMI _ In my years of travel as a foreign
correspondent throughout the Caribbean and Latin America, there is
very little that I haven't had to deal with _ from corrupt
dictatorships to drug cartels to starving people to tony tourist
meccas. But I'm not sure any of that prepared me for the high
anxiety and paranoia that has gripped this city since it learned
that Hurricance Georges could come its doorstep. (Emling, Cox News

</P>
<P>
   STORM-PREPARATION _ Karen Jacobs didn't panic in August 1992
when Hurricane Andrew built up a running start in the Atlantic
Ocean. ``What's the worst, you know, the AC could go off?'' She had
said. The air conditioning did go off. So did part of the roof and
one wall. That's why Jacobs was covering windows to prepare for
Hurricane Georges. But oddly, only the windows on the east side.
Jacobs partial reaction typefies, under one rebuilt roof, the two
currents of thought in Country Walk. (Trontz, Palm Beach Post)
MOVED.

   STORM-PROTECTION _ Eleven-dollar pieces of plywood gained new

Monroe county residents to buy storm supplies. But most Palm Beach
County and Treasure Coast residents remained calm, figuring the
brunt of Hurricane Georges wouldn't come this far north. (Bierman,
Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   STORM-INSURANCE _ Like most major insurance carriers, State Farm
Fire and Casualty stops writing new home and auto policies when a
hurricane watch has been posted. State Farm wasn't alone. If you
live in an area where you think you might need insurance within a
few days, you probably can't get it. Most companies stopped writing
new policies in South Florida by September 23. (Murawski, Palm

   CLINTON-TAPES _ WASHINGTON _ In what could bring a reprise of
the partisan furor over President Clinton's videotaped testimony,
the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee said Thursday the
panel may release edited transcripts _ but not the original tapes _
of Monica Lewinsky's phone conversations with Linda Tripp. Members
cite reasons ranging from the fact that the tapes show signs of

 &HT;    Going two by two through natural Nova Scotia

   OFF DIGBY NECK, Nova Scotia_Blooooow, 12 o'clock!''
</P>
<P>
   We had pedaled a tandem bike across 40 rough miles of Nova
Scotia, then ridden a tiny Zodiac boat across 25 miles of icy ocean
to hear those words.
</P>
<P>
   Our first whale sighting. The guide raced our 20-foot boat
closer to the 80-foot beast. The long, sleek body of the finback
glistened in the sunlight, moving very slowly through the frigid
waters of the Bay of Fundy. We all stood motionless as the majestic
beauty showed its features _ the fin, the dark gray back, the top
of its tail. Finally, the footprint _ the still mark on the water
left after a whale descends into the ocean depths.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Goodwin, biologist and owner of Ocean Explorations,
explained the protocol of spout-spotting: The bow of the boat is 12
o'clock, the stern 6 o'clock, and so on. We caught on fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blow! 2 o'clock!'' shouted a fellow tourist from Pennsylvania,
who was so excited she lost her balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blow! 11 o'clock!'' yelled another from Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In the next hour we saw a dozen or more finback whales, getting
to within 100 feet of some. The second-largest whale in the world,
the finback can grow to 80 feet and weigh as much as 80 tons,
devouring 2 tons of herring a day. On our ride back to shore, we
glimpsed the world's most endangered whale, a right whale, feeding
in the distance. Only 300 right whales are believed to exist.
</P>
<P>
   Nova Scotia is wonderful territory for anyone interested in an
active outdoor vacation, offering great cycling, hiking, birding,
beachcombing and whale watching. In one week, we pedaled through
remote areas on the Digby Neck, visited quiet fishing villages and
experienced hundreds of years of history in Annapolis Royal,
Canada's oldest European settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Our adrenalin high from the whale tour, we were ready to
continue our journey back to Digby. A ride across the Digby Neck
offers many challenges. The peninsula, on the western side of Nova
Scotia, juts out toward the Atlantic, separating the Bay of Fundy
and St. Mary's Bay. Steep climbs end in breathtaking views from the
tops of the now mostly submerged North Mountain chain. Fragrant
spruce trees, yellow and crimson snapdragons and white and purple
lupines line the roadsides, contrasting with the bright blue waters
of St. Mary's Bay.
</P>
<P>
   When we arrived back in Digby, Bob and Theresa Marshall and
their friendly dog Sam greeted us at the Bayside Inn Bed and
Breakfast. Theresa showed us our room, with a large bay window
overlooking the water and fishing docks. The private bath was
outfitted with a giant claw-foot tub, where a soak would be a
welcome treat after two days of biking.
</P>
<P>
   But hunger called first. Home of the world's largest scallop
fleet, Digby is a great place for fresh seafood. We enjoyed many of
the local delicacies _ mussels, scallops and lobster _ cooked to
perfection at the Red Raven Pub.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, we were back on the bike for a 30-mile ride
east, and then north: Our destination was Annapolis Royal, where
we'd stay two nights. Along the way was Bear River, once a busy
shipbuilding center, now home to craft and antiques shops.
</P>
<P>
   It's also home to a lot of big hills _ so many that Bear River
is called ``Little Switzerland'' _ lovely to look at, murder to
ride. For more than a mile, we climbed straight up before leveling
off on farm roads. We rode along the Moose River on rolling hills
lined with fragrant wildflowers and evergreens, and took Highway 1
to the town of Annapolis Royal. As we descended through lush green
farmlands and apple orchards, we saw horses grazing in the valley
pasture below.
</P>
<P>
   We arrived in town and headed to the King George Inn, a large
Victorian home built in 1868. Just a five-minute walk from the inn,
we came into the historic downtown, where our first stop was Ye
Olde Towne Pub, for huge platters of steamed clams and local draft
beer. Then to Catfish Moon, a shop featuring handmade pottery with
designs influenced by Nova Scotian folk art.
</P>
<P>
   The next day we enjoyed a walking tour through historic gardens
and took in the Tidal Power Plant, the Fort Anne National Historic
Site, a delightful dinner at the Garrison House and, finally, a
candlelight graveyard tour of the cemetery with a guide dressed in
traditional Victorian mourning clothes.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, we took our final tandem ride in Nova Scotia,
truly an island built for two.

 &HT;    Tides of change touch gently on pastoral province
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL SEPTEMBER 27: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Eileen M. Drennen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service

<P>
   VICTORIA, Prince Edward Island_Chasing down a memory is always a
risk.
</P>
<P>
   Revisiting a favorite seaside raises questions: Will how it
looks today erase your dreamy images of the way it used to be? Can
any coastal town escape the transforming tides of ``progress'' and
development?
</P>
<P>
   Happily, the tiny southern seaport of Victoria, where I spent
the summer of '64, has managed to dodge both.
</P>
<P>
   My dad had spotted an ad for a ``Victorian farmhouse by the sea,
$250 month'' in The New York Times, and rented the white two-story
sight unseen. For three whole months, the sounds of the ocean were
as close as a bedroom window. At 8, I fell under the spell of the
sea _ and being lulled to sleep by the sound of its rise and fall.
We all became accustomed to swimming lessons in the waves of the
cold Atlantic, vegetables fresh from a backyard garden, and bread
hot from a neighbor's oven. For six kids from the Hudson River
Valley, raised on canned veggies and frozen food, this village life
seemed too perfect to last.
</P>
<P>
   But here it is, unchanged in the important ways, 34 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, new owners have added a third story to our farmhouse and
made its barn an antiques shop; the old grocery was redone as the
upscale Island Chocolates. The working wharf of this former
shipbuilding town _ now often promoted as Victoria by the Sea _
caught fire a few years ago and was reborn as shops and a
restaurant called Sea Winds. Most of the dirt roads in these four
square blocks have been paved.
</P>
<P>
   And it's no longer an hourlong ferry ride from New Brunswick.
The much-debated Confederation Bridge, which opened in summer '97
and stretches across the Northumberland Strait in the distance like
a long, ghostly arm, has made it just a 30-minute drive from the
mainland. (You can still opt for the more romantic water crossing;
Northumberland Ferries connects Caribou, Nova Scotia, and Wood
Islands, Prince Edward Island, every hour and a half.)
</P>
<P>
   Since the eight-mile bridge debuted, tourism has roughly doubled
in Canada's smallest province, only 140 miles from end to end. An
estimated 1.2 million visited last year. In summer and fall, they
come for old-fashioned vacations on the beach, lobster bakes and
world-class golf courses. In winter, a network of extensive bike
trails attracts snowmobilers and skiers. Maybe it's the island's
environmental reverence, but for all its increased traffic, it
seems none the worse for wear.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes called the Million-Acre Farm, this ancient place
remains rooted in agriculture, growing much of the world's seed
potato supply. By summer's end, the white and purple blossoms,
covering iron-red fields, appear to Southern eyes like some strange
breed of cotton. Locals have worked hard to preserve this life,
raising vegetables, fruit and dairy products on the fertile land
and pulling lobsters, scallops and the justly famous Malpeque Bay
oysters from the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Everything we ate was blissfully fresh: a humble oyster sandwich
at the New London Seafood Restaurant south of Cavendish, or a
gourmet five-course meal at the casually upscale Seasons in Thyme
in Summerside. Here we marveled at chef Stefan Czapalay's inventive
island combos, typified by the oyster risotto, subbing Yukon Gold
potatoes for rice.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Edward Island has modernized around its rich past.
Capital city Char-
</P>
<P>
   lottetown (where the nation of Canada was born in 1864) and
major port Summerside have entire blocks of historic homes,
buildings and churches for every Kinko's or Blockbuster. Museums
dedicated to island industry offer history as cultural experience:
Summerside's International Fox Museum and Hall of Fame, which
reprises the island's fox farming history; Miminegash's Irish Moss
Interpretive Centre; O'Leary's Prince Edward Island Potato Museum.
The College of Piping in Summerside has nightly summer ceilidhs and
dancing that reflect the island's Celtic and Acadian roots.
</P>
<P>
   But the rural routes that cross-stitch the island remain its
heart and soul.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere are you more than 15 minutes from the ocean. The best
way to explore, if you don't have time to bike, is by car. Three
well-marked scenic heritage roads (Ladyslipper Drive, Blue Heron
Drive and Kings Byway) take you to red cliffs and beaches by way of
rolling fields of wheat and corn, patches of lupine and Queen
Anne's lace. Wandering without a plan is the way to go.
</P>
<P>
   We rued native novelist Lucy Maud Montgomery's international
fame when we crossed into the tourist-trap choked northern crescent
around Cavendish, home of the heroine of her ``Anne of Green
Gables'' series (first published in 1908, now in its 99th
printing). But that's only because we were not among the throngs
who came to find The House and retrace the footsteps of the
beguiling fictional redhead.
</P>
<P>
   We opted for the nearby Prince Edward Island National Park and
its 25 miles of beaches, especially the few white sand shores so
prized for swimming.
</P>
<P>
   And gravitated to such offbeat stops as the Bottle Houses (Les
Maisons de Bouteilles) along Ladyslipper Drive in Cap-Egmont, a
tiny stronghold of Acadian culture on the southwest shore. A
retired fisherman, dedicated gardener and pioneering recycler named
Edouard Arsenault built these three imaginative shrines out of
25,000 colored glass bottles and cement from 1980 to '83. He passed
away in 1984, after which the elements took their toll. A five-year
reconstruction was completed this year.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of old churches will find the island's plentiful houses of
worship beautifully maintained, open all the time and occasionally
staffed. Ulrich Poirier, 81, was the bilingual guide of the day at
the century-old Mont-Carmel, an Acadian cathedral just down the
road from the Bottle Houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our ancestors to thank for this,'' he said, patting a
green marble column. Carved wooden pews stretched out under
old-fashioned candle chande-
</P>
<P>
   liers. ``No expense was spared.''
</P>
<P>
   At the western edge of the island, where the lush farmland
crashes into the blue Northumberland Strait, lovers of the ocean
needn't spend a fortune to spend the night in a lighthouse.
</P>
<P>
   The 123-year-old West Point Lighthouse, a functioning Coast
Guard outpost, museum and bed-and-breakfast, fills up fast in
summer, so we'd booked a seaside room months in advance. We arrived
near dusk, finding the tower's black-and-white stripes softened by
golden-pink light.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're just in time for the sunset,'' said the young clerk at
the ancient front desk. She handed us two sets of keys _ one to our
room, the other to the uppermost walkway. ``It looks best from the
very top,'' she said, glancing at her watch. ``And you've got about
10 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the rough winds of the Lantern Deck, 70 feet up, as the
bright disc slipped into the waves, we watched the sky and water go
pearled pink and orange-blue. After, we dined on fresh lobster
sandwiches (on homemade bread) and a plate of local fruit and
cheese. Then we walked along the shore in the dark, cool night,
under a clear expanse of stars.
</P>
<P>
   Back in our room, gauzy white curtains framed the ocean view and
fluttered in the salty air. And we slept deeply, lulled once more
by the primal cadence of the sea.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   Costs in Canada are in Canadian dollars.
</P>
<P>
   -- Getting there: Fly into Charlottetown via Air Canada/Air Nova
(1-800-776-3000) or cross over from Nova Scotia or New Brunswick by
ferry ($28.50 per car, Northumberland Ferries, 1-800-565-0201). Or
drive over from Cape Tormentine, New Brunswick, on the new
Confederation Bridge, an eight-mile two-lane with tall guardrails
(hence no view). Since you're only charged when you leave the
island, no matter how you arrive, it's slightly cheaper, and more
fun, to ferry in and drive out (about $22).
</P>
<P>
   -- Accommodations: The West Point Lighthouse, at the edge of
Cedar Dunes Provincial Park, is more than a great place to spend
the night. Its five-story museum recaps the structure's 123-year
past and the history of the sea-dependent community surrounding it.
Only four of the nine guest rooms face the sea, so book early. Open
May 22-Sept. 27. Route 14, O'Leary. 1-800-764-6854.
</P>
<P>
   The Loyalist Country Inn faces Summerside's working waterfront,
and its mid-island location makes it ideal for exploring in almost
any direction. Indoor pool and sauna, onsite Crown &AMP; Anchor Tavern,
dining room and gift shop. 195 Harbour Drive, Summerside. Rooms,
$96-$145; suites $225. 1-800-361-2668.
</P>
<P>
   -- Dining: Seasons in Thyme features gourmet dining in an
unpretentious setting. 644 Water St. East, Summerside,

buildings from the roadside, you can't really appreciate them

   New season of ``The Practice'' starts off with a dud
</P>
<P>
   By Phil Kloer
</P>
<P>
   TV CRITIC
</P>
<P>
   They practice more than the law on ``The Practice.'' They
practice eye contact _ deep, prolonged eyeball lock, like you'd
normally find at a hypnotists' convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Practice'' is uber-producer David E. Kelley's other show,
the one that doesn't get as much attention as his ``Ally McBuzz,''
but that nonetheless won the Emmy as best drama two weeks ago and
is usually a satisfying legal drama, a thoughtful blend of cynicism
and idealism.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's season premiere has some plot problems with the main
court case, in which two college roommates each blame the other for
the rape-murder of a girl in their dorm room. It's supposed to be a
real puzzler, but one passed a polygraph and the other didn't, and
there's never any mention of physical evidence or DNA testing.
Kelley usually constructs his cases better than this; ``It's all a
little too convenient,'' one lawyer says. Indeed.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Practice'' is home to some of the best acting on TV,
notably Camryn Manheim, winner of a supporting actress Emmy, whose
Ellenor starts coming apart Sunday, and Steve Harris,
eyeball-locker supreme, whose intensity melts the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Star Dylan McDermott, as founding partner Bobby Donnell, is
sometimes branded the thinking woman's stud muffin, but he has more
than just smolder. Witness his working through father-son issues of
pride and shame Sunday with his dad (Charles Durning, reminding us
he can go deeper than comedy).

 &HT;    ABC trying to make Saturday night watchable again
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We don't expect much from TV on Saturday nights. Mainly, we just
want it on. But ABC has aimed its laser sights right between the
eyes of lovelorn stay-at-homes with a ``Fantasy Island'' remake and
``Cupid,'' two daftly not-bad new shows designed to make you feel
good about feeling bad about being home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fantasy Island'' (9 p.m. EDT Saturday on ABC) is darker than
the late-'70s, early-'80s original, in which, then as now, guests
are transported by ``da plane'' to a tropical resort to fulfill
their dreams. Executive producer Barry Sonnenfeld (``Men in
Black,'' ``Get Shorty'') replaces the old cheesy camp with a more
artful brand of cheese: swirling, zooming closeups that hint (like
a ton of bricks) at some dangerous undertone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have those white ones burned,'' island host Mr. Roarke orders
an assistant as he thumbs through white suits that look left over
from former host Ricardo Mantalban, and instead plucks from his
closet a black suit. He dubs the whites ``a little dated.''
</P>
<P>
   This is escapism at its most peculiar, a sort of Club Med for
the Damned. Perfectly cast as Roarke is the frighteningly peculiar
Malcolm McDowell _ one odd, irresistible duck. You sit up straight
as soon as he arrives; with his short white hair spiked back and
his face taught with what seems like the pressure of some major
G-force, he doesn't suffer fools gladly.
</P>
<P>
   The fools tonight want a variety of things _ one wants the woman
he thinks he should've married; one wants to be smarter than her
sister; another wants thrills instead of a more average life's
nuances _ and it is Roarke's duty to set them straight.
</P>
<P>
   It can get awfully silly, and all the lessons they teach you
learned in kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   But McDowell and his two sidekicks (Louis Lombard and Edward
Hibbert) are so astonishingly curious they're worth the short slogs
through the downtime. If not worth staying home for,this unlikely
flight of fantasy is at least worth watching if you have to stay
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cupid'' (10 p.m. EDT Saturday on ABC) is more aggressively
aimed at the citizens of Loserville. Try this one on: Jeremy Piven
(cousin Spence on ``Ellen'') is a recently released psych patient
convinced he's cupid. He winds up in a Chicago singles therapy
group, his aim to match up 100 couples so he can return to Mt.
Olympus.
</P>
<P>
   You can't be expected to believe this, but it sort of works.
Like a watered-down McMurphy in ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest,'' Piven teaches this group's lovelorn cuckoos to seize the
night. He alternates between tough love (``Get the complete cable
package,'' he advises one guy) and ``Loveline'' cheerleading.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pop psychology sensitivity awareness festival,'' he
exclaims at one session, run by relationship expert Claire Allen
(Paula Marshall). ``You're shackled in fear. Make a move! Get in
the game! Afraid to get hurt? Have a beautiful train wreck!''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to know whether we should be entranced or repelled by
this Cupid. The singles talk can be bracingly grim, but if
tonight's pilot is a blueprint, at least one winner should emerge
each week.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope so. If not, you'll have to turn off the TV. Then what
do you have on Saturday night?

   ``Martial Law'' needs to pack more punches
</P>
<P>
   Nobody does what Jackie Chan can. But Sammo Hung, who's worked
with Chan on film, comes as close as anybody.
</P>
<P>
   Hung's new cop chop drama ``Martial Law'' (9 p.m. EDT Saturday
on CBS) is a knock-your-block-off knockoff of Chan's big-screen
martial arts free-for-alls.
</P>
<P>
   Anything's fair game with these fists of fury. In Saturday's
debut, Hung beats up people not just with his arms, legs, elbows,
head and hands. Like Chan does, Hung picks up and whacks guys with
all kinds of stuff. Like a blow torch. A big blue trash can. Hedge
clippers. A picnic bench. An eraser _ and a chalkboard. A car door.
And, of course, a watermelon.
</P>
<P>
   The plot here is irrelevant. But Hung plays Sammo Law, a Chinese
cop come to Los Angeles to hunt down a stolen car racketeer. He's
teamed with an L.A.P.D. he-she duo (Louis Manylor and Tammy Lauren)
that's all strut. Her standard tough-cookie line: ``Let me point
you in the direction of jail.''
</P>
<P>
   That's nine words too many.
</P>
<P>
   We're tuning in to see the bruising ballets. Too bad there's not
enough of them.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B

   Content ratings don't always work
</P>
<P>
   Remember TV's content ratings? The V for violence? The S for
sexual situations? A new study from The Henry J. Kaiser Family
Foundation claims those letter designations are not always being
used for shows that contain sex and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Some 79 percent of shows with violent content and 92 percent of
shows with sex do not get appropriate content descriptors, the
study says.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, an episode of ``Walker, Texas Ranger,''
for example, failed to carry a ``V'' in a show that included the
stabbings of two guards, the threat of rape against a nun and a
fight scene in which an escapee is shot and another kicked and
beaten unconcious.

LIFE AND LITERATURE IN A CITY THAT SPEAKS VOLUMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GRACE PALEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This weekend, New York, our big, noisy, contentious,
world-engaging town, is being celebrated as Book Country. For most
people, that's Manhattan. But once, my New York City was the Bronx.
It was a small place (I thought). It was enlarging itself, slowly
moving east on little bridges over narrow streams and north on
Robert Moses' highways in order to sell its fancier citizens to the
suburbs. Not me.
</P>
<P>
   When my time came at 19 to leave home, marry and live real life,
I believed there was only one place this could be accomplished.
That was Greenwich Village. Not only because artists and other free
spirits lived there and puritanical parents did not, but because it
was a small place, too, a neighborhood, one of a thousand New York
neighborhoods. The high-rise buildings with elegant foyers and
French names had not yet been built.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, to this day, because of fought-for municipal
landmarking, if you stand on the northeast corner of 10th Street
and the Avenue of the Americas you can still truly see the sky. In
season, the sun sets along West 10th Street and just misses Patchin
Place, where E.E. Cummings and Djuna Barnes once lived. Of course,
I already knew what the Village looked like: When I was 17, I
walked with hopeful happiness from my job on 11th Avenue once a
week to hear W.H. Auden speak to an audience of about 200 in the
New School auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, many great cities in the world. A great
city probably has a river and a good deal of commerce, for
starters. Greatness would also like a welcoming harbor on the sea
as well and a population in constant argument in several languages.
A great city must absolutely have a bard, a poet to sing the city's
praises loud enough so finally the outside world can hear.
</P>
<P>
   For New York, Walt Whitman was the singer, and he was actually
willing to praise the rest of the country, too. He was, in fact,
the poet of glorious incessant praise. He found all the words for
it and helped most of us to love many of us. In the 19th century,
he said he heard America singing. In the following century,
Langston Hughes in Harlem sang to that ardent ghost:
</P>
<P>
   I too sing America
</P>
<P>
   I am the darker brother.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman would probably have answered, ``Ah, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   I have a kind of literary picture in my head. Hart Crane is on
the Brooklyn Bridge and is looking down at the busy waters. He sees
Whitman singing his wonderful ferry poem on the way home to
Brooklyn. At sea, or perhaps way downtown observing the harbor,
Herman Melville was writing and writing. Edith Wharton is wondering
as she walks her city how, while she was away, all these
chocolate-covered houses had crawled so quickly up one street and
down another.
</P>
<P>
   Now that it had a singer, the great city required the appearance
of many people and their different languages who had come after
arduous ocean voyages. They were so exhausted and fearful that most
of them got off the boat and stopped right where they were. (For
many years, my own parents didn't move another inch.)
</P>
<P>
   Though there was poverty and exploitation, in the small
oppressive factories that were making the city rich, there seemed
to be no war just then, no foreign occupation. In fact, they were
the occupiers. Storytellers like Anzia Yezierska and Mary Antin
gave the immigrants their American voice.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred years ago, New York politically consolidated itself,
but it became its geographical self in the appetite-driven way of
island cities _ by throwing out beautiful, and less beautiful but
always amazing, bridges to catch Brooklyn and Queens, entangling
the boroughs further with a couple of bridges between Queens and
the Bronx (in case Queens planned a getaway to Long Island) and
securing them in a network of subways. Staten Island had always
dreamed of independence, but the long line of the Verrazano-Narrows
Bridge, as well as the inexpensive delight of the Staten Island
Ferry, held it tight.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx is really a continuation of Manhattan by other _
cheaper _ means. It's the only borough with an article before its
name. This was very important to me as I began to meet children
from snootier boroughs. The Bronx is where I lived for 19 years on
Hoe Avenue, a street worth living one's whole childhood on.
</P>
<P>
   There were, in fact, so many children on that street that you
never had to go beyond the middle of the block to find good stoops,
good friends and that week's enemies. On that street, the stout
mothers leaned on pillowed windowsills on summer evenings and
called the children home. They began to call at 9 o'clock. They
tried again at 10, and often at 11 for the children famous for
intransigence. Even I could stay out that late if I played in front
of the house so my own mother or sister or grandmother or aunt
could see me if they suddenly worried.
</P>
<P>
   We left that street, my friend and I, only to go to the movies,
the dentist or the library. We had at least four books to return
and four new ones to bring home every week.
</P>
<P>
   As I grew out of childhood into a young woman's wonderful
estate, I traveled by IRT and IND deeper and wider in Manhattan. I
had already found Greenwich Village, where the narrow streets
abutted one another in what I assumed was a foreign manner. There,
Jess Paley and I settled.
</P>
<P>
   Like true New Yorkers, for us, settling meant living in at least
three or four different apartments in the same neighborhood. Here,
we had two children, sent them to public school, shopped in the
Jefferson Market, had friends and were young. Our children played
in Washington Square Park, and the women who were my true friends
and beloved colleagues in that exhausting, often belittled task of
raising children gave me the gift of subject matter. Luckily, I had
for years read James Joyce for absolute standards, Gertrude Stein
for pleasure and permission to play, and Saul Bellow for
inescapable humor and the darkness of my immigrant people.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when I began to write, that is, with the assumption that
other people might read my work, what I feared most was a literary
world that seemed to insist on its own narcissistic reason for
being. I was finally drawn into it by nonliterary means, through
proximity and politics. For instance, my son was in the same
second-grade class as the daughter of Ted Wilentz, a co-owner with
his brother, Eli, of the fabled Eighth Street Bookstore. If that
bookstore were still in business _ along with others _ it would
broaden New York's claim to the title of book country.

FEMINIST ORGANIZATIONS COME TO CLINTON'S DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: CORRECTS 13th graf to 67 votes)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Leaders of prominent feminist organizations joined
forces Thursday to decry the role of President Clinton in the White
House sex scandal but to urge that he not be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``While women are angry and do not condone his conduct, women
want President Clinton to remain in office,'' 12 feminist
organizations declared in a joint statement. ``We believe, and the
women of this nation concur, that Mr. Clinton's actions are not
impeachable.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Ireland, the president of the National Organization for
Women, told a news conference that while she was offended by the
president's behavior, ``it does not rise to the level of
impeachable offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Pioneering feminist activist Betty Friedan joined in, saying:
``It does not serve women to try to hound this president out of
office on charges of sexual misdoing.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``I fear that we are on the brink of an era of sexual
McCarthyism.''
</P>
<P>
   The group _ which also includes Eleanor Smeal, president of the
Feminist Majority, Dolores Huerta, co-founder of the United Farm
Workers, and Yvonne Scruggs-Leftwich, executive director of the
Black Leadership Forum _ called on their supporters to press their
elected officials to oppose Clinton's removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   The women said Clinton has done more for women's rights than any
modern president, despite his alleged crimes and admitted sexual
misdeeds with a young intern in his employ.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we allow this (impeachment) process to continue,'' said
Kathy Rodgers, the executive director of the NOW Legal Defense and
Education Fund, ``the interests of women in particular will be
buried in the muck for generations to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Smeal warned that the sex scandal threatens to depress female
voter turnout in the Nov. 3 off-year congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not allow our disgust or disillusionment to keep women
from the polls in November,'' Smeal said.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the spokeswomen expressed concern about three Senate
races in which the female incumbents _ Sens. Barbara Boxer,
D-Calif., Carol Moseley-Braun, D-Ill., and Patty Murray, D-Wash. _
face tough fights. The three were voted into the Senate in 1992,
which feminists dubbed the Year of Women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We risk not only losing the gains of the Year of Women in 1992
in the 1998 congressional elections, but we risk years of
reactionary control of both Houses of Congress and perhaps the
presidency itself,'' Smeal said.
</P>
<P>
   If the three women senators lost their seats and if the
Republican majority in the Senate increased from its current 55
seats, Clinton's veto power would be diminished because of the
greater likelihood that his political foes could muster the 67
votes needed to override.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's veto of a bill banning late-term abortions was
sustained by only three votes in the Senate last week.
</P>
<P>
   The feminist leaders said their show of support for Clinton was
not coordinated with the White House or with the Democratic
National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Other organizations that signed the joint statement of support
for Clinton were: the National Council of Negro Women; the National
Council of Women's Organizations; the National Asian Pacific Legal
Consortium; Black Women United for Action; Wider Opportunities for
Women; the Black Leadership Forum; and the Women's Institute for
Freedom of the Press.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee will vote in early October on
whether to recommend that the House authorize an impeachment
investigation against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Any such probe would be based on Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr's 445-page report that centers around Clinton's affair with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and alleges 11 possible
grounds for impeachment, including allegations of perjury,
obstruction of justice, witness tampering and abuse of power in an
effort to conceal the relationship.

 NEW YORK: book country. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Wilentz apartment, above the store, was a literary gathering
place, and there I met, or rather watched, writers. In the late
'50s, my first book, ``The Little Disturbances of Man,'' was barely
out. Ted's wife at the time, Esta, was a good friend and, being
pretty shy herself, needed another member of the PTA to give her
emotional support in that highly charged circle. I was able to
observe the writers, mostly young Beats in action, and their women
in inaction, and I began to think about that fact. But what was
important to me were their voices aloud, the poem at last off the
page, a song.
</P>
<P>
   But my Bronx _ how it suffered in my absence _ saw its little
houses and short tenements battered and burned to the ground by
blasting highways, property greed and tenant rage, while I went on
living my domestic life on a side street in the Village. I managed
to raise children among a wild assortment of grown-ups, while
fighting successfully along with many others, like my present
husband, Robert Nichols, for the integrity of Washington Square.
</P>
<P>
   My other literary connections happened because my neighbor
Donald Barthelme thought I ought to work in PEN, the writers'
group. He was a little sorry about that later. This was in the
mid-'60s, and I put about 15 years into the various committees and
long board meetings. I couldn't help meeting writers then and, in
fact, liked a great many, even the ones I considered careerist and
self-centered. It's hard to dislike people once you know them.
</P>
<P>
   Along with a number of rightly furious women, I helped organize
the PEN women's committee, which exists today in a slightly
attenuated form, its work half finished. Women organizing on their
own behalf are never quite done.
</P>
<P>
   The years of the Vietnam War and the antiwar movement brought
many writers and artists together in readings, in street plays with
groups like the Bread and Puppet Theater. There were short plays on
the backs of trucks in all the neighborhoods, longer, more
ambitious ones like ``Everyman'' in the street right outside Judson
Church.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many ways in which Manhattan is reminded of its
island nature, but as ordinary life becomes hopelessly more
expensive, the young have begun to create their own young
city-dreaming communities of artists and writers, sprouting up
outside Manhattan _ in Brooklyn, Queens and even in my own Bronx,
which is engaged in a lively cultural transformation.
</P>
<P>
   I was asked to say something about how New York worked me,
dreamed me into becoming a writer. It just never stopped speaking
to me. The city continues to do this for others I've met in the
high schools and community colleges of our city, often speaking
with a Spanish accent. If only our neighborhoods were still marked
by bookstores, if my friends could still walk up and down Fourth
Avenue in search of secondhand books, why then we would indeed be
not only a publishing center in a state of terminal merger, but a
true book country as well.

   Readings, lectures, panel discussions and storytelling are among
the events to be offered over the next three days during the 20th
New York Is Book Country festival, which this year is part of New
York City 100: Greater New York Centennial Celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``One Hundred Years of Literary Life in New York'' is the theme
of the festival's centerpiece, the annual New York Is Book Country
fair, which takes place on Sunday along Fifth Avenue from 48th to
57th Street in Manhattan. Literary material from more than 195
exhibitors, from major publishers to small presses, will be
available from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., weather permitting; the fair,
which is free, may be canceled if it rains heavily. (Information in
the event of a cancellation: 212-207-7376.)
</P>
<P>
   Free maps of the booth sites will be available at an information
booth set up on the northwest corner of Fifth Avenue and 52nd
Street; several authors will be making appearances at the various
booths. This year special activities will be presented at two

   NEW YORK _ Welcome to heaven. Or more accurately, to heaven on
earth. That's the terrain mapped out in crisp, luminous detail in
``From van Eyck to Bruegel: Early Netherlandish Painting in the
Metropolitan Museum of Art.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is exactly what it says it is: a display of more than a
hundred 15th- and 16th-century Flemish paintings representing the
bulk of the Met's large and impressive collection of such material,
supplemented by period objects.
</P>
<P>
   The works range from multi-paneled altarpieces to devotional
images the size of a passport, and from gold-threaded tapestries to
carved boxwood rosary beads.
</P>
<P>
   Like the museum's recent Goya and Rembrandt exhibitions, this
one is entirely home-grown and lacks the glamour of flown-in loans
or fancy pedigrees. Who cares? It's been ages since this
charismatic art has been given a major showcase in this part of the
world. The Met is superbly equipped to do it justice and has gone
all-out for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Long-hidden paintings have been pulled from storage and dusted
off. Some familiar works _ the fabulous ``Harvesters'' by Pieter
Bruegel the Elder is one _ have been deep-cleaned, with revelatory
results. And while many top-flight pieces are routinely on view in
the museum, they are scattered, for legal reasons having to do with
bequests, hither and yon, from the Linsky collection to the Lehman
Wing to the Cloisters uptown.
</P>
<P>
   Now they have been drawn together in a dazzling show of
strength, though the big news is also old news: the unrivaled
genius of the Netherlandish artists who invented the oil paint
medium and the passionate, inventive vitality of a late medieval
culture that saw the natural and the supernatural worlds as mirror
images and the boundary between them as slight.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by Keith Christiansen, a curator of European painting
at the Met, and Maryan Ainsworth, a senior research fellow in
painting conservation, the show is arranged chronologically. And it
opens at the birth of the oil tradition, with an early diptych
painting of the Crucifixion and the Last Judgment attributed to
that most modest of revolutionaries (his motto was ``As best I
can''), Jan van Eyck.
</P>
<P>
   Painted around 1430, the two narrow vertical pictures are about
a foot and a half high. Joined, they resemble a large open book _ a
reminder of van Eyck's roots in manuscript painting _ and they
probably served as a portable altar for private devotion.
</P>
<P>
   Portability would have been an important requirement for
personal art commissioned in Bruges, a city whose cosmopolitan
population of merchants and princes ranged back and forth across
Europe. But whether this work traveled with its owner or stayed at
home, it was clearly conceived to have every inch of its minutely
rendered images scrutinized.
</P>
<P>
   Both painting repay close attention. The Last Judgment's vision
of Hell, for example, as a vast digestive system chewing up
sinners, is a true post-mortem nightmare. But the real gem is the
portrayal of the Crucifixion.
</P>
<P>
   The composition divides into three stacked zones, and the one at
the top, where agonized deaths are in progress, is the prettiest.
The three thin crosses are silhouetted against a travel-brochure
view of Jerusalem, in this case a fantastic cluster of European
turrets and Arabic domes with a sweep of snow-powdered alps behind.
</P>
<P>
   But grim details intrude: Christ's side gushes blood; the hands
of the thieves have turned black, their circulation cut off by
ropes. And on the hill below, in the second zone, a kind of jocular
chaos prevails. Mounted burghers network and grin; rubbernecking
servants, keyed-up as if for market day, jostle and push. They are
all hemmed in by a wall of soldiers dressed in medieval riot gear.
</P>
<P>
   A man in an ermine-trimmed coat and a major turban stares out
toward the viewer; he may be the painting's patron. Another man,
wearing a sort of samurai outfit, his head thrown back as if he had
just been slapped hard, stares up at Jesus. This is the Roman
centurion who, the gospels say, was converted on the spot, and van
Eyck shows his life being changed forever right before our eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Farther down, a third drama unfolds. The Virgin has retreated
into her voluminous cloak like a wounded animal into a cave. St.
John holds her fast in a pincer grip. A woman in green _ Mary
Magdalene? _ raises her hands, at once pleading and shielding her
eyes. Nearby stands a female figure as impassive as a Buddha. She
is usually identified as one of the ancient sybils who prophesied
this event and now witnesses its fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   This diptych is a cornerstone of the Met's European collection.
An Annunciation triptych known as the Merode Altarpiece, also on
view in the exhibition's first gallery, is another. Together they
define the essence of the Early Netherlandish style: profound
religious emotion cast in the language of everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   The Annunciation is attributed to Robert Campin and an
assistant, possibly Rogier van der Weyden. Campin is a shadowy
figure who worked in Tournai in the first half of the 15th century.
Many questions surround both the handful of works linked to his
name and his life. (He was once hauled into court for having a
mistress, though he may have been framed by professional rivals.)
But about the Merode Altarpiece one thing is sure. Nothing quite
like it had been seen in painting before.
</P>
<P>
   Here, for the first time, a key event of sacred history is
depicted as a domestic event squeezed in between breakfast and
lunch. In the painting's central panel, the blond Virgin is
discovered reading in her living room as unexpected visitors drop
by. One is the angel Gabriel, all in white with polychrome wings.
The other, the tiny unborn Jesus beamed in on rays of light.
</P>
<P>
   Their arrival has kicked up a breeze, snuffing out a candle on
the table but has otherwise caused no fuss. The Virgin barely
notices them. The aged Joseph, drilling away in his carpenter shop,
hears nothing. Only the paintings' patron, who kneels outside in
the courtyard garden with his wife and discreetly peeks through the
door, is aware that anything unusual is afoot.
</P>
<P>
   An ocean of academic ink has been spilled over this picture.
Every one of its details _ the smoking wick, the mousetrap Joseph
is making, the spray of lilies in a majolica jug _ have been passed
through endless interpretive filters in search of symbolic
meanings, submerged or overt.
</P>
<P>
   The present trend in scholarship, though, is to lighten up on
such queries and to consider instead the psychological impact that
work might have held for its original viewers: what, for example,
its endorsement of the nuclear family might have meant, or its
encouragement of devotion as a private, intimate exercise.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the implied sanctification of the bourgeois interior
paved the way for 17th-century Dutch genre painting, exemplified by
Vermeer. And the late-20th-century infatuation with
miniature-everything, from Beanie Babies to microchips, doesn't
hurt the works' appeal.
</P>
<P>
   And then, what New Yorker wouldn't identify with the clutter of
the Holy Family's jammed two-rooms-with-a-view apartment? Or with
Gabriel's barging in like a next-door neighbor with a problem? Or
with Mary's studied, subway-rider's resolve to keep her eyes glued
to the page till the end of the chapter, come what may?
</P>
<P>
   The acute realism pioneered in paintings like this had powerful
repercussions, particularly in portraiture, to which a section of
the show is devoted. Some of the likenesses appear in altarpieces
in which generous donors are seen receiving a favorite saint's
personal attention, a comforting pat on the back or a nudge in the
right direction.
</P>
<P>
   Just as often the context is secular. There isn't a jot of
sanctity in van der Weyden's portrait of the haughty, long-nosed
Francesco d'Este, who holds an emblem of princely power _ a hammer,
no less. Or in Hans Memling's portrait of Tommaso Portinari, head
of the Medici bank in the Lowlands, who looks nice enough but was
by all accounts one tough cookie.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Memling has made Tommaso's young wife, Maria,
with her fashionably shaved forehead and self-amused smile,
extremely appealing. And the French-born painter Jean Hey has
managed to lend a certain charm to the glum, 11-year-old Margaret
of Austria, seen in her betrothal portrait.
</P>
<P>
   His efforts, alas, were of little avail. Her husband-to-be,
Charles VIII of France, called the wedding off.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, one of the unexpected stars in this gallery is a
portrait of a praying man attributed to Robert Campin's workshop,
where the great van der Weyden trained. The painting, long
disfigured by layers of varnish, was recently cleaned with stunning
results. Every detail of the man's middle-aged face can now be
read, right down to the white stubble on his cheek, and his skin
glows with life.
</P>
<P>
   By no means everything in ``From van Eyck to Bruegel'' is on
such an exalted level. But the Met's decision to bring second- and
third-tier works out of mothballs was smart.
</P>
<P>
   As arranged here, they illustrate some of the nuts-and-bolts
issues behind any study of the period: how workshops and their
divisions of labor functioned; how, in the absence of signatures,
attributions are made and revised; how a master's style is changed
_ inflected, corrupted _ as it passes through assistants and
followers.
</P>
<P>
   The investigatory section where these matters are explored is,
in fact, a mini-show in itself, one of several embedded in the
larger exhibition. Another is the gathering of paintings by Gerard
David (circa 1455 to 1523), long regarded as a sleepy, by-the-way
figure but who was, this show suggests, something more than that.
</P>
<P>
   The Met owns the largest group of his paintings anywhere, and
they reveal an artist who shrewdly bridged periods and styles.
Although he lived and died in Bruges, he set up a workshop in
Antwerp, the city destined to be the center of northern art in the
16th century. And while the figures in his blissful little ``Rest
on the Flight Into Egypt'' sustain a Netherlandish reserve, the
wind-tossed cloak of an Annunciation angel has a proto-Baroque
flair.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of David's death, northern art had changed greatly.
Italian influence was pervasive. Religious painting assumed an
exaggerated sensuality, as in a ``Virgin and Child With Angels'' by
Bernaert van Orley in which mother and child smooch and pet like
lovers. And the local realist tradition, while still in place, was
transformed.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Penitence of St. Jerome'' by Joachim Patinir _ one of
several ravishing altarpieces that punctuate the installation like
organ chords _ the landscape that was a tiny detail in van Eyck's
Crucifixion has taken over the picture, leaving the religious drama
to play itself out along a narrow apron in the foreground.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with the Reformation, saints and angels fled the scene;
landscape stood on its own, and the exhibition concludes with an
outstanding example of that development, Bruegel's ``Harvesters.''
The picture, dated 1565, is among the museum's most popular
attractions, and one can see why. Its expanse of gold-brown and
mint green is both soothing and thrilling, and its exquisite detail
both describes and extols the world.
</P>
<P>
   And just as important, it seems to represents a different moral
universe from what has preceded it, one free of doctrine and
damnation, or the need to believe in anything except what is
actually (italics)there:(end italics) in this case, farmers going
about their jobs on a storm-threatened summer afternoon. This is a
down-to-earth, humanist art, post-religious, an Impressionism in
the making.
</P>
<P>
   Or is it? Humanism was its own kind of religion, a system of
faith and beliefs. It is fascinating to view Bruegel in this
context or, for that matter, to reconsider Netherlandish art as a
whole in light of stimulating recent scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   An article by Alfred Acres in the current Art Bulletin reads
Flemish altarpieces, including the Merode, in terms of their
manipulation of human and cosmic time. And the eye-opening work
that the historian Caroline Walker Bynum has done on the image of
the human body in medieval art adds a whole new dimensions to the
field, connecting it directly to the late 20th-century sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Van Eyck to Bruegel'' takes the more traditional route of
who-did-what-and-when connoisseurship, and pretty much sticks to
that. But it's hard to complain. A glorious art tradition has been
give the royal treatment; a superb collection is, at last, on full
view; unsuspected treasures have been brought to light.
</P>
<P>
   Other, smaller, ground-breaking shows will surely emerge from
this one. And at least for the next few months, a patch of Central
Park around 82nd Street is pretty close to paradise.

 &HT;    CONSUMER ELECTRONICS TO PASS Y2K MUSTER
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS

</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly all consumer electronics products now in
U.S. homes will go on ticking without taking a licking from the
millennium bug, an industry leader assured a congressional panel
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outlook is very good,'' Gary Shapiro, president of
Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association, told a House
technology subcommittee that is delving into the so-called ``Y2K''
glitch, which prevents computer systems from correctly recognizing
dates beyond Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, all consumer electronics products currently being
sold and the vast majority of consumer electronics products sold
(since 1988) will not experience Y2K problems,'' Shapiro said.
</P>
<P>
   That product list includes date-stamped TV sets, VCRs,
camcorders, fax machines, personal computers, microwaves,
thermostats and home automation and security products.
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Holleyman II, president of the Business Software
Alliance, painted a less rosy picture for his sector. As he put it:
``Without taking action, the consumer who uses software in the home
or office may indeed face some difficulty with some of the software
applications on their personal computers.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing is done, the year 2000 problem could make it
impossible for affected personal computer users from preparing
their income taxes, sending e-mail or surfing the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   One problem: When it comes to hardware and software, virtually
every computer system is unique. Therefore, Holleyman said, each
individual consumer must take responsibility for finding out
whether her or his particular configuration is Y2K ready.
</P>
<P>
   Software piracy also enters the picture, Holleyman noted,
because ``consumers who discover that they do not hold valid
licenses (for their software) may find themselves without the right
to obtain information from technical service and support, as well
as access to upgrades, fixes and patches.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Connie Morella, R-Md., said her House panel will prepare a
checklist for both the home and the marketplace to assist consumers
in coping with the millennium bug threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This checklist underscores the fact that the Year 2000 crisis
may be so vast and far-reaching that each and every single one of
us must assume some responsibility to be year-2000 ready,'' she
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MASHANTUCKET PEQUOT RESERVATION _ Friday night is a big fight
with a big difference for Dana Rosenblatt.
</P>
<P>
   If Rosenblatt can outlast former World Boxing Council and
International Boxing Federation junior middleweight champion Terry
Norris at Foxwoods Casino, he will have inched closer to what
Norris has already had a dozen times _ a world title fight. But for
that to happen, Rosenblatt has learned, he cannot want that shot
too much.
</P>
<P>
   It is a zen way of looking at boxing, a sport not often peered
at from the spiritual side. But Rosenblatt has long been the
thinking man's fighter, and that is the road he chose to follow on
the heels of his worst moments in the sport _ his stunning knockout
loss to Vinny Pazienza and the broken hand that followed it and
sidelined him for so many months that he began to wonder who he
really was.
</P>
<P>
   In that search, he believes, he found not only the answer to
that question but also the answer to why he lost to Pazienza and
how to avoid such an outcome when his moment arrives again, as it
may well do Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against Pazienza, I let the event get the better of me,''
Rosenblatt said recently after a long night of preparing for Norris
at the World Gym in Somerville, Mass. ``I won't let that happen
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mistake I made was not staying in college. If I had, I
could have put the Pazienza fight in a more proper perspective
because school broadens your perspective. You realize what you're
doing now is just a part of your life. Without that perspective,
you can overglorify things and the stress of it can overwhelm you.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what happened to me against Vinny. I wanted it so bad.
I was like a kid the night before Christmas who hopes for something
so bad he gets himself sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt and his tight group of advisers were all sick after a
bloodied and badly beaten Pazienza nailed him with an overhand
right to the face that knocked him into semiconsciousness just when
Rosenblatt seemed only minutes from victory. Rosenblatt went down
in a heap and was helpless when he got up, his body in Atlantic
City but his mind on siesta. So referee Tony Orlando wisely stopped
the bout with Rosenblatt slumped on the ropes and a frenzied
Pazienza continuing to pummel him.
</P>
<P>
   Such a beating came as a shock to the then undefeated
Rosenblatt. To have lost when things seemed to be so right was
troubling. And when that disappoinment was immediately followed by
a gutsy victory over Glenwood Brown in which he fought most of the
night with a broken hand, his confusion about the vagaries of the
boxer's life began to overwhelm him.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Rosenblatt was unable to train, and when he came
back too soon, he again broke the bones his first night in the gym.
They were not all that he shattered that evening.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Rosenblatt was now adrift. Boxing had been for too long his
anchor in life. It was not only what he did but it had slowly
become who he was. Now he could not box, so what was he left with?
</P>
<P>
   ``After I broke my hand, I realized what the real story was,''
Rosenblatt said of the 15-month layoff that followed. ``It's great
when you're on top and everyone's making a buck off your success,
but when you need to rebuild, some of those people are there and
some of them aren't. The ones who aren't are conspicuous by their
absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Top Rank (Bob Arum's promotional company) was still with us,
but you no longer get the same attention. I'm not sour on the game
because of that, but I unfortunately look at it as a business now.
I still love boxing, but when I was off with my injury, I lost my
identity. I had no other source of enjoyment. All I did was sit
around and look at old tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the rigors of being a professional boxer wear on you.
You have a trainer and your family, but you carry the load. There's
no dissemination of the responsibility, and that sucks a lot out of
you. I understand now why some guys at the end are used up. They
leave their souls in the gym.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt could not accept that, just as he could not accept
that his loss to Pazienza would be not only the low point but also
the high point of his boxing career. He could not accept that he
would lose himself in a stuffy gymnasium or that he would lose his
career to a bad hand and a bad night.
</P>
<P>
   So the 26-year-old middleweight from Malden, Mass., did the
things he's trained himself to do. He thought things out first,
reviewing how he had gotten to this moment and what he had allowed
boxing to become. Then he fought back, something he intends to do
again Friday night against Norris. If the fight ends spectacularly
enough, it could convince Arum to try to match him with one of the
reigning junior middleweight champions if he cannot make a deal
with the middleweight titleholders controlled by rival promoter Don
King.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Rosenblatt will enter the ring looking at Norris far
differently than he did Pazienza. The desire to destroy him to
further his own ends will be vivid as always, but it will be about
business, not obsession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've changed my perspective on a lot of things,'' Rosenblatt
said. ``I used to pin my whole existence on each and every fight,
each and every round. I no longer do that. It doesn't help me. It
just adds to the tension, and you end up not being able to see the
forest for the trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very important day in my life. It has ramifications
for me. But I understand it for what it is ... and for what it is
not. I don't hinge my existence on boxing anymore. That doesn't
reflect on my wanting to succeed. I still want to win as much as
before. I'm just calmer about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to cause myself problems by trying to do too much. It
made me nuts. I learned after the Pazienza fight that when you're
just doing what you can do, you do it comfortably and you do it
well. When you try to do more than that, it wears you down. It
makes you weaker, not stronger. I'm stronger for this fight (than
for Pazienza). I know I've done everything I possibly could to get
ready for this moment. Now it's time to perform.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt (32-1, 24 knockouts) assumes he will be given that
opportunity by an aggressive Norris. Norris (47-7, 31 KOs) is a
well-respected power puncher who is himself staring at a crossroads
after being stopped by WBC junior middleweight champion Keith
Mullings 10 months ago. Since then, Norris has done little but bide
his time and try to get over the shock of not only losing a world
title but also blowing a promised multimillion-dollar payday with
Oscar De La Hoya after abandoning one with Felix Trinidad to take a
chance on more riches with De La Hoya and his promoter, Arum.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly, it appeared he would return to the ring in June against
old rival Julian Jackson, but that fight fell through, so the
boxing life has brought him to this moment _ a one-night meeting of
two fighters at a crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   One is young and just beginning to figure out what the boxing
game is really all about. The other is a 31-year-old ex-champion
who has been knocked cold too many times for his resume not to be
perceived these days as having a few holes in it. There is no more
margin of error left for Terry Norris and precious little of it for
Dana Rosenblatt. On that point, at least, all sides agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loser is in trouble,'' said Joe Lake, Rosenblatt's
longtime trainer. ``Dana feels he belongs in the eilte. He feels he
can compete with the best middleweights out there, so why not with
a junior middleweight, even an elite junior middleweight?
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you keep fighting for $20,000 or step it up? You beat a
Terry Norris in spectacular fashion and you're right there. I'm
sure Norris was told Dana is ordinary. Got no sizzle. Everyone who
comes to fight Dana sees a white kid who doesn't look spectacular
on tape. They all think they can win until he hits them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dana and Terry are in the same situation in one way. They both
had a hard loss. But Norris is on his last legs. He loses and he's
through. We took our loss, too, and now we gotta win. That's the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Norris may be on the shady side of the hill, he is
clearly the best fighter Rosenblatt has faced, and the most
dangerous. So the younger man believes he knows what to expect from
him when the first bell sounds Friday night and the two go out to
fight for their fistic lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll come out early to test the white, Jewish kid,''
Rosenblatt said, a smile creasing his face as he spoke. ``I think
he'll be surprised that I can do more than he thought. I'm ready to
beat him down. Outbox him. Have my way with him without getting
extravagant. I'm not looking to be exciting this fight, like with
Vinny. I'm just looking to win.''
</P>
<P>
   If he can just do that, it will be quite a night for Dana
Rosenblatt. Quite a night and quite enough. Quite enough, indeed.

INDIA WILLING TO SIGN TEST BAN TREATY, PRIME MINISTER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Miss., Ariz.)  (lh) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ India joined Pakistan Thursday in announcing
that it is prepared to sign the international treaty banning
nuclear testing within the next year, but said it is still
discussing details with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, speaking to the U.N.
General Assembly, said India had satisfied its security concerns
with its nuclear tests in May and is ready to cooperate in bringing
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty into force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are prepared to bring these discussions to a successful
conclusion so that the entry into force of the treaty is not
delayed beyond September 1999,'' Vajpayee said. The prime minister,
whose party is backed by Hindu nationalist organizations, spoke in
Hindi, breaking a long tradition of Indian leaders who spoke in
English at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration reacted cautiously to Vajpayee's
statement Thursday and to a similar pledge by Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif of Pakistan, who spoke on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously much remains to be done,'' Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright told reporters here. She mentioned, for example,
the actual signing and ratification of the treaty, as well as the
strengthening of export controls by both countries and other steps
needed to bring India and Pakistan into full compliance with
international arms control agreements.
</P>
<P>
   If India and Pakistan carry out their pledges, North Korea will
stand alone in refusing to sign the treaty, and its refusal could
still prevent it from going into force a year from now, the
deadline for ratification set by a U.N. conference two years ago.
At that time, India opposed the treaty and tried to block its
passage. The Clinton administration has been negotiating with India
to change its approach.
</P>
<P>
   Both Vajpayee and Sharif lead governments that are vulnerable to
swings in public opinion fostered by their political enemies.
Nuclear testing has been popular in both countries, and intentions
stated here _ however qualified _ could unravel in the arena of
South Asian politics. India's scientific and nuclear establishment
has a large stake in the weapons program there, as the Pakistani
military does in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-four countries with nuclear reactors _ though not
necessarily nuclear weapons _ must ratify the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty for it to take effect. Ten have done so. The United
States has signed, but the treaty is on hold in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, opponents of the treaty accused President Clinton
of bargaining away sanctions on India that were imposed after its
nuclear tests in May, in return for Indian support for the test-ban
treaty and another treaty barring the spread of nuclear weapons and
arms technology.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions were also imposed on Pakistan, which followed India
with tests of its own in May. On Wednesday, Sharif of Pakistan tied
the lifting of sanctions to his promise to sign the test-ban
accord. Sanctions have hit Pakistan hard.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to President Clinton last week, three Republican
senators _ Jesse Helms of North Carolina, who is chairman of the
Foreign Relations Committee; Trent Lott of Mississippi, who is the
majority leader, and Jon Kyl of Arizona _ said they opposed lifting
sanctions as a price for adhering to nuclear agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the recent Indian nuclear tests demonstrated, the CTBT is
not adequately verifiable,'' the senators wrote. They said they
also opposed the export of high-technology goods to India and the
sharing of scientific information that can be used in nuclear
programs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Talks between the United States and India and Pakistan have been
going on almost continuously since their nuclear tests. The Indian
tests surprised and embarrassed the U.S. intelligence services, and
made tests by Pakistan virtually inevitable because of the rivalry
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott has been shuttling to
various meetings with South Asian officials. As the talks
progressed, arms control experts said, the bite of sanctions was
beginning to be felt in India as well as in Pakistan, and both
countries had reason to negotiate an end to their isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee said Thursday that India had accepted the principles of
the test ban treaty since its nuclear tests in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``After concluding this limited testing program, India announced
a voluntary moratorium on further underground nuclear explosions,''
he said. ``We conveyed our willingness to move toward a de jure
formalization of this obligation. In announcing a moratorium, India
has already accepted the basic obligation of the CTBT.'' &QL;

   MIAMI _ Hurricane Georges continued its treacherous trek away
from Cuba late Thursday, and followed a path directed at the
Florida Keys, as rescuers carried out the grim task of pulling
bodies from mudslides and collapsed houses on the island of
Hispaniola.
</P>
<P>
   At least 116 people have died and hundreds more were missing
since the deadly storm began its rampage across the Caribbean last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   A hurricane warning alerting people to hurricane conditions --
or winds of at least 74 mph -- within 24 hours was raised for
nearly four million residents in South Florida early Thursday,
closing schools and most offices.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency preparedness officials urged 540,000 people who live
in flood-prone areas to leave their homes. That included the flashy
condominiums on Miami Beach and the more-modest dwellings in
Homestead, a city hard-hit by Hurricane Andrew in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Packing gusts of up to 175 mph, Andrew inflicted $30 billion in
damage on South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   At Miami's Metrozoo, which has still not repaired all the damage
caused by Andrew, workers started moving animals to safety Thursday
morning. Officials ordered people living in mobile homes to move to
shelters or hotels. Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles declared a state of
emergency, allowing the state to use the National Guard and lift
tolls along evacuation routes.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout South Florida, residents continued to pack hardware
stores in search of scarce pieces of plywood to board up their
homes. Others were glued to their televisions as local stations
reported around-the-clock on everything from what to do with pets
to what to include in a first-aid kit.
</P>
<P>
   With Georges approaching, NASA decided to haul the space shuttle
Discovery off its launch pad in Cape Canaveral, although its
lift-off on Oct. 29 was not likely to be delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also ordered some 80,000 residents of the Florida
Keys, where the storm is most likely to strike land in the United
States, to evacuate the 110-mile-long string of islands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people who have stayed behind (in the Keys), you are
taking a tremendous risk,'' said National Hurricane Center director
Jerry Jarrell.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m. EDT, the storm's center was about 255 miles southeast
of Key West. It was moving west-northwest at 14 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Sustaining winds of 80 mph, Georges was barely at hurricane
strength. But forecasters expected it to intensify to a Category 2
hurricane -- with winds between 96 and 110 mph -- as it moved out
over the warm waters of the Florida Straits overnight Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said that the Federal Emergency Management
Agency's six emergency response teams for the southeastern United
States had arrived in Tallahassee in anticipation of the storm.
</P>
<P>
   An agency spokeswoman added that FEMA has also set up a
mobilization center at Jacksonville's Naval Air Station on
Thursday, and had begun moving relief supplies and equipment --
such as generators and sleeping bags -- closer to the potentially
affected areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Caribbean islands, businesses and homes have been swept
away,'' Clinton said during a White House news conference. ``We're
helping people in Florida prepare for the hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   Over a 24-hour period, the storm dumped nearly a foot of rain
across eastern Cuba, where officials evacuated 500,000 people,
including thousands of tourists from resorts along the northern
coast.
</P>
<P>
   Georges destroyed crops, damaged infrastructure, and battered
coastlines with 20-foot waves.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban President Fidel Castro appeared on television Thursday for
the second day in a row to warn that even though Georges appeared
to be moving off the northern coast ``we can't be too trusting
because hurricanes play tricks.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Dominican Republic, which shares Hispaniola with
Haiti, appeared to bear the brunt of Georges' wrath so far.
</P>
<P>
   Dominican Republic President Leonel Fernandez said Thursday that
at least 70 people were dead and hundreds more were missing, while
100,000 people were homeless. Almost all electrical service was
wiped out, and the main airport remained closed. About 90 percent
of the agricultural crop was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The missing included 45 people who disappeared after the storm
washed a school shelter away on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez appealed for international aid, calling the storm ``a
national tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pray, and ask the Almighty to help the destiny of our
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Haiti, a desperately poor country of flimsy homes and a
fragile infrastructure, Georges killed 27 people and injured 29.
Many more were missing.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations Development Program donated $100,000 for
disaster relief in Haiti, while the U.S. government donated water,
food, blankets, sheets, and clothing.
</P>
<P>
   In Puerto Rico, Georges inflicted an estimated $2 billion in
damages. Electricity was out across the U.S. territory of 3.8
million people, and service may not be restored in some places for
months.

 &HT;    POVERTY DOWN, INCOMES UP, CENSUS BUREAU REPORTS
 &HT;    With INCOME-DATA.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A strong economy has reduced poverty and raised
household income to their best levels in a decade, the Census
Bureau reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The South and West have fared especially well, helping to lift
millions of African Americans and Hispanics out of poverty, the
bureau said in an annual report.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, speaking in the White House Rose Garden, said
the data represent ``one more year's worth of compelling evidence''
that his ``economic strategy is working.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the nation's economic gains under Clinton have done no
more than make up the ground lost during the 1989 recession,
prompting anti-poverty advocates to suggest further policy changes
to help poor and working families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're only halfway there,'' said Deborah Weinstein, an
official of the Children's Defense Fund. ``The economy is strong,
but supports for working poor families are weak.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the new data, the share of Americans living in
poverty declined from 13.7 percent in 1996 to 13.3 percent last
year, the third straight year of declines. That translates to 35.6
million Americans living below federal poverty levels, which vary
for different-sized families.
</P>
<P>
   During the same period, the median household income, adjusted
for inflation, rose 1.9 percent to $37,005.
</P>
<P>
   Regionally, the South recorded the largest percentage increase
in the median household income, 3.6 percent to $34,345, followed by
the West with 3.1 percent to $39,162, the Midwest with 2.4 percent
to $38,316 and the Northeast with virtually no change to $38,929.
</P>
<P>
   The West experienced the largest decline in poverty rates, 0.8
percent, followed by the South with 0.5 percent, the Midwest with
0.3 percent, and the Northeast with 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While the poverty rates for African Americans and Hispanics both
declined more than two percentage points in 1997, the country's two
major ethnic groups continue to be disproportionately represented
among the poor. Together, the two groups make up 22.8 percent of
the U.S. population but account for 47.8 percent of Americans
living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The new data also showed two long-term trends relatively
unchanged in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of those over 65 years of age in poverty dropped
to 10.5 percent, while the number of children in poverty remained
nearly double the elderly rate, 19.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the richest one-fifth of Americans continued to earn
about eight times as much aggregate income as the poorest
one-fifth, $126,550 compared to $15,400.
</P>
<P>
   This income inequality ``is still too high,'' Clinton said at
the White House. ``We have to use our prosperity, and the
confidence it inspires, to help our hardest-pressed families and
our hardest-pressed communities to ensure economic growth for all
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   In an anaylsis of poverty data released in advance of the Census
Bureau report, the Heritage Foundation, a conservative public
policy organization, noted that the bulk of the poor in American
today live in material conditions that would have been judged
``comfortable and well-off `` just a few generations ago.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Americans are ``better housed, better fed, and own more
personal property than average Americans throughout most of this
century,'' said Robert Rector, a senior analyst at the Heritage
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   But the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a
liberal-oriented nonprofit organization, said the stength of the
economy and the lowest inflation rates in decades should have
reduced poverty rates even more than the decline recorded between
1996 and 1997.

DEAN OF THE 505S COMPETES IN 38TH WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HYANNIS, Mass. _ Cal Ripken finally sat one out, and so,
Wednesday, did Marcel Buffet.
</P>
<P>
   The big difference is that Buffet, the 76-year-old sailor from
LaCell, France, still has his streak intact. In the International
505 World Championships here this week, he is making his 38th
appearance. No one is even close.
</P>
<P>
   Given the one throwout score each boat is allowed, Buffet, still
lean and athletic with white hair framing a deeply tanned face,
decided that Wednesday's 25-knot winds here just might make this
the race to sit out.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the wind blows like this,'' said Buffet in his heavy
French accent, ``I like it. I like strong wind, but I don't think
strong wind likes me.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from this regatta, Buffet races his 505, a high-tech
thoroughbred racing dinghy requiring equal parts quick thinking and
physical stamina, 130 days a year and has logged more than 4,000
regattas in his long career.
</P>
<P>
   The world championships that cap each season and bring sailors
from as far afield as Australia, Europe, and South Africa are the
focus of all 107 sailors here.
</P>
<P>
   This year a Massachusetts sailor _ Nick Trotman from Manchester
_ stands to win the worlds for the first time since 1982, when Gary
Knapp and Cam Lewis won it in Cork, Ireland. The year before in San
Francisco, Lewis crewed for Ethan Bixby in a winning entry, and in
1979, Steve Taylor from Yale won the regatta in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Trotman, 27, who sailed for Tufts, has been honing his 505
skills since his college days. He has been on the Team Racing World
Championship squad for the last five years and placed ninth in the
'95 world championships. For the past two years, Trotman and
crewmate Mike Mills have been among the top three teams on the East
Coast and narrowly missed winning last year's North American
Championships before winning the Canadian Championships this year.
</P>
<P>
   Racking up impressive finishes all week, including two firsts
and a second, Trotman said he and Mills are closing in on ``the No.
1 goal in my life right now. I just want to pull this regatta
off.''
</P>
<P>
   As with most 505 sailors, Trotman's devotion to this class grows
out of a belief that this double-handed dinghy is the best racer of
its size in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I raced my first one in my freshman year (of college),'' said
Trotman, who has also raced Lasers. ``(505s) are really fun to
sail, especially on days like (Wednesday) when it blows. They just
fly.''
</P>
<P>
   As a cold front blew through the region, winds rose to 25 knots
off Hyannis, and the seas built to more than 5 feet. After some
light-air days, this was the day when the 505s lived up to their
reputation as high-powered, high-performance planing boats.
</P>
<P>
   The 505 is a one-design boat with emphasis on a dizzying number
of controls that sailors use to get maximum speed out of the sails
and hull in whatever conditions they face.
</P>
<P>
   The sailplan and hull shape are highly controlled by the rules,
but rigging layout, spars, and foils are open to a variety of
approaches. This allows customizing of rigs that, when thrown
together at a large regatta such as the worlds, can prove decisive.
Most US boats have adjustable shrouds, forestay, and mast ram _ all
of which allow the rig tension, rake, and bend of the mast to be
changed during competition. Technical mastery of this very
high-tech boat is thus part of the 505 sailor's repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the technical aspects, sailors describe the 505 in
terms of exhilarating speed and power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me cut through the bull,'' said Allan Freedman, crew for
Rene De La Rie. ``Sailing a 505 in a breeze is the closest to God
you can get in any boat. When it's blowing 25, you surf off the
waves and you're flying. There's very little between yourself and
nature. You lose all sense of self. It just disappears, and you
just have this complete joy. It's just amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is what keeps Marcel Buffet coming back. And back and
back. Traveling with him is his wife, Huguette, who watches most of
his races through the year and ``makes the sandwiches,'' he said.
Buffet trains at a health club at least three times a week, rides a
bicycle, and swims at his health club for at least an hour a day.
But his tremendous fitness, he says, comes from sailing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This boat requires that you be active,'' he said, understating
the fact. ``You must move all the time, and there is need to have
strength and stamina.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffet puts 30,000 miles a year on his car, trailing his 505 all
over Europe to regattas. His job as a traveling salesman allowed
him to mix work and play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love being out there,'' he said. ``The wind and water,
the conditions, whatever they are ... it is all a pleasure for
me.''

 &HT;    EPA Moves Against Interstate Smog
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ New federal regulations will require 22 Eastern
states to cut pollution by smog-causing nitrogen oxide a total of
more than 1.1 million tons during the next eight years, the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   EPA Administrator Carol M. Browner said most of the reductions
likely will come from new emission standards state officials will
impose on electric power plants, the largest and least-controlled
sources of the air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   She said the cost to power companies likely will add about $1 a
month to the average residential electric bill.
</P>
<P>
   EPA ordered the reductions but did not dictate where they must
be made. Browner said the most cost-effective means of meeting
mandated limits will be for state officials to take action against
the power industry.
</P>
<P>
   She said technologies needed to clean up industrial sources of
the pollution already are available.
</P>
<P>
   The regulation covers all states east of the Mississippi River
except Florida, Mississippi, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Affected states were assigned maximum levels of nitrogen oxides,
known as ``NOx,'' emissions they cannot legally exceed after 2007.
</P>
<P>
   The move was hailed by environmental groups, which have long
pressed federal officials to take action to limit nitrogen oxide
emissions that drift from state to state.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, several states that believe much of their smog
problems come from industrial smokestacks in other states had
petitioned EPA to restrict the emissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is truly an historic action, one that will mean cleaner
air throughout the Midwest and the East,'' said Frank O'Donnell,
executive director of the Clean Air Trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``EPA has stood with the public and not with the polluters
today,'' said Jennifer Lyons, a spokesperson for the Georgia
AirKeepers Campaign. ``Now it is up to the state of Georgia and the
Southern Co. to implement this plan in a meaningful way to protect
public health.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan would reduce emissions that otherwise would occur that
year _ given expected growth between now and then _ by an average
of 28 percent, EPA officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``By 2007 we anticipate that this action will cut 1.1 million
tons of nitrogen oxide emissions each year in these states,''
Browner said. ``As a result of this action, 138 million Americans
living in the eastern United States will breathe cleaner air.''
</P>
<P>
   She said 31 million people will for the first time breathe air
that meets national public health standards for smog.
</P>
<P>
   Browner said EPA estimated that the annual cost of meeting the
limits will be $1.7 billion in the 22 states. The benefits,
primarily in reduced respiratory illness in urban areas, will be
$3.4 billion, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Modernizing a typical coal-burning power plant to achieve the
mandated reductions would cost about $4.5 million annually, she
said. Such a plant has revenues of $130 million a year.

ELLSWORTH KELLY ON THE WALL IN BOSTON; MANOOGIAN LEAVES THE ART
WORLD; A NEW DEALER FOR MORRIS LOUIS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Mich., N.Y.)  (js) 
 BY CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In May, New York celebrated Ellsworth Kelly's 75th
birthday, opening an exhibition of five of his sculptures on the
roof of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. There were also two other
Kelly shows in town, at Matthew Marks' Chelsea galleries, one of a
1957 wall sculpture and the other of recent paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's Boston's turn to toast the post-war American artist.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Boston's new U.S. courthouse opens to the public,
and throughout the building is ``The Boston Panels'' (1998), the
largest wall sculpture ever created by Kelly. Meanwhile, several
local museums are also showing the artist's work. For Kelly, this
is a home-coming of sorts. The artist graduated from the Boston
Museum School, now the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, in 1948.
He said he remembered his student days when he would go down to
Atlantic Avenue, near the South Boston waterfront where the
courthouse is located, to buy his canvases and art supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would have thought I would be asked to create a large
sculpture here?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those visiting the courthouse, which has been designed by Henry
Cobb, a partner of the New York architectural firm of Pei Cobb
Freed &AMP; Partners, will see 21 brilliantly colored aluminum panels
installed as a single work throughout the building. In the
courthouse's central rotunda, a space 90 feet high and 45 feet in
diameter, nine horizontal panels, 11 feet by 13-and-a-half feet,
create a visual tension against the curved walls. From the rotunda,
visitors can see 12 other vertical colored panels, 11 feet by 88
inches, on each floor of the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all the public places you can see fragments of color,''
said Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   At night, from the harbor, the panels act as beacons of color,
punctuating all three floors.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly was chosen by a committee of community representatives,
including U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, who is from
Boston, and federal Judge Douglas Woodlock, along with several arts
professionals and Cobb. The committee was formed under the auspices
of the General Services Administration in Washington. Kelly was
chosen from over 380 artists who made submissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Ellsworth Kelly's first commission from us,'' said
Barbara Harrison, who is the chief of the Art and Architecture
program for the General Services Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Cobb, the architect, knew who the artist involved
would be, he said he left places deliberately incomplete
specifically for an artwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were the only pure white surfaces,'' he said. ``The rest
of the building is brick. You encounter Ellsworth Kelly as you move
throughout the building. The panels and the walls talk to each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who want to see examples of Kelly's work from different
periods of his career can visit the Museum of Fine Arts Boston,
where a painting from 1952, ``Tableau Vert,'' along with four water
lily drawings from 1968, are part of ``Reflections of Monet,'' a
companion show to its blockbuster ``Monet in the 20th Century.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University, there are four Kelly
paintings _ one from the 1960s, two from the 1970s and one from the
1980s _ that make up ``Black with Color: Four Paintings by
Ellsworth Kelly.'' The show is in anticipation of a larger
traveling exhibition of the artist's drawings dating from 1948-54
that opens at the Fogg in April.
</P>
<P>
   An exhibition of Kelly's recent prints is currently on view at
the Boston University Art Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all timed our projects with the opening of the
courthouse so the public could get a greater understanding of
Kelly's work,'' said John Stomberg, director of the Boston
University gallery.
</P>
<P>
   A Collection for Sale
</P>
<P>
   In the world of American paintings, Richard Manoogian is a big
player. As chairman of Masco Corp., the Detroit-based leader in
home improvement and building equipment, he has been a major buyer
in the field, both for himself and for Masco. The corporation also
owns Beacon Hill, an American art gallery at 980 Madison Ave.
</P>
<P>
   But when Masco divested itself of its furniture division two
years ago, it began reviewing its various other activities and
eventually decided to get out of the art business, Manoogian said.
So at the end of the year it will be closing Beacon Hill. And this
fall it will be selling off its corporate art collection at
Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a corporate decision,'' Manoogian said. ``We decided
it was best to focus our resources in other areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The works for sale at Sotheby's consist primarily of American
paintings but include some European works. While Manoogian said he
was still in the process of deciding what would be sold, sources
close to the auction house said they believed he was selling about
$10 million worth of art.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Debra Force, director of Beacon Hill, said she
planned to sell the gallery's inventory, which consists of a few
hundred American paintings, privately. Once the gallery closes, she
said, she will become a private dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Manoogian stressed that he still plans to buy American art for
himself. So far his collection ranges from mid 19th-century
landscapes through the Ash Can school of the early 20th-century.
</P>
<P>
   New Dealer for Louis
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The estate of the color-field painter Morris Louis,
who has been represented by the Andre Emmerich Gallery, will now be
handled by Diane Upright, a private dealer who wrote the artist's
catalog raissonne.
</P>
<P>
   Louis' work had been handled by Emmerich for more than 30 years,
during his lifetime and after the artist's death in 1962. But Ann
Garfinkle, Louis' estate lawyer thought it was time for a change.
After last week's news that the Emmerich Gallery at 41 E. 57th St.,
which was bought by Sotheby's two years ago, was closing its doors
next month, and that its artists would be handled out of Deitch
Projects, the Grand Street gallery of which the auction house owns
50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morris Louis belongs in upper Manhattan,'' Ms. Garfinkle said.

 &HT;    CLINTON CHALLENGES CONGRESS TO ADDRESS HIS ISSUES
 &HT;    470&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Challenging Congress to turn away from the rhetoric
of impeachment and ''think about the American people,'' President
Clinton called Thursday for action on issues ranging from education
to shoring up the global banking system.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is utterly foolish for people to be diverted or distracted
from the urgent challenges still before us,'' Clinton said during a
White House event in the Rose Garden intended to spotlight recent
economic gains.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he saw any way of avoiding House impeachment
proceedings, Clinton fired off a list of other matters he said
matter more.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way out here, and the only way out, is for people in
Washington to do what the folks in America want them to do, which
is to take care of their concerns, their children, and their
future,'' Clinton said. ''That's what I mean to do, and I'm going
to do my best.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks continued a campaign he embarked upon two
weeks ago to largely ignore the sex and deception scandal that has
enmeshed his presidency and engage an array of high-profile
domestic and international issues.
</P>
<P>
   Aides say, however, that Clinton is continuing to work on the
Monica Lewinsky matter behind the scenes with legislators and
clerics _ and with the help of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton,
who's been making telephone calls on his behalf to key Democrats on
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   With Congress set to recess Oct. 9 to allow members to campaign
for the Nov. 3 midterm elections, Clinton chided lawmakers for not
fully funding his proposals to hire 100,000 new teachers for public
schools across the country, to rehabilitate or expand 5,000 public
schools, and to connect schools in low-income areas to the Internet
computer network.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also called on Congress to pass a ''Patients' Bill of
Rights'' aimed at protecting low-income and medium-income Americans
from being denied quality health care in times of dire need.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our bill would provide protections to all Americans, simple
ones,'' Clinton said. ''If you get in an accident, you can go to
the nearest emergency room, not be hauled to one halfway across
town. If your doctor tells you, 'You need to see a specialist,' you
can see one. If it comes down to a dispute about whether a medical
procedure should or should not be applied, the decision should be
made by a doctor, not an accountant.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have set forth their own health-care protection
plan, but Clinton has criticized it as inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also hammered House Republicans for failing to pass his
request for $17.9 billion in additional deposits in the
International Monetary Fund. The money is needed, Clinton said, to
help replenish the fund, which has been largely depleted over the
past 18 months by efforts to prop up a series of crumbling
economies across the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ''The International Monetary Fund helps the countries that are
helping themselves to return to growth and serves as an insurance
policy against having the financial crisis spread to the countries
that are doing the right thing and keeping Americans
</P>
<P>
   at work by buying our products,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no reason not to do this,'' Clinton said. ''It's what
America owes as the world leader and ...it is absolutely necessary
to keep American economic growth going.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton's legal team continued working with House members to
try to head off impeachment proceedings, White House aides said
Mrs. Clinton has been working the telephones to try to smooth
roiled relations between the president and key Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why she had become involved, White House spokesman Michael
McCurry responded, ''I presume because she loves her husband and
she supports him.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry stressed that the First Lady's liaison role was likely
her own idea, not the president's.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think the president is in a position to make that
request of her,'' McCurry told reporters. ''I think that is
something that she, being gracious as she is, volunteers to do. It
would be consistent with who she is and what she's about.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's press spokeswoman, Marsha Berry, confirmed the
recent contacts, but would not name the members called nor specify
the nature of the conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's certainly making clear to them that she's proud of her
husband,'' said Berry. ''She's just showing her continued support
for the president.''

NIGERIAN PRESIDENT MEETS WITH PRESS TO DISCUSS NATION'S POLITICAL
FUTURE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, who became president
of Nigeria in June by an accident of fate, came to the United
States this week determined to convince skeptics that his
government will be short-lived, open and incorruptible, and that
the country had finally turned the corner to democracy after years
of military rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come next May, we will hand over to the elected government,''
said Abubakar, a low-key reformer who succeeded one of Africa's
most destructive dictators, Gen. Sani Abacha, who died of a heart
attack on June 8. The date with democracy, Abubakar said Thursday,
is ``sacrosanct.''
</P>
<P>
   Abubakar, meeting with reporters at a breakfast that ranked only
slightly below lavish in a glittering dining room at the Palace
Hotel on Madison Avenue _a reminder of the immense wealth that
official Nigeria has at its disposal _ laid out the political steps
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In December local elections will take place, followed by voting
for state governors and legislators in January. In February an
election for president and a national assembly will be held, with
the formal handover of power three months later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back home the political parties are busy forming,'' he said.
``They are forging alliances, and the campaigning is going on for
elections.'' He invited Nigerians abroad to ``come back home and
work together with us.'' Abubakar, 56, said that after his interim
presidency ends, he plans to retire from any military and political
roles.
</P>
<P>
   The general, a measured speaker who seldom smiles, has won the
confidence of American and European officials during his three
months in power.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the European Union's development commissioner, Joao
de Deus Pinheiro, called for an easing of sanctions on Nigeria as a
reward for Abubakar's promise to restore democracy. Sanctions were
imposed in 1995 after the Abacha government executed Ken Saro-Wiwa
and eight other advocates of the Ogoni people.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is sending a team of political specialists to
Nigeria this week to advise the government on organizing elections.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan visited the country in the summer and
aides say he came away convinced that the new government was making
an earnest effort to listen to the Nigerian people.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who attended a Security
Council meeting here Thursday on Africa, praised Abubakar for
``systematically taking steps to bring Nigeria back into the world
community.''

   Abubakar, who addressed the General Assembly Thursday, met
President Clinton in Washington on Wednesday. The Nigerian
president, who described Clinton as one of the few world leaders
really interested in his country, said he was told that if he
stayed on his democratic course, the United States was prepared to
help win some debt relief from international lending institutions
and might also allow the resumption of direct flights to and from
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are quite a number of Nigerians here and they have a
problem getting home,'' Abubakar said Thursday.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Turning to the issue of corruption, for which Nigeria, under a
series of military rulers, has made itself notorious worldwide,
Abubakar said that ``government transactions will now be
transparent and open and whatever contracts are going to be given
will be done by open bidding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On the issue of freedom of speech and association,'' he said,
``we have done all we can to make these things as easy as it is all
over the world. There is freedom of association, there is freedom
of press. In Nigeria, licenses are being given now to private
organizations to set up radio and television stations. We have well
over 200, 300 newspapers and magazine circulating without any
hindrance.''
</P>
<P>
   Abubakar said that new rules governing political parties and the
electoral process have been introduced to meet the challenge of
ethnicity and tribal warfare, which has torn Nigeria apart in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Nigeria we have well over 250 tribes and ethnic
groupings,'' he said. ``Certainly it would not augur well for the
country if parties are formed on that basis. We have 37 states in
the country. One of the guidelines is that each of the parties to
be registered must have representation in at least four of the
states.''
</P>
<P>
   Abubakar, who says that he has freed a number of political
detainees and ordered a study of decrees defining political crimes,
spent a lot of time after taking office listening to Nigerians, he
recalled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The message he got was twofold, he said. ``We need an
indivisible country and we need each other. Two, we want democracy
in Nigeria. Based on that, we leveled the political field and
called everybody to come aboard in order to move the country
forward.''

MAN TURNS HIMSELF IN 19 YEARS AFTER WOMAN'S KILLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY RIZZO and RICHARD ESPINOZA  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Minister Al Lawrence hears from a lot of men
about to go to prison, men who have been tried and convicted and
have no choice. When Daniel Leroy Crocker talked to him last week,
it was different.
</P>
<P>
   Crocker wanted to turn himself in for a nearly 19-year-old
Johnson County, Kan., murder. He had never been a suspect. Now he
asked Lawrence to help him and his family deal with the
consequences to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing that nobody knew anything, it would take a man of
great faith to take that step,'' said Lawrence, who works with
Prison Fellowship Ministries in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Crocker, 38, of Chantilly, Va., was charged in
Johnson County District Court with first-degree murder in the 1979
death of Tracy Fresquez. The 19-year-old woman was found strangled
in her Shawnee, Kan., apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Crocker flew to Kansas City, Mo., Tuesday night and turned
himself in to a detective who was 10 years old at the time of the
murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to get something off his chest that had been
bothering him for years,'' said Johnson County District Attorney
Paul Morrison. ``I've been doing this for 18 years and I've never
seen anything like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon learning of the break in the case of his daughter's
homicide, Louis Fresquez said Wednesday: ``What (the killer) ruined
in my family is really beyond words.''
</P>
<P>
   Crocker, who is married and has two children, managed a
warehouse until he quit his job last week. He apparently has no
criminal record, Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities now think Tracy Fresquez met Crocker at a
convenience store near her home hours before she died. Crocker, who
was also 19, lived in Lenexa, Kan., at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison said he could not discuss specific evidence, but he
said authorities were ``very comfortable'' that the allegation
could be corroborated by physical evidence left at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   During a brief court appearance, District Judge William Cleaver
appointed the public defender's office to represent Crocker. He was
being held in the Johnson County Jail. Bond was set at $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Fresquez was killed on the night of Oct. 5 or the morning of
Oct. 6, 1979, in her apartment at 7525 Garnett St.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives actively investigated the crime for several months,
but Crocker's name never came up in the investigation, said Shawnee
Police Lt. Ron Copeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of her circle of friends would have known this
individual,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives went over the case file every three years or so, but
nothing new came up, said Shawnee Police Chief Tom Hayselden.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was total frustration because when the Metro Squad
disbanded and put everything in our laps, we had exhausted all
leads,'' Hayselden said. ``There were two suspects at that time,
but nothing panned out on those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrison, who joined the district attorney's office about six
months after the killing, said that the case had remained open and
that he had reviewed it several times since he became district
attorney in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison said he received a call from Lawrence, the minister,
last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he knew an individual who confided that he had
committed a horrible crime in Kansas many years ago,'' Morrison
said.
</P>
<P>
   After Lawrence relayed a few details, Morrison said he
recognized it as Fresquez's murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``He indicated that he was helping this man who was interested
in making things right, to use his words,'' according to Morrison.
</P>
<P>
   Fresquez's family heard about the charge against Crocker on
Wednesday morning. Her father thinks the unsolved murder took years
of life from his wife, who died six years ago from multiple
sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,'' Louis Fresquez
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Fresquez had recently graduated from Turner High School in
1978 and turned 19 less than a month before she died. She was
planning to enroll in business classes at Johnson County Community
College and was getting career experience in the credit offices of
J.C. Penney. She rode a bike for fun and was engaged to be married.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a happy person; things were starting out real well,''
her father said.
</P>
<P>
   The day she died, Fresquez told her parents that she was staying
home from work with a sore throat. Authorities said Wednesday that
she met Crocker at a convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   People at a party near Fresquez's apartment described a man who
left her home. Shawnee police released a sketch of the man, but
never found anyone who matched the image.
</P>
<P>
   Crocker's wife said he went to authorities as part of his long
effort to turn his life around.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a Christian,'' Nicolette Crocker said from the couple's
home in Chantilly, a town of about 4,000 near Washington, D.C.
``It's not just a religious thing; it's his lifestyle since the
incident. It sobered him up to get back on the right track.''
</P>
<P>
   The Crockers' neighbors at the Meadows of Chantilly mobile home
park knew the family as trustworthy Christians and were shocked to
hear about the murder charge.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Crocker sometimes surprised his next-door neighbor by
taking care of her yard, and a couple who lives behind the family
never minded when he took their ladder to work on his own home,
because they knew he'd bring it right back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very honest person and an honorable person,'' said
Audrey Curley, who lives behind the Crockers. ``Very kind, proud
and mannerly. He was very well-read in the Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Crocker faces a sentence of life in prison with no
chance of parole for at least 15 years, under Kansas law in place
in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   His next court appearance is scheduled for Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence said Crocker is prepared for what will come.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a crime just between a person and God,'' Lawrence
said. ``There are issues of justice that need to be dealt with. My
faith respects the law of the land.''

REPUBLICANS PRESS FOR IMPEACHMENT; MOST AMERICANS WANT CLINTON TO
STAY IN OFFICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: As congressional Republicans explore the prospects of
impeaching President Clinton, a sturdy American majority looks at
the president's transgressions and...yawns.
</P>
<P>
   ``That disconnect has been constant throughout this,'' Raymond
Wolfinger, a political scientist at the University of California,
Berkeley. ``You've got Washington pursuing this one way and the
polls pointed in another direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the task of impeaching a president is so purposefully
political, Clinton's showy poll numbers would appear to offer some
job security.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, however, describe a more complex political picture
framed first by the founding fathers. And though two-thirds of
Americans tell pollsters that Clinton should stay, those numbers
may be deceiving.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders insist contemplation of impeachment is a
solemn responsibility best considered with a sober look at the
facts _ not by holding a finger to the wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people would be frankly horrified if the Congress was
simply a polling institution that enacted a grotesque version of
justice based on the latest poll or the latest talk show,'' House
Speaker Newt Gingrich told reporters Wednesday following a meeting
of GOP and Democratic congressional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Constitution's rules for firing a president are sort of
a shotgun marriage of politics and jurisprudence.
</P>
<P>
   Short of bribery or treason, Congress must find offenses to fit
into the elastic category of ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' to
unseat a president.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate definition of impeachable offense is so fluid, in
fact, that Alexander Hamilton worried in the Federalist Papers that
``there will always be the greatest danger that the decision will
be regulated more by the comparative strength of parties, than by
the real demonstrations of innocence or guilt.''
</P>
<P>
   As Congress sorts through the complex _ and constitutionally
unclear _ issue of whether the evidence collected by Kenneth Starr
warrants impeachment, the polls make for an unreliable compass for
the politicians. Even at the low point of the Watergate scandal, 49
percent of Americans did not want Richard Nixon impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most striking finding from polling on Watergate is how
slowly and reluctantly many Americans came to accept the idea of
ousting a president,'' said Everett Ladd, a polling expert with
Roper.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion, made more relevant as the Nov. 3 congressional
elections creep ever closer, looms over this drama every bit as
much as the president bantering about sex on the telephone or Linda
Tripp's tape recordings.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the scandal, the president's job ratings have
remained above 55 percent. An ABC News survey conducted the day
after Clinton's videotaped grand jury testimony was released, found
56 percent of Americans opposed impeachment even if he lied under
oath about his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll conducted for CBS News the same day that found a
majority concluding Clinton perjured himself, 61 percent still said
he should finish his term as president.
</P>
<P>
   And while only 20 percent of people in a CNN//USA Today//Gallup
poll shared Clinton's tortured definition that sexual relations
only includes intercourse and 62 percent thought he looked like ``a
guilty person trying to hide something'' in his testimony, 66
percent believed he should not be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``His poll numbers are pretty solid,'' said Jonathan Krasno, a
senior policy analyst at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York
University Law School. ``For a long time, everyone was waiting for
the other shoe to drop. Now it looks as if the evidence is out.
Most of it was leaked ahead of time and that other shoe never
fell.''
</P>
<P>
   Krasno speculates that journalists cling to the story because it
sells, and because to back off would seem to give quarter to a
slippery politician. Members of the House and Senate, he said, have
their own motives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans are on top of this because they hate Clinton,'' he
said, ``and Democrats are worried that hating Clinton is the proper
course to take right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives carp that guilt or innocence _ even with something
as deliberately political as impeachment _ shouldn't run on poll
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media are saying `I dare you to go against the polls,' ''
said Tim Graham of the conservative Media Research Center.
``They're polling this to death. They're taking popularity ratings
on the independent prosecutor. We didn't do that during Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing polling does is measure the success of White
House attack lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the polls, Republican legislators report that their
letters, e-mail, faxes and phone calls from constituents run
strongly for booting Clinton from office. For example, the offices
of both U.S. Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri and U.S. Rep. Vince
Snowbarger of eastern Kansas said that upward of 85 percent of the
constituent opinion they've received demands the president's
ouster.
</P>
<P>
   As British envoy James Bryce wrote 110 years ago, ``In a free
country...ten men who care are worth a hundred who do not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All these polls we're seeing should be taken as pretty
reliable, in part because they say the same thing,'' said Don
Dixon, a political scientist and pollster at Sonoma State
University, near Santa Rosa, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you have to look beyond the poll numbers here...You've got
a class of absolute Clinton haters that's active and has itself in
a position of power.''
</P>
<P>
   That contingent, still a minority but convinced of the
seriousness of Clinton's failings, stands in contrast to a more
ambivalent and possibly more pivotal middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who have conflicting opinions are more likely to change
their minds,'' said Gallup pollster Frank Newport.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the eight months of the Monica Lewinsky scandal,
polls have revealed what seems to be an American public at odds
with itself: They dislike Clinton but think he's an excellent
president; they don't want him impeached but want Congress to
conduct impeachment hearings; they want their president to be a
moral leader, and say Clinton is a poor moral leader but a good
president.
</P>
<P>
   Poll data lump about 30 percent of Americans into that
bad-boy-good-president mindset. The rest either dislike him on both
fronts or like him all around.
</P>
<P>
   Another point that gives conservatives cheer in the November
elections is that most polls sample the general U.S. population,
not the smaller pool of registered voters. Last week a
CNN//Gallup//USA Today poll found that likely voters treated
Clinton more harshly. Only 24 percent of Americans overall favored
impeachment opposed to 34 percent of likely voters.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Republican majority in Congress argues it must
make its own judgment about whether Clinton lied under oath and
whether such perjury about his sex life meets a reasonable standard
for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting ourselves into a very dangerous situation if we
determine that a person can get away with conduct that is
inappropriate if he's popular,'' said Snowbarger. ``The other side
of that argument is that if you're unpopular and you haven't done
anything wrong you could be taken out.''
</P>
<P>
   There may be times when the polls be damned.

INTEGRITY STILL SERVES POSITIVE ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Some things float atop pond scum.
</P>
<P>
   I submit as examples two books with arrestingly similar titles:
``Winning With Integrity'' and ``Winning Through Integrity''.
</P>
<P>
   Both books float. They elevate ethical thought far above the
sexual//political swamp that engulfs national and workplace
conversations of late.
</P>
<P>
   The ``With'' book is new. It was produced this year by Leigh
Steinberg, a California sports agent who was the model and
consultant for film character Jerry Maguire.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Through'' book was published in 1985. It was written by
Kansas City businessman and former Greater Kansas City Chamber of
Commerce Chairman Cliff C. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg's formula for ``getting what you're worth without
selling your soul'' focuses on negotiating to achieve win-win
outcomes _ with your win being more satisfying than the other
guy's, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' formula for successful business conduct leans heavily
toward following the Ten Commandments and other biblical teachings.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because of the title similarity, I pulled Jones' book
from my bookshelves and scanned it before talking to Steinberg, who
was scheduled in Kansas City for a book tour appearance with a
client, Derrick Thomas of the Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   There are common threads running through both men's messages in
buoyant counterweight to the scummy national soap opera. Here are
some pertinent pulled threads:
</P>
<P>
   - The first step in choosing to do business ethically is to
choose to do business with ethical people.
</P>
<P>
   - It's important to find common ground, or at least to
understand what makes the other person tick, to establish a
mutually satisfactory relationship.
</P>
<P>
   - If someone is not a ``man of his word,'' not much else
matters.
</P>
<P>
   - One must believe in the quality of one's service, products,
bosses and fellow workers in order to be a good advocate for any of
them.
</P>
<P>
   - No negotiation, no sale, no personal interaction is a one-time
thing; any temporary advantage gained by lying or blustering is
likely to destroy long-term credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Some people say Steinberg's success as a sports agent is a
``nice guys finish first'' story. He thinks his negotiation trail
is clean because he connects with clients and general managers as
individuals _ not as income generators (although that certainly
happens) or conquests.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're attempting to work out a win-win situation, the
hardest thing to do is to get the other side to communicate
honestly and openly,'' Steinberg said. ``We give false agendas all
the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must get the true, critical priorities and the true bottom
line from the other person so that you don't waste a lot of time
talking about something that isn't really at issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, anecdotes of ethical connections ripple through
Jones' book. In keeping with the current national obsession, I'm
choosing to excerpt his observations about one of the Commandments.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spite of the loosening of many moral restraints,'' Jones
wrote, ``it is simply not good business to have someone advancing
to top management who has little respect for the vows of
marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Both books make it clear that integrity is won through daily
choices and actions. Choose wisely and float. Choose poorly and
sink.

FINDING THE RHYTHM OF THE WILD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

   CHELATNA LAKE, Alaska _ Our gear had been stowed aboard the
float plane, a red Beaver, at its berth in Anchorage. But a weather
front, blowing up darkly from the south, threatened to delay our
departure.
</P>
<P>
   Duke Bertke, the lodge owner, was on the radiophone, checking
conditions between Anchorage and this lake 100 miles north. Larry,
our pilot, was waiting for the word.
</P>
<P>
   Duke bounded out of the office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's coming in fast,'' he said. ``But if we launch right now
we can get out ahead of it. Might be just a little bumpy at the
start.''
</P>
<P>
   So we scrambled up into our seats _ wife Katie, daughters Anne
and Jennie and I. The plane's engine roared to life, and shortly we
were airborne, skimming above a terrain of mixed marshland and
spruce-poplar forest, buffeted by wind gusts as we gained altitude.
</P>
<P>
   Duke, in a faster plane, would dash on ahead to be at the lodge
before us.
</P>
<P>
   A second Beaver, the yellow one, had brought another group in, a
party from Texas. Lodgings were four handsome little chalets, each
with two bedrooms, large front windows giving a spectacular view
down this long lake, stirred now to a chop.
</P>
<P>
   At the far end were sharp-toothed peaks, some with snowfields
near their summits. And just beyond that ridge lay Denali National
Park, where a savage wilderness of shattered stone rose toward the
flanks of Mount McKinley.
</P>
<P>
   At lunch, Becky Bertke, Duke's wife and partner, briefed all us
newcomers on the camp routine.
</P>
<P>
   Front doors of the chalets should be left unlocked so that, at
precisely 7 a.m., one of the housekeeping staff could leave a pot
of hot coffee on the sitting room table to announce the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast would follow at 7:30, ordered from a full menu.
Luncheon materials would be laid out on a sideboard in the dining
room, and fisherfolk could make sandwiches and select beverages
that would accompany them by plane to whichever stream they'd
chosen to fish that day.
</P>
<P>
   Planes would collect the fishing parties and guides about 4:30
in the afternoon and return them to the lodge in time for a shower
or sauna before cocktails at 6 and dinner at 7.
</P>
<P>
   Becky had no more than concluded this recitation of delights
when one of the Texans gave a startled cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look there!'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A black bear had appeared out of the bushes on the hillside
between the main lodge and the chalets below and had come up to
amble across the yard and express some interest in the goings-on
inside.
</P>
<P>
   I'm no expert, but this one certainly appeared to me to be a
significant bear, probably somewhere between 250 and 10,000 pounds,
depending on whether you were observing him at 20 yards, from
inside the dining room, or at five yards, say, from outside on the
steps.
</P>
<P>
   It was a small adventure, but sufficient to remind us that
Alaska is not just any other place.
</P>
<P>
   The reckless dogs of two of the guides went yipping after the
creature and sent it scuttling away to cover. We were assured,
though, that there'd be other chances for bear-watching _ in the
evenings from a platform constructed for that purpose near a pond
behind the lodge.
</P>
<P>
   It was time, then, to get ourselves fitted for wading boots, rig
fly rods and make a quick run down Lake Creek, Chelatna's outlet,
to see if we might find a gullible trout or two.
</P>
<P>
   My daughters and I fished with guides Wade Elg, of Anchorage,
and Will Hodge, from Colorado. The water was running hard, more
than knee-deep even in the riffles, and a brisk wind made the
casting difficult. But the drizzle lessened as the afternoon drew
on, and finally stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Jennie caught a nice rainbow and admired it a moment before Will
slipped the barbless hook from its lip. Anne lost what appeared to
be a good fish. I missed two strikes.
</P>
<P>
   With a storm still threatening, the light began to fail early.
We motored back upstream to the lake and the lodge.
</P>
<P>
   Several days of almost unceasing rain have put the creek high,
so it was an unremarkable first couple of hours of fishing. But
that was only a warmup, in any case. It's the silver salmon we've
come here for, and we'll try those tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner we took the trail down to the bear platform. Our
friend the black bear had been there earlier, one of the Texas men
told us, but had left the area to a cinnamon-colored grizzly sow
and her two hefty cubs.
</P>
<P>
   The sure knowledge that one shortly will be walking to one's
quarters through the woods in near darkness, with bears not 100
yards along the path in the other direction, tends to activate the
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   We did not linger long.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ For ``Cabaret,'' it's auf Wiedersehen to the Kit Kat
Klub on West 43rd Street.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of rumors, officials at the Roundabout Theater
Company, the musical's producer, confirmed that the show's run at
the club would end in early November. ``Cabaret'' is to move to
refurbished and significantly larger quarters once occupied by the
defunct Studio 54, on West 54th Street near Eighth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The shift comes amid a flurry of legal threats and accusations
of bad faith. The story involves Douglas Durst, who owns the Henry
Miller Theater and rented it to Club Expo, which later struck an
agreement with the Roundabout to use the space as its Kit Kat Klub,
where ``Cabaret'' takes place. The club owners say they expected
the relationship to last for three more years and now say they feel
betrayed by Durst and the Roundabout's management.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like stick-em-up 43rd Street,'' said Matthew Johnson, a
co-owner of the club. ``And Douglas Durst is wearing the mask.''
</P>
<P>
   The stories behind the move conflict. Johnson said he believed
that the Roundabout had committed to using the space as its Kit Kat
Klub for $3 million over three years, starting in 1999. ``We shook
on it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Roundabout's general manager, Ellen Richard, said that in
negotiations the theater had offered $1 million up front for
continuing use of the space but that no agreement had been reached.
Todd Haimes, the artistic director of the Roundabout, said the
theater would fulfill the obligations of the current agreement,
which runs through December.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations apparently fell apart shortly after Labor Day,
when the Roundabout told Johnson it had decided to relocate the
show. Despite the approximately $1.5 million it would cost to move
and recreate the nightclub environment, Haimes said the change
would allow the Roundabout to sell about 950 seats a show instead
of 520.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said that Durst, who is on the Roundabout's board of
directors, pressured the show to move so he could evict the club.
</P>
<P>
   Durst declined to comment on Johnson's accusations, but said he
had served the club with an eviction notice, and that his company,
the Durst Organization, hoped to use the Henry Miller as a
full-time theater rather than a nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he planned to sue Durst, but regretted the loss of
the show. ``We were like family,'' he said. ``That's gone now.''
</P>
<P>
   On this point, at least, there is agreement. ``It has not been a
happy marriage,'' Ms. Richard said.
</P>
<P>
   Second Thoughts
</P>
<P>
   When dozens of prominent theater artists and First Amendment
groups issued a statement last Friday saluting the Manhattan
Theater Club's ``brave decision'' to stage Terrence McNally's
``Corpus Christi,'' Edward Albee was one of the biggest names on
the list of supporters.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, Albee said he had asked for his name to be
removed because of his lingering anger regarding the theater's
initial decision in May to cancel the production based on fears of
violent protests. The play, which depicts a gay Christ-like figure,
has outraged religious and other groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was too congratulatory to MTC for having changed
its mind in the face of its first cowardice,'' Albee said.
Reinstating the play was ``self-serving,'' he added, because the
theater did so only after other artists harshly criticized the
cancellation, and after playwright Athol Fugard pulled the rights
to produce his new play, ``The Captain's Tiger.'' (Fugard changed
his mind when the theater changed its position.)
</P>
<P>
   Artists endorsing the seven-paragraph statement include
playwrights Tony Kushner and Arthur Miller, as well as the PEN
American Center and the National Coalition Against Censorship.
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Meadow, the artistic director of the Manhattan Theater
Club, declined to comment on Albee's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corpus Christi,'' which began previews amid protests on
Tuesday, officially opens on Oct. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Revisiting a Muse
</P>
<P>
   On a dusky afternoon in a diner in Hell's Kitchen, Everett
Quinton leaned over a bowl of blood-red Jell-O and explained the
precise calculus of the quick change.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the audience can count to two and you're back out there,
you'll get a laugh,'' he said in a husky whisper. ``If it's three,
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinton has good reason to be obsessed with timing. As half of a
two-man cast in the revival of ``The Mystery of Irma Vep,'' Quinton
is responsible for the quicksilver antics of four characters, all
of whom nearly meet themselves at some point during the play. Two
of his characters actually struggle with each other during the
second act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irma Vep,'' which opens on Thursday night at the Westside
Theater, is a loony takeoff on vampires, ``Wuthering Heights'' and
mummy movies. Written by Charles Ludlam, it was a surprise hit in
1984, with Ludlam and Quinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've figured out something beautiful about the play: It just
doesn't add up,'' said Quinton, 46, with a laugh. Indeed, the
biggest laugh of a recent performance came when Quinton, in drag
and out of breath, stumbled on and announced, ``Somehow this all
doesn't make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   In the play's latest incarnation, Quinton has taken on the roles
previously played by Ludlam, who died of AIDS in 1987. Stephen
DeRosa plays the roles that Quinton originated.
</P>
<P>
   In a tale that plays fast and loose with ghosts and goblins,
Quinton said that performing the roles of Ludlam, who was his
mentor and lover, has conjured some spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles is still there,'' he said. ``In the words. And the
lunacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Evergreen
</P>
<P>
   ``Visiting Green,'' a play by Jeff Baron scheduled to close on
Oct. 4, has been extended until the end of the year at the Union
Square Theater. Its producer, Arnold Mittelman, said a surge in
ticket sales after a series of ``last weeks'' advertisements and
the postponement of another show, ``Band in Berlin,'' made the
extension possible. David Margulies is to take over the role of
Green, a curmudgeonly 86-year-old, from Hal Linden on Oct. 20.

   WASHINGTON _ A hastily arranged shift in Pentagon spending
priorities Thursday erased shortfalls of more than $600 million in
the military medical care system budget.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeons general of the Army, Air Force and Navy told a
House subcommittee Thursday that within hours of their scheduled
appearance before the subcommittee, they were told $623 million in
other Defense Department funds would be diverted to medical care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We received a commitment (from Undersecretary of Defense Rudy
de Leon) that we would receive the funding necessary to carry out
our health care mandate,'' Lt. Gen. Ronald Blanck, the Army surgeon
general, told the subcommittee. He said the money would be shifted
from elsewhere in the Defense Department budget.
</P>
<P>
   The action heads off a crisis in the military medical care
system for fiscal year 1999, which begins next week.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 budget, which was approved this week by Congress,
provides the amounts the Defense Department had sought to fund each
service's network of hospitals and clinics.
</P>
<P>
   The shortfall represents the difference between the minimum
amount the surgeons general say would be necessary to operate the
military medical system and the amount Defense Department budget
writers had requested for them.
</P>
<P>
   Blanck said he was promised an addition of $233 million for his
budget. The Air Force medical care system will receive an
additional $194 million and Navy medicine will get an extra $196
million.
</P>
<P>
   The three surgeons general told the House National Security
subcommittee on personnel that without the additional money they
could not have provided acceptable medical care to members of the
country's armed services, their dependents and a growing community
of military retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Subcommittee staff members stumbled onto the medical care
shortfall while doing research on an unrelated Defense Department
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Irked members of the subcommittee questioned how the Defense
Department could discover only a week before a yearly budget goes
into effect that it had failed to adequately budget funds for
medical care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ink isn't even dry on the (budget),'' said subcommittee
chairman Steve Buyer, R-Ind., ``and we're suddenly faced with an
underfunding of over $600 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Buyer said military medical care has been underfunded in the
Pentagon's budget requests for several years in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeons general said they told Defense Department budget
planners a year ago how much money it would take to run the medical
care system _ and did not learn until June how much they would
receive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We walk a tightrope of being advocates for our patients and
providing them with the best patient care and at the same time
working in the system as good soldiers,'' Blanck said.

IRAN DIVORCES ITSELF FROM RUSHDIE DEATH THREAT  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ On Thursday, the Iranian foreign minister
publicly divorced his government from the death threat imposed on
British author Salman Rushdie in 1989 by Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, and Britain responded by restoring full diplomatic
relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has no
intention, nor is it going to take any action whatsoever to
threaten the life of the author of `The Satanic Verses' or anybody
associated with his work, nor will it encourage or assist anybody
to do so,'' the Iranian foreign minister, Kamal Kharrazi, said in a
statement that he read to reporters Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Kharrazi's remarks followed comments made in New York on Tuesday
by Iran's president, Mohammad Khatami, who told reporters that the
Rushdie affair was ``completely finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing next to Kharrazi, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
said he was ``delighted'' to hear Iran's position clarified and to
know that the reward offered to anyone willing to kill Rushdie had
been officially renounced.
</P>
<P>
   Although an Iranian foundation continues to offer a $2.5 million
bounty for the death of the year-old Indian-born British author,
whose novel Kharrazi said still offended Iranians, the foreign
minister said his government ``dissociates itself from any reward
that has been offered in this regard and does not support it.''
</P>
<P>
   A somewhat stunned Rushdie, interviewed by telephone in London,
said Thursday night, ``It's over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Until I went into the meeting with the British government, I
wasn't sure,'' he said. ``But they have told me emphatically that
this is it. It's a breakthrough, and it's over. It's done. There is
no longer any threat from the Iranian regime. The fatwa will be
left to wither on the vine.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to meeting with officials from the British Foreign
Office, Rushdie spoke by telephone with Cook twice Thursday, and
said he was convinced by the government's assurances. ``I am given
unequivocal and emphatic and definite information from the British
government that it's true,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rushdie, who over the years often seemed on the verge of being
released from his death sentence, only to have the Iranian
government reiterate its commitment to the fatwa, or religious
edict, said he wasn't sure how to handle the thought of freedom,
and had not yet begun making arrangements, for instance, to travel
in public without a team of Special Branch agents guarding him. It
was not clear what his new security, if any, might entail.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're so used to getting hard news _ and by that I mean
bad news _ then news like this is almost unbelievable,'' he said.
``It's like being told the cancer is gone. Well, the cancer's
gone.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He added, ``This has been an enduring and collective effort, and
I want to thank all those people who helped, many of whom are in
the United States, including the government of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Rushdie's book, which was first banned in India, in the fall of
1988, and prompted riots in Pakistan in early 1989 just before
coming under Khomeini's edict, shocked Muslims in many countries,
who deemed it blasphemous.
</P>
<P>
   The book, written in Rushdie's most surreal style, includes a
dream sequence with prostitutes impersonating the wives of Mohammed
to improve their business. It also refers to Mohammed as Mahound, a
demon in Christian morality plays. Rushdie, who was born a Muslim,
was seen as a traitor to his faith.
</P>
<P>
   After Khomeini called for Rushdie's death, the author was forced
to seek haven in a series of safe houses in London and was guarded
around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Rushdie was able to travel abroad from time to
time, but always under tight security. He has made several visits
to New York, to promote books he has written since ``The Satanic
Verses'' and to appear on television interviews and in small public
gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   Rushdie, the co-editor most recently of an anthology of South
Asian writing titled ``Mirrorworks,'' has never been able to return
to his birthplace, Bombay, India, however, and has not ventured
into Islamic countries, where emotions still run high.
</P>
<P>
   At an impromptu news conference Thursday after meeting Kharrazi,
Cook said, ``Her Majesty's government recognized the fundamental
role of Islam in Iranian life and understood and regretted the
offense the book `The Satanic Verses' has caused to Muslims in Iran
and elsewhere in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook said the understanding reached Thursday with Kharrazi would
improve ties with the European Union as well as Britain. The
British, who had been represented in Tehran by a charge d'affaires,
said Thursday that they would raise the level of representation to
ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   ``These assurances should make possible a much more constructive
relationship between the United Kingdom and I believe the European
Union, with Iran, and the opening of a new chapter in our
relations,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who received something of
a rebuff from the Iranians this week, was less enthusiastic. The
United States has not had diplomatic relations with Iran since the
seizure of the U.S. Embassy and the taking of American hostages in
1979 during the revolution that brought Khomeini to power. Khomeini

HEALTH EXPERTS URGE OVERHAUL OF FOOD IMPORTS RULES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Health experts urged the Senate Thursday to require
that countries exporting fruits and vegetables to the United States
meet American production and sanitation standards to ensure the
safety of the growing amount of imported goods.
</P>
<P>
   William B. Schultz, deputy commissioner for policy at the Food
and Drug Administration, said short-staffed government inspectors
can't possibly detect every disease-causing germ in imported
produce during quick border checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``A whole new approach is needed,'' said Schultz, who testified
at a food safety hearing before a Senate Governmental Affairs
subcommittee. ``We can no longer simply rely on inspections on the
border. We must find a way to go to the source of the potential
contamination.''
</P>
<P>
   Schultz said the FDA inspects only 1.7 percent of the imported
fruits, vegetables, grains and cheeses because the agency doesn't
have enough inspectors to check the 2.7 million shipments that
enter the country each year.
</P>
<P>
   More food safety workers are needed to examine production
conditions at foreign farms that export produce to the United
States, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress also needs to grant federal food safety officials the
authority to refuse imports that don't meet U.S. production
standards, Schultz said.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the foreign producers, he said: ``We need a way not
just to work with them but to make them listen to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is pressing for exactly that in a
bill introduced in March by Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski, D-Md. The
legislation would ban any imported produce, grains or seafood that
aren't produced, handled or transported in accordance with U.S.
standards.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Agriculture already requires that imported
meat and poultry meet U.S. standards. Other imports, such as cars
and prescription drugs, also must comply.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't be able to import foods that aren't up to U.S.
safety standards,'' Mikulski said.
</P>
<P>
   Mikulski said about 40 percent of the nation's fruits and
vegetables are imported. The amount of imported food has more than
doubled over the last seven years, she said, and demand continues
to surge.
</P>
<P>
   Mikulski's legislation is one of a dozen proposals in Congress
designed to curb food-borne diseases, which cause more than 80
million cases of illness each year and as many as 9,000 deaths,
according to the Government Accounting Office, the investigative
arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sanford A. Miller, dean of biomedical sciences at the
University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, testified
that the only way to reduce the risks of food-borne illnesses from
imported food is to examine how it is produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the bottom line,'' said Miller, who served on National
Academy of Sciences panel that recently issued a report on ensuring
safe food. ``You have to see where it's grown. We've got to be
working with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said requiring foreign producers of imported food to
adhere to U.S. standards should eliminate much of the risk of
food-borne illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly can't ask other countries to do better than
ourselves,'' Miller said after the Senate hearing. ``On the whole,
the food supply to the American people is pretty safe because the
standards we have are enforceable standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas J. Billy, administrator of the Department of
Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service, said the agency
has certified that 37 nations have adequate production standards
and 20 more ``are lined up to demonstrate they have equivalent
systems to the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this idea of equivalency is at the heart of our
success,'' Billy said.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA has said in the past that it does not have sufficient
inspectors to cover every port. Thursday's hearing was part of a
series on food safety.

DEAL STRUCK TO EXPAND FLOW OF SKILLED FOREIGN WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Congress and the White House have reached a deal
to allow more foreign workers to take skilled jobs in the United
States, delighting high-tech companies and drawing protests from
labor groups.
</P>
<P>
   The House quickly ratified the agreement Thursday in a 288-133
vote after negotiators brokered it late Wednesday. Prospects for
the bill in the Senate are high.
</P>
<P>
   Employers, particularly high-tech companies, have complained
that the robust economy and low unemployment rate make it hard to
find qualified workers. They asked Congress to increase the quota
of foreign skilled workers that can be hired on so-called H-1B
visas, which now stands at 65,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, software-maker Cognex Inc. of Natick said
earlier this year that a high-tech workers shortage had forced it
to send work overseas, and Keane Inc. of Boston said it had
expanded its recruitment team to 100 people to keep the
8,600-worker company staffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prowl the halls of the universities to find people,'' said
Richard Egan, chairman of EMC Corp. of Hopkinton. ``We have
research and development in Ireland, France, New Delhi, Tel Aviv,
becuase we can't get enough engineers and scientists here.''
</P>
<P>
   But labor groups opposed any increase in visas, presenting
prickly politics for the White House, which counts both organized
labor and the high-tech community among its supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The labor groups said that employers would draw more US workers
if they merely raised wages. ``Generally, we are very unhappy about
this deal,'' said John Reinert, president of the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers-USA, a professional society of
219,000 electronics and computer engineers. ``The evidence doesn't
suggest that there is a labor shortage, and there is no need to
increase the number of visas.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's allotment of visas ran out in May, leaving employers
without new visas until the new fiscal year begins on October 1.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal approved Thursday by the House, employers will be
able to hire 115,000 skilled foreign workers in the next fiscal
year and in the year 2000. The cap will drop to 107,500 in 2001 and
return to 65,000 in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   H-1B visas are good for six years and are typically used to
employ computer workers, nurses, physicians, fashion models and a
range of other skilled workers at jobs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and many Democratic lawmakers have said that any
increase in visas must be accompanied by improved programs to train
US workers for high-tech jobs. The deal would spend $75 million
annually on new job training slots and scholarships for low-income
students in math, engineering and computer science, to be paid for
by a $500 fee on companies for each H-1B visa.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a bad thing,'' said Egan of EMC, which makes data
storage equipment for computer systems. A higher visa quota ``is an
interim thing. The long-term solution is for us to produce more
engineers and scientists.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal also navigated a tricky issue of how to assure that
companies are not laying off US workers in order to hire
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   It gives the US Department of Labor broader authority to
investigate violations of the visa rules if it has ``specific,
credible'' evidence that the violations exist.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also tempers a proposal from the House Judiciary
Committee, which had been blasted by top executives at Microsoft
Corp., Intel Corp., Oracle Corp. and 25 other high-tech firms. That
proposal would have required companies using H-1B workers to
certify that they had not laid off an American worker to hire a
foreigner, and that they tried to recruit an American before hiring
a foreigner.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech executives complained that this would open them to
unneccessary scrutiny of their hiring practices by the Department
of Labor, and might put them in violation of the law merely for
laying off US workers when a plant closes or product line ends.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new deal, only companies that rely on H-1B workers for
15 percent or more of their staffs must sign the certifications.
Congressional aides said the measure was aimed at so-called ``job
shops'' that bring in foreign workers only to hire them out to
other companies.
</P>
<P>
   At 600-worker Cognex, human resources director JoAnn Woodyard
said the deal was ``really good news.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodyard said Cognex immigration lawyers had told her that so
many firms are applying for visas that next year's allotment, which
become available on October 1, could be exhuasted by the end of the
year. That would leave employers with no visas until the following
October.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the recent college graduates hired by Cognex
hold foreign passports and need some kind of visa, she said. ``The
notion that this is cheap foreign labor -- that is absolutely not
true,'' Woodyard said. ``You can't attract the best unless you pay
the going rate, and we look for the best engineers.''
</P>
<P>
   But Reinert, of the engineers' trade group said, that raising
the number of visas might discourage US workers from entering
high-tech fields.
</P>
<P>
   He said many US companies refuse to higher mid-career engineers
who have lost their jobs as big companies like IBM Corp. and the
former Digital Equipment Corp. downsize. This has created the
impression among younger people that high-tech careers lead to a
dead-end, he contended.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Golodner, president of the AFL-CIO Department for
Professional Employees, which represents 4 million members,
complained of ``awful timing'' behind the deal. He said high-tech
employment is bound to fall amid the global financial crisis, a
downturn in defense spending, a glut in the semiconductor field and
falling computer prices.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the software industry has hired thousands of people to
fix the so-called Year 2000 bug, ``and they will be dumped out of
their jobs and onto the market in about 15 months,'' Golodner said.

GE AGREES TO FUND PCB CONTAMINATION CLEANUP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN AND PETER HOWE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   General Electric agreed Thursday to invest at least $150 million
to clean up widespread industrial contamination from its former
electric transformer plant in Pittsfield, Mass., ending an
often-bitter, year-long stand-off with the federal government over
how much cleanup is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Under a broad agreement with the US Environmental Protection
Agency and numerous other government agencies, the company will
clean up the Housatonic River and other areas such as a school that
it contaminated with PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls. In
addition, GE will clean up the 256-acre former plant site and give
it to the city for economic development.
</P>
<P>
   In return for the deal, which some sources predicted would cost
GE $250 million or more, EPA will not add the Housatonic River to
the federal Superfund list, which could have slowed the cleanup and
ultimately carried an even higher pricetag.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have moved the cleanup onto the fast track,'' said John
DeVillars, the regional EPA administrator who led the government
negotiating team that included representatives of Massachusetts,
Connecticut, and Pittsfield. ``We have honored our most important
responsibility: to protect the health and environment of Pittsfield
and Berkshire County.''
</P>
<P>
   General Electric officials, who earlier had accused EPA of
exaggerating the danger of PCBs, also praised the agreement, saying
it would secure the future of the company's plastics headquarters
and technology center in Pittsfield, which employs 700 people. The
company had said a Superfund site on the Housatonic could
jeopardize the facility's future by stigmatizing the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``GE is pleased to enter a new phase of investing in the future
of Pittsfield and Berkshire County,'' said Stephen Ramsey, GE's
vice president of environmental programs, in a statement from
company headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists and Attorney General Scott Harshbarger, who
had pressed EPA to take over the cleanup by placing the Housatonic
River on the Superfund list, were surprised, but pleased that GE
had agreed to take the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may well prove that the cleanup can be as thorough and more
expeditious than designating this river as a Superfund site,'' said
George Wislocki, president of the Berkshire Natural Resources
Council, an environmental group.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Governor Paul Cellucci also praised the agreement,
pointing out that his administration had pushed EPA and GE to keep
talking when they reached an impasse last spring. ``We have
achieved all of this without the endless lawsuits which could have
gridlocked the entire process well into the next century,'' said
Cellucci in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy traces back to 1932 when GE began lawfully using
PCBs in transformer insulating oil and other products at its
Pittsfield factory complex, a practice that continued until 1977,
shortly before Congress voted to ban their use.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, PCBs had heavily contaminated 12 miles of the
Housatonic River south of the plant, and traces have been found all
the way down to Long Island sound 100 miles away. PCBs have been
shown to cause cancer in animals and are suspected of causing
cancer in humans, but GE has repeatedly accused EPA of overstating
the threat to people.
</P>
<P>
   For years, environmentalists and local activists have charged
GE's top priority in Pittsfield was avoiding any deal that created
a precedent for cleaning up much worse PCB contamination in the
Hudson River in New York. Estimates of the cost of cleaning up the
Hudson have ranged as high as $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, however, GE officials said such concerns were
overblown, noting that cleanup methods that might be appropriate to
the shallow, winding Housatonic, such as dredging, likely would not
work on the vast Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Both GE and DeVillars praised Pittsfield Mayor Gerald S. Doyle
Jr. and City Council President Thomas Hickey for playing a central
role in bringing about a negotiated settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Had GE's Pittsfield site ``gone Superfund,'' as EPA and company
officials put it, the EPA could have taken over the cleanup and
charged GE triple the cost of work it paid for, potentially hitting
the company with a $500 million bill.
</P>
<P>
   So far, GE has spent by its estimate more than $130 million on
cleaning up PCB contamination at the Pittsfield plant and elsewhere
in Berkshire County, but much of that spending went to studies and
reports rather than actual cleanup work.
</P>
<P>
   That changed last summer when GE contractors began removing
100,000 tons of PCB-contaminated soil from homes and schools that
received ``free fill'' from the factory plant in the 1950s and
1960s. Thursday's agreement doesn't include the ongoing cost of
removing this fill.
</P>
<P>
   The deal calls for GE to immediately clean up the half mile of
the Housatonic nearest the plant and, starting in November, take
steps to prevent more PCBs from seeping into the river.
</P>
<P>
   Once the first half mile downstream has been cleaned up, GE will
turn its attention to the next mile and a half, where the EPA says
flooding has recontaminated properties that had previously been
cleaned up. Under the agreement, EPA and GE will jointly pay for
cleanup of this stretch even though GE vice president Ramsey
continued to say ``GE has not believed there was a health
emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, EPA will issue a decision on how to clean up the
rest of the river by 2001, though GE has the right to challenge the
solution. And GE will clean &UR;  &LR; up PCBs at the Allendale School
neighboring the old transformer factory as well as Silver Lake and
bends of the river where contamination often settles.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the cleanup, GE will spend an estimated $50 million
preparing its former property for commercial use, and contribute
$25 million to offset environmental damage, most of which will go
toward improving the Housatonic River.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's historic agreement is a result of months of
extraordinary efforts by all parties and will benefit the city of
Pittsfield and Berkshire County for decades to come,'' said Doyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``After years of negotiations, Pittsfield is finally able to
move forward,'' declared Sen. Edward M. Kennedy.

NATO ASKS MEMBERS TO BEGIN PREPARATIONS FOR AIRSTRIKES AGAINST
YUGOSLAVIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KOSOVO-REFUGEES) 
(js) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VILAMOURA, Portugal _ NATO asked its military commanders on
Thursday to take the next step to prepare for air strikes against
Yugoslavia if Yugoslavia does not stop attacks on ethnic Albanian
civilians in Kosovo, the province in southern Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance authorized commanders to ask member states for the
forces needed to carry out the threat. U.S. Secretary of Defense
William Cohen called the move ``an important step to avert a
humanitarian disaster,'' but that step fell short of a political
decision to go ahead with military action, and Cohen said it was
not an ultimatum. In fact, it is the first of many steps necessary
to carry out any threat against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The credibility of NATO is on the line,'' Cohen said after
defense ministers met at this bougainvillea-draped seaside resort
in the Algarve to seek a way to convince Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic that he is ignoring their demands at his peril.
Serbia and Montenegro are the last republics remaining in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today NATO sent a clear message to President Milosevic that it
is time to stop the killing and destruction in Kosovo,'' Cohen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other NATO ministers said that unless Milosevic stops his
attacks, as they demanded, tens of thousands of ethnic Albanian
refugees driven into the Balkan wilderness by Milosevic's forces
could die as winter sets in.
</P>
<P>
   Military and civilian officials here did not give details of
their plans for air strikes, which include both a ``limited air
option'' of strikes by U.S. ship-based cruise missiles against
Serbian military targets in Kosovo and beyond, and a ``phased air
campaign'' involving hundreds of planes that could attack command
headquarters deep inside Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something has to happen soon; we can't just sit back now,''
said Germany's defense minister, Volker Ruhe, who also said he was
worried about damage to the alliance's credibility if Milosevic
were allowed to continue defying the warnings the allies have been
issuing since May.
</P>
<P>
   Ruhe said Germany was prepared to contribute 14 Tornado
fighter-bombers to an air campaign, and called on the alliance to
issue an ultimatum within the next 10 days if Milosevic does not
keep repeated promises to end the attacks and let refugees return
to safety.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, the Netherlands, Britain and other countries
have also pledged forces. Washington would provide forces for any
of the military options outlined Thursday, said Gen. Wesley Clark,
the supreme allied commander in Europe, but he and other officials
declined to give details.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo, with roughly 2 million people, 90 percent of them ethnic
Albanians, is not an internationally recognized independent nation
like Bosnia-Herzegovina, where NATO warplanes eventually stopped
Bosnian Serb attacks in 1995 and where more than 20,000 NATO
peacekeepers remain.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said 15,000 Yugoslav national army troops and 11,000
security police officers had been used in attacks on villages in
the campaign against armed Albanian rebels who demand independence
for Kosovo. More than 200,000 people have fled their homes since
the spring, some to other parts of Serbia and some to neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The allies do not support the demands for independence but they
have called on Milosevic to negotiate with ethnic Albanian
political leaders to restore to the province the autonomy he
rescinded in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's decision _ by NATO's political decision-making body
for the supreme allied commander in Europe _ authorized requests to
member countries about what forces they would provide. This step is
only the first toward possible military action in Kosovo, an
``activation warning,'' in alliance jargon.
</P>
<P>
   The next step would be for officers at NATO headquarters to
match specific military units with the contingency plans drew up
over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The third step could only come days or weeks later, in some
cases after approval by national legislatures to participate in
military actions. At that point the alliance could formally
activate the plans, then take operational authority over national
forces and finally authorize commanders in the Balkans to use the
forces.

</P>
<P>
   ``We are measuring our time in hours and days, and it can be
compressed significantly,'' Clark said Thursday. He said air
strikes would be aimed at producing ``some significant level of
damage to key force elements and associated infrastructure'' _ in
other words, both human targets and military ones _ of the units
that are attacking the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Ruhe, whose country fears an influx of thousands of Albanian
refugees on top of the several hundred thousand Balkan refugees who
are already there, said the German Cabinet could approve military
action early next week.
</P>
<P>
   But the current Cabinet could be thrown out of office if
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats lose the German
elections on Sunday. Ruhe said he was trying to keep the Social
Democratic opposition closely informed about NATO discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Some important European allies remain reluctant to order NATO
into action solely on the basis of a U.N. Security Council
resolution that was adopted on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution called on all sides in the conflict to stop
fighting and start negotiating, and repeated earlier demands that
Yugoslavia withdraw its forces and let in relief organizations. The
resolution did not explicitly authorize military action if
Yugoslavia did not comply, but said the Security Council would
``consider further action and additional measures.''
</P>
<P>
   France, which pressed for the resolution as a way for the allies
to keep Russia in agreement with them and increase pressure on
Milosevic, still wants explicit U.N. authorization before the
allies decide to take military action.
</P>
<P>
   All decisions by the alliance require unanimity; Russia, which
opposes the use of force against Serbia, has veto power in the
Security Council. Thus the allies have been hamstrung by restraints
of their own making, issuing blustery threats that Milosevic
apparently considers hollow and then watching powerlessly as he
flouts their demands.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said Thursday that the alliance has sufficient grounds
under international law to act and that ``The United States is not
prepared to act unilaterally.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO defense ministers met in Brussels, Belgium, in June and
ordered allied military authorities to start drawing up contingency
plans. But territorial gains by the rebels, the Kosovo Liberation
Army, in the early part of the summer made some allies reluctant to
appear to be taking sides by attacking only Milosevic, when they
were themselves opposed to the rebels' demand for independence.
</P>
<P>
   Led by the negotiators from the United States, the allies have
tried diplomacy to get Milosevic and the rebels to reach a
settlement that would restore autonomy to Kosovo. The West had good
contacts with Ibrahim Rugova, the Kosovo Albanian political leader,
but he and the Western diplomats lacked leverage over the armed
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance has drawn up plans to send up to 50,000 troops into
the province to help keep a cease-fire if one is reached, and even
more if they decide to go in to force one.

CLINTON TRUMPETS CENSUS REPORT SHOWING DECLINE IN POVERTY RATES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton touted new census figures
Thursday showing a decline in poverty rates for the third
consecutive year, but said there is more that needs to be done for
low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   The report showed the percentage of Americans living in poverty
declined to 13.3 percent in 1997 from 13.7 percent in 1996. A total
of 35.6 million people lived at or below the poverty rate, which
was $16,400 for a family of four. One in five living in poverty
were children.
</P>
<P>
   The number of African-Americans living in poverty hit a record
low of 9.1 million people or 26.5 percent, while the number of poor
Hispanics fell to 27.1 percent or 8.3 million people.
</P>
<P>
   The poverty rate in urban areas fell to 18.8 percent in 1997
from 19.6 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The median household income also rose by 1.9 percent to $37,005,
the same level as 1989 before the recession.
</P>
<P>
   In a Rose Garden announcement flanked by his economic team,
Clinton seized on the new report to suggest Congress should be
concentrating its efforts on issues that affect the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report this morning shows that economic growth continues
to raise incomes, lift millions out of poverty and extend
opportunity. It also shows that we have more to do,'' Clinton said.
``The most important thing we have to do, of course, is to maintain
the economic strategy that got us here in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, the president's economic adviser, noted the
amount of poor black children was 46.1 percent when Clinton took
office and is now 37.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``And yet, even at 37.2 percent, it is a shame on our nation and
one of the things that compels us to continue fighting for
initiatives and programs that make sure all children have a fair
chance to make it in our country,'' Sperling said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton again called on Congress to save the budget surplus, the
first since 1969, until they agree to reform Social Security. The
president previously threatened to veto the Republicans' $80
billion tax cut moving through the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's don't get into that and spend it in an election year tax
cut until we have saved Social Security for the 21st century, for
the sake of our children and our grandchildren,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president also blasted Republicans for defeating a $1
increase in the minimum wage. ``I haven't quit fighting for it,''
Clinton said. ``I think eventually we will get it in the next
several months; if we have to wait until next year, we will get
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also called on Congress to pass his education plan; to
subsidize the International Monetary Fund to help stop the global
economic downturn; and to pass a measure protecting patients'
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still time. We haven't broken for the election yet. We
can still do the right thing by the American people. But we have to
think about it, we have to focus on it, and we have to put our
priorities where they ought to be,'' Clinton said.

MONITORING GROUP SEES VAST FAILURE OF TV RATING SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The television industry, which reluctantly agreed one year ago
to add rating labels to shows with sexual or violent content, has
overwhelmingly failed to live up to its word, according to a new
study released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's apparent foot-dragging raises questions about
whether the much-touted V-chip, whose function is linked to those
same labels, will achieve the aim of its proponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the industry doesn't fix some of these problems, the V-chip
is not going to work,'' warned Kathryn Montgomery, a member of the
board established to monitor the rating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to be able to block out shows if they aren't
labeled,'' she added. ``Parents are not going to be able to use it
to protect their children from harmful content on television.''
</P>
<P>
   US Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), sponsor of the federal law
requiring the V-chip, agreed that it will be ``much less
effective'' without accurate ratings. Markey blamed TV programmers
whom he said are looking for ways to evade the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   However, network executives fired back Thursday, contending that
the study is flawed. ``It finds sex and violence in places where
reasonable people wouldn't,'' insisted ABC spokeswoman Julie
Hoover.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a series of labels that went into effect last Oct. 1
after intense pressure from Congress and advocacy groups.
</P>
<P>
   All of the major TV networks except NBC agreed to clarify the
alphabet soup of existing ratings (TV-G, TV-PG, TV-14, TV-MA, TV-Y,
and TV-Y7) with labels to describe the content of shows: V for
violence, S for sex, L for coarse language, and D for suggestive
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   But the study conducted by researchers at the University of
California at Santa Barbara found that 79 percent of shows with
violence and 92 percent of programs with sexual activity did not
carry the V or S ``content descriptors.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, which was funded by the Kaiser Family Foundation,
also found that 81 percent of children's programs with violence did
not carry the FV (``fantasy violence'') label.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are serious problems,'' said Montgomery, head of the
Washington-based Center for Media Education. ``But the industry
wants to wait until there are hundreds of thousands of letters
complaining about a specific show.''
</P>
<P>
   However, one network executive, who requested anonymity,
expressed exasperation at the findings, saying that most parents
don't seem as concerned as the advocates, and noting that
definitions of sex or violence can be subjective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the reason we resisted going to content descriptors is
that it makes a subjective process even more subjective,'' the
executive said. ``Having beaten us into submission, they're now
saying we're not doing it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoover, of ABC, said the network is ``wholeheartedly'' behind
the idea of adding content descriptors to shows that require it.
But she said the study's findings are exaggerated because it
included ``passionate kissing'' as a sexual act deserving of an S
label. ``The S label should be reserved for something more serious,
and we believe most parents would agree,'' Hoover said.
</P>
<P>
   Vicky Rideout of the Kaiser Family Foundation acknowledged that
passionate kissing was counted as sex, but said it did not
constitute the bulk of the acts counted. She said one-third of the
shows the study deemed as requiring, but lacking, an S label
featured ``implied intercourse.''
</P>
<P>
   Rideout pointed also to the study's finding that more than half
of children's programs rated TV-Y, a label that is supposed to
denote programs appropriate for children as young as two years old,
contained violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents think TV-Y shows don't contain any violence, but we
found that a lot of TV-Y shows had pretty scary violence,'' she
said Rideout.
</P>
<P>
   The findings did not come as a surprise to veteran children's TV
activist Peggy Charren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who thought the broadcast industry was going to rate
some of their nonsense so it would be meaningful to parents must be
living on another planet,'' Charren said. She contended that
parents need to monitor what their children watch rather than
``depend on broadcasters to tell them what their children should
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kaiser Family Foundation, based in Menlo Park, Calif., is an
independent philanthropy that specializes in funding studies on
public-health issues. It is well respected in medical and academic
circles. The TV rating study, which is billed as one of the largest
studies of television content ever conducted, was performed as part
of the Kaiser Foundation's Program on the Entertainment Media &AMP;
Public Health, which Rideout heads.
</P>
<P>
   The rating labels at issue are vital to the function of the
V-chip. Using electronic signals, the computer chip identifies
which programs to block based on their program ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Set-top boxes containing V-chips are expected to be in stores as
early as next month. Under federal law, half of all new TV sets
must include V-chips by next July, and all news sets must have them
by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Rideout said the study found the TV networks have done a good
job in applying the proper age-based ratings to shows, such as
TV-PG or TV-14. In fact, only 4 percent of shows that qualified for
an age-based rating didn't receive one.
</P>
<P>
   However, she noted, more than two-thirds of parents surveyed as
part of the study said they rely on ``content descriptors'' like S
or V more than age-based ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast executive who requested anonymity criticized the
study because in tallying up shows that lacked content descriptors,
it counted shows rated TV-G, for general audiences, a category
exempt from the voluntary agreement to label shows.
</P>
<P>
   Rideout conceded that is true, but said less than one-fifth of
the unlabeled violence was found in TV-G shows. Most of the other
unlabeled violence was in the categories of TV-PG (``parental
guidance suggested'') and TV-14 (``parents strongly cautioned'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Our point is not really `Who's at fault?' '' she said. ``The
end result, the way the system works in practice, that's what
matters to the parent in the living room.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The way it is now,'' she added, ``You push the `V' on the
V-chip and you're only going to get 20 percent of the violence
blocked. It is not what parents' expectations were.''

STYLISH PASSAT PASSES MUSTER  
 (EMBARGOED FOR SATURDAY, SEPT. 26) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Volkswagen's had a fabulous year in the United States,
much of it based on the magical appeal of the New Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond that, VW in the past few years has built an excellent
lineup. The huge German automaker updated and replaced a bunch of
cars with limited appeal and spotty reliability records with a
collection of sporty, desirable automobiles offered at moderate
prices.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, VW's been setting sales records, and earning enough
profits to amuse itself with such diversions as buying Rolls-Royce
and Lamborghini.
</P>
<P>
   VW's flagship, the midsize Passat, was revamped for '98 from a
competent but conservative family sedan into a distinctive,
enjoyable automobile that continues to offer the German
driveability virtues represented by Mercedes-Benz and BMW. But for
a whole lot less scratch.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of a V-6 engine into the Passat was delayed
while VW ironed out some flaws (i.e., it wouldn't fit), initially
offering models with the 150-horsepower turbo-four and the
remarkable TDI diesel engines. The 190-horsepower V-6 arrived
midyear, becoming part of the upscale GLX model, along with a
luxury interior complete with wood trim.
</P>
<P>
   The GLX comes in at a base price of $26,250, which seems pricey
until you check out the performance and the hedonistic level of
standard equipment. Four-cylinder models start at about $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Though maybe not as taut as a 5-series BMW or a C-class
Mercedes, the Passat GLX does offer much of the same sensory and
performance appeal. The Passat is fun to drive, with the power of
the V-6 complementing its balanced handling and cruising
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a V-6 engine in a midsize car may sound pretty routine
nowadays, but this is a performance-bred mill with five valves per
cylinder, boosting power and economy, and allowing it to sprint up
to highway speed and cruise quietly on the far side of legal
speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Though small in displacement, this engine provides a surprising
amount of pull, running more smoothly and strongly as the rpm
quickly climb up the dial. The trade-off is some real doggy
behavior at low engine speeds, especially when coming out of
corners.
</P>
<P>
   The test car was saddled with an automatic transmission, but one
equipped with the Tiptronic system that allows the driver to select
gears quickly, up and down. I think it's a poor substitute for the
performance edge of a manual tranny, but if you must have
automatic, this is as good as it gets.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension is relatively soft, for a German car, but good
design keeps handling in balance and control. There is some extra
body sway in turns, but the Passat tracks well. The steering is
very responsive.
</P>
<P>
   Styling, inside and out, is interesting and individualistic.
There's a lot of New Beetle in the Passat, as if the
once-conservative family sedan received a dose of funk from the
rebirth of beetlemania. Look at the way the windshield arcs into
the roofline. Or at the interior contours and textures. Pure
Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   Passat's styling also owes a nod to Volkswagen's upscale
division, Audi. Not to mention a platform shared by the A4.
</P>
<P>
   Passat certainly cuts a different sort of figure among the
crowded pack of midsize cars, including perennial favorites Ford
Taurus, Toyota Camry and Honda Accord.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the Passat feels solid and well-constructed, with a
nicely shaped dash with pieces of genuine walnut trim and
interesting textures on the various surfaces. The cabin is very
roomy, the high ceiling and big windows creating an airy feel, the
wood, leather and texture surfaces creating a warm, homey feel.
There's plenty of room for all dimensions, with enough back-seat
space for three, and a cavernous trunk.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the dashboard parts seem accessible and nicely
designed, some of the moving parts felt cheesy and breakable. Such
as the cupholders, which seemed ready to break off, which would be
no big loss because they barely do the job.
</P>
<P>
   The stereo controls are tiny, hard to manipulate and difficult
to see, although the upgraded, eight-speaker setup in our tester
sounded fantastic.
</P>
<P>
   As four-door sedans go, the new Passat is one of my favorites,
combining real-world practicality with the elements of performance
and driving fun.
</P>
<P>
   This year, a new Jetta will make its appearance in midseason,
following the stylistic lead of the Passat. Sounds like the right
move for Volkswagen to continue its winning streak. &QL;

GE AGREES TO FUND PCB CONTAMINATION CLEANUP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN AND PETER HOWE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   General Electric agreed Thursday to invest at least $150 million
to clean up widespread industrial contamination from its former
electric transformer plant in Pittsfield, Mass., ending an
often-bitter, year-long stand-off with the federal government over
how much cleanup is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Under a broad agreement with the US Environmental Protection
Agency and numerous other government agencies, the company will
clean up the Housatonic River and other areas such as a school that
it contaminated with PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls. In
addition, GE will clean up the 256-acre former plant site and give
it to the city for economic development.
</P>
<P>
   In return for the deal, which some sources predicted would cost
GE $250 million or more, EPA will not add the Housatonic River to
the federal Superfund list, which could have slowed the cleanup and
ultimately carried an even higher pricetag.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have moved the cleanup onto the fast track,'' said John
DeVillars, the regional EPA administrator who led the government
negotiating team that included representatives of Massachusetts,
Connecticut, and Pittsfield. ``We have honored our most important
responsibility: to protect the health and environment of Pittsfield
and Berkshire County.''
</P>
<P>
   General Electric officials, who earlier had accused EPA of
exaggerating the danger of PCBs, also praised the agreement, saying
it would secure the future of the company's plastics headquarters
and technology center in Pittsfield, which employs 700 people. The
company had said a Superfund site on the Housatonic could
jeopardize the facility's future by stigmatizing the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``GE is pleased to enter a new phase of investing in the future
of Pittsfield and Berkshire County,'' said Stephen Ramsey, GE's
vice president of environmental programs, in a statement from
company headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists and Attorney General Scott Harshbarger, who
had pressed EPA to take over the cleanup by placing the Housatonic
River on the Superfund list, were surprised, but pleased that GE
had agreed to take the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may well prove that the cleanup can be as thorough and more
expeditious than designating this river as a Superfund site,'' said
George Wislocki, president of the Berkshire Natural Resources
Council, an environmental group.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Governor Paul Cellucci also praised the agreement,
pointing out that his administration had pushed EPA and GE to keep
talking when they reached an impasse last spring. ``We have
achieved all of this without the endless lawsuits which could have
gridlocked the entire process well into the next century,'' said
Cellucci in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy traces back to 1932 when GE began lawfully using
PCBs in transformer insulating oil and other products at its
Pittsfield factory complex, a practice that continued until 1977,
shortly before Congress voted to ban their use.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, PCBs had heavily contaminated 12 miles of the
Housatonic River south of the plant, and traces have been found all
the way down to Long Island sound 100 miles away. PCBs have been
shown to cause cancer in animals and are suspected of causing
cancer in humans, but GE has repeatedly accused EPA of overstating
the threat to people.
</P>
<P>
   For years, environmentalists and local activists have charged
GE's top priority in Pittsfield was avoiding any deal that created
a precedent for cleaning up much worse PCB contamination in the
Hudson River in New York. Estimates of the cost of cleaning up the
Hudson have ranged as high as $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, however, GE officials said such concerns were
overblown, noting that cleanup methods that might be appropriate to
the shallow, winding Housatonic, such as dredging, likely would not
work on the vast Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Both GE and DeVillars praised Pittsfield Mayor Gerald S. Doyle
Jr. and City Council President Thomas Hickey for playing a central
role in bringing about a negotiated settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Had GE's Pittsfield site ``gone Superfund,'' as EPA and company
officials put it, the EPA could have taken over the cleanup and
charged GE triple the cost of work it paid for, potentially hitting
the company with a $500 million bill.
</P>
<P>
   So far, GE has spent by its estimate more than $130 million on
cleaning up PCB contamination at the Pittsfield plant and elsewhere
in Berkshire County, but much of that spending went to studies and
reports rather than actual cleanup work.
</P>
<P>
   That changed last summer when GE contractors began removing
100,000 tons of PCB-contaminated soil from homes and schools that
received ``free fill'' from the factory plant in the 1950s and
1960s. Thursday's agreement doesn't include the ongoing cost of
removing this fill.
</P>
<P>
   The deal calls for GE to immediately clean up the half mile of
the Housatonic nearest the plant and, starting in November, take
steps to prevent more PCBs from seeping into the river.
</P>
<P>
   Once the first half mile downstream has been cleaned up, GE will
turn its attention to the next mile and a half, where the EPA says
flooding has recontaminated properties that had previously been
cleaned up. Under the agreement, EPA and GE will jointly pay for
cleanup of this stretch even though GE vice president Ramsey
continued to say ``GE has not believed there was a health
emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, EPA will issue a decision on how to clean up the
rest of the river by 2001, though GE has the right to challenge the
solution. And GE will clean &UR;  &LR; up PCBs at the Allendale School
neighboring the old transformer factory as well as Silver Lake and
bends of the river where contamination often settles.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the cleanup, GE will spend an estimated $50 million
preparing its former property for commercial use, and contribute
$25 million to offset environmental damage, most of which will go
toward improving the Housatonic River.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's historic agreement is a result of months of
extraordinary efforts by all parties and will benefit the city of
Pittsfield and Berkshire County for decades to come,'' said Doyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``After years of negotiations, Pittsfield is finally able to
move forward,'' declared Sen. Edward M. Kennedy.

EPA ORDERS 22 STATES TO REDUCE SMOG-CAUSING OXIDE EMISSIONS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Conn., Del., Ga., Ill., Ind., Ky., Md., Mass., Mich.,
Mo., N.J., N.Y., N.C., Ohio, Pa., R.I., S.C., Tenn., Va., W.Va.,
Wis.)   By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a step meant to control the windblown smog that
drifts across state lines toward the Northeast, the Environmental
Protection Agency Thursday ordered 22 states to significantly
reduce their emissions of nitrogen oxides, the main pollutant that
causes smog.
</P>
<P>
   The rule is the broadest regional attack ever mounted on
nitrogen oxides, which come mainly from burning fossil fuels.
Although the results are not expected to be dramatic or immediate,
over the long term they are intended to bring some relief to many
smog-afflicted states, especially in downwind states whose
pollution comes partly from power plants and other sources in the
industrial Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA ruling comes after a year of bitter feuding among
governors over how much the upwind states _ most of them in the
Midwest _ should be held accountable for pollution that affects the
downwind states, which are located in the Northeast. The governors
from the upwind states argued that the rule was unnecessary, unjust
and unaffordable.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulation calls for reductions in emissions by 28
percent over the next nine years, with more than half the
reductions coming in just six states: Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, West
Virginia, Michigan and Pennsylvania. To hold down the costs, the
agency encouraged states to set up a pollution trading system for
electric utilities similar to the approach that has been used to
control sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA estimated that the rules would cost an average of $1.7
billion annually over the next 15 years, but said the resulting
health benefits were worth the expense, which is likely to fall
most heavily on electric utilities. The agency estimated that this
cost would amount to about one dollar on an average household's
monthly electric bill, but said that this might not be noticeable
while electricity rates decline as the industry restructures.
</P>
<P>
   ``While EPA does not tell the states how to achieve their
targets, our plan does demonstrate that the most cost-effective way
to reduce these emissions is to focus on the largest,
least-controlled sources, and that is primarily the major utility
plants,'' said Carol Browner, the EPA administrator.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA said that of 117 counties in the region that met the old
air quality standard but violated the new, stricter standard, 114
would come back into compliance by adopting the measures
recommended in its new regulation, with no further steps required.
</P>
<P>
   But other areas, like the New York metropolitan area, which are
even dirtier, will have to take additional steps in the years ahead
if they are ever to meet the tough air quality standards. After
all, only part of New York's smog problem comes from smokestacks in
other states.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental advocacy groups praised the rule, which midwestern
utilities and governors had vigorously opposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is truly an historic action _ one that will mean cleaner
air throughout the Midwest and East,'' said Frank O'Donnell,
executive director of the Clean Air Trust, a nonprofit group in
Washington. ``We're talking about some of the biggest sources of
pollution in the nation. Many of these dirty electric plants have
avoided pollution controls for decades. Now they will finally have
to modernize.''
</P>
<P>
   David Flannery, the legal counsel for the Midwest Ozone Group, a
coalition of coal and utility companies, said that ``for electric
utilities and their customers, and those that supply fuel to them,
the rulemaking is a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a virtual certainty that this will be
litigated,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   About 132 million people live in the 22 states covered by the
new regulation, and the EPA said that 31 million of them lived in
areas where the rule would clean up the air enough to meet the
strict new health standards for smog that the Clinton
administration announced last year.
</P>
<P>
   Smog is formed when oxides of nitrogen and other chemicals react
in the sunlight to become ozone, a chemical that aggravates asthma,
damages the lungs, and causes other problems. It is the most
pervasive air pollutant in the United States. Besides reducing
smog, the regulations on emissions of nitrogen oxides will help
control acid rain.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, which for years had been discussing
with the states how to forge a regional strategy for reducing smog,
proposed the rule last year, a few months after it took a separate
action to toughen the national air quality standard for smog.
</P>
<P>
   According to environmental advocacy groups, every state covered
by the new regulations violated the new health standards for smog
during the past few months, some of them dozens of times.
</P>
<P>
   The new requirements apply to the District of Columbia and 22
states: Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana,
Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey,
New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South
Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin.

GROUP WANTS CONGRESS TO REVOKE IMMIGRATION LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A group of lawmakers demanded Thursday that
Congress repeal a new immigration law they contend will cause
extensive traffic delays in U.S. border communities and squeeze
regional economies that subsist on Canadian and Mexican trade.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 law mandates the installation of a computerized system
by Oct. 1, 1998, to record departures from the United States of
each non-U.S. citizen and match them with arrival records. The
system is designed to discourage foreign nationals from staying
beyond the time allowed by their visas.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, immigration officers check arrivals but not people
leaving the country.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Bonilla, R-Texas, told a news conference that the
law, known as Section 110, ``would be a great hindrance to
commerce'' and would stymie growth in border cities such as Laredo,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla, whose district includes an 800-mile swath of border,
said the entry-exit system would create lengthy bottlenecks at
checkpoints. The resulting delays would ominously signal to
industries that ``the border is now closed for business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y., said the entry-exit system would
choke off commerce in his upstate district that borders Canada.
``It is unthinkable that Section 110 ever be implemented,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jack Quinn, R-N.Y., warned of border bottlenecks next week
when the law goes into effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just days away from Section 110 being implemented and
there still does not exist a practical way to administer the law at
our border crossings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's highly unlikely that the Immigration and
Naturalization Service will meet the Oct. 1 deadline for putting
the system in place. As a result, the deadline likely will come and
go with no measurable impact along the U.S. border.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the lawmakers representing border districts want Congress
to repeal the law, or at a minimum to delay it for several years.
They are supported by business interests including the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce, the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, General Motors
Corp. and Eastman Kodak Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as this provision remains on the books, it will hang
over our industries, towns and economies,'' said Hal Coxson, a
spokesman for Americans for Better Borders, a coalition of
lawmakers and major business organizations seeking to scuttle the
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cloud exists. We want removal of the cloud,'' LaFalce
said.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the law say it is essential to dissuade illegal
immigration, drug smuggling and terrorism.

capital to exploit price discrepancies in the world's bond markets.
Now, in perhaps the clearest sign to date of the current fragile
state of global financial markets, Meriwether's latest bubble has

AMERICA'S MOZART: GERSHWIN REMEMBERED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH LAFAVE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - George Gershwin was born 100 years ago Saturday, which
means he would've been 65 years old when the Beatles made their
celebrated appearance on the ``Ed Sullivan Show,'' instantly
tossing outthe culture and the aesthetic in which Gershwin
flourished.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to imagine the aged _ but far from decrepit _ George
in a television interview a few months after the earth-stopping
event . . .
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) INTERVIEWER: So tell me, Mr. Gershwin, what is your
opinion of the new style of popular musicmaking?
</P>
<P>
   GERSHWIN: I think it was about time for a change. I like the
freshness of the beat, and the way Lennon and McCartney spin
melodies that cling to the beat and are shaped by it. The one thing
I might caution is that this new beat is so engaging that it could
become wholly dominant, swamping all the other musical elements.
Before long, you could have music that is all pulse, without
melodic profile or harmonic content.
</P>
<P>
   INTERVIEWER (laughing): Come on, Mr. Gershwin, who would listen
to songs that were nothing but a beat and some words?
</P>
<P>
   GERSHWIN: It could happen. Some of the groups I'm hearing other
than the Beatles are already tending in that direction . . . (end
ital)
</P>
<P>
   But since time took George from us so early _ he was two months
shy of turning 39 when he died of a brain tumor in 1937 _ we are
spared the notion of Gershwin having to battle changing times and
the transmogrification of popular music into ``pop'' music.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, history has given us the perfectly sealed memory of a
man who was born at exactly the right moment, thrived in his art
for a brief, intense time, and then died _ too young, yes, but at a
moment that would preserve him for us like some silent icon of all
that was best in his era.
</P>
<P>
   And if you think the words I put in his hypothetically
sexagenarian mouth are unlikely, here is something he actually
said, something that ought to be engraved on the forehead of every
aspiring pop star:
</P>
<P>
   ``If study kills a musical endowment, that endowment deserves to
be killed.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, ``classical,'' or educated, music is the friend,
not the enemy, of any genuine talent. Authentic musical gifts can
be enhanced and deepened only by study. The other kind will be
undone by it.
</P>
<P>
   Gershwin subjected his natural musical gifts and easy sense of
invention to the rigorous study of counterpoint, harmony and
orchestration, and more. As a result, he got better and better
throughout his short life. Starting out as a song plugger (someone
who played other people's songs to sell the sheet music) on Tin Pan
Alley, he ended up as the creator of the first fully American opera
to enter the repertoire, ``Porgy and Bess.''
</P>
<P>
   Gershwin moved back and forth between the worlds of classical
and popular because the two were linked by common disciplines and
methods. Music was a lingua franca. Now classical and popular are
split, and ``crossover'' must be mandated for them to broach some
discussion. Music is a fragmented set of languages, each
impenetrable by the others.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder we are struck by a sense of the exotic whenever we
listen to Gershwin's music and consider his story:
</P>
<P>
   A little boy, born to an immigrant family in Brooklyn, shows an
amazing aptitude for the piano and sets off to conquer the musical
world. Often teamed with his lyric-writing brother, Ira, George
triumphs in popular song with such perennials as ``Swanee'' and
``Someone to Watch Over Me.'' He hits on Broadway with shows such
as the Pulitzer Prize-winning ``Of Thee I Sing''; drags jazz
language into the concert hall via the epoch-making ``Rhapsody in
Blue''; develops popular song to ever-higher levels with the likes
of ``Love Is Here to Stay'' and ``TheyCan't Take That Away from
Me''; and breaks into the domain of Verdi and company with
``Porgy.''
</P>
<P>
   Time took Gershwin from us early, but it can't take all this
away from us.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Recordings
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is a great wealth of recorded Gershwin. The best
``Rhapsody inBlue'' and ``American in Paris'' remain, in my view,
those of Leonard Bernstein, whose early recording of these was just
re-released by Sony on its Bernstein Century series. Also
re-released by Sony: the 1951 studio recording of ``Porgy and
Bess,'' the first time the entire work was committed to disc. It's
a luscious and loving realization of this sprawling score.
</P>
<P>
   Gershwin's popular songs are ubiquitous on CD. A couple of
recent releases contain vital new interpretations of well-known
songs as well as rediscovered treasures.
Arranger-saxophonist-vocalist Matt Catingub's ``Gershwin 100'' (on
Concord Jazz) has fantastic rethinkings of ``Slap That Bass,''
``Lady Be Good'' and ``The Man I Love.'' On the Nonesuch label,
``George and Ira Gershwin: Standards and Gems'' is a delicious grab
bag of performances from such Broadway and opera notables as Dawn
Upshaw and Audra McDonald. Not only does it give us a ``Fascinating
Rhythm'' to top all previous ``Fascinating Rhythms,'' it brings to
light several buried diadems, including the sweet-clever ``I Don't
Think I'll Fall in Love Today.''
</P>
<P>
   And still in circulation on Nonesuch is musician Artis
Wodehouse's lively realization of piano rolls cut by the young
Gershwin. Hearing Gershwin's piano playing transmitted from the
distant past is hair-raising. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Television and movies
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carnegie Hall opened its 1998-99 season Wednesday night with a
salute to George Gershwin and videotaped it for the rest of us. The
concert, featuring the San Francisco Symphony conducted by Michael
Tilson Thomas, with mezzo-soprano Frederica von Stade, Audra
McDonald and Brian Stokes from Broadway's ``Ragtime,'' will air
next Wednesday on PBS.
</P>
<P>
   If you have Turner Classic Movies (TCM) on cable, you can watch
Gershwin-related movies Saturday. First is the 1945 movie bio of
George called ``Rhapsody in Blue'' and starring Robert Alda (Alan's
dad) as the composer. That's followed by ``The Barkleys of
Broadway'' (1949), the last Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers
collaboration, and one that includes some recycled songs by the
Gershwin brothers and several by Ira working with composer Harry
Warren.
</P>
<P>
   TCM's Gershwin mini-orgy concludes with Gene Kelly's justly
famous movie-musical expansion of the Gershwin tone poem, ``An
American in Paris'' (1951).
</P>
<P>
   If you can find them for rent, two Astaire movies made in the
1930s _ both all-Gershwin _ are superior. These are ``Shall We
Dance?'' (not the recent feature of the same name) and ``Damsel in
Distress.''
</P>
<P>
   '' For a more recent cinematic take on Gershwin, rent Woody
Allen's ``Manhattan.'' The soundtrack is a bouquet of Gershwin
songs both rare and familiar, and the spirit of thing is as
Gershwinian as a 1979 film could possibly be. &QL;

MONITORING GROUP SEES VAST FAILURE OF TV RATING SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The television industry, which reluctantly agreed one year ago
to add rating labels to shows with sexual or violent content, has
overwhelmingly failed to live up to its word, according to a new
study released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's apparent foot-dragging raises questions about
whether the much-touted V-chip, whose function is linked to those
same labels, will achieve the aim of its proponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the industry doesn't fix some of these problems, the V-chip
is not going to work,'' warned Kathryn Montgomery, a member of the
board established to monitor the rating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to be able to block out shows if they aren't
labeled,'' she added. ``Parents are not going to be able to use it
to protect their children from harmful content on television.''
</P>
<P>
   US Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), sponsor of the federal law
requiring the V-chip, agreed that it will be ``much less
effective'' without accurate ratings. Markey blamed TV programmers
whom he said are looking for ways to evade the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   However, network executives fired back Thursday, contending that
the study is flawed. ``It finds sex and violence in places where
reasonable people wouldn't,'' insisted ABC spokeswoman Julie
Hoover.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a series of labels that went into effect last Oct. 1
after intense pressure from Congress and advocacy groups.
</P>
<P>
   All of the major TV networks except NBC agreed to clarify the
alphabet soup of existing ratings (TV-G, TV-PG, TV-14, TV-MA, TV-Y,
and TV-Y7) with labels to describe the content of shows: V for
violence, S for sex, L for coarse language, and D for suggestive
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   But the study conducted by researchers at the University of
California at Santa Barbara found that 79 percent of shows with
violence and 92 percent of programs with sexual activity did not
carry the V or S ``content descriptors.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, which was funded by the Kaiser Family Foundation,
also found that 81 percent of children's programs with violence did
not carry the FV (``fantasy violence'') label.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are serious problems,'' said Montgomery, head of the
Washington-based Center for Media Education. ``But the industry
wants to wait until there are hundreds of thousands of letters
complaining about a specific show.''
</P>
<P>
   However, one network executive, who requested anonymity,
expressed exasperation at the findings, saying that most parents
don't seem as concerned as the advocates, and noting that
definitions of sex or violence can be subjective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the reason we resisted going to content descriptors is
that it makes a subjective process even more subjective,'' the
executive said. ``Having beaten us into submission, they're now
saying we're not doing it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoover, of ABC, said the network is ``wholeheartedly'' behind
the idea of adding content descriptors to shows that require it.
But she said the study's findings are exaggerated because it
included ``passionate kissing'' as a sexual act deserving of an S
label. ``The S label should be reserved for something more serious,
and we believe most parents would agree,'' Hoover said.
</P>
<P>
   Vicky Rideout of the Kaiser Family Foundation acknowledged that
passionate kissing was counted as sex, but said it did not
constitute the bulk of the acts counted. She said one-third of the
shows the study deemed as requiring, but lacking, an S label
featured ``implied intercourse.''
</P>
<P>
   Rideout pointed also to the study's finding that more than half
of children's programs rated TV-Y, a label that is supposed to
denote programs appropriate for children as young as two years old,
contained violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents think TV-Y shows don't contain any violence, but we
found that a lot of TV-Y shows had pretty scary violence,'' she
said Rideout.
</P>
<P>
   The findings did not come as a surprise to veteran children's TV
activist Peggy Charren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who thought the broadcast industry was going to rate
some of their nonsense so it would be meaningful to parents must be
living on another planet,'' Charren said. She contended that
parents need to monitor what their children watch rather than
``depend on broadcasters to tell them what their children should
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kaiser Family Foundation, based in Menlo Park, Calif., is an
independent philanthropy that specializes in funding studies on
public-health issues. It is well respected in medical and academic
circles. The TV rating study, which is billed as one of the largest
studies of television content ever conducted, was performed as part
of the Kaiser Foundation's Program on the Entertainment Media &AMP;
Public Health, which Rideout heads.
</P>
<P>
   The rating labels at issue are vital to the function of the
V-chip. Using electronic signals, the computer chip identifies
which programs to block based on their program ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Set-top boxes containing V-chips are expected to be in stores as
early as next month. Under federal law, half of all new TV sets
must include V-chips by next July, and all news sets must have them
by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Rideout said the study found the TV networks have done a good
job in applying the proper age-based ratings to shows, such as
TV-PG or TV-14. In fact, only 4 percent of shows that qualified for
an age-based rating didn't receive one.
</P>
<P>
   However, she noted, more than two-thirds of parents surveyed as
part of the study said they rely on ``content descriptors'' like S
or V more than age-based ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast executive who requested anonymity criticized the
study because in tallying up shows that lacked content descriptors,
it counted shows rated TV-G, for general audiences, a category
exempt from the voluntary agreement to label shows.
</P>
<P>
   Rideout conceded that is true, but said less than one-fifth of
the unlabeled violence was found in TV-G shows. Most of the other
unlabeled violence was in the categories of TV-PG (``parental
guidance suggested'') and TV-14 (``parents strongly cautioned'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Our point is not really `Who's at fault?' '' she said. ``The
end result, the way the system works in practice, that's what
matters to the parent in the living room.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The way it is now,'' she added, ``You push the `V' on the
V-chip and you're only going to get 20 percent of the violence
blocked. It is not what parents' expectations were.''

AILING CONGRESSMAN RETURNS TO WARM WELCOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAIME CASTILLO  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An ailing Texas congressman returned to the House
floor Thursday for the first time in more than a year, making what
one staff member called ``his victory lap'' before retiring from
the House.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, 82, was greeted with warm wishes and
accolades from Democrats and Republicans who watched him cast his
first vote in 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how good it is to be back,'' Gonzalez,
D-Texas, said between hugs, pats on the back and well-wishes from
his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez was rushed to National Naval Medical Center in
Bethesda, Md., in July 1997 when a low-grade infection traveled to
a heart valve and threatened his life.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to his San Antonio district to recover from the
heart ailment and had not returned to the House of Representatives
until this week.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a gray pin-striped suit, Gonzalez ambled onto the
House floor before noon for a vote, catching many friends by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, was first to acknowledge Gonzalez's
presence, hailing the return of the ``dean of the Texas
congressional delegation.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gerald B.H. Solomon of New York led the Republican
greeting: ``From this side of the aisle, we would like to welcome
back the dean of the Texas congressional delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is one of the most respected members of this body,''
Solomon said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's first vote in 14 months was in favor of a spending
bill for congressional operations.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few months ago, some questioned whether the sometimes
irascible congressman would ever return to the arena he first
entered in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, Gonzalez recalled the day he took the oath on
Nov. 4, 1961, as the first Mexican-American elected to Congress
from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as they swore me in, I pulled a bill from my pocket
and introduced it,'' he said, tugging at the lapel of his rumpled
coat. The bill called for the repeal of the poll tax, a fee
assessed citizens as a condition for voting.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez abhorred the poll tax because it was meant to
discourage minorities from participating in the electoral process.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez was a guiding force during the savings and loan crisis
of the 1980s, but he stood alone in his unsuccessful efforts to
impeach President Ronald Reagan and then George Bush for taking
military action against foreign nations.

`RONIN' A THRILLER WITHOUT THE THRILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - You start out wondering what's in the mysterious
suitcase everyone is killing everyone else for. About 10 minutes
into ``Ronin,'' you're wondering what, if anything, was in the
minds of the writers and director.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood makes plenty of pointless, worthless movies, few of
them as determinedly terminal as ``Ronins''
</P>
<P>
   The title refers to ancient samurai of Japan who had lost their
master and become freelance killers or bandits.
</P>
<P>
   The story is set in modern France, where the mysterious Deirdre
(Natascha McElhone), who is working for some mysterious Irish
group, brings together five mysterious ex-agents to steal a
mysterious suitcase from a mysterious bald guy.
</P>
<P>
   What's in the suitcase? Who are these men? How do they get away
with destroying half of France without the other half getting
ticked off about it?
</P>
<P>
   There are no answers to any of these questions, and it's just as
well there aren't because the answers probably would be as
unsatisfying as the mystery itself.
</P>
<P>
   The mysterious ex-agents include Sam (Robert De Niro), who may
or may not have been with the CIA, and Vincent (Jean Reno). We're
pretty sure that Vincent's French because he smokes Gauloise.
</P>
<P>
   We're not too sure about anyone else, although you can always
identify the next bad guy in the crowd because he's the one who
needs a shave.
</P>
<P>
   As the men go after the mysterious suitcase with guns blazing,
``Ronin'' devolves into a series of incredibly long and stupid car
chases.
</P>
<P>
   Director John Frankenheimer's (``The Island of Dr. Moreau'')
operating theory: If smashing up a dozen cars is exciting, then
smashing 10 dozen must be 10 times as exciting. Bad math.
</P>
<P>
   You have to wonder what De Niro is doing in a film like this,
unless he needed a vacation in France, one in which he wouldn't be
required to work very hard.
</P>
<P>
   Most other aging Hollywood stars have positioned themselves as
youthful by making movies in which they romance young women: Woody
Allen in ``Everyone Says I Love You,'' Warren Beatty in
``Bulworth,'' Michael Douglas in ``A Perfect Murder,''
demonstrating that they can still fake the ardor.
</P>
<P>
   De Niro wants to hang onto his youth by punching people out and
directing his own surgery, thereby demonstrating that he may be
getting older but he can still fake the pain.
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting person in the movie is McElhone (``The
Truman Show''), a British actress who has the longest, most
mournful face in movies. Maybe she's unhappy that she didn't get
romanced by Beatty or Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   As thrillers go, ``Ronin'' has no suspense, no thrills, plenty
of explosions and more than enough lame action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronin'' is rated R for profanity and violence. 2 stars. &QL;

FEMINISTS OPPOSE IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's feminist leaders ended months of
sidestepping the White House sex scandal Thursday and came out in
firm support of President Clinton. They called on women to oppose
impeachment, brake the Republican bandwagon for it, and back
candidates in November who champion women's causes.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement, more than a dozen feminist activists said
Clinton's chief accusers on Capitol Hill are ``among the worst foes
of women's rights,'' and they demanded Congress ``end this
hypocritical voyeurism and get back to work on the real issues''
facing the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough is enough,'' said Patricia Ireland, president of the
National Organization for Women. ``No matter how offended I am by
the president's behavior, it does not rise to the level of
impeachable offense.''
</P>
<P>
   The feminist leaders said they did not coordinate Thursday's
statement with the White House, though they did tell presidential
aides to expect it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women will not be duped into joining the Gingrich/Lott assault
on the president and his agenda,'' said Ireland, who signed the
statement that rebukes the GOP Congress and its leaders, House
Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, for
``a relentless campaign to hound President Clinton'' out of office.
``Women will not stand by as the Republicans use their power in
Congress to overturn a president they elected,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's gender gap today isn't nearly as wide as it was when
he was elected. Recent polls show women are only slightly more
inclined than men to support him and are only a little less likely
than men to call for his impeachment if he committed perjury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly don't believe these feminists represent the
majority of American women on this critical issue regarding
marriage, truth, lies, and what we teach our children,'' said
Carmen Pate, president of the Concerned Women for America, a
conservative group that has called for Clinton's resignation or
impeachment. ``Feminists are truly out in left field from what most
Americans believe should happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, women's rights groups have been conflicted, and
notably quiet, about Clinton's extramarital affair with White House
intern Monica S. Lewinsky and, before that, about the sexual
harassment lawsuit brought against him by Paula Jones in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, the president's workplace misbehavior with the then
22-year-old Lewinsky, so graphically described in Independent
Counsel Kenneth W. Starr's report, is everything feminists deplore
and, indeed, sounds as bad as sexual misconduct allegations brought
against former Oregon GOP Senator Bob Packwood and then Supreme
Court nominee Clarence Thomas, which the groups loudly condemned.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, both the president and his wife, Hillary
Rodham Clinton, have been good friends of the feminist movement and
promoted its agenda of pay equity for women, abortion and
reproductive rights, expanded child care services, and better
health and family leave policies. For that reason, feminist leaders
have been reluctant to harshly criticize the White House or seek
Clinton's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority, said the
women's groups are not hypocritical but rather in a ``unique''
position to judge the president and put the scandal in proportion.
``It is precisely because of the sexual backdrop of (this)
misconduct that we believe we are compelled and duty-bound to speak
out and act,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford May, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee,
disagreed. ``These women are opening themselves to a real trap when
they defend sexual harassers or exploiters out of partisan loyalty,
or because they don't want funding for a certain government program
jeopardized,'' he said. ``It looks like they are sacrificing their
principles.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a principle much larger than saving Clinton's
presidency is at stake, the feminists say. Their real concern,
evident in the timing of Thursday's statement, is that the scandal
will take down Democrats in November who have held the line _ and
been able to sustain the president's veto in the Senate _ against
conservative Republicans who oppose abortion rights, affirmative
action, and a host of gender-equity issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women have much at stake in these elections,'' the feminists'
statement said. ``We are here today to sound the alarm that if
disgust with the current crisis depresses women's votes in
November, we will see an antiwomen's rights majority in Congress
roll back the gains for women of the past 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the individuals and groups endorsing the statement, in
addition to Ireland and Smeal, were Betty Friedan, a founder of the
modern feminist movement; Kathy Rodgers, executive director of the
NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund; Jane Smith, president of the
National Council of Negro Women; and Yvonne Scruggs-Leftwich,
executive director of the Black Leadership Forum.
</P>
<P>
   They said they feared Republicans would manipulate an
impeachment process not only to remove Clinton, but also to bring
down Vice President Al Gore over alleged campaign-fundraising
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women should be asking the question, `who's on third _ who is
next in the line of succession,''' the joint statement said. ``Next
in line is Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedan said her fear is that the country is on the brink of an
era of ``sexual McCarthyism,'' as politicians polarize the country
over issues arising from people's private behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do risk ushering into power a puritanical or fundamentalist
sex police who speak of freedom but allow government to destroy the
right of privacy,'' Smeal added.

 &HT;    Coming soon: A new flurry of AOL discs
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- America Online is back, and so are its infamous
discs. Beginning Monday, the company will launch an aggressive
``carpet bombing'' marketing strategy to launch its newest version,
AOL 4.0.
</P>
<P>
   For some, AOL's marketing effort conjures memories of the
company's last deluge. At one point, so many disks were in
circulation several disgusted consumers put up Web sites devoted to
craft projects using AOL disks, 101 Uses for AOL Disks
(http://www.earthplaza.com
</P>
<P>
   /aoldisks) and Nikki's 1997 AOL CD Present Collection
(http://www.neosoft.com/nikki).
</P>
<P>
   AOL President Bob Pittman said in a statement the company will
begin mailing more than a million CD-ROMs per week and will place
the discs ``just about everywhere you turn'' _ from cereal boxes to
bank kiosks to school cafeterias.
</P>
<P>
   The company says the mass distribution is designed to add still
more subscribers to its present total of 13 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing now is very different from what we've done in
the past,'' says Barry Schuler, president of AOL Interactive
Services. Schuler says that three or four years ago, when AOL first
deluged the market with installation disks, it was largely unknown
and running a distant third in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say AOL's latest marketing plan is a clever move
despite unpleasant memories of campaigns pst.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research analyst Kate Delhagen says AOL hasn't been
doing much marketing directly to consumers lately. She also says
AOL needs to resume its old aggressive marketing stance to compete
in the increasingly crowded ``portal'' space. She says the second
part of AOL's strategy is to get the product out to existing
customers to they can upgrade their software.

 &HT;    Stocks' advance fuels new talk of BellSouth-Sprint marriage
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- A recent spike in the stock price of Sprint Corp. has
spurred talk the company is a merger target _ and BellSouth is
again rumored to be a potential suitor.
</P>
<P>
   Other large phone companies have been rushing to the industry
stage proclaiming partnerships, while Sprint and BellSouth have
stayed conspicuously aloof. But speculation pairing the two
received fresh fuel this week as the stock in both companies
reached all-time highs, even if both drifted lower in Thursday's
marketwide sell-off.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint stock, which dipped Thursday to $77.87 1/2, had jumped $5
the day before, part of a climb that began Sept. 2, when the stock
was selling for $64. During that same period, BellSouth stock has
climbed from $66 to $74.56 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   David Burks, an analyst with Hilliard Lyons, said much of the
strength in BellSouth stock can be traced to the company's earnings
growth and its relative insulation from harm during a deepening
international economic crisis. The slew of mergers has hardly
driven BellSouth to panic, but the game is gradually changing, he
said. ``I think they may be more amenable to a venture with another
company than they were a year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say both companies can succeed for some time without
partners. But both are expected to eventually extend their reach to
compete with the new behemoths that could soon surround them.
</P>
<P>
   ``With every merger that gets announced, BellSouth gets a little
further behind,'' said Mel Marten, analyst at Edward Jones &AMP; Co.
``I certainly believe that there are talks happening. But I would
be surprised to see an announcement from these two companies
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Giving the rumor some staying power is the notion that Sprint's
profile meshes well with BellSouth, which has a $15 billion-a-year
local-service business in the Southeast, an Internet business and
rapidly growing investments in Latin America. Sprint, the
third-largest long-distance company, is also building a national
wireless service and owns a chunk of Earthlink, a provider of
Internet access. Sprint has a local-service business scattered
around the United States and an international business in
partnership with France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   The only obvious overlap would be the U.S. wireless business of
the two companies. Such a merger would also face considerable
regulatory questions, since BellSouth is not yet permitted to offer
long-distance. But such a deal grows in likelihood if other
megamergers pass muster and if BellSouth does win federal approval
for long-distance.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint Chief Executive William T. Esrey recently testified in
Congress that he found the $62 billion SBC Communications plan to
buy Ameritech to be anti-competitive, a stance that would make it
hard to tout a Sprint merger anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey also told reporters Thursday his company has what it needs
to succeed. ``If I thought we needed something we didn't have, we
would consider going and getting it, or even consider a merger. But
I don't know what that is. We're very comfortable where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth's board of directors next meets Monday. Company
spokesman Tim Klein declined to comment on questions about any
merger or venture ``unless and until an agreement is reached.''

 &HT;    Circus leader on a cloud with Southwest
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The founder of an Atlanta-based big top has gone big
time as the star of a new television ad for Southwest Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Cedric Walker, president of the UniverSoul Circus, is featured
in a Southwest spot appearing on BET, Black Entertainment
Television. It may run elsewhere later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone loves a circus, so a few years back I started one,''
Walker says in the ad titled ``Another Southwest Airlines Freedom
Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker often flies ahead of the circus to promote ticket sales
at the next venue. The ad claims Southwest's low fares give him the
``freedom'' to be where he needs to be.
</P>
<P>
   In the spot he is seen watching the circus's preparations from
behind a curtain, then ducking out to catch his next flight as
ringmaster ``Casual'' Cal Dupree opens the show.
</P>
<P>
   The ad concludes with Walker exclaiming: ``We've got the best
show under the big top, and Southwest has the best one over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker and Dupree founded the circus _ dubbed ``Cirque du Soul''
by one reviewer _ in 1994. They tout it as the first
African-American circus in a century. It performs once a year in
Atlanta and is currently on a 19-city tour.
</P>
<P>
   Publicity manager Hank Ernest said ``it blew my mind'' when
Southwest's Texas ad agency called to ask about using Walker.
Someone at the agency had read an article about the circus. He said
Walker really does fly Dallas-based Southwest when he can. The
carrier has expanded nationally in recent years but doesn't serve
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   And what about UniverSoul's performers and crew? Ernest said
they travel by bus.

 &HT;    Coca-Cola taking its case to analysts
 &HT;    By Mickey H. Gramig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Coca-Cola Co. investors are anxiously waiting to hear
what Chairman and Chief Executive Officer M. Douglas Ivester will
say today when he briefs analysts about the company's near-term
business prospects.
</P>
<P>
   In New York this morning, Ivester and Chief Financial Officer
James E. Chestnut will give analysts a volume and earnings update
for the third quarter and the full year. The update is done each
quarter, either by conference call, video conference or in person;
Coca-Cola officials decided just this week to host the meeting in
New York with both Ivester and Chestnut attending.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting comes at a pivitol time, as analysts and investors
alike are expressing concern over the Atlanta-based company's
profitability in troubled economies around the globe. Several
analysts have cut earnings estimates and ratings on the stock,
which has plummeted 36.3 percent since hitting a 52-week high of
$88.93 3/4 on July 15.
</P>
<P>
   The stock closed Thursday at $56.68 3/4, down $1.31 1/4. More
than 6.7 million shares changed hands _ roughly twice the six-month
daily average.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone is expecting Ivester and Chestnut to give a
less-than-rosy short-term outlook, though just how blunt they will
be remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   In the company's midterm report mailed to shareholders this
week, Ivester acknowledged this year's earnings have been partly
``hampered'' by the effect of the strong U.S. dollar and weak
currencies abroad, particularly in Asia. Per-share earnings in the
first half were 82 cents, compared with 91 cents in the year-ago
period. Ivester, however, also noted that operating income rose 8
percent in the first half, ``even with currency factors.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, which does business in 197 countries, gets 70 percent
of its sales and 75 percent of its profit from international
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The company's earnings, to be released next month, are expected
to be 40 cents per share, according to First Call's revised
estimate. At the beginning of the quarter, First Call's consensus
estimate was 42 cents. In the year-earlier period, Coca-Cola earned
34 cents per share, excluding a gain from the sale of stakes in
bottlers.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford C. Bernstein analyst William Pecoriello has predicted
the strong dollar will clip this quarter's earnings by 10 percent,
with the biggest hits coming from Japan, Germany and Mexico. He
expects sales to increase 6.5 percent in the quarter, compared with
11 percent in the year-ago third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential Securities analyst George Thompson said that despite
the harsh economic climate, Coca-Cola is better able to weather the
storm than some companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current management has spent 10 years and billions of
dollars in putting together a very, very effective bottling system
on a worldwide basis,'' he said. ``That bottling system is in a
position to spend money and market more effectively on a local
level than it's ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who has a ``strong buy'' rating on the stock, feels
some investors are overreacting by bailing out.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we're seeing here. Typically, when people approach
being hysterical, it provides a great opportunity to buy the
stock,'' he said. ``When you see a (stock) like this crater as it
has, somebody probably is scared out of their wits.''

 &HT;    Southern's group one of two finalists to buy Louisiana power
cooperative
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- A consortium that includes Southern Co. is one of two
final bidders for the assets of a bankrupt Louisiana electric power
cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   Houston-based Enron Corp. on Thursday withdrew from the
protracted bidding process.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth D. Rice, chief executive of Enron Capital &AMP; Trade
Resources Corp., said the Enron subsidiary was opting out because
of the resources needed to continue with ``what has become an
extremely lengthy and expensive process.''
</P>
<P>
   Enron's withdrawal leaves Louisiana Generating _ which includes
Atlanta-based Southern, Ziegler Coal Holding Co. of St. Louis and
Northern States Power Co. of Minneapolis _ in a bidding war against
Southwestern Electric Power Co. (Swepco), a Shreveport, La.-based
subsidiary of Central &AMP; South West Corp. of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana Generating has bid $1.18 billion, and Swepco has
offered $940 million for Cajun's non-nuclear assets being auctioned
off by a federal bankruptcy judge.
</P>
<P>
   Janni Benson, a Southern spokeswoman, said Louisiana
Generating's bid ``is the best possible deal'' for the
cooperative's customers and creditors and the local economy. Cajun
was forced into bankruptcy in 1994 by its losing investment in the
Riverbend nuclear power plant in Louisiana. Cajun's assets include
more than 1,600 megawatts of power capacity from a network of
coal-driven power plants and long-term contracts to sell that power
to 12 rural electric co-ops. Those co-ops, in turn, provide power
for 1 million Louisiana residents.
</P>
<P>
   Southern joined the Louisiana Generating consortium as part of
its effort to acquire electric generating capacity around the
country to supply its growing wholesale energy trading business.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana Generating has the support of court-appointed
bankruptcy trustee Ralph Mabey, but Louisiana-based Swepco has
backing from most of the co-ops Cajun supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The proceeding has been one of a number of battlegrounds between
Southern and Enron as the companies increasingly face off in power
markets around the world.

 &HT;    Time Warner faces lawsuit over licensing of characters
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA A British entrepreneur has sued Time Warner for $153
million, charging that the media conglomerate fraudulently killed a
deal to open theme restaurants based on characters from the library
of Turner Broadcasting System.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed Thursday in federal district court in Atlanta,
concerns a troubled deal struck in May 1995 with Turner Home
Entertainment, a unit that was disbanded when Time Warner bought
its Atlanta-based parent two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Home Entertainment had agreed to let a company called
Dream Factory, controlled by Alan Lubin, use characters from Turner
Broadcasting's MGM libraries to decorate restaurants, the first of
which was to open in London.
</P>
<P>
   But the opening of the restaurant was delayed for years.
Consequently, Time Warner ordered Turner Home Entertainment to
cancel its deal with Dream Factory. Instead, the company struck a
similar deal with another set of British entrepreneurs incorporated
as ENIC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite simply, Time Warner and ENIC engaged in a conspiracy to
appropriate the project by convincing THE (Turner Home
Entertainment) to wrongfully terminate the agreement with Dream
Factory,'' says the suit.
</P>
<P>
   The suit seeks to recover what it describes as $38.3 million in
real damages. It also requests punitive damages equal to four times
that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys representing Dream Factory and Lubin declined to
comment Thursday on their suit.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner executives declined to comment on the suit Thursday,
explaining they had not yet seen it.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, finding new uses for Turner Broadcasting's movie
and cartoon characters was a key strategy for the company.
Licensing them to a restaurateur was typical of the kinds of deals
the company was looking for.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, its deal with Dream Factory struggled from the
start, according to the suit. Dream Factory wanted to open its
first restaurant in a historic building within a part of London
controlled by the royal family.
</P>
<P>
   ``What followed was an extremely tedious, drawn out and detailed
procedure to obtain'' various permits to use the site, says the
suit.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the restaurant was delayed again and again,
although the suit says Turner Home Entertainment continued to
support Dream Factory.
</P>
<P>
   But then Turner Home Entertainment, now a unit of Time Warner,
``unilaterally, suddenly and wrongfully'' canceled the project on
Nov. 11, 1996, according to the suit.
</P>
<P>
   The suit says that shortly thereafter Time Warner announced a
new idea to open theme restaurants. This time it was with Peter
Dubens and Daniel Levy, who had tried earlier to buy into the pact
with Dream Factory, says the suit.

   LA-COUNCIL-RAISE _ (Los Angeles) The members of the Los Angeles
City Council are getting a 3 percent pay raise, retroactive to July
1, in addition to a 9.7 percent raise they got earlier this year,
city officials said Thursday. The latest increase pushes their pay
to more than $110,000 a year. At least two council members say they
will reject all or part of the increase, which was caused by a
provision in the city charter linking council salaries to judges'
salaries; judges are getting higher pay under the new state budget.

Pacific Northwest five months ago with a dream to sing the nation's
theme song in all major league stadiums by season's end. In Dodger
Stadium just after 7 p.m. he realized that goal. By Beth Barrett.

supervision during recess. ``Can I go to work without worrying

BEN STILLER SCORES IN `MIDNIGHT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MELISSA MORRISON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Maybe Ben Stiller is the Dustin Hoffman of the Student
Loan Generation.
</P>
<P>
   Barely minutes after he stars in the biggest gross-out comedy of
the year, ``There's Something About Mary,'' and seconds after
playing a rabbity adulterer in what may be the harshest
relationship movie ever made, ``Your Friends and Neighbors,'' he
morphs into a convincing Hollywood junkie in ``Permanent
Midnight.''
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect to his comedian parents, Anne Meara and
``Seinfeld's'' Jerry Stiller, the junior Stiller seems to have the
acting genes of a contortionist: He apparently can do anything,
anytime, all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Like Hoffman in ``Lenny,'' Stiller plays a self-destructing
Jewish wit and heroin addict. The story is drawn from the
autobiography of Jerry Stahl, a TV writer who was apparently
shooting up in the studio latrine on his coffee breaks from the
alien-puppet comedy ``Alf.'' Stiller is the movie version of Stahl,
who graduates from Percodan to a heroin and crack habit ``the size
of Utah'' while riffing brilliantly for an alien-puppet comedy
called ``Mr. Chompers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I see Mr. Chompers as a modern-day Tom Joad,'' he bulls to the
producer, who loves it.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl's decline is a familiar one: Drugs eventually supersede
everything else in his life, including his career, his friends, his
wife (played by Elizabeth Hurley of ``Austin Powers'') and his
baby. Such a single-minded character could quickly become
monotonous to watch _ and the requisite shooting up and
jonesing-for-a-fix scenes excruciating _ but Stiller's finely
pitched stance between comedy and drama keeps Stahl interesting. It
helps that the story is bookended by a Stahl who's 90 days sober
relaying his history to a sympathetic pickup (Maria Bello from
television's ``ER'').
</P>
<P>
   There have been many movies about heroin addiction among the
gutter types (``The Man With the Golden Arm'' through
``Trainspotting'') and among the celebrity firmament (basically,
any biopic about a post-'50s rock star). This one addresses a more
recent phenomenon: junkies who exist somewhere in between.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, the career of Jerry Stahl is not exactly
interchangeable with that of an insurance salesman from Duluth. But
the fact that Stahl was a middle-class crackhead and junkie in LA
contributes to ``Midnight's'' plausibility.
</P>
<P>
   It's perfectly believable that Stahl would show up for a job
interview with the pallor of a corpse, curl up fetal-style in a
chair, proceed to ramble about his childhood memories and not be
escorted from the building by security. After all, he's in
television. Or that he would follow an intravenous breakfast with
wheatgrass juice and a five-mile run. After all, he lives in LA.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Stahl pays a visit to his East L.A. dealer and
speaks earnestly about mentoring her teenage son, all the while
loading up a syringe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Midnight'' is directed by David Veloz, who culls from the
techniques and music of videos, gimmicks that more often than not
are used to distract viewers from a limp story. Here, though, they
give an appropriately slick polish to a solid, very contemporary
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Permanent Midnight'' is rated R for the obvious reasons: sex,
drugs and profanity. 4 stars. &QL;

POVERTY RATE DECLINED LAST YEAR, LARGELY AMONG BLACKS AND
HISPANICS

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The proportion of Americans living in poverty
declined last year, mostly because of reductions in poverty among
black and Hispanic families, the Census Bureau reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The data reflected three consecutive years of growth in income,
which have restored household incomes and poverty to the levels
recorded in 1989, just before the last recession.
</P>
<P>
   The poverty rate was 13.3 percent last year, down from 13.7
percent in 1996 and 15.1 percent in 1993. The number of people in
poverty, 35.6 million last year, has dropped by 3.7 million since
1993.
</P>
<P>
   The poverty rate for non-Hispanic whites was unchanged at 8.6
percent last year. But the rate for blacks declined to 26.5
percent, the lowest since the government began collecting data on
poverty among African Americans in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   And the poverty rate for Hispanic Americans declined to 27.1
percent, from 29.4 percent in 1996 _ the largest one-year drop in
Hispanic poverty since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The data were a tonic for President Clinton, battered by eight
months of embarrassing disclosures about his affair with a young
White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the statistics vindicated his economic policies and
showed that low-income people were finally sharing the fruits of a
vibrant economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our growing economy is giving more and more families a chance
to work their way out of poverty,'' he said in the Rose Garden of
the White House. ``After six years, it can't be an accident
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidents generally get credit for economic growth and are
blamed if the economy declines. Clinton fought successfully for
increases in the minimum wage and in the earned-income tax credit
available to low-income workers, and White House officials said
those changes had helped reduce poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said that much of the decline in poverty was
attributable to the overall strength of the economy, which has
resulted from general fiscal and monetary policy. Republicans and
Democrats have tried, in different ways, to eliminate the federal
budget deficit, while Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal
Reserve, is often given credit for pursuing an enlightened monetary
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks have been among the president's most steadfast supporters
in recent months, and Thursday's data show that they have fared
well in the Clinton years.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the number of families in poverty declined last year by
384,000, to 7.3 million from 7.7 million in 1996. Black families
accounted for more than half of the decrease.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau found surprisingly robust growth in income
even among families headed by women. The incomes of households
headed by women rose last year by 8 percent for blacks, 10.3
percent for Hispanic Americans and 3 percent for whites. Among
non-Hispanic whites, hardly any change was seen.
</P>
<P>
   The poverty rate for children was under 20 percent last year for
the first time since 1989, and Clinton said the child poverty rate
had declined more since 1993 than in any other four-year period
since the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   But the poverty rate for people 18 to 64 years old was higher
last year than in 1987-89. And for households headed by people 35
to 54, income has not kept pace with inflation, so real income was
lower last year than in 1989, the bureau said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The welfare rolls are declining much faster than the number of
people in poverty. But Rebecca Blank, a member of the President's
Council of Economic Advisers, said, ``It's way too early to look at
these numbers and conclude very much about the successes of welfare
reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Politicians have repeatedly denounced growing inequality in the
distribution of income. But Census Bureau officials said their data
suggested that such inequality had stabilized.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the fourth consecutive year in which there was no
year-to-year change in overall income inequality,'' said Daniel
Weinberg, chief of the Census Bureau office that collects income
data.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Robert Reischauer, former director of the Congressional
Budget Office, said he found it remarkable that ``income inequality
has not been reduced after two years in which we've enjoyed the
healthiest economy in more than three decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg said the bureau's field interviewers probably missed
many people with very high incomes, just as they miss homeless
people. In addition, he said, anyone who reports income of more
than $1 million a year is listed as having $1 million of income.
</P>
<P>
   The data in the report are drawn from interviews with residents
of 50,000 households chosen to be representative of the nation. A
family of four was classified as poor if it had cash income of less
than $16,400 in 1997. The threshold for a family of three was
$12,802. Income, as officially defined, does not include capital
gains, health insurance or government benefits like food stamps,
Medicaid and housing subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the Census Bureau also made these points:
</P>
<P>
   _ Median household income rose last year by 1.9 percent, to
$37,005 from $36,306, after adjusting for inflation. The number of
households above the median is the same as the number below it.
</P>
<P>
   _ The median income of black households rose 4.3 percent last
year, to $25,050, while Hispanic households had an increase of 4.5
percent, to $26,628. The Northeast was the only one of the nation's
four regions that did not experience a significant increase in
income last year.
</P>
<P>
   _ State poverty rates, measured by three-year averages, ranged
from an extraordinary low of 6.9 percent in New Hampshire to a high
of 24 percent in New Mexico. The next highest rates were found in
Mississippi (20.2 percent) and Louisiana (18.8 percent).
</P>
<P>
   _ The poverty rate for children last year (19.9 percent) was
nearly twice the rate for people 65 and older (10.5 percent). Of
the 32 million elderly Americans, 3.4 million live below the
poverty line, and 2.1 million are just above it, with incomes
exceeding the official poverty level by no more than 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ The number of blacks in poverty dropped last year by 600,000,
to 9.1 million, from 9.7 million in 1996. The number of Hispanic
people in poverty declined to 8.3 million, from 8.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ A majority of all poor families are headed by women. There are
7.3 million poor families in America, and 4 million are headed by
women.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the bureau said that the poverty rate for
noncitizens, 25 percent, was double the rate for people born in the
United States. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Known more for her political savvy than her creative impulses,
Senator  &UR; Dianne &LR;   &UR; Feinstein &LR;  has at last come out of the closet.
She is an artist.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding subject matter _ ``The Scream'' or ``The Rape of the
Sabine Women,'' for instance _ that might have trite relevance to
government work, Feinstein concentrates on images from nature,
birds and flowers she's grown in her garden.
</P>
<P>
   The senator said she started drawing almost 10 years ago, &LR;  and
often doodles ``tulips, daisies and roses'' at meetings.
</P>
<P>
   She keeps the original of each formal work _ three birds and
seven flowers hang in her Washington office _ and uses framed
prints as donations to charitable causes or gifts to VIPs. Her work
has fetched as much as $2,000 at auction.
</P>
<P>
   Four Feinstein flower prints, &LR;  _ elegantly framed,
double-matted, signed and dated, &LR;  _ will be auctioned October 21 at
the ANA Hotel at the seventh annual Francis J. Curry Tribute Dinner
for the North of Market Senior Services.  &UR; Michael Krasny &LR;  is

   A survey of 200 American men 18 to 45 years old found the
maximum number of lovers was ``between 40 and 50,'' a total
accumulated by a man who said he lied to some women about it ``when
it was clear they'd be appalled by the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond your first few partners,'' said  &UR; Richard Kadrey &LR; ,
former editor of a sex magazine, ``there's something kind of
adolescent about counting. At first, you need to prove to yourself
that you can get laid, but after a while, you're just keeping
score.''

HarperCollins.

<P>
   Known more for her political savvy than her creative impulses,
Senator  &UR; Dianne &LR;   &UR; Feinstein &LR;  has at last come out of the closet.
She is an artist.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding subject matter _ ``The Scream'' or ``The Rape of the
Sabine Women,'' for instance _ that might have trite relevance to
government work, Feinstein concentrates on images from nature,
birds and flowers she's grown in her garden.
</P>
<P>
   The senator said she started drawing almost 10 years ago, &LR;  and
often doodles ``tulips, daisies and roses'' at meetings.
</P>
<P>
   She keeps the original of each formal work _ three birds and
seven flowers hang in her Washington office _ and uses framed
prints as donations to charitable causes or gifts to VIPs. Her work
has fetched as much as $2,000 at auction.
</P>
<P>
   Four Feinstein flower prints, &LR;  _ elegantly framed,
double-matted, signed and dated, &LR;  _ will be auctioned October 21 at
the ANA Hotel at the seventh annual Francis J. Curry Tribute Dinner
for the North of Market Senior Services.  &UR; Michael Krasny &LR;  is
keynote speaker. More information is available at (415) 885-2274.

   &UR; LISTING THE PROS AND CONS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ More than 60 artists, intellectuals and just plain celebrities
have signed a petition, released in Paris on Wednesday, opposing
``inquisitorial harassment by a fanatical prosecutor with unlimited
power.''
</P>
<P>
   The anti-Starr petition, being circulated by former French
cultural minister  &UR; Jack Lang &LR; , was signed by Archbishop  &UR; Desmond &LR; 
 &UR; Tutu &LR;  of South Africa,  &UR; Gabriel Garcia Marquez &LR; ,  &UR; William Styron &LR; ,
 &UR; Carlos Fuentes &LR; ,  &UR; Gunter Grass &LR; ,  &UR; Gerard Depardieu &LR; ,  &UR; Vanessa &LR;

 &UR; Constantin Costa-Gavras &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``A statesman is answerable to public opinion or to the law only
for his public acts,'' said a portion of the statement quoted in
the Washington Post. ``All else is solely a matter of his own
conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``How many women has he slept with?'' asks the latest issue of
Glamour magazine, which was referring to any woman's boyfriend. (A
hundred before he was 40,  &UR; Monica Lewinsky &LR;  told
 &UR; Kenneth Starr &LR; , but ``Solomon'' had 300 concubines,  &UR; Bill Burke &LR; 
read in some Philharmonia Baroque program notes.)
</P>
<P>
   A survey of 200 American men 18 to 45 years old found the
maximum number of lovers was ``between 40 and 50,'' a total
accumulated by a man who said he lied to some women about it ``when
it was clear they'd be appalled by the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond your first few partners,'' said  &UR; Richard Kadrey &LR; ,
former editor of a sex magazine, ``there's something kind of
adolescent about counting. At first, you need to prove to yourself
that you can get laid, but after a while, you're just keeping
score.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Jerry Oppenheimer &LR; , who trashed  &UR; Martha Stewart &LR;  in a
best-seller published last year, is writing ``State of a Union,'' a
book about &UR; Bill &LR;  and  &UR; Hillary Clinton &LR; 's marriage, for
HarperCollins.
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer doesn't seem to have any special inside knowledge of
this relationship, but his agent,  &UR; Joni Evans &LR; , told Publisher's
Weekly that he ``knows how to ask the right questions, then he
prints the answers.''

<P>
   &UR; _ Bawang &LR;  the western lowland gorilla gave birth at the San
Francisco Zoo on Wednesday. Members of the gorilla family were
allowed to be with the mother during the birth.
</P>
<P>
   Weight and gender of the infant are unknown, &LR;  because the
newborn is clinging so tightly to Bawang.

   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;

   ``Making these horror movies isn't as easy as it might look.
You're trying to act, and there's all these damn puppeteers
crawling around under your feet.''

 UNDATED: actual actor.
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
   _ Aaron Spelling is doing other things _ actually, he's doing
``Buddy Faro'' with Mark Frost, but keep that quiet _ and the new
``Fantasy Island'' is now a Barry Sonnenfeld (``Men in Black'')
production.
</P>
<P>
   It could make all the difference. Sonnenfeld's ``Fantasy
Island'' (Saturday on ABC) is far more sardonic than in the days of
Ricardo Montalban and ``da plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm McDowell is the new Mr. Roarke, and you get the feeling
he might have murdered the former Mr. Roarke and seized the island.
</P>
<P>
   More than ever, it's a Fantastical Island, where Mr. Roarke
chases away storm clouds with a snap of a finger and plays havoc
with the psyches of his guests. Who, by the way, book their trips
through a mysterious travel office run by the cackling Fyvush
Finkel (``Picket Fences'').
</P>
<P>
   Louis Lombardi and Edward Hibbert (``Frasier'') are two Roarke
aides who apparently are serving out some sort of sentence, and
Madchen Amick (``Twin Peaks'') pitches in as an assistant who can
morph into different women.
</P>
<P>
   The series is beautifully filmed, in Hawaii, and seems to be an
intriguing mixture of romance, adventure, magic and pure nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like it better, though, if it displayed a willingness, after
all its winking devilishness, to eschew conventional moral lessons
for Mr. Roarke's clients.
</P>
<P>
   _ Despite a time slot that could double as a cemetery plot,
``Cupid'' (Saturday on ABC) could develop an avid if not massive
following.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Piven, late of ``Ellen,'' stars as Trevor Hale, a glib
fellow who materializes in Chicago and claims to be Cupid, the
Roman god of erotic love.
</P>
<P>
   I'm reminded that in ``The Brothers Karamazov,'' when Jesus
reappeared on Earth during the Spanish Inquisition, he was
consigned to the Grand Inquisitor. For our purposes here, it's
Cupid, and he's sent to a psychiatrist (Paula Marshall).
</P>
<P>
   Back on Olympus, he says, life is a ``nonstop, clothing-optional
party. Everyone's happy, drinking wine, chasing nymphs. An amazing
place.'' But for some transgression, he's been ordered to join 100
couples in true love before he can rejoin his fellow gods.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, that scores sky-high on the asininity scale. But
Piven has a roguish, fast-talking appeal, not unlike Bruce Willis
back in the ``Moonlighting'' days.
</P>
<P>
   He and Marshall push hard _ probably too hard _ to recapture
that same romantic friction that made Willis and Cybill Shepherd a
TV commodity a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Look at it this way. If you're home on Saturday night, and you
watched ``Fantasy Island'' without feeling cheated, you might as
well make it an evening with ``Cupid.''

NETWORKS GIVE FAMILIAR FARE NEW TWISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for times.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   First of all, don't you agree that, as matter of principle, at
all times there ought to be at least one spirited private eye show
on TV?
</P>
<P>
   Sure you do. But the genre sputtered after ``The Rockford
Files'' and dropped into a coma sometime around ``Magnum, P.I.''
The culprit, maybe, was too many realistic cop dramas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buddy Faro'' (Friday on CBS) is an eye-catching, highly
enjoyable effort to turn back the clock in a couple of ways.
</P>
<P>
   It seeks to revitalize a seemingly moribund program form, and to
do it in chic retro trappings. Series creator Mark Frost (``Twin
Peaks'') apparently figures the way to do it is to make the old
feel new again.
</P>
<P>
   His star is Dennis Farina, the actor who showed in ``Get
Shorty'' that he can be self-assured, virile and hilarious all at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Farina is Buddy Faro, a legendary Los Angeles detective and bon
vivant who vanished in 1978. Co-star Frank Whaley is the 1998
detective who unearths his idol, Faro, in a drunken stupor down in
Baja.
</P>
<P>
   The third regular cast member is Allison Smith as the girl,
Julie Barber. She's a woman, but this is shamus stuff. There's
always a girl.
</P>
<P>
   Back in L.A., Buddy cleans up well enough to discover that his
old gin-joint pals are dead and gone. But in the neon whirl of our
retro present, when twentysomethings dress up and guzzle martinis,
he finds his second wind. Buddy's back.
</P>
<P>
   It's a neat trick all around for Frost. Buddy might have dropped
from sight in 1978. But ``Buddy Faro'' is in a murky zone. It
borrows from the good-times Rat Pack ambience of the late 1950s and
early 1960s, and blends it with the metallic hardness of the 1990s.
Take a look at why retro movements are fun, but always too sleek
and studied to be real.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to sell yourself,'' says Buddy, probably echoing
Frost's own approach to the show. ``That's what they're buying,
baby _ confidence, style.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Buddy Faro'' is unquestionably a confident and stylishly
pleasing TV series. And it's hard to imagine anyone adorning it
quite so comfortably as Farina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like an anarchist,'' he proclaims, surveying the world
around him.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy is reminded that the word is ``anachronism.'' But he might
have had it right in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Olsen twins, Mary-Kate and Ashley, are 11 years old now
and probably good for one more quiet hit.
</P>
<P>
   Quiet hit means a show that I don't watch, and you don't watch,
and no one we know has ever mentioned watching. But it airs year
after year. The cast of ``Boy Meets World'' is pictured in the
dictionary definition of the phrase.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Mary-Kate and Ashley are in ``Two of a Kind'' (Friday
on ABC), playing the twin daughters of an unmarried college
professor (Christopher Sieber).
</P>
<P>
   The girls see a grand opportunity for matchmaking when the
28-year-old woman hired as their baby sitter (Sally Wheeler) turns
out to be one of their father's students.
</P>
<P>
   It's not bad for what it is. And I expect that in some distant
sweeps month, maybe May of 2004, we'll see the twins as TV
bridesmaids.
</P>
<P>
   Or, someone we don't know will see the twins as bridesmaids.
</P>
<P>
   _ I could wag my finger at you and tell you I have not had
visual relations with ``Brother's Keeper'' (Friday on ABC), but the
fact is that I've seen bits and pieces of the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   It's another of those ABC domestic sitcoms for Friday family
viewing. William Ragsdale is yet another college professor and
single parent, this time the father of an 8-year-old son (Justin
Cooper).
</P>
<P>
   This is in San Francisco. The show is supposed to turn
rib-tickling when dad's brother (Sean O'Bryan), a football bad boy,
is signed by what ABC calls ``the city's pro football team.'' Uh,
99ers?
</P>
<P>
   My impression, albeit incomplete, is that the show could use a
new offensive line, a few pass rushers, a solid secondary, a
linebacker corps, a tight end, a reliable quarterback and a healthy
running back.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise it's great.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Martial Law'' (Saturday on CBS) is a horrible show _
statically directed, uninteresting, and with some of the worst TV
acting since the schlock days of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   I found myself thinking that its makers should relinquish all
restraint and just go for it, purposely make the show as bad as
possible, in hopes that it'd be so awful that viewers would laugh
along with it.
</P>
<P>
   Know what? That might be exactly what's happened. The police
show starring Hong Kong martial arts star Sammo Hung is so
brazenly, giddily stinko that it's tempting to say you shouldn't
miss it.
</P>
<P>
   Hung, who can speak a few words of intelligible English, plays a
Shanghai cop who ends up affixed to the Los Angeles Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   He also ends up winning a dinette set on ``The Price Is Right.''
I must have blinked somewhere; I'm still not sure how that
happened.
</P>
<P>
   Hung is a roly-poly sort who does exude a certain charm, whether
he's elbowing an assailant in the head _ there are three
martial-arts fights in the first episode _ or asking for a ``Dye-uh
Co'' (Diet Coke).
</P>
<P>
   At certain angles, his round face looks like the giggling sun
baby in ``Teletubbies.'' From no angle will he look like an actual
actor.
</P>
<P>

 By ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seeking to repair political missteps, Rep. Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., said Thursday it was he, not Speaker Newt Gingrich,
who presided over impeachment deliberations, and Hyde played down
suggestions that Republicans were seeking to broaden the inquiry
beyond Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, who heads the Judiciary Committee, called a news
conference a day after the White House and congressional Democrats
asserted that the speaker was calling the shots and was motivated
by partisan zeal.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who have been on the losing side in other
confrontations between the president and Gingrich feared they had
stepped into another political trap, and Hyde quickly sought to
stamp his inquiry with his voice and visage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was selected to chair this committee, presumably not as a
delegate of the speaker's office, but as a person who has some
autonomy,'' Hyde said. ``We've tried to exercise it and will
continue to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   But the comments failed to dispel the conflicting signals sent
by Hyde and Gingrich, and left some Republicans confused about who
was actually quarterbacking the deliberations. Some committee
Republicans called on their leaders to let the panel do its job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a classic case of too many chiefs,'' said Rep. Lindsey
Graham, R-S.C., who has been a persistent critic of Gingrich. ``Our
leadership is trying to figure out what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, Hyde outlined the committee's schedule
for the next two weeks. On Friday, the committee will meet in
closed session to decide which portions of the remaining 65,000
pages of evidence from the Whitewater independent counsel to
release.
</P>
<P>
   Committee aides have been pouring over the material, which
includes depositions from Vernon Jordan, Clinton's friend, and
Betty Currie, Clinton's secretary, as well as the tape-recorded
conversations between Ms. Lewinsky and Linda Tripp. Aides have
flagged portions deemed too private, too embarrassing or
irrelevant, and lawmakers will vote on the proposed deletions. Hyde
said that material would probably be made public late next week.
</P>
<P>
   The committee will then vote on Oct. 5 or Oct. 6 whether to
begin a formal impeachment inquiry into 11 charges against
President Clinton. Hyde said that if the committee approved a
measure to open the inquiry, the full House would vote on the
measure a few days later, probably on Oct. 8 or 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like all Americans I want to bring this matter to closure as
soon as possible,'' Hyde said. ``Our guide is deliberate speed, not
too fast that people can accuse us of rushing to judgment and not
too slow so people can accuse us of deliberately stretching it out
for political purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Hyde was trying to stamp out some of the political fires
surrounding Gingrich, the chairman appeared to ignite two new
blazes himself. Committee aides spent much of the afternoon
modifying his statements.
</P>
<P>
   First, Hyde indicated the committee would likely release edited
transcripts of the tape recordings between Ms. Lewinsky and Mrs.
Tripp, but not the tapes themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said they would not push for releasing the tapes, but
they accused Republicans of hypocrisy, saying that Republicans who
had called for the release of Clinton's videotape deposition were
now balking at material that might prove favorable to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unacceptable to pretend to be conducting a bipartisan
investigation and then vote not to release the tapes,'' said Martin
Meehan, D-Mass. ``In the tapes, when you can listen to them, you
can get a better sense of the credibility or lack of credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican aides said later that Hyde did not oppose releasing
the tapes if Democrats insisted; Hyde was only worried about the
logistics of editing hours and hours of tapes, the aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Then Hyde said if the committee conducts a formal impeachment
inquiry, he did not think it would be necessary to call Ms.
Lewinsky as a witness, saying her sworn testimony was good enough.
``I would rather not,'' said Hyde. ``I don't think that would be
too productive.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats pounced on those remarks. ``How are we going to have
an inquiry if we're not going to listen to witnesses?'' said Rep.
Barney Frank, D-Mass. ``What are we going to do at these hearings?
Play records?''
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon, Hyde's office issued a statement correcting
those comments. ``Certainly no decisions have been made on who
might testify,'' if the committee holds formal hearings, Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   After saying little on Wednesday, Hyde's main goal Thursday
seemed to be to tamp down Gingrich's suggestions that the
committee's inquiry might expand to include accusations about
campaign finance abuses by Democrats, illicit transfer of sensitive
missile technology to China, and other allegations that the
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, was still investigating.
</P>
<P>
   The committee would consider any new, serious accusations from
Starr or other House panels, Hyde said, but he made it clear the
panel was plenty busy already. ``None of us are interested in
casting a very wide net,'' said Hyde. ``We have enough on our
plate, believe me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., a member of the panel, seconded
Hyde's concerns: ``We shouldn't become the repository of everything
bad that someone says about Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, Hyde chided those who would try to
sidetrack the panel ``by attempts to cut deals or cry wolf about
partisanship.'' He also sought to pull his squabbling committee out
of the swirling partisan fray, invoking ``the rule of law'' six
times in his 10-paragraph statement as the committee's guiding
principle.
</P>
<P>
   But Hyde's most difficult task over the next several weeks may
be shaking the perception on Capitol Hill that he is doing
Gingrich's bidding. ``All I know is every time I give advice to
Newt, he nods his head affirmatively,'' Hyde told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   And when the speaker offers Hyde guidance?
</P>
<P>
   ``I listen carefully,'' said Hyde, ``but I don't feel bound by
it.''

 &HT;    Neiman case ends with $962,500 award
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- A federal jury Thursday awarded $962,500 to an
Atlanta woman who said Neiman Marcus security guards at Lenox
Square manhandled and strip-searched her because they wrongly
suspected she was a shoplifter.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Lynn Cooper, 54, was leaving the store on Nov. 3, 1996,
when she was confronted in the parking lot by a plainclothes
security guard who she thought was going to rob and abduct her.
Cooper was handcuffed, taken through the upscale department store
screaming, then put in a basement office, where, she says, guards
strip-searched her and reached inside her undergarments to check
for stolen merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased ... that the jury saw the truth in this
matter,'' said Cooper, a computer software consultant. ``But this
is not about money. It's about the customers' safety while they're
shopping in department stores. It's about the proper training of
security guards.''
</P>
<P>
   Deliberating in the type of case that civil attorneys said
rarely gets to trial, the eight-person jury awarded Cooper $750,000
for emotional distress, $100,000 for pain and suffering and $12,500
for her physical injuries. It also awarded $100,000 in punitive
damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're studying our options,'' Peter Farwell, a spokesman for
Neiman Marcus Group, said, declining further comment on whether the
company plans an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, juries have returned million-dollar verdicts
against two stores _ a Dillard's store in Kansas City, Kan., and an
Eddie Bauer branch in a Washington suburb _ in favor of plaintiffs
who claimed they were denied service or stopped on suspicion of
shoplifting because they were African-American.
</P>
<P>
   Neiman Marcus security guards denied strip-searching or
violating the rights of Cooper, who is white.
</P>
<P>
   They said she voluntarily took off her clothes to prove she took
nothing. According to testimony, when Cooper entered the lingerie
apparel fitting room to try on seven items and came out with none,
a guard went inside and counted six. But the other item was in
another stall, which the guard failed to inspect.
</P>
<P>
   Another guard confronted Cooper in the parking lot and the melee
ensued.
</P>
<P>
   In closing arguments, Cooper's lawyer, Richard Hendrix, asked
the jury to award more than $2 million in compensatory damages and
enough in punitive damages to send a message to the $2 billion
company.
</P>

   Cynthia Edwards, a BellSouth employee and the jury forewoman,
said jurors ruled against Neiman Marcus ``because of the negligence
of its employees'' and had talked about awarding Cooper a higher
amount. But the jury was ``not trying to send a harsh message,''
she said. ``We want Neiman Marcus to know that what they did to
Mrs. Cooper was not right.''

 &HT;    Turner U.N. grants to help poor, environment
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The U.N. Foundation, the organization set up to
administer Ted Turner's gift of $1 billion to support United
Nations objectives, announced its second round of grants Thursday,
just four months after announcing its initial grants in May.
</P>
<P>
   The 17 new grants, totaling $32,849,500, will support projects
designed to improve the environment, children's health and the
status of women.
</P>
<P>
   ``This round of grants demonstrates the priority we place on
protecting the environment around the world,'' said Timothy Wirth,
president of the U.N. Foundation. He said the foundation also had
taken care to make sure most of the grants will go toward services
for the poor and that they will support programs encouraging
cooperation between various U.N. programs and agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The grants were awarded by the foundation's board, which
includes, among others, Turner, Wirth, former Atlanta Mayor Andrew
Young and Graca Machel, wife of South African President Nelson
Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   Turner announced a year ago that he would donate to the
foundation Time-Warner stock with a value up to $1 billion in 10
annual installments worth an estimated $100 million each. In its
first round of grants May 20, the foundation awarded $22,181,000 to
22 projects around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The grants announced Thursday include:
</P>
<P>
   $2,383,500 to help African cities manage water.

<P>
   $650,000 to improve early warning and preparedness for future El
Nino weather effects.
</P>
<P>
   $1,249,500 to help governments and individual companies
cooperate in building a framework to contain emission of greenhouse
gases.
</P>
<P>
   $1 million to link the transfer of technology to developing
countries with the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
   $2.8 million to discourage the use of tobacco among children
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   $5,175,000 to create a partnership between the Rockefeller
Foundation and the U.N. Foundation to support efforts to revitalize
the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
   $3,090,000 to vaccinate 7.6 million children against polio in
five war-afflicted countries: Afghanistan, Cambodia, Sierra Leone,
Somalia and southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   $3,090,000 to help prevent the transfer of HIV from mothers to
children by administering the drug AZT to mothers in Cambodia,
Ivory Coast, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   $3,090,000 to improve education, work conditions and skills

</P>
<P>
   $150,000 for a program to be developed by Peruvian adolescents

</P>
<P>
   $1 million to prevent female genital mutilation in Burkina Faso,
Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and Gambia.
</P>
<P>
   $3.2 million to improve reproductive and sexual health for

IMF OFFICIAL DEFENDS THE FUND'S STRATEGIES AMID HEAVY CRITICISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A senior official of the International Monetary
Fund warned Thursday that he would neither submit to ``the
blackmail'' of Russian leaders who threaten national default if
they are not given billions of dollars in new aid, nor allow
Congress to ``impose conditions'' on the fund in return for $18
billion in new contributions from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The comments came as the IMF is facing the most intense
criticism of its 53-year history, accused of mismanaging the
spreading global financial crisis and misjudging the political
effects of its prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   But the senior official, who declined to be identified by name,
conceded no mistakes on the part of the institution during his
90-minute breakfast with a large group of reporters Thursday
morning in the fund's executive dining rooms, three blocks from the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   While the official conceded that the world economy is ``in a
mess,'' he insisted that the global economy would not ``fall into a
world recession'' in coming months. He also made clear that a huge
``contingency fund'' now being assembled for Latin America _
chiefly to support Brazil _ would require direct contributions from
major economic powers around the globe, including the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   So far the Clinton administration has refused to publicly
discuss whether it would agree to commit U.S. taxpayer dollars to
stabilize one of the United State's largest trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   Any such move would have echoes of the 1995 bailout of Mexico, a
move President Clinton made in defiance of Congress, which
overwhelmingly opposed the loans. While Mexico fully repaid the
full $12 billion loan, administration officials are leery about
repeating the experience, especially at a moment when Clinton is
conserving every vote he can in Congress to ward off impeachment
threats.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF official noted that the government of Brazilian
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who faces a national election
in 10 days, has made no ``formal'' request for aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go on assessing the situation to be ready when the need
arises,'' the official said, a considerable understatement of the
frantic series of phone calls exchanged among the world's finance
ministries in recent weeks about stopping the economic contagion
from spreading to Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days the leadership of the fund _ particularly Michel
Camdessus, its French-born managing director _ has been mounting a
public-relations counteroffensive against its many critics.
</P>
<P>
   Both Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and House Speaker Newt
Gingrich have referred to Camdessus as a ``French socialist'' who
has squandered the fund's resources, and the House recently
rejected an $18 billion payment of the U.S. commitment to the
institution.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF has been on the defensive about its $4.8 billion aid
payment to Russia in late July. No one can fully account for what
happened to the money, which was intended to stabilize the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   It was lost in currency transactions after the Russian
government allowed the ruble to be devalued. The IMF aid did, by
most accounts, provide some extra time for the country's oligarchs
to get their cash out of the country before the devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's session with reporters, the senior IMF official
reversed course and was sharply critical of Russia, making clear
that the IMF would not go forward with the $17 billion bailout plan
it cobbled together in July unless Russia met the conditions of the
loan. The new Russian government appears to be going the other way
_ announcing plans to print money to dictate to its lenders when
and how much they will get paid back.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the government to be credible with the international
community they must behave in a civilized way with their
creditors,'' the senior official said. ``Any kind of imposed
solution for debt restructuring would be a mistake.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The official also derided Russia's statements in recent days
that it would resort to ``controlled inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Controlled inflation reminds me of what Anglo-Saxon people
call being half pregnant,'' the official said. ``The IMF does not
like countries to be half pregnant with inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want to be paid for their arrears in fake
money,'' he concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The senior official stressed that ``we are talking with Russia''
and ``trying to obtain from the authorities clarification of their
intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that the ``IMF does not accept'' efforts to
``blackmail'' the institution into providing more funds by
threatening further defaults on international loans, an event that
could trigger more global market turmoil. He seemed to be referring
to comments made earlier Thursday by Russia's deputy Prime Minister
Alexander Shokhin, who said that if the IMF delays additional aid
it would ``drive Russia into a corner.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments on Congress' reluctance to provide $18 billion in
new cash for the IMF _ part of a far larger financial pool
supported by other countries _ seemed intended to signal that the
United States should ask for changes but not dictate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. must bring its contribution,'' he said, ``and no
country is entitled to impose conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   If every country tried to do so, he said, ``at the end of the
day we would have so many conditions _ contradictory _ that the job
could not be done.'' The official held out a small olive branch,
saying ``I hear many things on the Capitol Hill which are music to
my ears and which are already in the cooking here,'' mostly reforms
that would require the IMF to make more data public about internal
operations and about the countries it helps.

 &HT;    HOUSE APPROVES ADDITIONAL VISAS FOR HIGH-TECH WORKERS
 &HT;    By Christi Harlan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After four months of wrangling, the House agreed
Thursday on a plan to create more visas for specially skilled
foreign workers while collecting a fee from employers to pay for
scholarships and job training for U.S. workers.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, crafted this week in meetings between President
Clinton's economic advisers and immigration policy makers from
Congress, will allow up to 337,500 foreign workers to take jobs in
the United States during the next three years. Current law would
have admitted 195,000 foreign workers during three years.
</P>
<P>
   The additional visas were necessary because of unprecedented
demand from the high-tech industry, which has become the
predominant user of the so-called H-1B visas. Industry
representatives lobbied hard for the bill, complaining that they
are unable to find sufficient U.S. engineers and computer
specialists to fill available jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation approved Thursday in a 288-133 House vote was a
compromise between two widely different bills approved in May by
the Senate and the House Judiciary Committee. The Senate version
would have increased the number of visas over five years and
imposed few new restrictions on employers. The House committee
version, written by Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, also would
have added more visas but required new efforts by employers to find
and retain U.S. workers.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation has been stalled since May, in part because the
White House was threatening to veto any bill that did not contain
more money for teaching U.S. students and retraining U.S. workers
to fill the jobs being offered to foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
   The White House got its way this week, winning the addition of a
$500 fee for each visa application and each application for
renewal. The fee is expected to raise at least $75 million, which
will be used in part to create 10,000 scholarships for
underprivileged students to study math and science.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is expected to tout the legislation Friday
during a fund-raising visit to Silicon Valley in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased that the House of Representatives has moved
quickly to pass a bipartisan compromise to address a shortage of
skilled workers, while providing new training and protections for
U.S. workers,'' Clinton said Thursday in a statement. ``To address
that shortage and maintain America's competitive edge, we must give
U.S. workers new opportunities to train and to learn new skills.
This legislation helps us meet that challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The House bill, which could win Senate approval as early as
Friday, will make 115,000 visas available beginning next Thursday,
the start of the federal fiscal year. Another 115,000 visas would
be available beginning Oct. 1, 1999, and 107,500 would be available
Oct. 1, 2000. In 2001, the annual limit reverts to 65,000 visas.
</P>
<P>
   This year's supply of 65,000 visas ran out in early May,
stranding companies and the foreign workers they had expected to
hire. A spokeswoman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service,
which processes applications for H-1B visas, said the agency does
not count applications _ only visas issued _ but immigration
lawyers are estimating that 25,000 to 30,000 applications are
pending with the INS, awaiting the new batch of visas that will be
issued Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is good news that there are visas available again, and
universities and employers needing highly specialized workers will
again be able to seek visas,'' said Paul Parsons, an immigration
lawyer in Austin, Texas, who has been filing applications for
high-tech companies in the Austin area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad news is they've decided to require employers to pay
$500 to the government per worker,'' Parsons said. ``This appears
to be essentially a tax on U.S. employers to attempt to address the
failure of our educational system to train sufficient U.S. workers
in specialized fields, such as engineering and computer science.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who originally pushed for tougher requirements for
employers, called the passage of the compromise plan ``a nice
victory'' that offers ``protections for American workers.''
</P>
<P>
   And with the money for scholarships and job training, Smith said
``I really am hopeful ... we will have produced enough home-grown
talent'' that additional visas won't be needed after the three-year
boost.
</P>
<P>
   The American Electronics Association, a trade group for 3,000
U.S.-based technology companies, issued a statement saying its
members would not be ``unduly'' burdened by the legislation, which
gives the Department of Labor new power to investigate employers
suspected of underpaying or otherwise abusing foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The H-1B compromise will help high-tech companies continue to
create high-paying jobs for talented skilled workers in the U.S.,
and not lose them to our foreign competitors,'' said association
president William T. Archey. ``Employment-based immigrants who
enter this country legally on H1-B temporary visas play a critical
role in keeping the U.S. high-technology industry globally
competitive. And they create thousands of new jobs in the United
States as a direct result of their scientific and technical
expertise.''

<P>
   MIAMI _ After wreaking havoc in Haiti and the Dominican Republic
then dallying over Cuba, Hurricane Georges strengthened Thursday,
turning northward and taking aim at southern Florida, where 750,000
people were advised to evacuate mobile homes and low-lying coastal
areas.
</P>
<P>
   With the storm gaining both speed and strength as it moved
toward the Florida Straits, forecasters were predicting that the
eye of the hurricane would strike the Florida Keys early Friday.
From Miami to Tampa, millions of nervous residents rushed to
complete their storm preparations in anticipation of that landfall
and the flooding and destruction that are expected to accompany it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1992, we weren't as ready for Hurricane Andrew as we should
have been, and I vowed not to let that happen again,'' said Lisa de
Grandy as she loaded plywood into a van outside a home supply store
here Thursday morning. ``It's tense in there, like a scavenger
hunt, and this is not something I really want to be doing again,
but we want to suffer as little damage as possible this time.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Caribbean nations that have already endured the brunt of
Georges fury began the process of cleaning up, the death toll from
the storm rose to more than 110 Thursday. The bulk of the
fatalities were reported in the Dominican Republic, where at least
45 people in the town of San Cristobal were killed when the walls
of a school being used as a shelter collapsed in flood waters.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dominican Republic and Haiti, which share the island of
Hispaniola, hundreds of people were reported still to be missing
and feared dead. Leonel Fernandez, president of the Dominican
Republic, said the storm had also left more than 100,000 people
homeless and severely damaged sugar, banana, rice and coffee crops
that were nearly ready to be harvested.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a national tragedy,'' he said in a televised
address to the country's 7.5 million people. ``We face a titanic
task.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 3.8 million residents of Puerto Rico were reported
still to be without electricity and water, and the local telephone
company said 339,000 of its customers had no long-distance service,
making communication with relatives in the continental United
States difficult. Some shops and restaurants have reopened, using
generators as their power source, and the government said it hopes
to restore power to half the island by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday, the energy Georges expended during its four-day
rampage across Puerto Rico, Hispaniola and Cuba appeared to have
exhausted the storm. But as the hurricane moved back out over the
warm waters of the Caribbean, it rapidly gained force, and
meteorologists warned that it could strengthen to a Category 3
storm, with winds of more than 125 miles per hour, by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The course Georges is thought most likely to follow in the
coming days would take it directly over the lower Florida Keys
early Friday and on into the Gulf of Mexico. Residents of both
Miami and Fort Lauderdale awoke Thursday to find that a hurricane
warning had been issued for their communities, while a hurricane
watch was extended northward, to Longboat Key just south of Tampa
Bay on the Gulf Coast and to Stuart on the Atlantic Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may become a major hurricane, and we need to be ready for
that,'' Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center
here, cautioned Thursday, after radar images indicated the eye of
the storm was reorganizing itself. ``People really need to count on
it being bad.''

   James Witt, director of the federal Emergency Management Agency,
added that ``it is the storm surge coming behind the Keys that will
have a lot of the force. We're worried about flooding and crop
damage.''
</P>
<P>
   As Georges was regrouping, Alex Penelas, the mayor of Miami-Dade
County, which has 2 million residents, issued a decree for the
evacuation of Miami Beach, Key Biscayne and other communities on
barrier islands directly facing the Atlantic. The directive was
strictly voluntary, however, and many residents, especially young
people and those who did not experience Hurricane Andrew, said they
had no intention of complying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been in a hurricane before, but I'm not
panicking,'' Carolina Aguirre, 32, a teacher and Miami Beach
resident, said. ``It's more dangerous to leave than to stay, so I
will stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents of mobile homes and trailer parks, many of whom
experienced the full force of Hurricane Andrew and its 150 mile per
hour winds, seemed to be taking a mandatory evacuation order aimed
at them seriously, however. At Fowler's trailer park in southern
Miami-Dade County, Xiomara Lopez, 44, and her family of five were
loading an air conditioner and changes of clothes into a truck and
preparing to leave for a relative's house.
</P>
<P>
   ``This trailer survived Andrew, but we're not taking any
chances,'' said her daughter, Ayza Corujo, 23. ``We're lucky,
because a lot of the people here are poor and don't have any place
to go. We're just praying that our home is still here when we come
back, because we don't have any insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   The evacuation directive also applied to the towns of Homestead
and Florida City, both of which were leveled by Hurricane Andrew.
``We are extremely concerned because of the extensive flooding we
believe will be associated with this hurricane,'' Penelas said
Thursday afternoon in explaining the measure and announcing the
opening of public shelters across the county.
</P>
<P>
   Key West, which is expected to end up in the eye of the storm,
was reported to be virtually a ghost town Thursday, with tourists
having fled and hotels, bars and boutiques along normally bustling
Duval Street closed. The Key West airport was closed Thursday
morning, and a 9 p.m. curfew was ordered for Monroe County.
</P>
<P>
   At Cape Canaveral, NASA officials began moving the Discovery
space shuttle off the launch pad and back toward its protective
hangar. Hotels in nearby Orlando were filling rapidly with
residents fleeing threatened areas further south, and MacDill Air
Force Base in Tampa was ordered evacuated.

ANALYSIS: DEEP CONCERN IN THE WORLD OVER WEAKENED CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: CLINTON-POLL, CLINTON-CONGRESS, CLINTON-REPUBS-MONEY,
CLINTON-PRESS, CLINTON-ASSESS.) 
(JT) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ask in Foggy Bottom, ask in Whitehall, ask on the
Quai d'Orsay, ask at the Kremlin, and you get the same deeply
discreet answer: No, of course, Bill Clinton's personal and
political troubles have not impaired the capacity of the United
States to conduct foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   But scratch a little deeper, push a little harder, and you
discover that diplomats and politicians in most of the world's
major nations are worried sick by the spectacle of a distracted
president in Washington at a moment when, in their view at least,
bold American leadership is all but indispensable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world requires an end to this mawkish nonsense,'' said
Christopher Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, a
top-level Tory politician and a newly minted author who is
traveling in the United States to promote his book, ``East and
West.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time Europeans like to poke sticks through the
bars at the United States,'' he added. ``It makes us feel
important. We only realize how much we need you when things go
wrong, like now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubert Vedrine, the French foreign minister, spoke of ``a world
that isn't getting any stronger, with 25 regional conflicts
involving 40 countries, states in the process of disintegration, a
spreading financial crisis.'' He added: ``What we need is strong
leadership in all our countries, starting with the United States.
For us, what is worrying is the guerrilla war between the Congress
and the president, which has been going on for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The ambassador in Washington of one of the closest allies of the
United States, speaking on condition of anonymity, used blunter
language. He said, ``You'd have to be deaf, dumb, blind and a
mental defective not to see that Clinton has been weakened in his
capacity to lead, at home and abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   So that the United States can speak with one voice if serious
crises need to be addressed this fall and winter, while impeachment
proceedings may be taking place, the ambassador urged that the
White House hold intensified foreign-policy briefings for
Republican leaders in Congress, starting now.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many complex problems in the world that were not
able to be solved even before these events, and we shouldn't
confuse the two,'' Vedrine cautioned a group of reporters at
breakfast in New York City on Wednesday. ``But that is my answer
today. Will this affect America's capacity in the future? I hope
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Some officials insist that Clinton has not been distracted at
all. For example, Alastair Campbell, spokesman for Prime Minister
Tony Blair of Britain, said after Blair and Clinton had talked at
the United Nations in New York on Monday, the very day that
Clinton's grand jury testimony was broadcast: ``The prime minister
found him totally focused and able to focus, and engaged on all the
issues where he needs to be engaged.''
</P>
<P>
   But the calculus is a bit more complicated than that. It
involves many questions, of which the president's ability to
concentrate is only one. Can he spare the time, for instance, to
rally international coalitions? Can he influence congressional
action on foreign policy? Will all his actions abroad be
interpreted in unfriendly quarters at home, like the bombing raids
on Afghanistan and Sudan, as mere ploys to divert attention from
the Lewinsky case and impeachment hearings?
</P>
<P>
   One thing is clear in almost every capital: A crippled president
is good news for no one. Gratitude for past support was one element
in the standing ovation Clinton got at the United Nations; it was
led by Foreign Minister Rosario Green of Mexico, which the Clinton
administration bailed out of a financial crisis nearly three years
ago. But the applause was also designed, some delegates said, to
strengthen Clinton's hand during a time of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   People in different countries fret about different issues.
</P>
<P>
   A top-ranking State Department official said that proposals for
fresh initiatives in two of the most difficult situations, those in
Kosovo and in Iraq, have been on Clinton's desk for some time. He
would not say how long, but he commented: ``We need action, and in
normal times, we would have had it. But these are not normal times,
as you may have noticed.''

 WASHINGTON: have noticed.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States has sat quietly by while Saddam Hussein
expelled U.N. arms inspectors, having said previously that it would
not accept such action, and it has failed so far to intervene to
slow Serbian attacks upon ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Some
Europeans think Clinton's hands are tied.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cannot order retaliation against Islamic terrorism without
raising the suspicion of it being a reckless political expedient,''
wrote Alberto Ronchey, the former head of the big publisher Rizzoli
RCS, in the Milan, Italy, newspaper Corriere della Sera.
</P>
<P>
   An Asian diplomat complained bitterly about what he called
``intolerably late, intolerably inadequate'' U.S. action in the
case of Anwar Ibrahim, the former Malaysian deputy prime minister,
who was fired earlier this month from his positions in the Cabinet
and the ruling political party, then arrested in Kuala Lumpur on
Sunday on charges of sexual misconduct and treason.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's first official comment came only Thursday, in the
form of a statement by the State Department spokesman, James Rubin,
expressing concern over the detention of Ibrahim under Malaysia's
Internal Security Act, which dates from the insurgency there
decades ago. Asian representatives in Washington wanted a tougher
American line, enunciated by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The international financial crisis is another cause for anxiety,
although some foreign officials continue to suggest that Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin can manage U.S. economic policy with minimal
White House help.
</P>
<P>
   Others suggest, though they offer no convincing proof, that if
Clinton had not been preoccupied this summer when troubles broke
out in Asia, Russia and then Brazil, he might have been able to
react much more aggressively. And his legal troubles are widely
blamed abroad for the president's inability to persuade Congress to
authorize an additional $18 billion for the International Monetary
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Gianni De Michelis, the former Italian foreign minister who was
convicted of corruption in the early 1990s, said that signs of
Clinton's weakness on the international front were already evident
in the IMF setback.
</P>
<P>
   No stranger to the political fallout of legal entanglements, De
Michelis said: ``If Japan blows up, we are facing an unthinkable
disaster. It would obviously be useful to have at the head of the
most powerful government in the world someone who can deal with
world crises with a free hand.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton's efforts to open a debate on the financial crisis
have been welcomed in Brazil, the country's finance minister, Luiz
Felipe Lampreia, said that the president's ability to lead that
debate has been reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian officials, the finance minister said, were ``extremely
concerned with the fact that President Clinton is weakened
internationally.''
</P>
<P>
   Some on Capitol Hill believe that the Lewinsky affair has
contributed to the looming failure of Clinton's bid for wider
powers to negotiate trade treaties. The House is scheduled to vote
Friday on so-called fast-track authorization legislation, with a
defeat widely anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Walter B. Jones Jr., R-N.C., said he had been leaning
against widening presidential powers last year but was now a sure
``no'' vote. His views had changed because of his constituents'
views, he said, adding: ``They don't want to see this president
given any new authority.''

 &HT;    HOUSE APPROVES ADDITIONAL VISAS FOR HIGH-TECH WORKERS
 &HT;    By Christi Harlan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After four months of wrangling, the House agreed
Thursday on a plan to create more visas for specially skilled
foreign workers while collecting a fee from employers to pay for
scholarships and job training for U.S. workers.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, crafted this week in meetings between President
Clinton's economic advisers and immigration policy makers from
Congress, will allow up to 337,500 foreign workers to take jobs in
the United States during the next three years. Current law would
have admitted 195,000 foreign workers during three years.
</P>
<P>
   The additional visas were necessary because of unprecedented
demand from the high-tech industry, which has become the
predominant user of the so-called H-1B visas. Industry
representatives lobbied hard for the bill, complaining that they
are unable to find sufficient U.S. engineers and computer
specialists to fill available jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation approved Thursday in a 288-133 House vote was a
compromise between two widely different bills approved in May by
the Senate and the House Judiciary Committee. The Senate version
would have increased the number of visas over five years and
imposed few new restrictions on employers. The House committee
version, written by Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, also would
have added more visas but required new efforts by employers to find
and retain U.S. workers.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation has been stalled since May, in part because the
White House was threatening to veto any bill that did not contain
more money for teaching U.S. students and retraining U.S. workers
to fill the jobs being offered to foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
   The White House got its way this week, winning the addition of a
$500 fee for each visa application and each application for
renewal. The fee is expected to raise at least $75 million, which
will be used in part to create 10,000 scholarships for
underprivileged students to study math and science.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is expected to tout the legislation Friday
during a fund-raising visit to Silicon Valley in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased that the House of Representatives has moved
quickly to pass a bipartisan compromise to address a shortage of
skilled workers, while providing new training and protections for
U.S. workers,'' Clinton said Thursday in a statement. ``To address
that shortage and maintain America's competitive edge, we must give
U.S. workers new opportunities to train and to learn new skills.
This legislation helps us meet that challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The House bill, which could win Senate approval as early as
Friday, will make 115,000 visas available beginning next Thursday,
the start of the federal fiscal year. Another 115,000 visas would
be available beginning Oct. 1, 1999, and 107,500 would be available
Oct. 1, 2000. In 2001, the annual limit reverts to 65,000 visas.
</P>
<P>
   This year's supply of 65,000 visas ran out in early May,
stranding companies and the foreign workers they had expected to
hire. A spokeswoman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service,
which processes applications for H-1B visas, said the agency does
not count applications _ only visas issued _ but immigration
lawyers are estimating that 25,000 to 30,000 applications are
pending with the INS, awaiting the new batch of visas that will be
issued Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is good news that there are visas available again, and
universities and employers needing highly specialized workers will
again be able to seek visas,'' said Paul Parsons, an immigration
lawyer in Austin, Texas, who has been filing applications for
high-tech companies in the Austin area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad news is they've decided to require employers to pay
$500 to the government per worker,'' Parsons said. ``This appears
to be essentially a tax on U.S. employers to attempt to address the
failure of our educational system to train sufficient U.S. workers
in specialized fields, such as engineering and computer science.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who originally pushed for tougher requirements for
employers, called the passage of the compromise plan ``a nice
victory'' that offers ``protections for American workers.''
</P>
<P>
   And with the money for scholarships and job training, Smith said
``I really am hopeful ... we will have produced enough home-grown
talent'' that additional visas won't be needed after the three-year
boost.
</P>
<P>
   The American Electronics Association, a trade group for 3,000
U.S.-based technology companies, issued a statement saying its
members would not be ``unduly'' burdened by the legislation, which
gives the Department of Labor new power to investigate employers
suspected of underpaying or otherwise abusing foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The H-1B compromise will help high-tech companies continue to
create high-paying jobs for talented skilled workers in the U.S.,
and not lose them to our foreign competitors,'' said association
president William T. Archey. ``Employment-based immigrants who
enter this country legally on H1-B temporary visas play a critical
role in keeping the U.S. high-technology industry globally
competitive. And they create thousands of new jobs in the United
States as a direct result of their scientific and technical
expertise.''

COMMENTARY: LISTEN TO THE MAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By A.M. ROSENTHAL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been a pretty fine vacation for Americans, hasn't it, a
vacation from the whole world for the better part of a year.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to President Clinton, we could take our minds off things
a real bother to think about _ how Saddam Hussein has smashed the
U.N. inspection system supposed to prevent him from ever making
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, and what the United
States is doing about it, which so far is nothing. We did not have
to think about the China-North Korea missile-peddling partnership,
that kind of thing.
</P>
<P>
   For a few days, Mideast terrorists did penetrate American
defenses and consciousness by blowing up two U.S. Embassies. Then
U.S. missiles blew up two terrorist targets, we think.
</P>
<P>
   Talking at the rostrum of the United Nations and around New York
is a man trying to tell us something: There's no vacation ever for
his people or America's.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel is not saying
it clearly enough, because people keep telling him to be nice and
diplomatic, neither of which I have to be.
</P>
<P>
   He is saying that Israel and the United States are the two
countries most in danger from the Iraqs and Irans of the world,
from the China-North Korea proliferation combine, from the whole
universe of terrorism, whether sponsored by states with weapons and
cash, or with decades of propaganda that is anti-American,
anti-Jewish, anti-democracy, anti-peace, anti-everything except
hatred, hatred.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Netanyahu is saying that despite misgivings he shares with
most of his people, he is ready to give the Palestinians more than
they had dreamed of _ until the previous government gave them
reason to believe they could get all they wanted in the way of
land, statehood and arms.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is saying he was elected precisely because he did not
sign on to that much largess. But he is willing to sign on right
now to giving Palestinians 13 percent more land _ Washington's
drummed-up figure.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians would have control of 40 percent of the West
Bank, with a final settlement still ahead. Yasser Arafat already
governs almost 100 percent of West Bank Palestinians. Israeli rule
over Palestinians has already ended.
</P>
<P>
   But the prime minister says there are three conditions _ and
that for a change he would like Washington to help him, by pushing
Arafat to carry out his promises.
</P>
<P>
   First: As promised, Palestinians must dismantle and destroy the
terrorist machinery that otherwise would be forever at the gates of
Israeli cities. He spells out what he means by dismantle and
destroy: Dismantle and destroy.
</P>
<P>
   Second: The 13 percent would be handed over in three months, as
anti-terrorism goals were met and, as promised, the hateful
Palestinian covenant scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   Three: Three percent of the 13 is critical to Israel border and
water protection. No building or Palestinian forces would be
allowed; the Israeli Army would see to it. It would be the first
real Palestinian compromise in five years of negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has been furious at Netanyahu for the impertinence of
defeating Shimon Peres. Clintonians blinded themselves to what he
was doing: working for a peace with enough security so he could
convince himself and Israelis it was safe to try.
</P>
<P>
   There are those in Israel and in America, including myself, who
have no expectation Arafat will accept a peace secure for Israel.
They believe that hatred spread by many Muslim regimes and
Palestinian officials is so deep and foul that it will take years
to clear away the muck.
</P>
<P>
   But I also believe Netanyahu deserves the chance to try. At next
week's meeting with him and Arafat, Clinton can tell Palestinians
that unless they carry out the conditions they will lose the 13
percent and possibly a lot more.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu knows that if there is an agreement, it will create
what he calls a Palestinian entity and what the world will
correctly call a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   But he told me that if Arafat went ahead with his threat to
declare an independent state on May 4, 1999, without a peace
agreement, that would be a unilateral change in status that would
``collapse'' the Oslo declarations and free Israel to take
unilateral action itself _ such as annexing parts of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   I asked him to repeat that, and he did _ slowly, so I could put
it down right.

KOHL, SEEKING FIFTH TERM, PLAYS ON GERMANS' FEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ROGER COHEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MUNICH, Germany _ Battling to win an unprecedented fifth term as
chancellor in national elections on Sunday, Helmut Kohl on Thursday
chose a simple theme: fear.
</P>
<P>
   The setting was Munich, a conservative city, and the specters
Kohl invoked were many and wide-ranging. They included communism,
extremism, fascism, inflation, immigration, Balkan violence,
instability and chaos. Against them, the chancellor suggested, the
best bulwark was his own 300-pound frame.
</P>
<P>
   Having governed Germany for 16 years, Kohl knows his people
well, and they know him. He has a visceral sense of the traumas
left by Nazism, two experiences with hyperinflation and _ in the
east _ four decades of Communist rule. What is unclear, and what
the election will determine, is whether his focus on that history
has now left him out of touch with younger Germans.
</P>
<P>
   ``What should we be afraid of?'' said Achim Bogdahn, a young
editor with Bavarian radio, as he listened to Kohl. ``We have had
him for 16 years and have 4.1 million unemployed. What more do we
need to fear?'' Groups of students chanted, ``Auf Wiedersehen''
(``Goodbye'').
</P>
<P>
   Kohl was unruffled. Speaking to a crowd he estimated at 20,000,
but which looked closer to 2,000, he sought to build on the success
in a recent Bavarian state election of the Christian Social Union,
the sister party to his own Christian Democrats, and portray the
Social Democratic Party of his chief opponent, Gerhard Schroeder,
as dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl recalled that Konrad Adenauer, the first chancellor of the
postwar Federal Republic, had told him long ago that ``the most
important thing is that people learn to trust Germans.'' He said
that trust had now been universally earned, but German stability,
the bedrock of Germany's international standing, could be
threatened if a left-wing government came to power.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, he said, was ready to work with ``the Communists'' in
a coalition government, and he urged people leaning toward voting
for the Social Democrats to recall the horrors of the Bautzen
prison in the former East Germany, where political prisoners were
held under Communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   The message was anything but subtle, but Bavaria is a deeply
conservative place where on Sept. 13 the Christian Social Union
defeated the Social Democrats in state elections by 52.9 percent to
28.7 percent. Each derisive reference to ``the Communists'' and the
dangers of a German lurch leftward raised applause.
</P>
<P>
   By ``Communists,'' the chancellor was referring to the Party of
Democratic Socialism, the successor to the former East Germany's
Communist Party, whose popularity in the east could conceivably
give it a pivotal position in attempts to form a governing
coalition after an election that now appears too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, both Schroeder and the environmentalist Green Party
have ruled out a coalition with the former Communists. But still
trailing Schroeder by between 2 percent and 5 percent in most
opinion polls, Kohl appears to have concluded that his best chance
of a fifth victory may lie in playing on German fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Wall Street,'' he said, ``where calculations are cold,
people make decisions to invest in Germany. And if you ask them
why, they will tell you it is because Germany is stable, and they
can trust us.''
</P>
<P>
   But, the chancellor continued, a glance over Germany's southern
flank was enough to reveal, in Kosovo and Bosnia, how dangerous
Europe remained. ``We need a government with authority, a
government that can provide law and order,'' he said, arguing that
Schroeder could not provide such a government.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl was flanked by Edmund Stoiber, the popular Bavarian
premier, and he repeatedly contrasted the successful Bavarian
economy _ where unemployment is about half the national rate of
10.6 percent _ with that of Lower Saxony and Saar, the states
governed by Schroeder and Oskar Lafontaine, the Social Democratic
Party chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to so-called ``chaos days'' in the Lower Saxony
capital of Hanover _ large public gatherings of punks permitted by
Schroeder _ Kohl asked: ``Could you ever imagine such a thing in
Munich?''

RUSSIA WARNS IT MIGHT DEFAULT IF WESTERN AID IS WITHHELD  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By CELESTINE BOHLEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As the Russian government Thursday laid out ways to
spend its way out of a roiling economic crisis, it also took a
harsh line with its international creditors, warning them of a
potential default on its long-term debt if more Western aid is not
delivered.
</P>
<P>
   The stark, almost belligerent tone used Thursday by Alexander
Shokhin, a deputy prime minister of financial affairs, suggested
that Russia is ready to take an offensive, rather than
conciliatory, tack in its negotiations with the International
Monetary Fund and other creditors as it tries to battle its way out
of a widening budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not like to scare anyone by discussing the possibility
of default,'' Shokhin told a news conference Thursday, ``but we
must at least hope for the loyal attitude of our partners in the
international financial institutions and the G-8, and expect them
to make available those aid packages that have been announced.''
</P>
<P>
   Shokhin's tough talk was seen by financial experts as a sign of
Russia's increasingly desperate situation, as it plots an
inflationary course on the one hand and on the other, seeks help
from Western governments and institutions that have urged it not to
spend money it doesn't have.
</P>
<P>
   On the table this month is the delivery of a $4.3 billion credit
from the IMF, the second installment of a $22.6 billion package
negotiated with the Russian government last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The first $4.8 billion installment, delivered in July, failed to
shore up investors' faltering confidence in the Russian economy and
to prevent Russia's decision on Aug. 17 to devalue its currency and
default on its short-term Treasury bills.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington Thursday, a senior official of the International
Monetary Fund warned that he would not submit to ``the blackmail''
of Russian leaders who were threatening to default.
</P>
<P>
   IMF officials have said that they first want to examine the
Primakov government's economic program before judging whether it
makes sense to lend Russia more money. Shokhin, who is to meet with
an IMF delegation Friday, said such a wait-and-see approach would
push Russia ``against the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will make no secret of the fact that this is a tough
position of the international financial institutions that can
invalidate the conventional pattern of our relationships in the
future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shokhin's strong language, couched by an appeal to the IMF to
treat Russia in a ``civilized manner,'' went down the wrong way
with Western financial analysts who see Russia reverting to its old
bullying ways.
</P>
<P>
   His tone was echoed Thursday by the Russian central bank
chairman Viktor Gerashchenko, who warned Western banks negotiating
over the terms of a rescheduling of Russia's now frozen short-term
Treasury bills not to push too hard. ``Greedy'' banks,
Gerashchenko, ``may lose everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At this particular moment, the objective of the Russian
government should be to avoid becoming a long-term pariah in the
world financial community,'' said Charles Blitzer, director of
emerging markets research at the London office of Donalson, Lufkin
and Jenrette. ``They should be bending over backwards to be more
accommodating. Instead, they have their backs up, and are making
threatening moves.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a speech Thursday to his still-incomplete Cabinet, Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov said the government would first undertake
to pay undelivered pensions and paychecks, and starting in January,
to ``pay compensation'' to the population for soaring prices, and
the cost of the ruble devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Such proposals are sure to further increase an inflation rate
that, according to the Russian economics ministry, had already sent
consumer prices shooting up by 35.7 percent in the first week of
September.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report from the central bank, inflation by the
end of this year will drift up to 290 percent if the value of the
ruble, which Thursday held at 15.6 to the dollar, drifts down to a
rate of 20 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov on Thursday attacked the Aug. 17 decision to devalue
the ruble _ together with a simultaneous default on short-term debt
and a moratorium on bank-held loans _ as ``poorly thought out and
heedless of the real consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting with reporters on Wednesday, Anatoli Chubais, the
architect of Russia's privatization, defended the Aug. 17 decision.
``I thought, and I still think, that the decision was the only one
that could be made,'' he said. ``There were a few short-term
reasons for such a decision. The simplest one was there was no
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Shokhin, a former economics minister in the early 1990s, said
Thursday that Russia would press for a renegotiation of the
estimated $38.4 billion in credits from foreign governments
inherited from the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's total foreign debt _ as opposed to debts held by
Russian banks _ is estimated at $158 billion, of which $91 billion
are Soviet-era obligations. About $31.5 billion are estimated to be
owed to financial institutions. The total figure does not include
derivatives, estimated at $60 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has already missed August payments on debts to Germany,
one of its biggest creditors, and several rating agencies have cut
Russia's credit ratings to near-default levels.
</P>
<P>
   Shokhin proposed offsetting foreign-government debts by swapping
them for debts that third-world countries owe Russia. According to
Moody's Investor Service, those debts, also left over from Soviet
times and held by Moscow's former socialist allies and trading
partners like Iraq and Libya, total about $150 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not rule out that we may come up with a zero option,''
said Shokhin, suggesting that Russia's creditors could assume the
role of broker in what experts called a highly imaginative and
highly improbable debt exchange. &QL;

DISNEY CASTS A WARY EYE ON MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BILL VIRGIN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walt Disney Co. has annual revenues of $22 billion, one of the
best-known brand names in the world and its tentacles in virtually
every form of entertainment, communication and tourism.
</P>
<P>
   But even with those assets, there is one company that Disney
casts a wary eye on _ one headquartered in Redmond, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft may be our most daunting competitor,'' writes Disney
Chairman and Chief Executive Michael Eisner in his new book ``Work
in Progress.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounds more like a statement that should be coming from the
chief executive of Netscape, Sun, Novell or some other computer
technology company. Microsoft does have a more dominant position in
its business of operating systems for personal computers than
Disney does in entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft, with annual revenues of $14.5 billion, isn't as
big as Disney, and its threat to Disney would seem minimal,
especially given Microsoft's spotty record in trying to generate
entertainment content.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner doesn't see it that way. In a telephone news conference
Thursday, Eisner said Microsoft's combination of cash flow, its
``enormous buying power,'' its aggressiveness, and the youth of its
employee base and chairman is ``a formula for competition.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular Eisner noted that Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates
combines youth, money, intelligence and an interest in the
entertainment business. That, he said, means Gates ``is a
competitor to be watched.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner also said he's not dissuaded by Microsoft's lack of a big
hit in the entertainment business; Microsoft has started slowly in
other businesses only to make improvements and become highly
successful, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how Gates will use his interest and cash in the
entertainment field, whether by trying to develop it in-house or in
partnership with others (Microsoft has made a relatively small
investment in the Spielberg-Geffen-Katzenberg venture DreamWorks),
Eisner didn't hazard a guess.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does he know exactly how people will use the Internet when
it reaches maturity. Commerce is a likely application, and Disney
is already selling merchandise online. Less certain is the
possibility of streaming video via the net as a replacement to
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a little like Lewis and Clark,'' he said. ``We've
reached the Rockies and we've got to go across.'' People think
there's something worthwhile on the other side but at this point
``we're still exploring.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney is sufficiently intrigued by the potential of the
Internet to add it to its portfolio of movies, theme parks,
broadcast and cable television networks (including ABC and ESPN),
radio (its holdings include a Seattle station), professional sports
franchises, even cruise ships.
</P>
<P>
   Last year it bought Starwave, the Bellevue-based Web site
developer, from Paul Allen. This year it swapped Starwave for a
stake in Infoseek, which operates an Internet gateway. The two plan
to introduce a new ``portal'' known as Go Network, which will,
according to Eisner's book, act as ``a central hub through which
people can gain access to every business and every form of
information and entertainment that Disney offers.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner said Thursday Disney made the investment in Infoseek
because it wanted control of an Internet channel. The Internet, he
added, is the next big convenience in the home since the television
and the telephone. ``It is that important,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton's standing with Americans has rebounded
broadly in the days since the release of his videotaped testimony
before a grand jury, according to the latest New York Times/CBS
News Poll.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the poll shows there are stirrings of a backlash
against the Republican-controlled Congress and the House Judiciary
Committee in particular as it presses forward with an impeachment
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   By a clear majority, Americans said they disapproved of how the
Judiciary Committee has handled the matter. While committee members
said they released the videotape for the public's benefit, 78
percent of all Americans, and 65 percent of Republicans, said it
should never have been released.
</P>
<P>
   People said they objected to the committee's prying into what
they regard as a private family matter and that it was unnecessary
to make public salacious details about sex. In addition, 65 percent
of Americans said Republicans in Congress were unfairly trying to
weaken the president and the Democrats. Thirty-nine percent of
Republicans saw it that way as well.
</P>
<P>
   But even in the face of a turnabout for Clinton, the first
glimpse of how the Monica Lewinsky scandal could play out six weeks
from now in the national elections helps explain why Republicans
are sticking with an aggressive strategy. The Republican strategy
is popular with the party's core voters, and those voters are most
likely to turn out at the polls on Election Day. Appeals to a
narrow, partisan core of Republicans may carry long-term risks,
however, if it gives the party a lasting image as overly partisan
and out to topple a president.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent resurgence for Clinton has come swiftly _ and is
surprisingly pronounced. Not only has the months-long slide in his
personal ratings halted but, in a marked shift from only a week
ago, Americans also trust him more as a leader, like him more, are
less inclined to think he committed perjury before the grand jury
and increasingly believe that the scandal is a private matter that
has little to do with his job as president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is also helped by a growing sense among Americans that
the investigation by Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent
counsel, has spiraled out of control.
</P>
<P>
   In a telling display of the public's exasperation with the
entire matter, people are now divided over whether Clinton should
be censured by Congress. Forty-six percent of all Americans favor
censure, as do 55 percent of Republicans; only a week ago 57
percent of all Americans wanted such a punishment, as did 70
percent of Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the more promising news for Clinton _ his job approval
rating has risen in the past week to a solid 67 percent and even to
a respectable 40 percent among conservative Republicans _ his gains
should be viewed in relative terms. Most Americans, for example,
continue to say that the president does not share their moral code.
</P>
<P>
   But the most striking finding in the telephone poll, which was
conducted on Tuesday and Wednesday with 960 adults nationwide, was
that on question after question Clinton recaptured support. The
poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Summing up the sentiment of many Americans who have grown
impatient with the Judiciary Committee, Virginia Caperton, a
68-year-old retired factory supervisor in Fennville, Mich., said,
``I just feel like the Judiciary Committee is too partisan.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Caperton, a Democrat, explained in a follow-up interview:
``I don't think they're going to give him enough time to go through
all of the testimony. I don't think that the offense that he
committed is worth all the time and the trouble and the expense of
impeachment hearings.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Huisken, a poll respondent from Montague, Mass., said,
``The members of Congress should look to themselves first and tidy
up their own backyards.''
</P>
<P>
   Expressing weariness about the duration of the inquiry, Ms.
Huisken, 42, a freelance writer who is an independent, said of
Clinton, ``It's appropriate for him to be censured, but it needs to
be done as expeditiously as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   And Nancy Thirtyacre, 46, a Republican respondent from
Wellsville, Ohio, who described herself as a housewife, put it this
way: ``This whole thing is a personal matter between him and his
wife now, and we should let the guy do his job so we can get back
on track.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the 53 percent of Americans who said they would be
satisfied if no action was taken against the president and the
matter was dropped, Ms. Thirtyacre added: ``This whole thing has
gone so far now that they're trying to dig up every little bit of
dirt they can. But let's face it _ there's dirt on everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   She also was among the overwhelming proportion of 8 in 10
Americans who said the investigation has not been worth all its
cost, Starr's inquiry has cost at least $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   Seven in 10 Americans said they saw or heard some part of
Clinton's appearance before the grand jury, although only 1 in 10
said they sat through the entire four hours.
</P>
<P>
   Six out of 10 people who watched Clinton's testimony said he
mostly tried to avoid answering the questions. But, by the same
margin, Americans who watched said it was appropriate for him to
refuse to answer questions about his sexual relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky. Among Republicans, 4 out of 10 said his refusal to answer
those questions was understandable.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's bounce back in the last few days was reminiscent of
when his popularity shot up after his State of the Union Message in
late January, which he delivered shortly after allegations about
his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House intern,
were disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The president's gains seemed to have come at the expense of
Congress and Starr. The overall rating of Congress is 48 percent,
roughly where it has been all year. But last week it was unusually
high, at 56 percent. However, the current rating is still
impressive for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1994, just before the last midterm elections, only
20 percent of Americans approved of the way Congress was doing its
job. A year later there was a backlash against Republicans in
Congress when the public thought lawmakers had gone too far and
shut down the government for partisan purposes. At that time,
approval of Congress was at 26 percent.

AS ATTITUDES ABOUT AIDS SHIFT, NEW LAWS SEEK TO PROTECT THE
PUBLIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Ark., Cal., Fla., Miss., N.Y., Okla., Tenn., W.Va.)  (js) 
 By LYNDA RICHARDSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Reflecting a growing frustration and fear about AIDS,
legislators around the country are passing an increasing number of
laws intended to protect the public. This latest wave of
legislation shifts the focus from earlier laws that protected the
civil liberties of HIV-infected people to laws that seek to
identify, notify and in some cases punish people who intentionally
place others at risk of contracting the virus.
</P>
<P>
   At least 29 states now make it a crime to knowingly transmit or
expose others to HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, with a third of
those states enacting laws within the last two years. This year
alone, 16 state legislatures, including New York, introduced such
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, states are mandating HIV testing for specific
segments of the population, mainly prisoners and pregnant women. In
Arizona, Florida, Mississippi and West Virginia, laws were recently
passed to give good Samaritans and nonmedical personnel the right
to ask the HIV status of the person they assist in a car accident,
fire or medical emergency.
</P>
<P>
   More states are also strengthening programs to notify partners
of infected people. In a blow to New York's powerful AIDS advocacy
groups, the New York state Legislature in June passed a law that
requires doctors to report the names of HIV-positive people so
officials can notify their partners of potential exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the new laws reflect a shift in attitudes toward
people with the virus. The laws have also been fueled by widely
publicized cases of HIV outbreaks, most prominently the case of
Nushawn Williams, the teen-ager who is accused of knowingly
infecting more than a dozen girls and young women in upstate New
York and New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, there is a backlash,'' said Lawrence Gostin, a
director of the Georgetown University-Johns Hopkins University
Program on Law and Public Health and a member of the Federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's advisory committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legislators believe we have been soft on the epidemic,'' he
said, ``that we haven't treated AIDS like other infectious
diseases, and the way they interpret it is a need to get tough on
people with AIDS. The legislative trend is that we've moved from a
period where civil rights and civil liberties for a person with HIV
prevailed to a compulsory and punitive approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Public perception has also changed because powerful new AIDS
drugs have transformed what was seen as a fatal disease into a
chronic condition for many people, making early testing and
treatment more important, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get over the hurdle of treating AIDS as if it were
a political disease rather than a public health disease,'' said
Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., who is sponsoring a federal HIV-partner
notification bill with Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., that mirrors the
New York law. A congressional hearing on the bill is set for
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite a different time and a different era,'' Ackerman
said. ``There's progress that has been made on this disease. People
are living longer with AIDS. Things have calmed down.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the start of the AIDS epidemic in 1981, there have always
been lawmakers willing to champion proposals ranging from
quarantines to criminal prosecution for infecting others. In 1989,
for example, eight states approved laws imposing criminal penalties
for knowingly exposing people to HIV, even as 30 states passed
confidentiality laws to protect infected people, according to the
National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan research
organization in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   But many public health experts and advocates say legislatures
are now far more likely to adopt laws making it a crime to
intentionally expose someone to HIV.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the fear associated with HIV may be growing. A national
telephone survey suggests that the public has become more
suspicious of people who contract the virus, and less knowledgeable
about the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-five percent of Americans believed in 1997 that they could
become infected by sharing a drinking glass with an infected
person, compared with 48 percent in 1991, according to the survey
by researchers at the University of California at Davis. Forty-one
percent believed that AIDS might be contracted from a public
toilet, compared with 34 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Such erosion in knowledge about HIV may reflect the fact that
recent public health campaigns have not emphasized that the disease
is transmitted through sexual contact, tainted hypodermic needles
or blood, said Dr. Gregory Herek, a social psychologist. Herek,
along with a colleague, Dr. John Capitanio, conducted the survey of
1,712 people nationwide. The findings were presented at the World
AIDS Conference in Geneva this summer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although three-quarters of those surveyed believed that infected
people were treated unfairly, they also had harsher views about the
behavior of people with AIDS. Twenty-nine percent last year agreed
that people who contracted AIDS through sex or drug use have got
what they deserved, compared with 20 percent in 1991. More than
half of those surveyed agreed that it was the fault of infected
people if they got AIDS these days, and one-quarter said most
people with AIDS did not care if they infected others.
</P>
<P>
   Public attitudes also may reflect the changing contours of the
epidemic. Blacks now make up a greater percentage of new AIDS cases
than whites, and cases are dramatically increasing among women.
According to the survey, black respondents tended to judge black
people with AIDS more harshly than white infected people, and that
pattern was even more pronounced among black women respondents than
black men.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts see parallels with the occurrences of venereal
disease from 1930 to 1950. At that time, a feeling of repulsion and
anger against infected women, particularly prostitutes, was
reflected in laws imposing criminal penalties, mostly as
misdemeanor offenses, for knowingly exposing people to, or
transmitting, venereal infection. Many of those laws remain on the
books.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was thought of as an unenlightened period,'' said Gostin
of the Georgetown-Johns Hopkins program. ``We have kind of returned
to that era. We are now treating the disease as more of a problem
of criminal law and coercive state powers than one to do with
health and medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Many public health officials are troubled by the new
criminalization laws, saying they could make it less likely for
people to seek help for their disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very striking,'' said Helen Fox Fields, associate
director for infectious disease policy for the Association of State
and Territorial Health Officials, whose members are state health
commissioners. ``We've gone from feeling compassion around people
with HIV and AIDS to looking at this in a very punitive way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone who purposely sleeps with a number of partners because
they are angry about being HIV-infected and want to infect others
is a very serious and horrible act,'' Ms. Fields said. ``But you
have any number of circumstances where it could be difficult to
prove that it is intentional. People engage in sexual relations for
any number of reasons, which rarely relate to hurting someone.''
</P>
<P>
   HIV criminalization laws are playing out in different ways
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   In Arkansas, the state Supreme Court recently upheld the
conviction of a 24-year-old man who was sentenced to the maximum of
30 years in prison for knowingly transmitting the virus to a woman
through unprotected sex. The man, Pierre L. Weaver, who had
committed no prior offense, was found guilty after a two-day trial.
</P>

   In Tennessee, an HIV-positive mother was recently jailed and
charged with two counts of criminal exposure of people to HIV after
telling the authorities that she slept with 50 men to get revenge.
The police chief of Lewisburg, Tenn., Michael Hunter, said the 1994
law was initially intended for a different population.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of the law,'' he said ``was to protect law
enforcement officers from persons with HIV spitting on them.''

 NEW YORK: on them.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The shifting attitudes have blindsided many advocates for AIDS
patients. In the early years of the epidemic, most states refrained
from aggressive efforts to track and test HIV-positive people,
agreeing with advocates that it would drive the disease further
underground. Nationally, advocates and officials now generally
agree that early testing and tracking can do a great deal to slow
the epidemic, although how the reporting of HIV cases should be
conducted remains a contentious issue.
</P>
<P>
   Many public health officials favor the use of actual names to
track such cases while most advocates for AIDS patients want to use
coded identification to safeguard privacy. And while many advocates
are not opposed to voluntary programs of partner notification, they
object to mandatory programs such as the one recently passed in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS advocates in New York, who have historically been the most
effective in the nation in shaping confidentiality legislation and
securing funds for treatment, have vigorously opposed laws that
they view as coercive.
</P>
<P>
   But those advocates say the HIV reporting and
partner-notification law passed this summer by a wide margin by the
New York Legislature is more intrusive than they could have
imagined. Under the law, which takes effect on Jan. 1, doctors must
report the names of HIV-positive people to the state. Then, local
health departments will be required to interview all people
reported as testing HIV-positive, ask them to name their sexual
partners and warn those partners that they are at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the new law say the current voluntary system of
partner notification has been ineffective because few notifications
were actually made. In 1993, for example, out of about 10,000 HIV
positive tests in New York City, only 350 partners were contacted,
according to the legislation's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question there has been a lack of responsibility,''
said Nettie Mayersohn, the Democratic assemblywoman from Queens who
sponsored the bill.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS advocates say the law is so broadly worded that it is
unclear how health officials will determine whether an HIV case
merits contact tracing, and how that notification will be done,
particularly in cases of potential domestic violence. The law does
not penalize people who refuse to divulge names.
</P>
<P>
   ``Large parts of it look like someone just Xeroxed 45-year-old
statutes dealing with syphilis and changed syphilis to HIV,'' said
state Assemblyman Richard Gottfried, who heads the Health Committee
and opposed the bill. ``There were people in the advocacy community
who could have contributed a lot to developing sensible
middle-ground legislation but who felt their hands were tied
because of concern about being attacked from their own colleagues.
That also applies in the Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   Many advocates blame the Nushawn Williams case and Assembly
Speaker Sheldon Silver for the new law, accusing the Democratic
lawmaker of caving to political pressures in an election year. The
bill had been kept from a vote for years by the Assembly's
Democratic leadership, but opposition to the measure was dropped in
the final hours of the session.
</P>
<P>
   However, Gottfried, an ally of AIDS advocates, said he did not
believe that the actions of Silver or Williams were the overriding
factors. He said many advocates failed to recognize how deeply the
public feels about infected people who do not disclose their status
to partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what makes the average person incensed is stories
about a spouse or a long-term partner who they are shocked to
learn, after the fact, is infected,'' Gottfried said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Isbell, former associate executive director of the Gay
Men's Health Crisis and a member of the Presidential Advisory
Council on HIV/AIDS, contends that advocates have no one to blame
but themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than recognizing this was a bill that had legs, most
advocates decided the bill was beyond hope and anyone who tried to
address it was evil,'' he said. ``The advocates needed to get in
there and make the bill as good as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mayersohn, the law's sponsor, said many questions about the
new law would be answered when the State Health Department
completes a draft report later this year on how the law will be put
into effect.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mayersohn also sponsored a law that made New York the first
state in the nation last year to require doctors to test newborns
for HIV and to notify the mothers of the results. The rationale
behind both laws is simple, she said. ``We were ignoring basic
prevention strategies and for reasons that made no sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman, who wants federal legislation to protect the partners
of HIV-infected people, said advocates had put aside public health
concerns for too long. He said it was in their interest to come to
the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to embarrass them and have them get caught short
like they did in New York,'' he said. ``This is not a surprise
attack. If they don't participate in the formulation of the
legislation, they will get legislation formulated by others.''

STOCKS TUMBLE ON FEARS OF WORLD FINANCIAL INSTABILITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices tumbled Thursday on intensified fears
about world financial instability, which has so badly infected a
large American investment fund that the Federal Reserve helped
organize a $3.5 billion emergency rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Bank and brokerage shares were pummeled as the Dow Jones
industrial average relinquished about two-thirds of Wednesday's big
advance to close down 152.42 points, or 1.87 percent, at 8001.99.
Stocks also fell 6 percent in Brazil and by lesser amounts in
Europe but advanced in Tokyo following a Japanese holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear the dimensions of these problems remain bigger than
anticipated and will take a longer period to adequately deal
with,'' said Thomas M. Galvin, chief investment officer at
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, referring to Japanese banks and other
sources of persistent concern.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund based in Greenwich,
Conn., is teetering on failure from bad speculative bets that could
have resulted in a cascade of losses if not for the rescue. Galvin
said that ``the magnitude of the numbers shook the confidence of
the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also expressed some second thoughts about Wednesday's
enthusiasm for the possibility that the Federal Reserve will cut
interest rates next week. Some wondered whether it would accomplish
much, while others reinterpreted the comments of Alan Greenspan,
the Fed chairman, that prompted this optimism in light of what he
undoubtedly knew was the dire condition of the hedge fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were reminded in the most eye-opening manner of what
happens in a financial crisis,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief
investment officer of First Albany Corp. ``This is one of the ways
financial crises can get transmitted around the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the fund's problem resulted from a rush by world
investors into the safety of U.S. Treasury securities, which it had
bet would decline, after Russia defaulted on debt.
</P>
<P>
   Even though stocks had slumped in Europe _ 2.36 percent in
Frankfurt, 1.25 percent in Paris and nine-tenths of 1 percent in
London _ shares opened somewhat higher on Wall Street. But they
quickly retreated as the implications of the near-failure of
Long-Term Capital sank in. The Dow average was nearly 220 points
lower before some late-session buying pared the loss and edged it
back above the 8,000 mark.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan, down 5 3/16, to 87|, and American Express, down 4
3/16, to 79\, had the biggest negative effect on the average,
accounting for one-quarter of its decline.
</P>
<P>
   Other decliners included Citicorp, down 6}, to 98}; Merrill
Lynch, down 4|, to 53]; Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, down 5 11/16,
to 51 9/16; Lehman Brothers, down 4 3/16, to 33 11/16; Chase
Manhattan, down 3}, to 46], and Charles Schwab down 3 1/16, to 40
1/16.
</P>
<P>
   BankAmerica dropped 5\, to 60, while Nationsbank, its merger
partner, was down 4], to 54]. Nationsbank stockholders on Thursday
approved the deal, scheduled for completion next Wednesday.
Travelers Group, which is to merge with Citicorp, skidded 3 5/16,
to 39|.
</P>
<P>
   Only five of the 30 Dow stocks ended with gains, all fractional
except for International Paper's, up 1 9/16, to 46~.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indexes fared worse, with the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 down
23.37 points, or 2.19 percent, to 1,042.72, and the Nasdaq down
39.93 points, or 2.27 percent, 1,720.34.
</P>
<P>
   Among high-technology flyers, Yahoo shed 2|, to 115\, and
Amazon.com fell 3, to 102[, following spectacular gains Wednesday
while Microsoft lost 3{, to 110[.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing could keep investors away from Ebay Inc., bidding
shares of the fledgling internet company as high as 54\ from an
initial offering price of 18. The shares finished at 47], with more
than 9 million shares changing hands.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered
advancing ones by 2,042 to 1,093, with 43 making new highs and 127
new lows. Volume was 805.94 million compared with 900.23 million
during Wednesday's rally.

up policies from healthy people proves to be the start of a trend.
Viatical settlements, as the arrangments are known, are slowly

NISSAN TO SELL ITS TOKYO HEADQUARTERS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Nissan Motor Corp., Japan's No. 2 car manufacturer, is
selling its headquarters building in the tony Ginza district here,
making another small step toward paring its mammoth debts.
</P>
<P>
   The company is selling the building and the land under it to
Mori Building Sangyo Co. and Mori Building Development Co., two
privately held real estate companies, for 14.6 billion yen, or
$106.6 million. Nissan will continue to occupy the building, which
is across the street from another building housing a large
showroom, under lease from Mori.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a positive sign that they are willing to try to deal with
their problems,'' said Christopher Redl, an auto analyst at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   But the symbolism of the deal far outweighs its impact on
Nissan's debt burden, which is expected to hit 4.3 trillion yen, or
$31.4 billion, at the end of the fiscal year on March 31.
</P>
<P>
   That amount is 80 percent of the total Japanese military budget,
according to Redl.
</P>
<P>
   The automaker, which posted losses in four of the last five
years, has pledged to reduce the burden by 1 trillion yen over the
next two years, but so far has made barely a dent in its pile of
financial obligations.
</P>
<P>
   It recently sold its stake in an advertising agency, and the
money gained from the sale of its headquarters building will cover
three-tenths of 1 percent of its total debt _ and only half of the
proceeds represent a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan has been negotiating with Daimler-Benz AG over the
possible sale of its stake in Nissan Diesel, an ailing truck
manufacturer, but those talks are moving exceedingly slowly.

PHILIPPINES STRUGGLES WITH LOSS OF AIRLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ What happens when a sprawling island nation suddenly
loses its national airline?
</P>
<P>
   That question reverberated through the Philippines Thursday, on
the morning after Philippine Airlines ceased flying. The airline,
Asia's oldest, shut down at midnight on Wednesday after Philippines
President Joseph Estrada failed in a final effort to resolve a
bitter labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   In the short run, the demise of Philippine Airlines could raise
acute transportation problems for the 76 million people of this
Asian archipelago who relied on the airline to hop from island to
island. The government and several domestic airlines are scrambling
to plug the holes in the air network.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, government officials and airline analysts said
the collapse would be remembered more as a blow to national pride _
and to the prestige of Estrada, for whom the dispute was a major
test of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of image, we're badly affected,'' said Roberto Ram
Antonio, the undersecretary of tourism. ``It's the pride of a
country to have a flag carrier that represents the Philippines in
different markets abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   But Philippine Airlines had become a threadbare symbol. It lost
$338 million over four years and was staggering under $2.1 billion
in debt. After the unions rejected a proposal that would have
allowed the airline to slash costs, its owner, billionaire Lucio
Tan, made good on his threat to close the doors.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio said the government's priority was to reassemble its
domestic route network. Philippine Airlines carried 80 percent of
domestic traffic until it encountered severe financial trouble last
June, when it cut local destinations to 16, from 36. Analysts
warned that the Philippine economy could be crippled if people and
cargo were not able to move smoothly around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a country with 7,000 islands,'' Scott Gibson, head
of research at ABN Amro in Manila, said. ``You need a
well-developed domestic airline.''
</P>
<P>
   The government said two smaller domestic airlines, Cebu Pacific
Air and Air Philippines, would expand service to fill the vacuum.
Thursday, both airlines were arranging to lease planes from
Philippine Airlines, commonly known as PAL.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Antonio said, the airlines had only a fraction of
Philippine Airlines' domestic capacity. But he added, ``I'm very
confident that we will be able to solve this problem by the end of
October.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said an overly rapid expansion could create safety
hazards. Several Air Philippines planes have already been grounded
because of government concerns about maintenance standards. In
February, a Cebu Pacific DC-9 crashed into a mountain, killing all
104 people on board.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also noted that some domestic Philippine Airlines
routes were unprofitable, and only existed because of an agreement
between the airline and the government. If the government wants to
continue serving remote or outlying islands, they said, it may have
to subsidize those routes.
</P>
<P>
   Though the collapse of Philippine Airlines will have less of an
impact on international air travel, its loss will still be felt.
Singapore Airlines has already doubled its economy-class fares
between Singapore and Manila to exploit the exit of its only
competitor on that route. Cathay Pacific Airways, which serves the
heavily traveled Hong Kong-Manila route, said it would not
immediately lift fares.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio said the government was also encouraging foreign
carriers to increase their flights to the Philippines. Japan
Airlines recently agreed to schedule 36 additional flights from
Japanese cities to the resort island of Cebu, between now and
year's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flag carriers are not really needed, provided that the
government is willing to give the routes to foreign carriers,''
said David Sherman, a consultant who heads the transportation
practice at A.T. Kearney Ltd. in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts said no flag carrier was better than a second-rate
one. ``It may have been the first airline in Asia, but it was
carrying a lot of excess baggage,'' Jim Eckes, an aviation
consultant at Indoswiss Ltd. in Hong Kong, said. ``It just has
never been well managed, from the Marcos era on.''
</P>
<P>
   But this is where national pride comes in. Antonio said
Philippine Airlines was a valuable tool in the country's marketing
efforts. At airports from London to Los Angeles, its planes were
large, rolling billboards for the country. Though some detractors
said PAL stood for ``Planes Always Late,'' fans of the airline said
it exuded the warmth and cheer of the Philippines.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Indeed, the airline's staff marked the long-threatened shutdown
on Wednesday in a characteristically emotional fashion. Employees
at Manila's airport hugged and wept, while the pilot of the last
incoming flight, from Tokyo, walked off the plane singing a
variation on the 1970s hit song ``We May Never Love Like This
Again.'' His version: ``We may never fly this plane again.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a miserable end for an airline that started out in 1941
with one plane carrying five passengers on a 125-mile flight from
Manila to the northern city of Baguio.
</P>
<P>
   The allure of owning a flag carrier has fueled rumors that
Philippine Airlines may be sold to another foreign carrier. Estrada
said in a Bloomberg News report Thursday that three airlines had
already expressed interest: Northwest Airlines, Cathay Pacific and
Eva Airways of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not convinced we've seen the end of PAL,'' said Peter
Negline, an airline analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   If no buyers resurrect Philippine Airlines, its creditors could
face a protracted and messy fight to get their money back.
Bankruptcy law in the Philippines is not as developed as that of
other countries, and Philippine Airlines is the biggest corporate
failure in the country since the Asian economic crisis began more
than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The company has suspended payments on its $2.1 billion in debt
for two months. When it resumes payments, analysts said the line of
creditors will include local and foreign banks, plus export-import
banks in the United States and Europe. Because the company's debts
are as large as its assets, analysts said the creditors could wind
up dickering over planes.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the process is that the second-largest local
creditor, Allied Bank, is owned by Tan, who also owns the airline.
One of the richest men in the Philippines, Tan took control of the
carrier in 1994 and has vast interests in tobacco, brewing and real
estate. Nick Cashmore, a banking analyst at ABN Amro in Manila,
estimated the bank's exposure at $76 million.
</P>
<P>
   Two other potential casualties of the collapse are Airbus
Industrie and Boeing Co. Eckes said Philippine Airlines had
recently acquired 16 Airbus planes, with another 12 on order. It
also ordered several 747s from Boeing. The airline may return many
of these planes as part of the liquidation process.
</P>
<P>
   For Estrada, the closing of Philippine Airlines is a bitter
denouement to what had become a passionate campaign. During the
negotiations, the government offered the airline a bridge loan of
$34 million for two months until new investors could be found.
Estrada met with both sides until Wednesday evening but failed to
break the deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have done all that I can as president because I know it will
affect our country, not just the jobs of the labor union, but the
jobs and businesses connected with Philippine Airlines,'' he said
afterward.

DEBATE RAGES ON SCOPE OF IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the House all but certain to launch a full
impeachment inquiry of President Clinton, a rash of new disputes
erupted Thursday over the scope of the investigation, including
whether to summon Monica S. Lewinsky and the independent counsel,
Kenneth W. Starr, to testify on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Additional skirmishes broke out as the House Judiciary Committee
scheduled a vote on the impeachment inquiry for Oct. 5 or Oct. 6.
The full House is expected to approve the investigation by Oct. 9,
but set no deadline for ending the probe.
</P>
<P>
   As a bipartisan resolution of Clinton's sex scandal remained
elusive amid an escalating political free-for-all, lawmakers
wrangled over a series of highly charged issues, including whether
the Judiciary Committee should expand the sex-related probe to
campaign fundraising abuses, and whether Linda R. Tripp's secretly
recorded audiotapes of her conversations with Lewinsky should be
made public next week.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is scheduled to meet Friday to debate releasing
the Tripp tapes and nearly 65,000 pages of additional material
supporting Starr's charges that Clinton may have committed 11
impeachable offenses stemming from his illicit affair with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the meeting, Democratic lawmakers stepped up their
accusations that the Republican majority has shut them out of
preliminary impeachment decisions, even those as mundane as
scheduling matters. And the two sides remained nowhere near
consensus on one of their most crucial duties: defining the basic
question of what constitutes an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clinton joined the fray, abandoning his self-imposed
contrition over the Lewinsky scandal in the wake of polls that
showed no drop in his job approval rating after the broadcast on
Monday of his videotaped grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Asked after a Rose Garden ceremony if he saw any alternative to
impeachment, Clinton admonished Congress to concentrate on ``what's
best for the American people'' rather than the sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right thing for me to do is what I'm doing,'' he said.
``I'm working on leading our country, and I'm working on healing my
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his job record proves ``it is utterly foolish for
people to be diverted or distracted from the urgent challenges
still before us. It tells me the right thing to do is put progress
over partisanship, put people over politics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton issued the broadside as his hope of engineering a quick
alternative to a full impeachment investigation appeared to
dissolve. As lawmakers in both parties acknowledged the virtual
certainty of a formal inquiry, one of Speaker Newt Gingrich's top
lieutenants emerged on the House floor to attack the most prominent
alternative plan: a congressional censure and fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's dispense with the notion that Congress can punish the
president either by a so-called censure or by a fine or by any
other punishment,'' said Representative Tom DeLay, a Texas
Republican who is the House majority whip. ``Such a deal is
unconstitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   If the formal impeachment process begins Oct. 9, according to
Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee, the panel's staff
would investigate Starr's charges against Clinton for several
weeks, while most lawmakers are home campaigning for reelection.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's chairman, Representative Henry J. Hyde of
Illinois, said he hopes to begin hearings after the Nov. 3
elections if the House approves a full inquiry. But no one could
predict when the investigation would end, or even if it would
conclude before the next Congress is seated in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not certain,'' said Representative George W. Gekas, a
Pennsylvania Republican who sits on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for committee Democrats, Representative Barney Frank of
Massachusetts lashed out at Hyde for announcing the schedule
without consulting the Democrats and accused the Republican
majority of dragging out the process as a partisan weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an effort to run out the clock so the election comes
and goes with this totally unresolved, with all the questions
hanging,'' Frank said. ``I think the dilemma my Republican
colleagues face is, they have a significant part of their party
that wants an impeachment and, to their disappointment, the public
does not appear ready to join them.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the potential spectacle of Lewinsky telling her story in
front of the cameras in the Judiciary Committee hearings, Hyde and
several other Republicans on the panel downplayed the prospect,
saying it would be unnecessary because they could rely on Starr's
detailed account of her relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said he has ``no reason to doubt'' Lewinsky's testimony in
Starr's investigation, ``so I'm prepared to take what she said''
without calling her before the committee.
</P>
<P>
   That outraged Democrats, who accused Hyde of professing
bipartisanship while unilaterally deciding issues as pivotal as
which witnesses to call.
</P>
<P>
   ``To suggest that the Judiciary Committee is going to put this
country through a potentially year-long ordeal with hearings, and
then to suggest that main witnesses are not going to be called,
shows either an incredible lack of judgment or a partisan stampede
on the president,'' said Representative Martin T. Meehan, a
Massachusetts Democrat who serves on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde later issued a statement saying he may have been
``misunderstood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly no decisions have been made on who might testify,
should the committee (and the full House) vote to conduct a formal
inquiry,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet committee members continued to tangle over prospective
witnesses, including Starr. ``There is no way we can evaluate this
report without calling Ken Starr before the committee,'' Meehan
said.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Starr would face an extraordinary grilling from
committee Democrats, including some who have denounced his
``four-year, $40 million'' investigation of Clinton as a ``witch
hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans immediately rallied against the proposal. ``I don't
know what purpose would be served by having Mr. Starr there to
testify,'' said Representative Charles T. Canady, a Florida
Republican who is chairman of the Judiciary subcommittee on the
Constitution. ``He's not a material witness in the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank said the Republicans appeared to want to hold a hearing
without witnesses. ``We can't hear from Monica Lewinsky,'' he said.
``We can't hear from Ken Starr. They don't want to hear from
President Clinton. What are we going to do at this hearing. Play
records?''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hyde expressed partial support for Gingrich's
suggestion that the inquiry be expanded to alleged fund-raising
abuses by Clinton's campaign in 1996. Angering Democrats, Hyde said
the Judiciary Committee would leave open the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us are interested in casting a very wide net,'' Hyde
said. But if other evidence of possibly impeachable arises, he
said, ``I would never say we won't hear those things.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Tripp tapes, which are considered favorable to
Clinton because of questions about Tripp's motives and the tapes's
authenticity, Republicans said they are inclined to withhold the
audiotapes and release transcripts, with broad sections blacked out
to protect privacy rights and excise sexually explicit remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who are split over releasing the audiotape,
nonetheless accused GOP members of hypocrisy for favoring
withholding the material after making public Clinton's videotaped
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect that what the Republicans on the committee want to
do is withhold evidence that is exculpatory'' for Clinton, Meehan
said. ``The president has been railroaded enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tripp tapes are expected to generate some of the most heated
debate in today's meeting. Notable among the other items to be
considered for release are transcripts of grand jury testimony by
Tripp, Secret Service officers, a White House butler, Clinton's
secretary, and the president's close friend, Vernon E. Jordan Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The material to be made public is expected to be shipped to the
Government Printing Office this weekend and made available late
next week.

ETHICS INVESTIGATION OF HOLBROOKE IS NEARLY OVER, HIS LAWYER SAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By PHILIP SHENON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The lawyer for Richard Holbrooke, whose
nomination as the American representative at the United Nations has
been sidetracked by a federal ethics investigation, said on
Thursday that the inquiry was nearly over and that investigators
had found nothing that should stop the nomination from proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Richard Beattie, said the Justice Department had
advised him that the investigation focused solely on whether
Holbrooke had benefited from illegal contacts with his former State
Department colleagues after he left in 1996 to become vice chairman
of Credit Suisse First Boston, a New York-based investment banking
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Beattie said a Justice Department official in Washington had
assured him in a telephone call on Thursday that the investigation
of Holbrooke, the veteran diplomat and architect of the 1995 peace
agreement in Bosnia, was expected to end within a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Beattie would not name the Justice Department official with whom
he spoke. A Justice Department spokesman, John Russell, had no
comment on the timetable for the inquiry, nor would he predict its
outcome. President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright have pledged their continuing support for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident that this investigation will end without any
finding of wrongdoing and that Mr. Holbrooke will be nominated and
confirmed in due course to serve this country,'' Beattie said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials say the investigation began
with an anonymous letter last summer to the State Department's
inspector general asserting that Holbrooke may have had a ``quid
pro quo'' with the Credit Suisse while he still worked at the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The detailed contents of the letter were disclosed on Thursday
by the Washington Post, which did not report how it had obtained
the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke's lawyers acknowledged that in March 1995, when
Holbrooke was assistant secretary of state for European and
Canadian affairs, he helped Credit Suisse by contacting the
American ambassador in Hungary to ask the American embassy there to
withdraw its exclusive support for a different investment banking
firm, Solomon Brothers, for a multimillion-dollar consulting
contract with the Hungarian government. The ambassador agreed, and
Credit Suisse went on to win the contract.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, the Ambassador at the time, Donald Blinken,
said that Holbrooke had done nothing wrong in seeking to help
Credit Suisse and another investment banking firm, Goldman Sachs,
which were in competition with Solomon Brothers to advise the
Hungarian government on the privatization of a state phone company.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Holbrooke argued that although Credit Suisse First
Boston is owned by a Swiss banking group, it is largely managed and
staffed by Americans and was entitled to some assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holbrooke was a very hands-on assistant secretary, which was
good, and I think he was acting based on complaints that were made
to his office by C.S. First Boston, which is that they weren't
being treated in an even-handed way,'' Blinken said. ``I came to
see that there was a good case to be made for including them,
considering that they have a lot of American employees and are
obviously an important player in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he understood that Holbrooke's office had been lobbied
intensively by Credit Suisse First Boston for help in obtaining the
Hungarian contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were camping out at the State Department,'' Blinken said,
adding that Holbrooke's later employment by Credit Suisse was
``just one of those strange quirks of fate _ I think it's
coincidence really.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke has declined to be interviewed about the
investigation. But friends and advisers say that when he began
weighing job opportunities on Wall Street toward the end of 1995,
he never considered Credit Suisse as a potential employer.
</P>
<P>
   Beattie said that he had been assured by the Justice Department
on Thursday that it was not pursuing the assertions involving the
Hungarian government contract.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the State Department, Holbrooke was appointed the
special unpaid State Department envoy to the Balkans, a post that
required him to meet repeatedly with foreign leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Beattie said that in the meetings, which are the subject of the
Justice Department inquiry, Holbrooke was always careful to focus
on either his work for the Clinton administration or on his work
for Credit Suisse _ but never the two together. ``He was always
very careful to avoid conflicts of interest,'' the lawyer said.

RIPKEN SAYS DECISION AIDED BY ORIOLES' RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ If his team were still in the hunt for the wild card,
Orioles third baseman Cal Ripken wouldn't have played his trump
card last Sunday in Baltimore by pulling himself out of the lineup
and ending his major league-record streak of consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the Red Sox and Blue Jays, not the Orioles, who were
still in the chase, and that unavoidable scenario, said Ripken, was
very much on his mind last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a contradiction, of sorts, in my voluntarily taking a
day off,'' said Ripken, who played 2,632 straight games, ``but I
think it got to that point that the reponsibility, the burden,
whatever you want to call, it was being firmly put on my shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had gotten to the point to put the focus back on the team
and move on. It was time to change the subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he said, during a pregame press conference in the visitors'
dugout before Thursday night's game at Fenway Park, it would all be
an open book _ if the Orioles' second-half surge hadn't lost steam
a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our season wasn't over, even though we didn't have the best
first half,'' he said. ``We still had an opportunity with the
talent that we had to make a run at the wild-card spot, and I felt
an obligation and a responsibility to continue to fight that
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Ripken said, however, that in the back of his mind, ``if we fell
short of that, then I was prepared to end the streak.'' He first
thought about doing it in Fenway on the last day of the season
because ``it would stand out to everyone that if I was really
selfish about the streak, I could easily have played one more game
and taken it into next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Deep down, Ripken was hoping the four-game series in Boston
would have meaning for his team ``and that issues about the streak
wouldn't have come into play. It didn't work out that way. We
faltered a little bit, Boston continued to play strong, and we
couldn't catch them.''
</P>
<P>
   So last Sunday, instead of waiting one week, Ripken, not manager
Ray Miller, pulled the plug, making Ryan Minor the answer to a
trivia question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was faced with the decision I had made earlier in the season
and I felt that was the time to implement it,'' said Ripken, who
took a .273 batting average with 14 homers and 61 RBIs into
Thursday night's game, in which he batted fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt for (Minor). I tried to assure him it was my decision.
I just told him to play his game and I thought he handled himself
really well.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a moment's hesitation, though, by Minor, just before
game time last Sunday at Camden Yards. ``I think he was still
waiting for my approval,'' said Ripken. ``I just kept telling him,
`Go ahead, take the field.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand that because my teammates didn't know until
the very end (just before game time).''
</P>
<P>
   As for next season?
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, it's uncharted waters for me,'' he said. ``I'm
open and amenable to whatever tha manager suggests. I consider
myself an everyday player with the desire to prove that on a daily
basis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a good second half. I've made some adjustjments in my
swing and I'm feeling good about it.''
</P>
<P>
   And he feels good about the streak, not necessarily in terms of
numbers but in terms of what he brought to the table from May 30,
1982, to Sept. 19, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stands for many, many good things,'' he said. ``It's very
symbolic as to who I am and my approach as a player. It identifies
some of my most positive traits. It meant that my manager and
teammates could count on my being there for them.''

FULL-TIME MOTHERS MEET PART-TIME JOBS  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 27)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Ill.)  (Eds: Please note subslug) 
(af) 
 By JULIA LAWLOR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a typical school day in Mill Valley, Calif., Paula Reynolds
rises at 5:30 a.m., gets her two oldest children out the door by
7:45 and hops into the car to follow her youngest as he navigates
his bike down the hill to school.
</P>
<P>
   Then she commutes to work to San Francisco, 45 minutes away.
Five hectic hours later, she heads back home in time to greet her
children _ Peter, 12; Julia, 9, and Charlie, 6 _ at the door at 3
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``My kids are at an age where they want to be with me more than
anybody else,'' said Ms. Reynolds, 43, the co-owner of a firm that
supplies temporary executives to corporations. So she works a
26-hour week, guaranteeing that she will have some afternoon hours
with her children. ``I'll have plenty of time later to develop my
career,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reynolds has resolved to her satisfaction the great quandary
of the working Mom _ how to balance the demands of her job with the
tugging at her heart. But the conundrum stymies millions of women,
and not a few men, anew each fall as the school year begins.
</P>
<P>
   The job _ and the desire to advance _ beckon. But who will great
young children at the end of the day? Older children might be able
to fend for themselves, but shouldn't somebody be there prodding
them to do their homework or driving them to soccer practice?
</P>
<P>
   For most women, quitting their jobs is not an option; they
simply cannot afford the loss of income. Many of those part-time
positions being advertised in the newspaper _ as bank tellers,
school aides or store clerks _ pay pittances. And despite all the
talk at corporations these days about family-friendly workplaces,
asking the boss for a reduced work schedule often gets a frosty
reception.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reynolds found that out in 1986, when she asked her manager
in the sales division of the AT&AMP;T Corp. if she could cut back on
her hours to spend more time with her infant son. The answer was
no. So she quit and founded her company, M Squared, with another
mother.
</P>
<P>
   But for the vast majority of working women, who don't own
businesses, the task can be much trickier.
</P>
<P>
   More people than ever want to escape the confines of the
traditional workweek. In a survey of 2,877 employees last year by
the Families and Work Institute, based in New York, 63 percent said
they would like to reduce the number of hours they worked, up from
47 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy percent of working parents say they did not have enough
time to spend with their children.
</P>
<P>
   But the study also showed that many workers felt that it would
be difficult to move to shorter hours. Only 38 percent of
full-timers said ``yes'' or ``maybe'' when asked if they could
arrange a part-time schedule, while 58 percent of part-timers gave
those answers when asked if they could switch to full-time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Part-Time work is especially rare among managers. A survey of
2,000 managers and professionals in four companies last year by
Catalyst, a New York firm that consults with businesses on women's
issues, found that just 11 percent of the women and 4 percent of
the men worked part-time, compared with 21 percent and 8 percent,
respectively, for all working women and men.
</P>
<P>
   Although more than 60 percent of large employers offer part-time
work, according to Hewitt Associates, a benefits consulting firm,
there are very few takers among the full-time staff, and for good
reason. Part-time work, of course, generally comes with no health
insurance, paid vacations, sick days or other benefits.
</P>
<P>
   And many managers believe it is difficult to manage a staff that
has varying part-time schedules. ``People don't widely use these
policies because there's a general sense that they don't work,''
said Marcia Brumit Kropf, a vice president at Catalyst.
</P>
<P>
   Many corporate cultures continue to put more value on ``face
time,'' or the number of hours a worker stays in the office, than
on the work product. And workers who switch to part-time schedules
risk being viewed as less committed to their work.
</P>
<P>
   There are also days when part-timers feel inadequate both at
work and home and wonder if all the juggling is worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, I feel like I have the best of all worlds;
sometimes I feel like I'm not doing anything well,'' Ms. Reynolds
said. Her dual responsibilities have so crowded her life that her
colleagues once bought her a ``Where's Waldo?'' book for Christmas,
pasted a little picture of Ms. Reynolds over Waldo's face, and
retitled it ``Where's Paula?''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Lindmeier, 42, a lab technician who has held a series of
temporary jobs for nine years through Manpower, the temporary help
company, thinks she would have been promoted to a management
position by now had she stayed with one employer.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Lindmeier, of Wadsworth, Ill., has always wanted to work
a 7 a.m.-to-3:30 p.m. shift and have summers off with her children,
now 15 and 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in a small town on a lake where we'd spend all
summer hanging out,'' she said. ``I wanted my kids to have summers
off like I did, and not to be in day care 12 months a year.''
</P>
<P>
   True, she sometimes feels a pang of jealousy about her husband's
paycheck, which equaled hers when the couple was childless but is
now four times hers. Still, she cannot imagine giving up summers of
swimming and bike-riding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten so darned used to this,'' she said, ``I don't
think I'll ever go back to full-time.''

MEXICO JAILS 2 DRUG AGENTS, AND U.S. OFFICIALS SEE GRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By SAM DILLON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIJUANA, Mexico _ In a new case raising friction between
American and Mexican law enforcement officials, two Mexican drug
enforcement agents are in jail here on kidnapping charges that
appear to have been trumped up by corrupt police officers working
with traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   The two Mexican agents, part of an elite anti-drug unit that
works closely with U.S. officials, were preparing to buy a ton of
marijuana from Tijuana traffickers as part of a buy-and-bust
operation when they were arrested by Baja California state
policemen who were summoned by one of the traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   The traffickers, a father and son, have made protection payments
to the state police who came to their rescue, according to sworn
testimony and Mexican and American government documents in court
files here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing smells,'' said an American official familiar
with the case. Several U.S. officials portrayed the arrest as the
latest example of how pervasive corruption frustrates attempts to
work with Mexican law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. officials are particularly perplexed because several
Mexican Federal Police took part alongside the state police in
arresting men who are, technically, their own colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Herran Salvatti, who heads Mexico's Federal
anti-narcotics agency, said in an interview in Mexico City on
Thursday that he believed corrupt Baja state police were seeking
vengeance against the two federal agents because, since their
15-member intelligence unit arrived in Tijuana in early September,
it has already made several large drug seizures.
</P>
<P>
   Baja state police, who have visited the two agents in jail, have
asked them to name their undercover colleagues and commanders and
to divulge the address of their undercover offices, Herran said.
The state police have also threatened to kill the federal agents,
he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The commander of the Baja California state police, Alvaro
Castilla Gracia, insisted that the agents must stand trial,
although he acknowledged in an interview that circumstances
surrounding their arrest were more consistent with an undercover
drug operation than a kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Since the agents' arrest on Sept. 11, he said, other kidnapping
complaints have been filed against them. The two incidents for
which the state authorities provided dates occurred before the
federal agents say they arrived in Tijuana, however.
</P>
<P>
   The two agents, Eligio Garcia Reyes, 29, and Nicolas Carrillo
Jimenez, 24, were recruited about a year ago into Mexico's elite
anti-narcotics force, the Special Prosecutorial Agency for Drug
Crimes, known by its Spanish acronym FEADS, as part of an effort to
rejuvenate Mexico's discredited drug enforcement agencies with
honest young agents.
</P>
<P>
   After passing lie detector tests and other examinations of their
integrity, they were trained in investigative and intelligence
procedures by Drug Enforcement Administration officers at an
American training center in Leesburg, Va., Garcia and American
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Mexico, the two were first assigned to the state of
Guadalajara, where they took part in investigations that led to the
successful prosecution of Mexico's foremost methamphetamine ring,
an American official said.
</P>
<P>
   This month they were transferred to Tijuana to work in a drug
intelligence unit that cooperates closely with American officials,
Garcia said. Several undercover informants with whom the two agents
had worked in Guadalajara, including Jose Luis Rodriguez Gonzalez,
also traveled to Tijuana to continue their undercover operations
there, Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez Gonzalez has testified in the court proceedings that
once he arrived in Tijuana he met Victor Manuel Monge Gonzalez, 50,
and his son, Julio Monge Ochoa, 21, in a bar. They offered to sell
Rodriguez a ton of marijuana, Rodriguez has testified.
</P>
<P>
   In several face-to-face negotiations, the traffickers assured
Rodriguez that their drug organization was protected by corrupt
Baja California state police officers, according to Rodriguez's
court testimony. One one occasion Monge boasted that in exchange
for a load of marijuana, he had given a house to one of the
officers, Luis Humberto Gamez Lazcano, according to the testimony.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 11 Rodriguez called Agent Garcia and said he was about
to meet with Julio Monge at Tijuana's Terranova Hotel to test a
sample of the ton of marijuana. Garcia told the informant he would
meet him, informed his commanding officer, and with his fellow
agent, Carrillo, traveled to the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately after arriving at the hotel, the two federal
agents, three informants the agents said were working with them on
the sting operation, and three bystanders were seized by state,
federal and Tijuana municipal police, and taken to jail on
kidnapping charges, according to police reports. Garcia and
Rodriguez said they were beaten by the state police. The three
bystanders were later released.
</P>
<P>
   The police seized six pounds of marijuana from the room in which
Rodriguez was arrested, and in which Monge later testified he was
being held in a kidnapping. When the police found Monge he was not
bound in any way, was wearing his watch and several items of gold
jewelry, and hotel records show he had made several phone calls
from the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Baja California authorities trumpeted the arrest in several
front-page newspaper stories in Tijuana as a spectacular rescue of
a kidnapping victim.
</P>
<P>
   The two agents, in the meantime, appear to have received little
attention from their superior officers within the vast bureaucracy
headed by Mexico's federal attorney general, although their
commander did hire a lawyer for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't tell how much our chiefs are trying to help us,
because we haven't seen the support,'' Garcia Reyes said in a
telephone interview from prison.

<P>
   According to American law enforcement documents, the Monges were
convicted on drug charges in 1995 and deported to Mexico after
crossing into the United States in cars loaded with marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   But the Baja state judge who is trying the kidnapping case said
the drug arrest records of the supposed kidnapping victims had
little bearing on the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not here to rule on the conduct of the kidnapping
victims, only the conduct of the accused kidnappers,'' the judge,
Blanca Estela Avalos Favela, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The agents' arrest comes days after United States-Mexican
relations over narcotics matters were strained by two other reports
of top-level corruption in Mexican law enforcement units.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't intervene _ its not our deal,'' said an American
official speaking on the condition of anonymity. ``But what kind of
message does this send to these guys? The first little thing they
do, they're in jail.'' &QL;

BABA LEWIS   WAS A   BATTLER TO THE END 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ She couldn't decide whether her most famous partner was
Charlie Chaplin or Errol Flynn. But Baba Lewis would tell envious
friends that both those movie gods were ``gentlemen and sportsmen
on the tennis court when we played mixed doubles. Except Chaplin's
shorts kept falling down, and he went right on playing until he
noticed and pulled them up again and apologized.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, as the Little Tramp, he had those baggy trousers
that didn't fit, and his tennis shorts were the same. It was pretty
funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Those were the days after World War II when Hollywood was crazy
about the game, and the stars invited leading players to tennis
parties at their private courts. Mercedes Johnson Madden ``Baba''
Lewis of Newtonville, who died Wednesday, was a prized partner.
There will be a graveside funeral service at Newton Cemetery at 11
a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   As the last Bostonian to rank in the US Top 10 (No. 10 in 1951,
No. 8 in 1952-53), Lewis was a diminutive but dynamic, nimble
competitor, extremely quick and a strong volleyer although but 5
feet 2 inches. With piercing eyes and dark hair cut short, she
seemed all business, yet could laugh heartily at herself and
wisecrack while at play.
</P>
<P>
   Baba Lewis was 78 when her heart gave out, but it carried her
extraordinarily well over a long, rewarding stretch in both tennis
and squash. She was No. 1 in New England four times over 14 years
(1951-53-63-64) while hitting balls over nets, and No. 3 nationally
(1968-60-61) banging them against walls, winning the US Senior
squash titles of 1965-68-69-70.
</P>
<P>
   Installed in the New England Tennis Hall of Fame in 1992, she
``had so many sectional and national titles and rankings, from a
little girl onward, that you'd run out of breath reciting them.''
So says a friend, US Tennis Association-New England historian Nancy
Norton. ``But what many of us remember was her generosity and
kindness in helping and encouraging younger players.
</P>
<P>
   ``She grumbled after beating me once that I wasn't enough
competition. But I said if she didn't have people like me to beat
in the first and second rounds, there'd be no tournaments, and she
had to smile.''
</P>
<P>
   During a brief marriage to another ranking tennis player, Morey
Lewis, she and he pulled a rare double, both winning the Canadian
singles of 1946. But Baba was more a loner, happiest tending her
rose garden when she could no longer play.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was ill a long time at the end,'' says her sister-in-law,
Halima (Mrs. Ted) Madden, ``in intensive care once for 30 days. Her
doctor said it was unbelievable the way she fought and stayed
alive, but I told him that's what champions do _ fight.''

PRESENTING NEWS IN TIMES OF SCANDAL BECOMES A DELICATE BALANCING
ACT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Ill., Mass., Md., N.J., Texas)  (See also: CLINTON-POLL, CLINTON-CONGRESS, CLINTON-REPUBS-MONEY,

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been an unequal contest. Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico
versus the possibility of impeachment proceedings. International
economic breakdowns versus an unprecedented video of President
Clinton defending himself during questioning about intimate sex
acts with Monica Lewinsky. Sometimes it has seemed that the only
newsmakers able to hold their own against the onrushing steamroller
of the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal have been two baseball players,
Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   What news coverage gets short shrift when a scandal like the
present one takes grip of the news columns and airwaves? None, some
newspaper editors and network news executives say. Lots, say
others, citing the pre-election coverage of the primaries held
around the country on Sept. 15, the instability in Russia, the
economic troubles of Japan and Brazil, and the issue of
international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``News coverage has been distorted to the most incredible degree
I have seen in my lifetime,'' said Charles Peters, editor of The
Washington Monthly, a political journal based in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews over the last two days, editors and news directors
have defended their judgment calls, but most acknowledge that they
have been concerned about the sacrifices made to accommodate the
heavy coverage that they believe is justified because the events
could lead to impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about changing presidents,'' said Al Ortiz, the
executive producer of CBS' ``Evening News with Dan Rather.'' ``It's
hard to imagine anything more important as that. My intention has
been to devote as much time to this story as possible, to explain
what's going on behind the scenes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz added, ``Several important foreign stories _ Kosovo and
Russia _ have had to take a little bit of a back seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Bradlee Jr., a deputy managing editor of The Boston Globe,
said: ``The possibility of impeachment comes along once a
generation. But you still have to be concerned about getting a good
mix in the paper.''
</P>
<P>
   The release of the Clinton videotape demanded so much space that
The Boston Globe delayed the third part of an in-depth series on
food safety for a day. At The Chicago Tribune and The Baltimore
Sun, investigative projects ready for publication were also
temporarily shelved last weekend. ``What gets delayed might be a
series on race or an investigative project in the works that's
timely and topical but not urgent,'' said William Marimow, The
Sun's managing editor.
</P>
<P>
   The issue goes beyond where articles are placed. Diversion of
resources comes at a price. One test of how excessive coverage is,
said James Willse, the editor of The Newark Star-Ledger. is ``what
do the papers look like three and four and five days away.
</P>
<P>
   ``If in covering the story you've exhausted yourself, and five
days out there is nothing in the paper, that's a subtler statement
of the kind of price you've paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Reader complaints about excessive coverage of the Washington
crisis have been heard, some editors say. But readers also bought
the newspapers containing text from the Starr report in unusually
high numbers. At The Tribune, the edition with the Starr report
sold 75,000 more copies than usual; at The St. Petersburg Times,
excess demand for that edition reached 5,500 or more copies.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Oppel, the editor of The Austin American-Statesman, said
that the paper containing text of the Starr report sold 9,300 extra
copies. Nonetheless, he is troubled by the sacrifices in coverage.
``We delayed some Texas state election roundups,'' he said, adding,
``What got crowded off our page one has been the German election,
the shaky economy, the Russian ruble, and reports of erratic
economic developments in Tokyo and Hong Kong.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At The Baltimore Sun, Marimow said, state political and
government reporters were not called in to do the crisis coverage.
Instead ``we took people we consider really talented working on
ongoing projects that didn't have the same degree of urgency.'' For
instance, he said, a reporter working on a financial investigation,
who has special legal expertise, was pulled off the day the Clinton
videotape appeared to assess the president's effectiveness as a
witness.
</P>
<P>
   At The Washington Post, the managing editor, Steve Coll, said
the volume of pre-primary coverage was not cut back this year. ``We
certainly haven't produced any less journalism about the election
this season than we would have otherwise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even on days of peak coverage, the scandal has not shut all
other news off front pages. The Dallas Morning News devoted three
of seven front-page articles to the Washington crisis Tuesday, the
day after the Clinton videotape aired. The newspaper also put an

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The $3.5 billion rescue of a large investment fund
verging on collapse unnerved markets around the world Thursday,
raised a clamor for a government investigation and fanned fear that
other enormous hidden losses would surface in the weeks and months
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than contain the problem and bring stability to Wall
Street, the cash infusion late Wednesday by a consortium of banks
and brokerage firms to salvage Long-Term Capital Management LP only
seemed to rattle investors. Banks began to tighten their lending
requirements, raising fears of a credit shortage that could result
in a recession.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. stocks fell broadly and the Dow Jones industrial average
lost more than half its 257.21-point gain Wednesday. Shares of
financial stocks were particularly hard-hit.
</P>
<P>
   Investors tried to absorb not only what had happened to
Long-Term and its founder, Wall Street bond trader John Meriwether,
but what the deal to salvage the fund meant for wobbly world
markets. As details of Long-Term's fall to earth began to trickle
out and the shock among traders, brokers and bankers began to fade,
fear set in. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill called for an inquiry into
what went wrong and resentment grew that an elite firm, populated
by industry stars and two Nobel Laureates, was saved from a
disaster of its own making.
</P>
<P>
   By midday, it was clear that Long-Term Capital's problems were
not going to be confined to the firm and a few high-roller
investors.
</P>
<P>
   The ripple effect started with UBS, the world's second-largest
bank, which said its risky investments with Long-Term and ownership
stake in the fund would result in an accounting charge of $720
million against the Swiss bank's own earnings. Its stock fell 10.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Of deep concern to the financial community is exactly what
impact the debacle will have on worldwide bond markets, already
badly shaken by events in emerging markets during the past two
months.
</P>
<P>
   Fears of a pullback in lending among major financial
institutions also grew Thursday as banks were awakened to the risks
in their previously easy-money attitudes toward borrowers. If
difficulty in borrowing money lasted more than a few weeks, it
could cause a significant slowdown in the economy, maybe even a
recession if it lasted long enough.
</P>
<P>
   The implications of Meriwether's troubles are great for hedge
funds, the oddly named investment funds that cater largely to
wealthy individuals and large institutional investors, often making
enormous bets on risky securities with little oversight from
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Many in this world believe that Long-Term Capital's
near-collapse and its takeover by big banks and brokers will
translate to increased client nervousness and rising redemptions
among other firms. For funds operating in the already beleaguered
bond market, redemptions would cause a continued downward spiral in
these portfolios. If some of these areas take even further hits,
junk bonds for example, heavy redemptions could hit plain-vanilla
mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is the worry that the disaster will bring
increased scrutiny by regulators to hedge funds. Rep. John LaFalce,
D-N.Y., the ranking minority member of the House Banking Committee,
said in a statement Thursday that ``The virtual collapse and
bailout of Long Term Capital Management makes clear that the
Banking Committee must continue its inquiry into potential risks
posed by any gaps in the regulation of hedge funds, and I'll be
calling on chairman Leach to do precisely that.'' Rep. Jim Leach,
R-Iowa, is the chairman of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   The specter of Long-Term Capital's near failure is not going
away anytime soon. Indeed it will dog the financial industry
through at least the end of the year. Traders say the overhang of
its $90 billion portfolio will keep much of the fixed-income
markets frozen. If the Federal Reserve Board's policy-making
committee reduces interest rates next Tuesday, as is widely
expected, that would hurt many of the trades Long-Term has on its
books.
</P>
<P>
   An immediate reaction to Long-Term's woes was that major banks
and brokerage firms began demanding increased margins, or partial
payments from their hedge fund customers on new trades.
</P>
<P>
   One hedge fund manager who invests in bonds said that the firms
he deals with were asking for 2 percent margin, significantly more
than the typical requirements of one-quarter of 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the details of the bailout were still being
finalized. Late in the day, investors in the fund were still
waiting to hear where they stood. It is expected that existing
investors will end up with 10 percent of their original stake in
the firm and that the consortium of banks and brokers will wind up
with 90 percent. An oversight committee with representatives from
the banks will direct overall strategy at Long-Term. In one of the
many small ironies attending this crisis, Meriwether will be
reporting to people who were, in some cases, very junior traders on
his desk at Salomon Brothers in the 1980s.

HOW THE POLL WAS CONDUCTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CLINTON-POLL.) 
(th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone
interviews conducted Tuesday and Wednesday with 960 adults
throughout the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected
by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active
residential exchanges across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a
complete telephone number to permit access both to listed and
unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated
by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been weighted to take account of household size
and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for
variations in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race,
age, and education.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such
samples will differ by no more than 3 percentage points in either
direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all
American adults. For smaller subgroups the potential sampling error
is larger.
</P>
<P>
   For example, for Southerners, it is plus or minus 6 percentage
points. For residents of the Northeast, or the Midwest or the West,
it is 7 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of
conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources
of error into the poll. Variations in question wording or the order
of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat different
results. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Salomon Brothers, the swashbuckling Wall Street
firm of the 1980s, was raking in the money _ hundreds of millions,
even billions, of dollars _ investors would grin at one another and
say, ``J.M.'s done it again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``J.M.'' is John W. Meriwether, who, with a small and intensely
loyal band of colleagues, turned vast profits by using complex
trading strategies and huge amounts of capital to exploit price
discrepancies in the world's bond markets.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in perhaps the clearest sign to date of the current fragile
state of global financial markets, Meriwether's latest bubble has
burst. No longer at Salomon, he _ still pursuing his secretive
strategies _ is at the center of a $90 billion storm, a storm that
led to this week's $3.7 billion bailout of his hedge fund
orchestrated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Those who put up the cash for this bailout _ a roll-call of
illustrious Wall Street names like Merrill Lynch, J.P. Morgan,
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Goldman, Sachs and Chase Manhattan _ in
return got 90 percent of Meriwether's company, Long-Term Capital
Management of Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Hardest hit are those in the middle of the storm: Meriwether,
51, and his colleagues. At the end of last year, the nearly 200
employees of Long-Term Capital held some 30 percent _ or $690
million _ of the hedge fund's $2.3 billion in capital, said Peter
Rosenthal, a spokesman for the firm. And the bulk of that was held
by Meriwether and his dozen or so partners.
</P>
<P>
   With their stake slashed to about 3 percent of the newly
capitalized company, the employees have seen their holdings shrivel
to, at best, a little more than $100 million _ but even that could
dwindle quickly unless the markets turn in their favor. According
to some people familiar with the company, several junior employees
had borrowed to finance their holdings.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long ago that Meriwether and his colleagues were among
the most fabled managers of hedge funds, those unregulated pools of
capital that seek to offer rich investors rates of return undreamed
of by small investors. The elite partners of Long-Term Capital
include Myron S. Scholes, 57, and Robert C. Merton, 54, both Nobel
laureates in economics, David W. Mullins Jr., 52, a former vice
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Eric R. Rosenfeld and
Lawrence E. Hilibrand, former Salomon bond experts. Mullins, when
he was a Harvard professor, even served on the panel that
investigated the October 1987 stock market collapse with an eye to
preventing such events in the future. Now regulators will spend the
coming months debating how to protect the markets from hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1994, Meriwether _ who had left Salomon after one of
his traders submitted false bids at Treasury auctions _ turned to
raising capital for his new venture. Many of the world's richest
and supposedly smartest investors flocked to his doors, giving him
$1.25 billion, then a record sum for a new hedge fund. The list of
investors _ minimum stake: $10 million _ included such well-known
investors as Banque Julius Baer, the private Swiss bank, a Paine
Webber management compensation plan and the Bank of China, China's
central bank.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Meriwether's investors complained vociferously when,
at the end of 1997, he and his partners insisted on paying back
about $2.7 billion of their capital, saying the markets had gotten
trickier. They returned all the money that had been invested after
Dec. 31, 1994, and all investment profits made before that date.
</P>
<P>
   Those investors, of course, ``are feeling extraordinarily lucky
and happy'' now, said Antoine Bernheim, president of Dome Capital
Management, a New York company that compiles data on hedge funds.
``Those who received preferential treatment by getting less of
their investment returned last year must be feeling very unhappy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So how did this meltdown happen? How could some of the world's
best-known bond investors, and some of its most famous economists
and mathematicians, get crushed, and so quickly? The partners
themselves are not talking publicly, but sifting through the
wreckage, a familiar theme emerges. It is a story as old as the
history of financial debacles: a gradual loss of confidence,
eventually cascading into a full-scale rout.
</P>
<P>
   As the summer wore on, the financial markets became increasingly
concerned about risk, particularly in mid-August, after Russia
defaulted on billions of dollars of its obligations. The financial
institutions involved with Long-Term Capital _ whether lending it
money, investing in it, or clearing its trades _ started getting
nervous. They gradually came to believe that the ambitious
financiers at Long-Term Capital might not have enough money to
support their complex network of obligations in the world's
markets, mainly in three areas: mortgage bonds, European government
bonds and bonds issued by Russia and other developing countries.
The hedge fund also bet that interest rates would rise in the
Treasury market.
</P>
<P>
   Events were playing havoc with Long-Term Capital's strategies,
causing the world's increasingly nervous investors to rush to buy
the highest-quality securities, like Treasury bonds and German
government bonds.
</P>
<P>
   But Long-Term Capital, according to Wall Streeters familiar with
aspects of its business, had made heavy bets that interest rates
throughout Europe would move closer together as many of its nations
moved toward monetary union. And now, with investors suddenly more
eager to buy Deutsche mark bonds, the ``spread'' between German
and, say, Italian government bonds widened rapidly _ precisely what
the firm had bet against.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a perception that there was not enough of an equity
cushion underneath the positions,'' said a person familiar with the
fund's business, who declined to be identified. ``Very often in
these markets perception becomes reality.''
</P>
<P>
   And the perception has gotten worse. Thursday, one of
Meriwether's oldest colleagues even asked whether the stories of
personal bankruptcies at Long-Term Capital were true. Rosenthal,
the spokesman, dismissed such questions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Meriwether and his colleagues have seen most of their
wealth evaporate in a few frantic weeks, and this week they were
forced to accept the terms imposed on them by their rescuers. Many
Wall Streeters also predicted that the fiasco at Long-Term Capital
would probably mark the end of Meriwether's financial prominence,
and that of many of his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, of course, Meriwether has made some remarkable
returns for his investors and for himself. In 1995, for example,
the fund returned almost 43 percent after allowing for its 2
percent annual management fee and the fund managers taking 25
percent of all profits under their agreement with investors. It is
not clear how much Meriwether took out in profits over the years
and how much of his wealth he kept in the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Astonishingly, perhaps, some investors in Long-Term Capital may
not have lost money even after this meltdown, Rosenthal, the fund's
spokesman, said. Assuming an investor put in money only at the
fund's birth, in early 1994, and took all the profits paid out
through the end of last year, that investor would still have made a
return of some 17 percent, he said, citing calculations by
executives at the fund's offices.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this record, many doubt whether Meriwether can bounce
back for a second time after such a spectacular fall. In 1991, he
lost his job as vice chairman _ and heir apparent _ at Salomon
Brothers when it became clear that Paul Mozer, one of his
subordinates, had submitted false bids at Treasury bond auctions.
That scandal threatened to end his career, but Meriwether survived
to bring his talent to Long-Term Capital.
</P>
<P>
   The very scale of this latest fiasco is also likely to make it
harder for Meriwether and other hedge fund managers to pursue such
aggressive investment strategies again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Situations like this could have the adverse effect of
regulators beginning to scrutinize hedge funds.'' said Holland
West, a partner at Shearman &AMP; Sterling who specializes in
derivatives and hedge funds. ``Some of the financial institutions
that are involved are going to be doing more and more scrutinizing
and credit analysis.''

DISNEY MISTAKE: CLONING OF MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In case you hadn't noticed, or you just shield
your eyes, ESPN's ``Sunday Night Football'' looks an awful a lot
like ABC's ``Monday Night Football.''
</P>
<P>
   The word awful is used intentionally.
</P>
<P>
   The same Hank Williams Jr. The same graphics. The (almost) same
three-man booth _ a play-by-play man with two first names, next to
the ex-quarterback, talking over the
I'll-try-to-provide-some-levity guy.
</P>
<P>
   It's creepy and it's kooky. Mysterious and spooky. It's all
together Goofy _ the Disney family.
</P>
<P>
   Packaging the two prime-time NFL games _ that is, if your
definition of prime time includes the period between 5 p.m. and
7:30 p.m. when the average vehicle on the 405 reaches a top speed
of 2.3 mph _ really has nothing to do with bringing the viewer's TV
experience to a new level. It's actually subliminal torment, if you
must know the truth.
</P>
<P>
   This profit-enhancing buddy system has everything to do with
selling commercial time to companies that think they're getting a
unique package deal. A buy-Monday-get-Sunday-free sort of thing,
since about 40 million people watch Monday more than Sunday. The
company actually gets two days in a row to ram its commercial
message _ OUR BEER IS BETTER BECAUSE... IT JUST IS _ into the
viewers' gray matter.
</P>
<P>
   If Disney were to make a movie about this arrangement, they
could call it ``The Parent-Company Trap.'' But they wouldn't do
that. It would ruin the surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's blatant joint-bid strategy with the NFL last winter was
to cough up $17.6 billion not just to keep ABC from losing ``MNF''
but secure Sunday nights for ESPN, which swiped the eight-game
package from cable-rival TNT.
</P>
<P>
   What Disney accountants failed to take into account is that by
trying to elevate ESPN's Sunday game, it has lowered the stature of
ABC's Monday game. Even Dierdorf could figure this out. Just thank
the person on the editorial side who wasn't under the profit-margin
trance and had the clear vision to now allow Monday's game to be
called ``ESPN Presents Monday Night Football.'' You don't know how
close it came to being just that.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's game piggy-backed onto Monday night's tradition might
be a ratings bonanza, but it only exposes the inferior product that
can't be disguised with some pretty graphics or a Hank intro.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night football is an important element of the ESPN game
plan. So important, that you saw that classic Philadelphia-Arizona
game instead of experiencing the fans' love of Cal Ripken Jr., as
he ended his consecutive-game streak. This decision came because
Major League Baseball gave ESPN an ultimatum _ the NFL or us _
before taking the games back. Remember that.
</P>
<P>
   Cross-labeling isn't new. Fox does it between the main network
and the cable regionals, which is the same logo it uses on its
movies, too.
</P>
<P>
   !ital!(Writer's note: By the way, Fox says we should start
referring to it as FOX, as in all capital letters, as in ASAP, as
in even though FOX isn't an abbreviation for anything like CBS,
NBC, ABC, WB, UPN, CNN, PBS, HBO, TBS, TNT, NFL, NBA, NHL,
NASCAR.... Hey, pals: You're Fox, just Fox, not FOX.
Fugettabowit.)!off!
</P>
<P>
   The objective here is to ``brand'' the product, again for
advertising strategy. ``Branding'' is a phrase used in TV these
days more than ``quality programming.''
</P>
<P>
   If Al Michaels is told to whet our appetite for the next episode
of ``The Hughleys'' instead of watching what the Dallas Cowboys
might be discussing in the team huddle between plays, that's one of
those same-channel spots we've sadly been conditioned to seeing.
</P>
<P>
   If Michaels reminds us at the end of the game that we can stay
tuned to ABC for late local news or go over to ESPN for the
postgame show with ``live reports and continuing analysis,'' that's
somewhat a relief. L.A. viewers are officially free of any
obligation to stay around for ``Monday Night Live''!
</P>
<P>
   But if Michaels ever shows up on ESPN, even for that ``Monday
Night Countdown'' infomercial, it's just going against the laws of
high-component circuitry.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough that ESPN's Chris Berman hosting a MNF pregame
``blast'' is about as blasty as a shot of seltzer water from a
bottle. The FCC must look into the fact that ABC has blatantly
exceeded the ``One Boomer-per-night'' limit.
</P>
<P>
   So, after three weeks, the ratings bear out that more folks are
watching Sunday night football than ever before. And less are
watching Monday night _ the 13.6 rating average is the lowest it's
ever been.
</P>
<P>
   Congrats. You've managed to make Monday nights not so special
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   But that groan you just heard was Howard Cosell rolling over in
his own private luxury box.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SMOKES: A potential viewer enhancement debuting on the next
ESPN ``Sunday Night Football.'' A graphic called ``1st and Ten''
will show a yellow line that appears to be painted on the field
marking where the offense has to go to get a first down. It'll be
used every down. Think of watching a game on a college field that
has a soccer lines painted over it. Except these lines move. The
gizmo _ created by New York-based company SportTVision Systems _ is
run by a computer that creates the first-down stripe. In each frame
of video, the line maintains its position. The computer analyzes
the line 30 times per second and determines whether the image in
the frame is the field, a player, the ball, an official or
something else, and allows that to be shown on top of the line.
It's one of those things you need to see to determine if it suits
your viewing needs. ``The league knows that new technology, when
used properly, can only enhance the coverage of its sport,'' said
Jed Drake, ESPN's vice president of remote production. And nah,
nah, nah, Fox didn't come up with it first, Drake failed to add. &QL; 
__ With only one NFL game to show Sunday (Oakland-Dallas at 10
a.m.), KCBS Channel 2's ``Sports Central'' has four hours to fill.
Watch for Lisa Guerrero's favorite outtakes from ``Sunset Beach''
to help fill the time. &QL; 
__ Fox Sports Net decided not to run ads for the muscle-building
supplement Androstenedione, which ESPN had been airing Tuesday but
then pulled because of criticism from the NCAA and national high
school federation.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT CHOKES
</P>
<P>
   __ Maybe it has nothing to do with the fact ESPN's ``Sunday
Night Football'' ratings keep increasing. But maybe it's kind of
interesting to know how things work behind the scenes. During the
summer, ESPN's marketing department inundated more than 1,100 cable
systems across the country to help promote the fact that the NFL
would be a full 18-game package this year instead of nine games.
Included in the campaign was a ``customizable press release'' that
cable companies could use to mail out to media outlets. ``The NFL
on ESPN and (System Name)'' is how the release is headlined. It
goes on to tell how ESPN's ``cable-exclusive prime-time NFL games''
will be on ``(System Name's) Channel ---.'' Then there's this
pre-fab quote: `` `We are delighted to provide our customers with
the best NFL programming available,' said (System Name) General
Manager (--------). `ESPN's entire 18-game Sunday Night Football
regular-season package, as well as its expanded studio offerings,
will deliver a one-stop shopping bonanza for NFL fans. Programming
of this caliber makes cable television the best entertainment
bargain around.' '' Kinda creepy, eh? &QL; 
!arrow!!off! ABC's ``Sports Night.'' Is it a drama? Is it a comedy?
After Tuesday's maudlin pilot, we've stopped trying to figure it
out.

 &HT;    Preparing and Praying: Residents wait on Georges
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY WEST, Fla. _ With their homes shuttered and their cupboards
stocked, the Florida Keys settled in to wait for Hurricane Georges
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities issued a 9 p.m. curfew and ordered traffic stopped
below Marathon by 4 p.m., but that didn't stop resilient locals
from gathering at the Green Parrot on Whitehead Street in Key West,
a ring of bicycles circling the outside bar. Several blocks away, a
handful of faithful prayed at St. Mary's By the Sea Catholic church
while others hurried with last minute chores and kept an eye on
growing clouds overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing you can do in times like this is prepare and
come here and pray,'' Maggie Hernandez said after lighting a candle
at St. Bernedette's grotto, a 76-year-old shrine dedicated to
protecting the island from ``the full brunt of a hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   With Hurricane Georges expected to rebuild fast, the nation's
top hurricane forecaster said Thursday he fears ``we'll lose a lot
of folks'' ignoring an evacuation order if storm waters wash over
the flat Florida Keys.
</P>
<P>
   About 770,000 people from Key West nearly to the Tampa Bay area
were advised to flee, but there was no indication how many obeyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This storm looks like it's all set to explosively intensify
once the eye gets over water,'' said Jerry Jarrell, director of the
National Hurricane Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Monroe County officials said they are happy with the
evacuation efforts that began earlier in the week. Officials
estimated that 75 percent of the Keys' residents have left, though
more have stayed behind in Key West.
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, officials urged people to stay put and called all
rescue workers to duty. Deputies, police and medical staff planned
to continue answering calls until winds reach 50 mph. Virtually all
businesses were shut down and boarded up in the Upper Keys by
mid-afternoon Thurday.
</P>
<P>
   If the full force of the storm does cross the Keys, the first
job for emergency officials will be to clear the highway and search
for the injured. Though helicopters will likely be used to bring in
needed supplies, keeping the highway open is considered critical
for getting help to the islands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to take care of people, and the only way to do that
is to keep the road open,'' Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also fear that heavy rains and a surging surf will put
the highway underwater.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe County officials have already asked the state to help
coordinate additional help from other counties after the storm
passes through.
</P>
<P>
   At the Big Coppitt Key volunteer fire station, where a hurricane
flag was hoisted for the first time, firefighters squeezed tankers
sent from Big Pine, Sugarloaf Key and Key West into the station's
bay. About two dozen firefighters and their families will ride out
the storm in the station, said Deputy Chief Scott Young.
</P>
<P>
   The Monroe County Sheriff's south substation on Stock Island
became a shelter to about 190 deputies. The building, constructed
in 1993, can withstand a category 5 storm, said deputy Jerome Fain.
Nearby, another 100 corrections officers shared the 585-bed jail
with about 600 inmates, some transferred from Marathon and
Plantation facilities, and Pooch, Lt. Manuel Cuervo's drug-sniffing
Pit Bulll terrier, Cuervo said. The jail can run on a generator if
power fails and has its own water treatment facility, Cuervo said.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 elderly from the Key West Convalescent Center also
moved into jail dormitories usually occupied by inmates. Another
200 from nursing homes around the Keys were also moved to the jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I elect to stay here?'' Mary Karhan pleaded with center
administrator Don Capoldo, as he hurried to board residents on
school buses for the move. ``I'm sick of moving, for God's sake,
all over a little storm.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Florida Keys Health Center, a volunteer crew of three
doctors and four nurses from the University of Florida Health
Science Center in Jacksonville arrived Wednesday evening to keep
the emergency room open, said Dr. David Seaberg. The team, trained
in emergency medicine and disaster management, decided to come
because so many residents decided to stay, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Seven ambulances will continue to answer emergency calls until
winds reach 45 mph, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, passengers boarded the last commercial flight from
Key West about 10 a.m. Gulfstream flew four last flights, with
about a dozen passengers on each, said spokesman Terry Deischer.
</P>
<P>
   Many fishermen gambled and left their lobster traps out in the
Gulf of Mexico, though many are likely to be lost in the storm.
Most didn't have time to pull them in, or feared they would be just
as damages when stacked up onshore.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Bruland has 2,500 traps _ worth about $18 a piece _
floating in the Gulf. He spent Thursday morning lashing his fishing
boat to seven other fishing boats at the docks of Keys Fisheries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a minimal storm, but we're going to ride it out,''
Bruland said. ``We're committed now.''

 &HT;    Residents are getting out of Georges' way
 &HT;    By Stephanie Desmon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Alicia Medina is afraid, she'll tell
you that right off.
</P>
<P>
   The Kendall woman survived Hurricane Andrew. (Her house didn't.)
So under sunny skies on Thursday, she loaded up her husband, their
three children and the photos and videotapes they've collected
since 1992 and started heading north.
</P>
<P>
   She had no intention of sticking around for Hurricane Georges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're running away,'' she explained as the family stopped for
a bathroom break at the Lake Worth-West Palm Beach service plaza on
Florida's Turnpike. ``We don't know (where we're going). We're just
hearing the news as we go along.''
</P>
<P>
   Northbound traffic on the Turnpike and Interstate 95 was heavier
than usual Thursday as evacuees from Monroe, Miami-Dade and Broward
counties looked for what they considered safe places to ride out
the storm.
</P>
<P>
   Some stopped in Palm Beach County, where many hotels had to say,
``Sorry, we're full.'' Hotels and motels on the Treasure Coast also
were pretty booked.
</P>
<P>
   Occupancy rates weren't available.
</P>
<P>
   Getting out by train became impossible Thursday because Amtrak
stopped running trains south of Orlando. CSX shut its tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Tran officials said the last county buses would run
Thursday night, and a decision would be made today whether rides
will resume Saturday. School buses won't be seen today, either:
Classes have been canceled until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach International Airport continued normal operations
although a few flights were canceled, said spokeswoman Lisa Waters.
Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport closed for arriving
flights Thursday night. Miami International Airport was still open
Thursday night, but some delays were expected.
</P>
<P>
   Northbound boat traffic was heavier than usual early Thursday as
boaters looked for a safe place to tie down. By nightfall, however,
the Intracoastal Waterway was empty, said Officer Joseph Anderson
of the U.S. Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people were wise enough to get off the waters,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart marinas were nearly full Thursday, with many larger boats
from Broward, Miami-Dade and Monroe counties tying up at Martin
County docks.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of increased auto traffic, the Florida Highway
Patrol planned to put four times as many troopers on the interstate
today. Meanwhile, transportation workers were taking down
construction signs and barricades Thursday, meaning drivers should
be careful around unmarked construction sites.
</P>
<P>
   For much of Thursday, things were calmer in Palm Beach County
than expected because no local evacuations were ordered, said Manny
Papandreas, operations manager for Palm Beach County's emergency
operations center.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're probably going right straight on through,'' he said of
the evacuees.
</P>
<P>
   And some people, he hoped, were listening to the advice he has
touted for years: You're probably safer at home. Stay there.
</P>
<P>
   Richard and Lenore Bernard, a retired couple from Kendall, tried
staying home for Andrew. The roof blew off of their house while
they huddled inside.
</P>
<P>
   They were headed to Fort Pierce Thursday and stopped for some
frozen yogurt at the service plaza. Richard likes Fort Pierce
because it's a good spot for a short getaway west or north, should
the storm shift. Lenore isn't sure anywhere is safe from Georges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's everywhere,'' she said. ``There's no getting away from
it.''
</P>
<P>
   For Jacki Garcia of Miami, Palm Beach was far enough. She
planned to get a hotel room on the island with her husband and
Lady, her Yorkshire Terrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more like a vacation,'' she said.

<P>
   The two-way home run race that fans don't want to end, the one
that has catapulted baseball to new heights of interest, enters its
last stage on Friday night. So does the three-way race for the
National League wild-card spot. But both races could be extended
beyond Sunday, the final day of the regular-season schedule,
creating an even more frantic finish to one of the most
scintillating seasons ever.
</P>
<P>
   The unprecedented home run contest between Mark McGwire and
Sammy Sosa has rocketed baseball back into the minds and hearts of
people who had abandoned it after the strike that shattered an
exciting 1994 season.
</P>
<P>
   Results of The New York Times/CBS News poll showed on Thursday
that fans have followed this season with far greater interest than
at any time since the poll was first conducted in 1985.
Furthermore, Major League Baseball will set a total attendance
record with about 70.5 million fans seeing games this season.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the Cardinals' game against the Montreal Expos on
Thursday night, McGwire and Sosa were tied with a record 65 home
runs, four more than any player had ever hit before in a major
league season. McGwire has three games left against the Expos while
Sosa and the Chicago Cubs play three times in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The games in Houston take on additional significance because the
Cubs are scrapping for the NL wild-card spot with the New York Mets
and the San Francisco Giants. The Mets and the Cubs are tied for
the lead, with the Giants a game behind following the completion on
Thursday of their sweep of a four-game series with Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   If the 162-game schedule is not enough to decide that spot in
the playoffs, the teams will play off for it Monday and, in the
event of a three-way tie, Tuesday. The Cubs, at most, would play
one such playoff game, meaning Sosa would have that extra game in
which to add to his home run total.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa and McGwire will not have a playoff if they end the season
tied. They would, in that event, go into the record book, replacing
Roger Maris and his 61, as a tandem. Both players have said they
would welcome such a development.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a unique, really superb year in so many ways,''
Commissioner Bud Selig said on Thursday, ``topped off obviously by
the home run chase, not only the record-breaking part of it, but I
have to give Sosa and McGwire great credit. They not only broke
these records, but they've done it with such grace and dignity.
That, I think, is the thing that has captivated people.''
</P>
<P>
   The interest generated by the home run race was reflected in the
poll conducted Tuesday and Wednesday. Of the 960 adults who
participated, 22 percent said they were very interested in watching
or following Major League Baseball, up from 15 percent a year ago,
and 41 percent were somewhat interested, up from 27 percent.
Conversely, 38 percent said they were not at all interested, down
from 58 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll marked the first time since the question was first
asked in 1985 that the ``interested'' number exceeded 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   News media coverage of McGwire and Sosa has been intense and
widespread. Sosa has helped create that coverage by sticking close
to McGwire, who had been the hitter given the best chance to break
the record, which he did Sept. 8. Sosa has led only once (48-47),
and that briefly during a game between their teams Aug. 19, but
each time McGwire has pulled away, the Dominican hero has caught
up.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the first game between the Cubs and the Astros on Friday
night, Sosa will face Jose Lima, against whom he hit a pair of home
runs on Aug. 23. But the Cubs' pitchers will have to be wary of
Moises Alou and Craig Biggio, each of whom has hit five home runs
against the Cubs this season. The Astros have won five of the eight
games, with Lima winning twice in two starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, who are at home to the Mets for three games this
weekend, have beaten New York six times in nine games, though the
Mets won three of four in the most recent series earlier this
month. Bruce Chen, a rookie, will start against the Mets on Friday
night, but then they will see Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   The game against Maddux will be interesting for more than the
obvious reason. The league's perennial No. 1 pitcher has struggled
recently, winning none of his last five starts (he has lost three,
the Braves all five) and compiling a wildly uncharacteristic 5.45
earned run average in his last six starts, a stretch that includes
one game in which he allowed no runs in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants play their final series in Colorado, where they lost
all three games of a three-game series immediately after the
all-star break. The Giants also lost two of three games the teams
played in San Francisco two weeks ago. The Rockies have won six of
nine games overall.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves and the Astros are in an interesting position. They
would like to sweep their series this weekend to knock the team in
their division out of the wild-card spot. If they succeed, they
would play the wild-card team in the playoffs, presumably giving
them a more advantageous matchup.
</P>
<P>
   The season has managed to sustain a high level of interest in
spite of the absence of legitimate races for the division
championships. The Braves, the Astros, the San Diego Padres, the
Yankees and the Cleveland Indians breezed to their first-place
finishes.
</P>
<P>
   Only the AL West produced a race, and that one emerged more from
the weaknesses of Texas and Anaheim than their strengths. The
Rangers, on the verge of clinching, took command by beating the
Angels five times in five games in an eight-day span.
</P>
<P>
   Other matters are to be decided this weekend. The final games
will determine the pairings and homefield advantages for the
playoffs. Right now only the Yankees are assured of homefield
advantage for the first two series. The Yankees, however, will be
trying to set an American League record for victories, eclipsing
the 111 games the Indians won in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Thursday's schedule, major league attendance for the
season was 68,795,359. The record is the 1993 attendance of
70,256,459. This season's attendance, of course, is aided by the
addition of Arizona and Tampa Bay. The per-game average of 29,287,
up 3.6 percent from last season and 15.9 percent from the
post-strike 1995 season, is the third highest in major league
history. The record, set in 1994, is 31,612.

CLINTON SCANDAL SPURS SHARP INCREASE IN CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: CLINTON-POLL, CLINTON-CONGRESS, CLINTON-PRESS,
CLINTON-ASSESS.) 
(js) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The scandal involving President Clinton and a
former White House intern has spurred a sharp increase in
Republican campaign contributions for the November elections, a
senior party official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Mitchler, finance director of the National Republican
Senate Committee, said about $12 million, or a third of the $35
million the committee has raised for Senate candidates this year,
has come in the last two months, a period that includes Clinton's
televised apology, his taped testimony before the grand jury and
negotiations over impeachment hearings. Usually, Mitchler said,
about $6 million in contributed in a two-month period.
</P>
<P>
   ``People out there now have evidence of what they have believed
all along,'' Mitchler said, offering an explanation for the
increase and, perhaps, why Republican lawmakers prefer dragging out
an impeachment process. ``I just wish I have Bill Clinton in office
a few more months.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Crawford, a spokeswoman for the National Republican
Congressional Committee, which raises money for House races, said
contributions to her committee also began to increase after
Clinton's apology, which he made on Aug. 17, the same day he
testified before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   She said she could not provide specific numbers for how much
money the committee has raised this year, compared, for example,
with 1994. But she said one difference had been among grass-roots
supporters, who are now giving more, and that the committee's
``telephone prospecting'' in the days after the apology generated a
20 percent increase in contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Crawford cautioned that donations to the committee typically
increase after Labor Day. ``But we are doing better over all,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic fund-raising efforts, too, have been helped by the
scandal, according to Democratic party leaders. Melissa Boney
Ratcliff, the party spokeswoman, said a telemarketing campaign that
began two days after Clinton's apology generated a 15 percent
increase in contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take that to mean that Democrats wanted to help the party
and the president as soon as possible,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchler said the recent flurry of check writing for Senate
campaigns was highly unusual for exceeding the traditional monthly
donations of $3 million to $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extraordinary when it gets to $4 million, $4.5 million,
even $6 million, which is what we've been doing in the last two
months,'' he said, adding that about a third of the totals had come
from major donors and the rest from people who contributed as
little as $10.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This year, the committee plans to spread the donations among 34
Senate races, with larger amounts funneled into states where the
campaigns are perceived as close. Both parties generally agree that
they include six races where Democrats have held the seat _
California, Kentucky, Illinois, Nevada, South Carolina and
Wisconsin _ and two where Republicans reign _ New York and North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high for both parties in that Republicans need a
net gain of five seats for a filibuster-proof majority. But an
additional enticement for Republican donors is the possibility,
unlikely as it might be, of reaching 67 seats _ the two-thirds
majority needed for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In California, Republican state party leaders say they have
noticed a swirl of activity in recent months, with a rising number
of contributions and volunteer efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend started in mid-August,'' said Mike Madrid, the
political director for the California Republican Party. ``After the
apology, the floor fell out for this guy. We began getting 250
calls a day, people telling us whatever we do, get rid of him.
We've even gotten checks from Democrats in the Bay Area.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For us,'' Madrid added, ``Bill Clinton has been the motivator
in chief.''
</P>
<P>
   That could be especially beneficial to Matt Fong, the state
treasurer, who is locked in a political brawl with Sen. Barbara
Boxer, a Democrat seeking her second term.
</P>
<P>
   But not everywhere is Clinton the driving motivation for
Republican donations. Brad Goodrich, deputy executive director of
the Illinois Republican Party, said problems surrounding Sen. Carol
Moseley-Braun, stemming from questions about her finances and a
trip to Nigeria in which she seemed to express support for a
dictator, have served as a much stronger magnet for fund-raising
efforts than those engulfing the president.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking a second term, she is facing Peter Fitzgerald, a
Republican state legislator, in a race that is regarded as a
tossup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tag all our stuff to her,'' Goodrich said. ''When we
include her name in mailings and telemarketing, we go off the
charts. We tie her to everything we can; we never even mention
Clinton. We don't have to.''

   NEW YORK _ The financial world has grown too frantic and
fragile.
</P>
<P>
   That, in the end, was the worry that drove Federal Reserve
officials to orchestrate Wednesday night's extraordinary rescue of
Long-Term Capital Management L.P., a group of high-powered
speculators who in any other era would have been allowed to fall
flat on their faces.
</P>
<P>
   That is the worry that's likely to convince the central bank to
reduce interest rates next week at a time when, by many
conventional economic measures, the nation does not need a rate
cut.
</P>
<P>
   And that is the worry that's provoking a crisis of confidence in
the optimistic notions about market economies and the free flow of
capital that have dominated the world since the fall of the Berlin
Wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of money out there moving very fast that could
do a lot of damage,'' said Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs. `That's
why people are starting to talk about the need for tripwires and
safeguards.''
</P>
<P>
   The global financial upheaval ``has people thinking a lot harder
than they have about their previous belief that totally unfettered,
rapid and large capital movements are always beneficial,'' said
former Fed vice chairman Alan Blinder.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, September has offered a remarkable tableaux of
policymakers struggling -- thus far with only minimal success -- to
come to grips with what has gone wrong with global financial
markets. Although Asian economies had already crumbled and Russia
had partially defaulted on billions of dollars of debt by the
beginning of the month, nobody had expected these troubles to jump
continents to Latin America and pose the first real threat to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   In short order, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan announced that US
economy could no longer remain ``an oasis of prosperity'' in a
world of turmoil, and disclosed that the central bank was now as
worried about a turmoil-induced recession as it was about its
traditional concern over inflation. A politically embattled
President Clinton declared that the world faced ``the worst
financial crisis in half a century.'' And bankers and policymakers
began hammering out another in a long line of rescue packages for a
financially troubled country, this time Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the events of this week -- especially the surprising
rescue of Long-Term Capital -- may be the most revealing about the
dimensions of the world's financial problems and the depth of
policymakers' worries.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult for most people to grasp how unusual it is for
the Fed to arrange a takeover such as it did of the Greenwich,
Conn.-based investment group, or even to understand what business
the firm was in.
</P>
<P>
   While the government regularly steps in when banks are in
trouble and depositors' funds are at risk, it usually avoids
bailing out other kinds of businesses even when their demise could
cause disruptions. It did nothing, for example, to stop the 1990
collapse of junk-bond king Michael Milken and his firm, Drexel
Burnham Lambert Group.
</P>
<P>
   Such a hands-off approach is virtually always the rule when the
investors involved are rich, sophisticated and knew what they were
getting into. And at least until recently, there was almost nobody
in the financial world who fit that bill better than the partners
and investors of Long-Term Capital.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's roster includes Harvard Business School economist and
Nobel Prize winner Robert H. Merton, Stanford finance professor and
Nobel Prize winner Myron S. Scholes, former Fed vice chairman David
Mullins and legendary bond trader John W. Meriwether.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and financial market experts said that the New York
Fed threw aside its usual practices and stepped in to help after
concluding that Long-Term Capital had made such huge and dazzlingly
complex investments that no one could be sure what would happen if
the firm collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Fed officials ``had to be asking themselves if this thing falls,
what does it do to people's perception of other institutions?''
said Harvard economist Robert Z. Lawrence. ``If this thing falls,
are people going to panic?''
</P>
<P>
   The danger of panic was heightened beyond anything that a more
conventional financial firm's fall might produce for two reasons:
First, Long-Term Capital borrowed fantastic amounts of money and
put most of it into complex instruments called derivatives that
allow investors to control huge financial positions for relatively
low cost. So the ripple effects of its collapse would have been
outsized.
</P>
<P>
   Second, it made most of its investments in overseas markets that
policymakers now worry are too fragile to survive the giant
outflows that the firm's demise would cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody cared to notice it, but the basic fact is that most of
these markets aren't mature enough to cope with the reprocussions''
from the sort of investment that Long-Term Capital was doing, said
Roger M. Kubarych, a former senior Fed official and now a partner
with Kaufman &AMP; Kubarych in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Policymakers are now scrambling to cope with their belated
discovery of the weakness of many foreign markets. Most
immediately, they are likely to cut interest rates to ensure that
the US continues growing and importing, which helps troubled
overseas economies. But long-term, they are studying proposals that
would have been anethema at the height of the free market years of
the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   `I suspect at the end of the day, they will end up with some
kind of institutional changes that control capital flows in and out
of emerging markets,'' said Blinder, the former Fed offical.
Nothing could have been further from policymakers' minds - or those
of Long-Term Capital partners -- even a few months ago.

U.S. COORDINATING WORLD EFFORTS TO DEFUSE BIN LADEN TERRORIST
NETWORKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JAMES RISEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States is coordinating an effort with
European and African nations to roll up the terrorist networks of
Osama bin Laden, the suspected mastermind of the bombings of two
American Embassies in East Africa, as fears mount that he will
strike again, officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   American intelligence and law-enforcement agencies are working
with their counterparts in countries including Britain and Germany
to help arrange for the arrests of as many suspected operatives of
bin Laden's groups as possible, whether or not they can be directly
linked to the embassy bombings, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Bureau of Investigation is leading the investigation
into the bombings on Aug. 7 in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania. The Central Intelligence Agency, the FBI and other
agencies are giving information and expertise to help other nations
arrest suspected accomplices of bin Laden who can held on other
charges.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA, the FBI and the Justice Department were conducting
detailed investigations of bin Laden and his operatives long before
the embassy bombings. The United States accelerated its efforts
after the bombings and aggressively sought the support of other
nations to break up his network.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said they had assisted in arresting 18 people
in Uganda, 7 people suspected of being connected to bin Laden in
London and at least 1 person in Germany suspected of links to the
embassy bombings.
</P>
<P>
   The security minister of Uganda told reporters Thursday that the
FBI had helped in the arrests of a group there connected to bin
Laden. U.S. officials confirmed that they had helped Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   An antiterrorist raid by British authorities on Wednesday in
London led to the arrests of seven men who were described as having
links to bin Laden's organization, although there were no
indications that they were tied to the African bombings.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, one suspect, Mamdouh Mahmoud Salim, who is though to
have close ties to bin Laden, was arrested near Munich in
connection with the bombings and is awaiting extradition to the
United States. He arrived in Munich from Sudan, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether those arrested in some of the other
countries would also face charged in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden once lived in Sudan, and United States officials say
they think that he still has close ties to the Sudanese government.
</P>
<P>
   Those arrests are in addition to suspects who are held in the
United States or have been charged here in connection with the
bombings. Those in custody in New York include Mohamed Rashed Daoud
al-Owhali and Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, who were flown last month from
Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   Also in custody in New York is Wadih el Hage of Arlington, Texas
el Hage pleaded not guilty Thursday in federal district court in
Manhattan to 11 counts of lying in connection with the bin Laden
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Another suspect being held in New York under a sealed indictment
has not been publicly identified by U.S. authorities. In addition,
a federal warrant has been issued for Haroun Fazil, a suspect in
the bombings who was living in the Comoro Islands and who is at
large.
</P>
<P>
   Before the embassy bombings a federal grand jury in New York had
handed up a sealed criminal indictment that charged bin Laden in
connection with terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration timed its cruise missile strike into
bin Laden's terrorist camp near Khost, Afghanistan, for Aug. 20, a
day when they knew that he had scheduled a conference of his
network's leaders, to debilitate the organization. But, U.S.
officials said, bin Laden left the camp before the attack.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The U.S. campaign against the bin Laden network comes at a time
when United States counter-terrorism experts and other officials
believe bin Laden is planning new terrorist acts against American
interests, possibly in retaliation for the cruise missile strikes
against his camp and against a suspected chemical weapons facility
in the Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden has not made any public pronouncements since the
cruise missile strike, but he is still believed to be in
Afghanistan, and U.S. officials say they believe the question is
not whether bin Laden will strike again, but when.
</P>
<P>
   The ability of U.S. officials to move so quickly to take down
the bin Laden network stems from the fact that the United States
was already in the midst of a long-term investigation of the Saudi
exile and his operations before the bombings, officials said. bin
Laden has been the focus of attention at the CIA's
counter-terrorism center for several years, and he has been
identified by name in a presidential finding authorizing covert
action to combat international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The federal indictment of el Hage states that in 1996, the
United States Attorney in New York and the FBI began a grand jury
investigation into bin Laden and al-Qaeda, his international
organization. By September 1997, it focused more tightly on the
structure and operations of his terrorist network. That long-term
investigation, apparently aided by cooperating witnesses, has
clearly enabled the United States to help other countries identify
and arrest bin Laden associates around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were doing this before, but it received a new emphasis
after the embassy bombings,'' said one U.S. official. ``Now, we've
accelerated our efforts, and gotten more countries involved. We are
rolling up terrorists related to bin Laden, but we are also getting
terrorists who may not be related to him but who get caught up in
the net as well.''

NOT ALL HEDGE FUNDS HAVE SUFFERED 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also: HEDGEFUND-BAILOUT, HEDGEFUND-TEAM, MARKET)  
(lh) 
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Not all hedge funds have suffered the losses of
Long-Term Capital Management, which is accepting a cash infusion of
$3.4 billion just to stay afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Tonga Partners, a six-year-old fund run from San Francisco, said
that it was up about 14 percent so far this year, including a loss
of 2.5 percent this month and a gain of 8.7 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
   A group of hedge funds that bet American stock prices will fall
_ known as ``short funds'' _ are actually raking in the profits.
The Optima Short Fund, for example, rose 21.9 percent for the year
through August.
</P>
<P>
   And George Soros' largest fund, the Quantum Fund, with roughly
$10 billion under management, is up 9.6 percent for the year
through Monday, a Soros Fund Management spokesman said. In
mid-August, the fund was up 19 percent. The Quantum group of funds,
with $20 billion, are all registered outside the country and are
not open to United States investors. The performance of individual
funds ranges from a loss of 22 percent for Quantum's $1.7 billion
Emerging Growth Fund to a 4.5 percent gain for the $1.3 billion
Quasar Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Long-Term Capital's mammoth losses of up to 90 cents on
the dollar have prompted widespread industry concerns about
possible calls for new regulation, investor redemptions, and
tightening credit lines that would make it harder for these funds
to operate.
</P>
<P>
   Managers of hedge funds _ investment vehicles for wealthy
individuals that are now largely unregulated _ fear the entire
industry will be tainted by Long-Term Capital's stunning decline.
Several managers said they had received calls over the last few
days from concerned investors. Some others have taken the unusual
step of sending out notices to reassure investors. Hedge funds
operate under a great deal of secrecy and normally report their
performance no more than quarterly. Blackstone Asset Management,
which oversees $1.5 billion, issued a statement that said its hedge
fund performance was flat to positive for the year through August.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry experts expect withdrawals despite managers'
efforts to calm jittery investors. Lois Peltz, a a managing editor
at Managed Account Report, a hedge fund tracking service, foresees
withdrawals at the end of the third quarter as well at the end of
the year. The panic may come in waves since many hedge funds allow
withdrawals only quarterly or annually. But she sees this as a
temporary setback.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a shake-out, and it will ultimately get rid of a lot of
hedge funds that were not truly hedged funds,'' Ms. Peltz said.
``And there may be a lot of pressure on funds to make their overall
strategy and specific investments clearer.''
</P>
<P>
   A fund manager countered that hedge funds are notoriously
volatile and their returns could recover in the last few months of
the year, making any forecasts about withdrawals tricky.
</P>
<P>
   Credit too may become an increasing problem. Nicola Meaden,
chief executive officer of TASS, a hedge fund tracking service
based in London, said Thursday: ``Hedge funds do business with
their brokers. Over the last four years, brokers have been willing
to lend to hedge funds. Right now liquidity is very tight, so that
makes operating difficult. We don't think it will get better
quickly.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As to regulation, at least four fund managers said privately
Thursday that they believed some regulation was likely if for no
other reason than that regulators tend to respond to highly
publicized problems by instituting tighter controls. Some members
of Congress called for hearings on the matter Thursday, though the
administration played down any concerns about systemic problems
related to hedge funds and their often complex investments.
</P>
<P>
   One reason it is difficult to generalize about hedge funds is
that they have myriad investing styles, some conservative, some
highly speculative.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals generally have to show a significant net worth to
invest in hedge funds and, until recently, hedge funds have been
able to accept no more than 99 limited partners, though those rules
have been relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike mutual funds, hedge funds are not required to report
their holdings or to invest in securities that have a ready market
or to adhere to any particular investing style. And stock mutual
funds generally make a straightforward bet that certain stock
prices will rise. But hedge funds frequently hedge their positions
by betting that the price of a certain security, say a stock, will
go up, while betting that some other security, perhaps another
stock, will fall. The theory behind hedge funds is that a money
manager's performance is heavily tied to the overall performance of
a specific market, but a hedge fund manager could do well even in a
down market.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge funds come in many types, but they can bet on everything
from currencies to stocks to bonds to exotic securities for which
there may not be a ready market. They can also leverage _ or borrow
_ to make far heavier bets than mutual funds can.
</P>
<P>
   A number of hedge fund managers went to lengths Thursday to
point out that Long-Term Capital was not representative of the
industry in strategy or risk level.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital was highly leveraged and was able to borrow
extensively to make bets in part because it was using the money in
the bond market, widely perceived as less risky than, say, the
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are higher in the capital structure,'' said one money
manager who insisted on anonymity, ``and therefore banks will lend
you more money on fixed income.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the current hedge fund woes, the manager said there had
been other spectacular hedge fund losses in the past without
destroying the business. ``People need yield,'' he said, ``and I
think that risk-taking will increase.''

300 MOURN DEATH OF PROTESTER KILLED BY FELLED TREE IN CALIFORNIA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Calif.) 
 
By BILL DAWSON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ More than 300 people came together Thursday in nearby
Pasadena to mourn, remember and praise David N. Chain, who grew up
in East Texas but died last week in the towering redwood forests of
Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   Chain, 24, affiliated with the Earth First! group, was
participating in what fellow activists have said was an
anti-logging action intended to monitor and delay timber harvesting
by Pacific Lumber Co., a subsidiary of Houston-based Maxxam. A
tree, felled by a logger, struck and killed him.
</P>
<P>
   Pasadena is an industrial city of 130,000 about 10 miles
southeast of downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The group that assembled at Grand View Funeral Home preceding
Chain's burial in an adjoining cemetery was too large for the
chapel and spilled out into a lobby. The mourners represented all
phases of Chain's life _ his childhood in Pasadena, his young
adulthood in Austin, Texas, and his environmental activism in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Chain's journey to California earlier this month, which ended
with his death Sept. 17 near the city of Eureka, was his second
experience with environmental activism there.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Martin, who knew Chain since they were
second-graders and lived with him in Austin, told mourners that he
was ``the happiest I've ever seen him last year when he came back
from the woods.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin said he realized then that Chain ``had found something to
strive for, bigger than himself, for the benefit of all.''
</P>
<P>
   Naomi Steinberg, a student rabbi who lives in the forest near
the place where Chain died, said he was trying to protect a forest
around a salmon-spawning stream called Grizzly Creek, which has
been clogged with mud from erosion caused by nearby logging in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This brave young man understood what so many of us have failed
to grasp _ that the delicate balance of nature is more important
than the balance of the corporate balance sheet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Lumber announced there would be no logging operations at
the site where Chain died on the day of his funeral. Since his
death, the company has appealed to Earth First! members to stop
coming onto company land.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy has arisen over the circumstances of Chain's death,
the first in over a decade of environmental protests on Pacific
Lumber property. The company has said the logger who felled the
tree that killed Chain was unaware that activists were in his area,
but activists who accompanied Chain dispute that claim. Law
enforcement authorities have tentatively termed the death an
apparent accident pending further investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of his remarks at the funeral, Martin expressed
confidence that his friend's commitment to his cause would
``continue to influence people's lives.''

NUMBER OF POOR IN BAY STATE RISING: CENSUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ZACHARY R. DOWDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ At a time when Massachusetts unemployment has reached
historic lows and the state's economy is booming, US census figures
released Thursday show an increasing number of people are poor.
</P>
<P>
   According to the figures, the percentage of people living below
the poverty line in Massachusetts was higher last year than in
1996, a change that bucks a decline nationwide in the poverty
figure.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, family income has been stagnant.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``We can say with real confidence that this shows a
surprising trend towards higher poverty even during the growing
economy,'' said James St. George, executive director of the
education fund at the Tax Equity Alliance of Massachusetts, a
liberal advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   St. George and other specialists were at a loss to explain the
poverty increase.
</P>
<P>
   Census projections indicate that last year 12.2 percent of the
state's residents, or 734,000 people, were living below the poverty
line, which for a family of four was defined as earning $16,400 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 the poverty figure was 10.1 percent, while it was 11
percent in 1995 and 9.7 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers come from the Census Bureau's annual Current
Population Survey, a study of 52,000 people conducted in March.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 13.3 percent of all Americans or 35.6 million people
lived in poverty last year, down from 13.7 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The sobering Massachusetts numbers come as the state basks in
healthy economic indicators, including 3 percent unemployment and
substantial growth.
</P>
<P>
   What has remained hidden amid the news of prosperity, however,
is a growing number of families who struggle daily to make ends
meet, St. George and others said. .
</P>
<P>
   St. George said the size of the sampling in the study and the
small increase from year to year prevents statisticians from saying
the rise last year was ``statistically significant.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, the evidence of a general rise in poverty is still
compelling since the percentage of people who are poor in
Massachussetts has increased in two of the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the survey showed, median income of Bay State families
has not caught up to its pre-recession levels. Though it rose from
$40,400 in 1996 to $42,023 last year, it remained nearly $4,700
below the 1989 median income.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the median household income for all Americans rose
1.9 percent to $37,005, a change that was not statistically
different from the peak in 1989 &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The figures jibe with a study released this week by the Women's
Educational and Industrial Union, which found that families
hovering just above the poverty line are in critical need.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes an income much higher than the poverty level to make
ends meet,'' said Laura Russell, director of the Work and Family
Resource Center at the women's union.
</P>
<P>
   According to the study, entitled ``The Self-Sufficiency Standard
for Massachusetts,'' a ``subsistence-wage'' level for a family of
four with two children in the state is $42,564.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the findings, state officials say fewer people are
living on public assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Maio, deputy director of the state Department of
Transitional Assistance said the number of families on state
welfare rolls has been plummeting, from 84,130 families in June
1996 to 63,501 last June.

FRANK HITS CLINTON SUDAN BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Representative Barney Frank, one of President
Clinton's staunchest supporters, broke with the administration
Thursday to criticize last month's bombing of a chemical plant in
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Democrat, who initially supported the bombing
in retaliation for attacks by Islamic extremists on two US
embassies, said new information about the al-Shifa pharmaceutical
factory indicated that it should not have been targeted.
</P>
<P>
   His announcement Thursday follows growing skepticism among US
allies that the plant produced chemical weapons components, as the
Clinton administration has maintained. Foreign officials note that
the plant produced legitimate pharmaceuticals and even had a UN
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Frank, in a letter to Clinton, said that before any US attack,
``there ought to be a degree of certainty or fear of imminent
danger, which in neither case seem to be present regarding Sudan.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank said he still believed the simultaneous bombing of
terrorist training camps in Afghanistan was justified on Aug. 20
because those sites have been tied to outlaw Osama bin Laden,
suspected in the bombings of the US embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Jimmy Carter has demanded an independent
investigation to see whether the factory actually produced
materials for chemical weapons. The Clinton administration has
rejected such an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Frank said he weighed the increasingly
skeptical accounts about activities at the site before changing his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attacking an installation in another country may be justified,
but you've got to be very, very sure about the threats before
launching the attack,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to have self-defense capability, but if you
overuse it, you lose it.''

(th) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Surgeons in France announced Thursday that they had attached the
right hand and forearm of an anonymous donor to the arm of a
48-year-old Australian man whose own hand was amputated after a
logging accident in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs was not the first such transplant attempt; at least one
previous attempt, in Ecuador in 1964, ended in failure after two
weeks when the donor hand was rejected by the body.
</P>
<P>
   Although no such transplant is believed to have ever been
successful, the team in France said advances in drugs and
microsurgery since the attempt in Ecuador gave the procedure a 50
percent chance of turning out well.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors offered few details about their procedure, which was
performed at Edouard Herriot Hospital in Lyons. Officials of the
hospital said they would disclose more information later.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, it will be some time before they can say the
operation is a success. If the grafted hand takes, weeks must pass
before doctors can tell how well it functions, and 12 to 18 months
of physical and other therapy will be required to gain full use of
it, if that is possible.
</P>
<P>
   Failure of nerves to regenerate sufficiently to allow perception
of hot, cold and other sensations, and to control movement, would
leave the grafted hand a useless body part.
</P>
<P>
   And the procedure is not without risk to the recipient, Clint
Hallam, an Australian businessman. He must take anti-rejection
drugs that suppress the immune system, leaving him vulnerable to
infection, disease and perhaps serious reactions to the drugs
themselves, which must be taken indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the optimism voiced in France found support in a
team of experts at the University of Louisville in Kentucky, who
said they were about to embark on similar surgery at Jewish
Hospital in Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Barker, a plastic surgeon in charge of the research for
the Louisville project, said in an interview Thursday that his team
had selected several patients from among 100 applicants to undergo
a hand transplant later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Barker expressed confidence that his team's efforts would
succeed, because advances in transplantation in recent years have
been so dramatic. But he said the rejection of transplanted skin
posed a particular risk to the success of the procedure and had
been the limiting factor in earlier attempts and research.
</P>
<P>
   The surgery in Lyons was performed on Wednesday and lasted more
than 13 hours, said the team of doctors there, headed by Dr.
Jean-Michel Dubernard.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors attached ``all the arteries, veins, nerves, tendons,
muscles and skin after setting the two bones of the forearm,'' the
hospital said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to French television, Dubernard said the procedure
``gives hope to all those who are victims of domestic or work
accidents, antipersonnel mines, or have congenital deformations.''
</P>
<P>
   The surgical team was made up of doctors from France, Australia,
England and Italy. Dubernard led the team with Dr. Earl Owen,
director of the Center for Microsurgery in Sydney, Australia; Dr.
Marco Lanzetta of the University of Milan; Dr. Hari Kapila of
Sydney, and Dr. Nadey Hakim of Saint Mary's Hospital in London.
</P>
<P>
   The donor was a brain-dead patient, hospital officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Barker, of the Louisville team, said he was surprised to learn
about the operation in Lyons. He said his team ``never heard of
this group'' that performed the procedure. The idea of such a
transplant was previously discussed at international scientific
meetings, he said, but he does not recall that members of the
French group participated.
</P>
<P>
   Barker said he was particularly surprised to learn that Hallam
was the patient, because he had also applied to be treated in
Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   In work with rabbits and pigs over the last three years, the
Louisville team has conducted extensive research on new approaches
to anti-rejection therapy. The findings have been presented at
meetings and published in scientific journals.
</P>
<P>
   If hand transplants work, the team hopes ultimately to use the
immunologic techniques to transplant jaws, tongues and other
tissues that cannot be repaired well among patients with cancer and
other diseases, Barker said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William P. Cooney, a hand surgeon at the Mayo Clinic and
president-elect of the American Society for Surgery of the Hand,
said that technical and ethical questions about hand transplants
were debated in May at an international scientific meeting in
Vancouver, British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The Louisville team discussed its ideas there but at the time
had not received permission to do such surgery. Barker said
Thursday, however, that an ethics committee had since given its
approval.
</P>
<P>
   The main ethical objection was that hand transplants pose
substantial risks to the health and even life of a recipient and
that, unlike heart transplants, they are not life-sustaining.
</P>
<P>
   But proponents said a functioning hand could be superior to a
prosthesis.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing from rabbits to pigs in its research, the Louisville
team has developed an anti-rejection regimen based on the drug
FK-506, which is also known by the generic name tacrolimus and by
its trade name, Prograf.
</P>
<P>
   The team has created flaps resembling a hand and composed of all
elements of transplanted tissue, like bone, tendons, nerves,
arteries and veins.
</P>
<P>
   The research has involved using skin creams and pumps so that
large amounts of anti-rejection drugs can be delivered directly to
the anatomic site of the transplant rather than circulating
throughout the body. This reduces chances of damage to other
tissues and organs.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, the Louisville team publicized its intention
to transplant a hand, so as to alert possible recipients and
would-be donors, Barker said.
</P>
<P>
   Psychiatrists and other specialists on the team screen the
applicants, who must be using a prosthetic hand _ a way of making
sure they know the alternative. If a graft is rejected by the body,
the recipient can then use a prosthesis again, much they way a
person who rejects a kidney can resume dialysis.
</P>
<P>
   Applicants are asked to evaluate cosmetic factors that would be
important in the graft they receive, including skin color and
amount of hair. The doctors measure the bone size to avoid
mismatches, and test blood type and other immunologic factors.
</P>
<P>
   Barker said that for ethical reasons, the team would prefer to
do two transplants in a patient who has no use of either hand. For
such a patient, the benefits of success would clearly outweigh the
risks, he said. The risk calculation is less clear in a patient
with only one damaged hand.
</P>
<P>
   Performing the transplant on an elective basis should improve
chances of success, Barker said, because the donor hand would be
removed and grafted quickly, reducing the amount of time the tissue
lacked oxygen. &QL;

 &HT;    Serious series for Mets, Braves
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Bobby Cox usually flips the keys to the ranch to the
Greenville Braves at this time of the year; the clubhouse hearts
game draws more attention than the NL scoreboard; and Atlanta
wonders where to scrounge for playoffs tickets. But not so fast.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves open the season's final weekend against the New York
Mets with the opportunity to influence which opponent they face in
next week's League Division Series, hardly insignificant in this
era of the three-tiered playoffs. With one more victory, the Braves
clinch home-field advantage for the first two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, with the Mets and Chicago tied for the wild-card
slot _ and San Francisco 1 1/2 games behind _ the Braves reduce the
Mets' postseason chances each time they beat them this weekend,
thus improving the odds that Atlanta would face the Cubs instead of
San Diego in the division series.
</P>
<P>
   To suggest the Braves have been anything less than serious about
the standings since clinching the division 11 days ago doesn't
wash. Both Andres Galarraga and Chipper Jones, the club's RBI
leaders, have been in the lineup six times in eight days, and while
Javy Lopez skipped half the games to rest a sore left elbow, Andruw
Jones has sat down only once. Cox, the Braves' manager, doesn't
want to hear this stuff about easing off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never take a deep breath,'' Cox said. ``It doesn't matter
who we play. We play hard every time, too.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one player trying to get that across is rookie call-up
Marty Malloy, who is one hamstring twinge away from making the
postseason roster. With second baseman Keith Lockhart testing his
right hamstring in the field for the first time in two weeks
against the Mets, Malloy is the option if Lockhart goes down.
Lockhart, who will start tonight, has reported improvement in
recent days, but one misstep would give Malloy significant playing
time and a spot on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liken (Malloy) to Mark Lemke,'' Chipper Jones said. ``He's
not going to pop your eyes out with anything he does. But he does
everything (well).''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here three weeks now, and I just treat each day as a
new day and do the best I can,'' said Malloy, who is batting just
.185 but has struck out only twice in 27 at-bats. ``Hopefully,
that'll show that, if it came down to me getting an opportunity,
they'd believe I can get the job done.''

 &HT;    Klesko heeds advice, tries new stance
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- While most of the team went after the postgame spread
the other night in Miami, Ryan Klesko was headed for the batting
cage. The game had not been over for 10 minutes before the Braves
left-fielder was taking batting practice again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a fairly new stance and I'm trying to get as comfortable
as I can,'' he said. ``After the game is when everything is
freshest in your mind. I'd just missed a couple balls and it's been
a while since I hit one good. I've been swinging under the ball.
I've got to get on top of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves could use it. The team has set a franchise home run
record with limited participation from Klesko, who led the team in
home runs in the last two seasons. He enters the Mets series with
18 home runs, the fewest he has hit since 17 his rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   While Klesko does not use his appendectomy as an excuse, his
season has not been the same since June 29th, when he had surgery.
In his first 73 games, Klesko had 13 homers and 47 RBIs while
hitting .281, a remarkable comeback from a 6-for-34 start in April.
In 53 games since the operation, he has hit .257 with five homers
and 22 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   In the postseason, where every shortcoming is magnified, this
will not do. Klesko entered the season having averaged one homer
every 16 at-bats. That rate has slipped to every 23.3 at-bats. Part
of the club's solution was to reduce his swing a few weeks ago,
restore his stance to squared with the plate and let him stride
straight at the pitcher. Leyland's take
</P>
<P>
   Jim Leyland is familiar enough with the Braves bullpen history
to have his own take on Kerry Ligtenberg and what has transpired
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done well under difficult circumstances,'' Leyland said.
``I've been impressed with the way he's handled it. When you're
saving games for the Atlanta Braves, not only do you have the
pressure of saving the game but you have the added pressure of
saving it for a Cy Young winner every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Since blowing back-to-back save opportunities Aug. 28 and 31,
Ligtenberg has strung together eight scoreless appearances with six
strikeouts and three hits allowed in 7 2/3 innings this month.
</P>
<P>
   `Maury' Perez
</P>
<P>
   He left behind the base someone placed in his locker in Miami
but back-up catcher Eddie Perez still is having trouble living down
the first stolen base of his career, achieved against Florida's
Greg Zaun Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, the president of Venezuela called,'' Perez announced.
</P>
<P>
   Really?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, no. It was really my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Millwood is slated to make a relief appearance in Sunday's
game. That will comprise his second appearance out of the bullpen
this season, all the acclimation he will get before full-time
relief duty in the postseason.

 &HT;    On Deck: New York Mets
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: Today 7:40 p.m., Saturday 1:15 p.m. and Sunday 1:10 p.m..
</P>
<P>
   Where: Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   Radio/TV: TBS will televise tonight. WAGA-5 will televise
Saturday, and Fox Sports South will televise Sunday. 750-AM will
broadcast all three games.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: Tonight, RHP Rick Reed (16-10, 3.99
ERA; 2-1, 1.86 lifetime vs. Braves) vs. LHP Bruce Chen (2-0, 3.31;
0-0, 12.00 lifetime vs. Mets). Saturday, LHP Al Leiter (17-5, 2.40;
3-2, 1.86 lifetime vs. Braves) vs. Tom Glavine (20-6, 2.53; 10-5,
3.26 lifetime vs. Mets). Sunday, RHP Armando Reynoso (7-2, 3.24;
0-6, 6.37 lifetime vs. Braves) vs. RHP Greg Maddux (17-9, 2.24;
21-12, 3.47 time vs. Mets).
</P>
<P>
   Series history: Atlanta trails the all-time series 200-204, but
is 20-11 against New York at home since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Past meetings: The Braves are 6-3 vs. the Mets this season, but
lost three of four at Shea Stadium Sept. 4-7, when Rudy Seanez and
John Rocker each blew a save and lost a game on late home runs.
Atlanta won the first five games of the season series, and the
Mets' last visit to Turner Field ended in a near riot on July 5
after Michael Tucker scored in an 11th-inning collision with Mike
Piazza at the plate. Plate umpire Angel Hernandez was chased off
the field by Mets manager Bobby Valentine and losing pitcher John
Franco.
</P>
<P>
   Mets leaders: Avg. _ John Olerud (.351); HR _ Mike Piazza (32);
RBI _ Piazza (110); SB _ Brian McRae (20). W _ Al Leiter (17); ERA
_ Dennis Cook (2.15). Saves _ John Franco (38). Strikeouts _ Leiter
(168).
</P>
<P>
   Quickly: The Mets had no luck against the bottom of the
division, going 2-3 in their final homestand against Florida and
Montreal. If New York fails to reach the playoffs this season, they
can blame the Expos, who beat them eight times in 12 games,
including four of the last five meetings and just shut them out in
their last 17 innings. ... New York has lost two straight but is
12-9 in September. The bullpen has four blown saves this month and,
with the exception of John Olerud, no other Mets player has hit a
home run in the last five games. ... The Braves have held the Mets
to a .230 team average this season. New York has hit .260 against
everyone else. In their nine previous meetings, the Braves have
outscored the Mets, 42-23. New York has hit five homers off Atlanta
pitching this season. Andruw Jones and Andres Galarraga have hit
seven homers against the Mets. ... But the memory of the last
series still lingers, when late homers by Tony Phillips and Edgardo
Alfonzo pulled out two victories. In their first 50 innings against
New York, Braves pitchers did not give up a homer. They have given
up five in the last 33 innings. ... Reed, tonight's starter, has
one victory in his last five starts. He is 0-1 against Atlanta in
two starts this year, losing on Sept. 6 in a 4-0 shutout to John
Smoltz. ... On the DL: RHP Jason Isringhausen (right elbow
surgery), LHP Hector Mercado (left elbow surgery), INF Craig
Paquette (sprained left ankle), C Vance Wilson (broken right
forearm), RHP Brad Clontz (bone spurs, right elbow).
</P>
<P>
   Who's hot: RHP Turk Wendell has appeared in the last nine games
and has given up a run in 13 innings. John Olerud is batting .517
in his last eight games but fell nine points behind Colorado's
Larry Walker after going 0-for-3 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Who's not: CF Brian McRae is batting .152 during the last 10
days. Closer John Franco has given up seven hits and walked six in
his last five innings.

MORGAN STANLEY REPORTS 5 PERCENT DROP IN INCOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By PETER TRUELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. reported a 5 percent
drop in net income for its third fiscal quarter on Thursday, but it
beat analysts' expectations and turned in a stronger performance
than either Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. or Lehman Inc., the two other Wall
Street firms that reported quarterly results this week.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley said it earned $645 million, or $1.05 a share,
for the three months ended Aug. 31., the third quarter of its
fiscal year, and cited losses of more than $200 million in a
developing country fund that it manages. The median forecast of
analysts surveyed by First Call was $1.03 a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over all, the results showed they handled a pretty rough
situation pretty well, particularly compared to the rest of the
firms,'' said Guy Moszkowski, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, a
unit of the Travelers Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley's return on equity also remained a high 19.3
percent, despite the difficulties in the financial markets that
became particularly severe in July and August.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its relatively strong performance, Morgan Stanley shares
fell $5.6875, or 10 percent, to $51.5625, as the banking and
financial services sectors were generally pounded in Thursday's
market slide.
</P>
<P>
   Raphael Soifer, an analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman, said,
``Comparing them with the two other firms which have reported, they
showed less volatility because of the more diversified group of
businesses that they have.''
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, Morgan Stanley's results for the quarter were an
endorsement of its strategy of building a broad investment banking
and financial services franchise, from selling mutual funds and
credit cards to ordinary citizens to issuing stocks and bonds for
big companies and governments. Its merger last year with Dean
Witter Discover &AMP; Co., was intended to create just such a
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Although Morgan Stanley's pin-striped investment bankers would
sometimes grimace at the firm's Main Street businesses at Dean
Witter, and the Discover Card, its rather middle-market credit
card, ``Discover card did exactly what you would have expected in
terms of supporting earnings in otherwise difficult quarter,''
Moszkowski said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the revenge of the nerds,'' laughed Robert Scott, Morgan
Stanley's chief financial officer, as he discussed his firm's
earnings, and the rich profits from credit cards and Main Street
customers.
</P>
<P>
   In common with many other big financial firms, Morgan Stanley
had warned a few weeks ago that its profits for the quarter would
be cut by about $110 million because of losses caused by difficult
conditions in world capital markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a leveraged emerging markets debt fund,'' Scott said on
Thursday. ``The fund got caught in the emerging markets debt
downturn. When that market tanked, because it was a leveraged
fund,'' with heavy borrowings, ``it was unable to meet margin
calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than let the fund fail, Morgan decided to step in and put
up the money to meet the fund's margin calls. And that cost it
``more than a couple of hundred million dollars,'' he said. The
firm decided to do that, he added, even though it was not
technically obligated to do so, because of ``its overall
relationship with the creditors'' of the fund.
</P>
<P>
   But, things may get worse before they get better for Wall Street
firms such as Morgan Stanley. The firm's earnings for the current
quarter, which ends Nov. 30, are also likely to be affected by the
continued instability in world financial markets.

 &HT;    Eating up yardage
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Back in the far left corner of his
cluttered refrigerator, there might be one last nugget of chicken,
Garrison Hearst thinks, but, alas, its unofficial expiration date
passed two weeks ago. All that remains of the plum jelly, made with
love from trees that grow in his mama's back yard in Lincolnton, is
a half-jar of good eating and a lot of great memories.
</P>
<P>
   The cornbread and biscuits and sweet-potato pie his family
brought out the first week of the NFL season? Despite diligent
rationing, gone, gone and long-gone.
</P>
<P>
   These are the glad tidings for the Atlanta Falcons as they will
attempt Sunday to slow down the San Francisco 49ers and their star
running back: The inventory of down-home vittles that Hearst craves
is all but depleted. A stomach filled with chicken, pork chops and
ribs during a hurried trip home for last weekend's bye is empty
again, and Hearst yearns for something deep-fried and smothered in
gravy.
</P>
<P>
   But because older sister Candy's gall bladder is flaring up
again, a visit this weekend by Hearst's mother, Mary, and his
grandmother, Julie Leverett, has been postponed, and the flour and
aprons and cooking oil have been packed away for another time.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst, a former University of Georgia player, is desperate for
the kind of Southern home cooking you can't find anywhere in the
Bay area. (Tourist alert: the S&AMP;B Restaurant in nearby San Jose is
long on promises, but its fried okra comes up short.) ``He's been
calling a lot lately and asking for a box of food _ you know, some
butter rolls and all,'' Mary Hearst said earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Now the bad news for defenders: Hearst is even hungrier to keep
posting the kind of rushing numbers that have elevated him to
lethal-weapon status in the NFL's deepest offensive arsenal. His
dreams of another 1,000-yard season probably will become reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should be a piece of cake, really,'' guard Ray Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   And with his extended family watching on television late Sunday
afternoon when the hometown running back takes on the home team,
Hearst has additional motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Although he tried early in the week to play down the
significance of facing the Falcons, Hearst said by Thursday that
the two matchups with Atlanta are circled on his calendar.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, sure, there's always something a little extra when it's
the Falcons,'' said Hearst, who in two games this season has rushed
for 325 yards on 42 carries and whose 7.7-yard average is the NFL's
best. ``Guys have been talking all week about it being our hardest
game. And they've got the top-rated (defense) against the run, too.
It's going to be tough. But I'll have family and friends watching
and expecting me to light it up. So if we can win and I can put a
little smile on their faces. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Since he signed with San Francisco as an unrestricted free agent
in March 1997, both of those missions have been accomplished. The
49ers are 13-2 in the 15 contests Hearst has started, and the
sixth-year pro has rushed for 1,344 yards and averaged 4.9 yards,
the most productive stretch of his NFL career. His rush to glory
with the Niners was slowed only by a fractured collarbone last
December, and some players cite the late-season injury and Hearst's
resultant rustiness in the playoffs for the team's failure to
advance to Super Bowl XXXII.
</P>
<P>
   Mention Hearst's name to Mariucci or any of the 49ers' long-time
veterans and a smile and knowing nod are the most typical
responses. They speak often of his trademark locker-room pranks.
But when pressed, the players politely refuse to divulge the
details of the latest pranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take care of our own,'' wide receiver Jerry Rice said.
``And Garrison is definitely one of us. He has fit in well, and
that hasn't always been the case with newcomers here. Garrison has
made us tougher on the field and a little less (uptight) off it.''
</P>
<P>
   That the 27-year-old Hearst would not only find, but also
dispense, happiness with the NFL's most sophisticated franchise
seems improbable. In the process, he has silenced the critics who
thought his time with Arizona and Cincinnati, and resulting knee
injuries, would never allow him to be as good in the pros as he was
in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given what he's been through _ being cut in Phoenix after he
was the third overall pick (in 1993) and exploited in Cincinnati,
and the knee injuries _ I think he's enjoying this a little more
than some other guys might,'' agent Pat Dye Jr. said. ``Garrison
has seen the other side, believe me.''
</P>
<P>
   Dye worked hard in the spring of 1997 to convince San Francisco
vice president Dwight Clark that Hearst could be the answer to the
49ers' running problems. And while not everyone in the club's front
office believed it, they came to trust in Hearst within a few
months of his arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Just before she served the turkey dinner on Thanksgiving
afternoon a year ago, Ashley Clark, the wife of the 49ers' vice
president, asked him what he was most thankful for. ``No offense,''
Clark said, ``but probably Garrison Hearst.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year later, that feeling is universal with the Niners.
</P>
<P>
   When his record 96-yard run rescued the team in overtime of this
year's first game, he was hoisted onto the shoulders of two
offensive linemen and carried to the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive linemen, in particular, admire the way Hearst
worked on his shoulders during the offseason so that he might avoid
future collarbone problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tougher runner now,'' guard Kevin Gogan said. ``(He's)
a lot more explosive to the hole, like somebody shot him out of a
cannon or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearst insists he is the same back he's always been, but he
concedes that San Francisco fans have put him into a hero's
spotlight. But at heart, he's a thrifty country boy who will make
$3.5 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   He is a blue-jeans-and-T-shirt guy employed by a glitzy
franchise. The floor in the office of owner Eddie DeBartolo is
covered in leather. While San Francisco's backup players have phone
calls carefully screened, he refuses to buy an answering machine or
a cellular phone. He does have a pager.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned home to Lincolnton last weekend, Hearst kicked
back in a rocking chair, watched Georgia football and professional
wrestling and, of course, ate well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Him being (in San Francisco), it's kind of like another
world,'' Mary Hearst said. ``He's country all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrison himself said, ``Always have been country. Always will
be country. This is nice, but I can't see how Lincolnton would ever
stop being home.''

 &HT;    Falcons-49ers should be competitive despite trend
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When they renamed the stadium here 3Com Park
several years ago, San Francisco 49ers officials must have had the
Atlanta Falcons in mind. During the past six seasons, the Falcons
certainly have mirrored that moniker when they faced the Niners.
</P>
<P>
   Compliant. Compunctious. And for the most part, comatose.
</P>
<P>
   Since their upset victory in 1991 at what was then Candlestick
Park, a win that compelled Jerry Glanville to commission the
ill-advised ``California Trophy,'' the Falcons have suffered an
inglorious stretch of bashings by the Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The average margin in Atlanta's six-pack losing streak is 27.0
points, and San Francisco hasn't scored fewer than 34 in that span.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when Glanville returns to 3Com Park on Sunday afternoon
to serve as analyst for the Falcons-49ers matchup, another ``com''
word might creep back into this rivalry as well.
</P>
<P>
   Competitive. Many of the 49ers veterans think the weekend's only
game pitting undefeated teams will be just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're playing real well,'' 49ers center Chris Dalman said
about the Falcons. ``The big thing that stands out is that they
don't beat themselves. It's an aggressive defense but still very
sound. And they can move the ball offensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may not be the flashiest team, but they're the best one
we've looked at so far.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the ``bests'' for this weekend:
</P>
<P>
   Upset opportunity: Despite an 0-3 record, Chicago has been
remarkably competitive and figures to give the slightly overrated
Vikings all they can handle. But the underdog of the week clearly
is undefeated Seattle, which faces the offensively addled Steelers.
The fans at Three Rivers Stadium might generate more energy by
twirling their Terrible Towels than Pittsburgh can muster with
mistake-prone Kordell Stewart. The Seahawks can get to 4-0 for the
first time in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   Individual matchup: Asssuming St. Louis wideout Isaac Bruce is
healthy, his battle with Arizona cornerback Aeneas Williams should
be a good one. The Cardinals staff is beginning to flip Williams
more in an effort to lock him onto the opposition's best wide
receiver for the entire game. Bruce is a burner with great
explosiveness, but Williams knows every trick in the book. In
Chicago, there will be plenty of collisions between Bears tailback
Curtis Enis and Minnesota linebackers Ed McDaniel and Dwayne Rudd.
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy play: You hate to make 'em too obvious, but playing
without a running game and going up against a battered Carolina
defense, look for Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre to have a big
day. Favre knows the weaknesses of Panthers cornerback Doug Evans,
a former Packers teammate. And with Panthers strong safety Mike
Minter out with an injury, Favre will get the ball more to his
tight ends.
</P>
<P>
   Grudge match: Sunday marks the first time the Cardinals have
returned to St. Louis for a regular-season game since owner Bill
Bidwill relocated the franchise to Phoenix in 1988. Bidwill isn't
the most beloved owner in the Valley of the Sun, but he is reviled
in St. Louis and will be jeered lustily if he shows his face.
</P>
<P>
   Division game: With one start under his belt now, rookie
quarterback Charlie Batch has learned the most important rule of
the Detroit offense: When in doubt, hand the ball to Barry Sanders.
He will, often, on Monday night, and the Lions will upset the Bucs.

 &HT;    Forgotten slugger
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- He is credited with hitting more home runs in a
single season than any other player in professional baseball
history, yet he remains largely ignored today, just as he was
slighted in his own time, while Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa fight
over the most cherished record in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-born Josh Gibson, known as the Black Babe Ruth, was
segregated out of the white major leagues, but according to black
newspapers, the slugging catcher hit 962 home runs in a 17-year
Negro League career that spanned the Depression and World War II.
It is said that Gibson hit 75 homers as a 19-year-old for the
Homestead Grays in 1931, and he struck his all-time high, 84, for
the Pittsburgh Crawfords in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would've definitely challenged Ruth's record, perhaps
surpassed it,'' said James Riley, who has written four books on the
Negro Leagues and their players and did the research for Mark
Ribowski's Gibson biography, ``Power and Glory.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley considers Gibson baseball's all-time greatest catcher and
the slugging equal to Ruth, but he admits that some of Gibson's
totals are open to question. There is a dearth of box scores from
the era to confirm the legend, and black newspapers typically
didn't cover road games.
</P>
<P>
   The home run totals also include those hit in all games, most of
them against semi-pro teams. Gibson played in 170 games during the
84-homer year of 1936.
</P>
<P>
   ``The newspapers say he hit 972 home runs, but we haven't been
able to document every game,'' Riley said. ``Some of the papers
probably fudged a little bit just to make headlines. I'm skeptical
of their veracity, but there's no question he could've done that.
Just imagine if Babe Ruth played 60 games and 100 more against
semi-pro teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson's teams played league schedules of only 40 to 60 games a
year. Riley said semi-pro teams of the '30s were comparable to A or
AA minor league teams because it was more practical in Depression
days for top players below the major league-level to work during
the week and play on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Among his Negro League peers, however, there is no dispute.
Gibson was their premier home run hitter. At 6-foot-1, 210 pounds
in his prime, Gibson didn't just hit home runs. He made spectacles
of them.
</P>
<P>
   He's the only player said to have hit a fair ball completely out
of Yankee Stadium. The homer was struck off Slim Jones in 1934 and
might've traveled 700 feet had it been measured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gibson is in the mold of a Ruth or a McGwire,'' Riley said.
``His home runs were majestic.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson was born in Buena Vista in 1911 but didn't play baseball
until his family moved to Pittsburgh when he was 13. He joined the
Grays in 1929 and became their regular catcher and a national
barnstorming attraction, the fun-loving home run king, throughout
the '30s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to over 200 (Negro League) players, and the
consistent thing they talk about is Josh's home runs and Satchel
Paige's strikeouts,'' Riley said. ``Gibson was to black kids what
Ruth was to white kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, who was beset by alcoholism and suspected drug use in
the '40s, died of stroke shortly after his 35th birthday, just
months before Jackie Robinson became the century's first
African-American major league player. In 1972, Gibson became the
second player from the Negro Leagues after Satchel Paige to be
inducted into the Hall of Fame.

STUDY FINDS TV NETWORKS FAIL IN ALERTS TO SEX AND VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One year after the television networks revised their movie-style
ratings code to add labels alerting parents to sexual or violent
content in shows, a study has found that the networks are not
regularly adding those labels.
</P>
<P>
   The labels, for example, V for violence or S for sexual content,
are added to the age-group ratings printed in television listings
and appearing on screen at the start of shows.
</P>
<P>
   The age-group rating codes are being applied appropriately to 96
percent of the programs, according to the study released Thursday
by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a philanthropic group devoted to
public health issues.
</P>
<P>
   But the report by the foundation, based in Menlo Park, Calif.,
said 92 percent of shows with some sexual content did not carry the
additional S label, and 79 percent of shows that had violent scenes
did not carry a V. Also, the study found that 81 percent of
children's shows that contained violence did not have the FV
notation, for fantasy violence, which is found to varying degrees
in many cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   Those percentages may be skewed upward by the fact that NBC
programming was included in the study's sample, and NBC has refused
from the outset to add the V, S, L for foul language and D for
suggestive dialogue to the system. And the study acknowledged that
some violent or sexual content not labeled was of ``low level.''
</P>
<P>
   The age-based labels, in use since January 1997, are supposed to
be applied to all programs except news and sports. They are TV-G
for all ages; TV-PG, parental guidance suggested; TV-14, not
suitable for those under 14; TV-MA, for adults only; TV-Y, for all
children, and TV-Y7, may not be suitable for children under 7.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, all the networks except NBC and the cable network
BET agreed to augment their age-group ratings with the four letters
to signal what specific content in a show might be found
objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the ratings are misleading or not being applied accurately,
then the system won't work for parents,'' said Kathryn C.
Montgomery, president of the Center for Media Education, a
Washington group concerned with how the media influence children.
``We need some close scrutiny from the monitoring board.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A monitoring board, with members from the industry and family
advocacy groups, was set up to adjudicate disputes about the
system. Richard L. Taylor, vice president for public affairs at the
Motion Picture Association of America, which led the industry's
negotiations for the ratings system and still coordinates it, said
Thursday that the board would meet in November.
</P>
<P>
   The system, which is voluntary, was devised for use with the
V-chip, an electronic device that can be used to black out shows
that parents do not want their children to watch. The chip is to be
standard equipment on new television sets starting next year.
</P>
<P>
   With television news reports recently filled with explicit
sexual detail about President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, the
study's authors were asked Thursday if news programs should
continue to be exempt from the ratings system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't take a position on the ratings system,'' said Vicky
Rideout, director of Kaiser's program on entertainment media and
public health. ``We just try to conduct valid studies and put the
data out there for the policy makers. But there was a widespread
consensus it would not be appropriate to rate news. Those decisions
are up to the judgment of journalists and news executives as to
whether something is truly newsworthy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kaiser study, conducted by researchers at the University of
California at Santa Barbara, analyzed 1,147 randomly selected
programs shown last season by ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox stations, the
cable networks USA, TNT, HBO, Lifetime and Nickelodeon and an
independent station in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers counted incidents of violence or sexual content, but
they also evaluated how graphic or intense the content was and the
context in which it was shown, and related these factors to the
definitions of what is appropriate for each age group in the rating
system. Those definitions were set by a group representing both the
television industry and the family advocacy groups.

CLINTON TO MEET WITH ARAFAT AND NETANYAHU NEXT WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By TIM WEINER    
 c. 1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will meet separately with
Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the Palestinian
leader, Yasser Arafat, at the White House next week in the hope of
reviving peace talks in the Middle East, White House and State
Department officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   They would be the first such meetings in nearly nine months.
There has been little visible progress in the peace process in two
years. But there have been signs in recent weeks that Netanyahu and
Arafat might be easing their stances on aspects of a U.S.-sponsored
plan for pushing the process ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will meet separately with
the two leaders in New York City on Saturday night and Sunday to
try to persuade them to agree on the terms of an Israeli withdrawal
from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said in New York on Thursday that ``we keep making
progress'' in nudging the Israelis and the Palestinians toward an
accord on the West Bank. American, Israeli and Palestinian
officials believe that the personal intervention of President
Clinton might help move the process forward.
</P>
<P>
   But diplomats said there was so much work to be done that there
is little hope of closing a deal next week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke separately by telephone Thursday with the two men
to confirm the meetings, the officials said. ``The president urged
them to be flexible and urged them to make the tough decisions that
will lead to final talks'' in the peace process, a senior
administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is tentatively scheduled to see the president on
Monday; Arafat is to meet Clinton later in the week. The White
House meeting would be the first for either man since January.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is seeking a gradual Israeli pullback from the
West Bank, allowing an increasing Palestinian control of the area.
A proposed compromise, which has taken more than a year to resolve,
calls for the two sides to agree on an Israeli withdrawal from an
additional 13 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is thought to be on the verge of agreeing with the
Palestinian Authority to withdraw _ or redeploy, as the Israelis
prefer to state it _ its troops from this land, on the condition
that 3 percent of the West Bank will become a nature preserve or a
national park.
</P>
<P>
   On this issue, among others standing in the way of final talks
on the status of Jerusalem and the size and shape of the land under
the Palestinian Authority's control, Albright hopes ``to lock in as
much progress as we can'' in her weekend discussions with the two
leaders, a senior administration official said. ``The best to hope
for is that she can lock in agreements on some of the areas''
standing in the way of final talks, this official said.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue that needs to be resolved for final talks to begin
is an Israeli demand for concrete counterterrorism commitments from
the Palestinian Authority. The CIA's chief in Israel has been
serving as a mediator on this issue, working with the Palestinian
and Israeli security services on counterterrorism concerns.
According to Israeli radio reports last month, the CIA chief is
working with the Palestinian service on drawing up a
counterterrorism memorandum that will satisfy Israel's demand.
</P>
<P>
   No agreement on this issue has been reported, however. And there
are equally thorny interim issues that must be resolved, including
how freely Palestinians may travel between the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, before final talks begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't expect to be able to complete all the steps necessary
to complete a move to final status talks'' during the coming week,
a senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Looming in the minds of the Israelis, the Palestinians and the
Americans is the fact that the Oslo Accords, the framework under
which the peace process has taken place since 1993, are scheduled
to expire on May 4. Diplomats fear that if some progress is not
made soon, this deadline will not be met, and that this failure
could plunge the Israelis and Palestinians into a deeper
bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has said that he would unilaterally declare a Palestinian
state unless Israel agreed to the idea by May 4. Netanyahu has said
that the Oslo agreements forbid such a declaration, and that
Palestinian statehood is an issue that must be settled between the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say that if the talks in coming days create a
path toward peace, then the May 4 deadline could possibly pass
without trouble. But they say they fear that without progress soon,
the deadline could mark a significant erosion of the peace
process. &QL;

 What's in a Name? America Gets to Know Next Week   By Peter Sinton  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
The merger of BankAmerica and NationsBank is no longer in doubt,
but the brand name of the combined bank remains a big secret.
<TEXT>
<P>
   At yesterday's special shareholders meeting, BofA chief
executive David Coulter said the winning name will be disclosed
``on an evening news program'' on Wednesday. There has been intense
speculation about what name will go on the combined bank's
branches, signs, advertising and ATM cards.
</P>
<P>
   If NationsBank is the surviving name, it would be an additional
affront to many Californians and BofA employees who already are
smarting from the fact that Charlotte, not San Francisco, is
headquarters, and NationsBank and its board of directors are in
charge.
</P>
<P>
   For months, bankers at both institutions have been grappling
with the high-stakes name issue. They have hired the New York
corporate identity firm Anspach Grossman Enterprise for advice and
suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter said there will be ``a single brand name moving
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Bay Area corporate brand experts and securities analysts
think that BankAmerica will be the surviving name.
</P>
<P>
   ``BankAmerica is clearly the name that travels the best from
state to state,'' said Rick Bragdon, a partner with the San
Francisco corporate branding firm Idiom. He figures that
BankAmerica also has an edge internationally, especially in
volatile markets when ``people gravitate to the stability of
America and our currency.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst choice would be to put the two names together,''
said David Placek, CEO of Lexicon Branding in Sausalito.
``NationsBank of America would be an unfortunate compromise _
redundant, and people won't get the connection.''
</P>
<P>
   Placek figures that BankAmerica is easier to say and phonically
stronger. In work for American Express and other financial
companies, Placek also said he found that America or U.S. in a name
doesn't carry ``negative baggage around the world,'' although USA
may.
</P>
<P>
   ``BankAmerica has been a fixture in the West for decades and is
the better choice,'' said Van Kasper analyst Joseph Morford, who
hears that the chosen name could be disclosed on ABC's
``Nightline.''
</P>
<P>
   ``NationsBank has a relatively new name, and because of all the
acquisitions they've done in the past few years, it's not as well
known.''

REPUBLICAN LEADERS HINT AT WIDENING THE PRESIDENTIAL
INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: CLINTON-POLL, CLINTON-CONGRESS, CLINTON-REPUBS-MONEY,

(th) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican leaders suggested Thursday that the
Judiciary Committee would consider information from other House
investigations into the White House and Democrats if it helped the
panel establish a pattern of obstruction of justice by President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and
party leaders also said they had not ruled out a second referral by
Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, on matters relating to the
Whitewater land deal, possible misuse of FBI files and dismissals
in the White House travel office.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing his words carefully, Hyde said his committee would not
rule out relevant information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never felt we were bound by Judge Starr's activities,'' Hyde
said. ``There may be other matters we feel bear on the main
questions of the fitness of the president for this office. I would
never say we won't hear these things, but I would be guided by the
rule of relevancy, germaneness and of probative value.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde stressed, however, that the panel did not currently intend
to widen the inquiry, or cast a ``very wide net.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders had held out hope that Starr's report would
go beyond the question of Clinton's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky, a topic for which the public harbors mixed feelings. They
had also expected Starr's report to help bolster several of their
own in-house investigations into the White House and the
president's Democratic allies.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year now, Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., who is the
chairman of the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, has
been investigating campaign finance abuses in the 1996 election by
Democrats and the White House. His committee is now completing an
interim report.
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., was recently asked to head a
select committee on whether China illicitly obtained sensitive
American missile technology.
</P>
<P>
   In recent meetings with Republican leaders, Speaker Newt
Gingrich of Georgia raised the prospect of referring relevant House
committee findings to the Judiciary Committee, a Republican
leadership aide said. At the very minimum, the information could
``corroborate the pattern'' of obstruction of justice, the aide
said, recounting the discussion.

 Philippine Airlines Plane Seized in L.A.   By Benny Evangelista  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
The Philippine Airlines plane that was supposed to have carried
passengers on a final flight from San Francisco to Manila Wednesday
night has been impounded by U.S. authorities in Los Angeles to help
pay off the carrier's debts.
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; PAL abruptly canceled the flight after the U.S. Eximbank, one
of PAL's creditors, received a restraining order preventing the
plane from leaving the United States, said PAL Vice President
Manolo Aquino.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to be sure. They have lost their trust in us and
wanted to recover their assets,'' Aquino told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Mars Calica, manager of personnel and administration in PAL's
San Francisco office, said the plane was handed over to a trustee,
Evergreen Airlines, which will store it eventually in Arizona for
safekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   Debt laden and beset with labor strife, Philippine Airlines
officially shut down Wednesday night after the last plane from
Manila dropped passengers off at San Francisco International
Airport before making a final stop at Los Angeles International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   SFO spokesman Ron Wilson said the airport would wait to see if
PAL resumes operations before assigning PAL's ticket counter and
terminal space to other carriers. PAL, which carried about 85,000
passengers a year from SFO, owed about $70,000 to the airport,
although it was not considered delinquent, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Philippine Airlines is a long-established carrier here,''
Wilson said. ``We're going to have to wait and get word on their
prognosis.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a number of suitors including Northwest and United
Airlines have reportedly expressed interest in buying the airline.
</P>
<P>
   According to one news account, Northwest and United are
interested in picking up some of PAL's passenger routes, especially
its transpacific service to the Philippines from San Francisco and
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine President Joseph Estrada also reportedly said the
government might buy part or all of Philippine Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   But Northwest, the only U.S. carrier still flying into Manila,
denied reports that it is considering buying the airline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no plans to purchase Philippine Airlines,'' said Doug
Killian, international communications manager for Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines still has transpacific landing rights to Manila,
but ended passenger service earlier this year because it could not
generate enough high-fare business traffic. United spokesman Tony
Molinaro said the airline was studying the situation but was far
from making a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Cathay Pacific Airways of Hong Kong and Eva Airways Corp. of
Taiwan also may want to take over PAL, Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Lufthansa AG was also interested, PAL executive Avalino
Zapanta said. Given PAL's union problems and the region's slump in
traffic, some analysts said it seemed unlikely any other airlines
would want to purchase PAL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see Northwest as an opportunistic buyer of some used
aircraft on the cheap, but I would personally be surprised to see
anything beyond that,'' PaineWebber analyst Samuel Buttrick said.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments, Singapore Airlines has doubled its fares
from parts of Southeast Asia to the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   PAL's Calica said the airline's major ground crew union, which
rejected a proposal that the airline said it needed to keep
operating, was reconsidering the offer.

 BofA Deal Past Last Hurdle   By Peter Sinton  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
The last potential obstacle to the merger of BankAmerica and
NationsBank was overcome yesterday when the banks' shareholders
gave the deal a resounding thumbs up.
<TEXT>
<P>
   At simultaneous meetings in San Francisco and Charlotte, N.C.,
it was announced that 97 percent of BofA shares and 98 percent of
NationsBank shares that voted were cast in favor of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The combined bank will have $570 billion in assets, a
significant presense in almost half the states, and 32 million
customers in 38 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The merger will be completed after the close of business on
September 30. The combined bank will start operating the following
day, but changes in products and services will be phased in
gradually.
</P>
<P>
   The new bank's brand name will be disclosed Wednesday on a TV
news show. The name of the holding company will be BankAmerica
Corp., and its stock trading symbol will be BAC, which is
BankAmerica's ticker.
</P>
<P>
   The new holding company will issue 1.1316 shares for each share
held by current BofA shareholders. In a bad day for stocks in
general and many financial issues in particular, BofA shares
dropped $5.25 to $60 and NationsBank shares slid $4.38 to $54.38
</P>
<P>
   Talking to a mostly friendly crowd of 600 shareholders and
bankers at the Masonic Center in San Francisco, BofA Chairman and
CEO David Coulter said, ``BankAmerica and NationsBank will be
positioned more strongly as a combined company than either of us
are separately.''
</P>
<P>
   Coulter will be president of the new company, which will be
based in Charlotte and headed by NationsBank Chairman and CEO Hugh
McColl. The combined bank expects to cut annual costs by about $1.3
billion and generate profits of about $10 billion. Coulter said
dividends will rise to the level of NationsBank, which is about 25
percent higher than BofA's payout.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has been estimated that as many as 8,000 of the
combined bank's 180,000 jobs could be eliminated, Coulter said that
as a result of ``natural attrition, the reduction will not be
draconian.'' (He also said the company has decided to call its
people ``associates'' rather than employees.)
</P>
<P>
   Although six San Francisco policeman were posted outside the
auditorium on Nob Hill, the special shareholders meeting was
peaceful inside and outside.
</P>
<P>
   In the 45-minute question-and-answer session, Coulter
acknowledged that there were ``execution risks'' in providing
seamless customer service while consolidating operations. About 400
``transition teams'' have been working on these issues.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter also conceded that there are corporate culture
differences and year 2000 computer programming issues that need
attention but certainly are surmountable.
</P>
<P>
   Although Coulter was applauded warmly, the person who generated
the biggest cheer was former teller Catherine Paul, who ended her
question about retiree benefits with the quip, ``I know you've
checked your retirement.'' (No one else made any mention of top
BofA executives' generous employment contracts.)
</P>
<P>
   Paul, who worked for BofA for 18 years and was one of the few
who voted against the merger, also got in the last word from the
audience. After Coulter explained that mergers of Citibank and
Travelers, Banc One and First Chicago, Wells Fargo and Norwest all
point to the importance of size and scope, she snapped, ``Just
because they're jumping off the bridge, we don't have to join
them.''

 SEC Gets Tough on Online Stock Fraud   By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
The Securities and Exchange Commission, in a major crackdown on
online stock fraud, filed charges yesterday against 41 companies
and individuals, alleging they were behind scams that cheated
investors out of more than $25 million.
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The move marks the government's most aggressive action yet
against the fly-by-night businesses and stock offerings promoted
over the Internet through spam, or unsolicited commercial e-mail
messages, and newsgroup postings.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``We're going to ferret out and prosecute scam artists who
prey on innocent investors,'' said Richard Walker, director of the
SEC's enforcement division. ``With so much money to be made during
a bull market, we've seen an increase in get-rich-quick online
offers.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities sued brokerage firms, bogus companies and
individuals from Los Angeles to Florida for engaging in so-called
``pump and dump'' schemes that were widely advertised in postal
mail and spam.
</P>
<P>
   The illegal practice typically occurs when a speculator &UR;  &LR; buys
large amounts of a low-priced or ``penny'' stock, ``pumps'' up the
price by hyping the security over the Internet and then ``dumps''
it to make a profit, the SEC said.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators said the operations included enticements to invest in
bogus medical breakthroughs, ersatz data-transmission technology
and sham hotel renovations.
</P>
<P>
   In many of the cases, Internet spam and newsgroup postings
played a key role in spreading misleading information about the
financial condition and future stock price of the companies. Among
the worst offenders, the SEC alleges:
</P>
<P>
   _ Orange County brokerage firm Waldron &AMP; Co. Inc. racked up more
than $4 million by hyping shares of Internet shopping service
Shopping.com.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Florida company that claimed it built golf practice
facilities was actually a pyramid-type scheme that bilked more than
350 investors in 16 states out of $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC's online Enforcement Complaint Center now receives more
than 120 e-mail messages daily on potential Net securities fraud,
compared with just 10 a day in mid-1996, Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the SEC has pursued some 30 suits since 1995 against
online services accused of fraud, this summer it created a special
unit _ the Office of Internet Enforcement _ to step up its efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet provides a lot of good information, but a small
group of users is trying to rip people off,'' said John Stark, who
heads the unit.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC encourages consumers to report suspicious online stock
offers to its &UR;  &LR; toll-free phone number, (800) 732-0330, and e-mail
address, &LR;  enforcement(at sign)sec.gov &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   In related news, federal prosecutors in New York charged
executives of Assets International Ltd. yesterday with cheating
investors of $14 million by selling bogus ``high-yield investment''
programs on the company's Web site.

 &HT;    Champ is an inspiration, but only inside the ring
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Servic
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The story goes that Atlanta's heavyweight champion
Evander Holyfield was not officially introduced to his father until
he was 21, just a few months after getting jobbed at the 1984
Olympics. His mother, Annie, led him to a doorway in Atmore, Ala.,
and to the square-bodied lumberjack who could answer those
important questions, ``Who am I? Where am I from?''
</P>
<P>
   You see his father, Isom Coley, on the fringes of the Holyfield
flock during the periodic big event. The man with the broad face
and tell-tale cow-catcher jaw was at the Georgia Dome Saturday for
the Vaughn Bean fight, loosely connected to the champion's corner.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield often has spoken of the pain he felt growing up
without a father. He even testified once before a U.S. House
subcommittee studying the problems in fatherless households. But it
turns out that instead of a solution, Holyfield is the problem. We
have come to know that he is as reckless in his personal life as he
is controlled and consistent in his chosen profession.
</P>
<P>
   What a disappointment it all has been.
</P>
<P>
   Having five of his nine children born out of wedlock to four
different women _ two in the last year while his marriage to Janice
ran aground _ Holyfield once again has shown his basic flaw. He
will support all his children; he will deny none of them; they will
know their father. But sometime well before his 35th year of life,
he should have figured out that family reunions aren't meant to be
more convoluted than an Oliver Stone plot.
</P>
<P>
   It's really very simple. A responsible man doesn't disperse his
seed like a Scott's rotary spreader.
</P>
<P>
   The revelations of a philandering fighter set off a massive
reaction hereabouts this week. Suddenly, a champion who had
constructed a shining image had his character picked apart on talk
radio and at lunch counters around town. Some said it was none of
our business _ ignoring that it was Holyfield who came clean,
repeating his philosophy to his advisers that ``the truth can only
hurt you once, but a lie can hurt you forever.'' Others branded
this publicly pious fighter a hypocrite of Old Testament
proportions.
</P>
<P>
   One bit of advice seems warranted now: If you want serious
religious guidance, look somewhere else other than the heavyweight
division. It's as risky as getting your faith off TV.
</P>
<P>
   On the corporate front, Holyfield's attorney, Jim Thomas, said
that Holyfield has been in contact with his major sponsors since
the latest story of infidelity broke, and that they are
``understanding.'' A Coca-Cola spokesperson said its relationship
with Holyfield is continuing.
</P>
<P>
   On the personal front, Holyfield and his circle must deal with
the first undressing of his myth. ``People can accept it or not,''
Thomas said. ``It is the same kind of feeling as with (minister)
Jimmy Swaggert's scandal. When someone falls, there are always
people who want to step on him. They want to be able to say, `See,
you're not so holy.' But Evander never said he was any holier or
better or cleaner than anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   There still is much to be learned from watching Holyfield at
work. I maintain immense respect for the seriousness of his
training and the strength of his fighting spirit.
</P>
<P>
   We can stop looking for anything more just now. The tide is out.
The role-modeling ends in those knee-deep qualities.

   RUSSIA-BARTER _ ENGELS, Russia _ The good news for Trolza, a
mammoth assembly plant and major employer in this depressed town on
the Volga River, was a recent deal worth $25 million to produce
buses for several Russian cities. The bad news: No cash will be
exchanged and no profits will result. Barter made the deal
possible. In a country with a sick economy, a flimsy currency and a
sea of debt, barter accounts for more than two-thirds of all
transactions in Russia. In the West, ``cashless society'' conjures
21st century images of ``smart'' credit cards and high-tech cash
registers and instant electronic debits from a bank account.
Russia's cashless society is from a century in the other direction.
It emerged from a Soviet-era economy that never quite made the
transition to capitalism. The Russian marketplace is hamstrung by
failing banks, the falling ruble, government corruption and an
oppressive tax system. The result is survival-by-barter from the
corner fruit stand to the highest levels of industry. (Holmes, Cox

 No Job? No Problem! Laid-off Tech Workers Enjoy Time Off   By Dan Fost  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
You've just lost your high-tech job. What are you going to do next?
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I'm going to Disneyland'' is the response some high-tech
workers might give.
</P>
<P>
   Confident of their ability to land a new job quickly, many newly
unemployed tech workers are using their buyout and severance
payments to live it up before getting back into the 9-to-9 grind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby, I'm taking it easy,'' said Michael Shea, 27, who was
laid off earlier this month along with 226 others from Broderbund
Software in Novato. ``I'm going to investigate the bohemian
lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Shea, who provided online support for Broderbund products,
figures that he can start looking for a new job in January. First,
he's going to visit family in Pennsylvania and London.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I have now is a vista of opportunity,'' he said. ``There
are billions of doors in front of me.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The numbers bear out his optimism: The Bay Area unemployment
rate this year is under 4 percent, its lowest in nine years,
according to economist Joe Nation in San Rafael.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``Most of these people can write their own ticket and go
anywhere they want, and for more money,'' said Roger King, chief
executive of Tech Search, a Sausalito recruiting firm. ``It's a
workers' market. There's tremendous demand for them.''
</P>
<P>
   King, who mostly places executives, said he's never been busier.
His wish list now includes a vice president of technology, a vice
president of sales and marketing, and a chief executive officer.
But he also said quality-assurance engineers and product marketing
managers ``are having a heyday.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, many laid-off workers will face a struggle, even in
booming Silicon Valley. In the slump that continues to hit the
semiconductor industry, many people are sent into a job market
where companies are cutting back across the board.
</P>
<P>
   And some older workers may not have the skills in the newer
programming languages that are in such great demand.
</P>
<P>
   Even at Broderbund, the layoffs stung some workers. Dave Smilie,
31, had just started a new job three months ago. ``I loved my new
position,'' he said. ``It was a little hard to lose that new
position.''
</P>
<P>
   And while some of his younger colleagues can move to Silicon
Valley to capitalize on new opportunities, Smilie hopes to find a
job within commuting distance of Santa Rosa.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, though, layoffs occur because of mergers, poor
business conditions or even corporate mismanagement. In those
situations, the layoff no longer carries the stigma it once did and
other companies eagerly snap up the newly unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when Apple Computer laid off 4,100 workers last
year, recruiters flocked to the Cupertino campus to hire the highly
skilled employees.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Diffely, 32, took a buyout from the chip-equipment
manufacturer Applied Materials earlier this year and moved almost
directly into a new career as an industry analyst with Merrill
Lynch in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to get five or six months' salary (as a buyout
package) before leaving,'' Diffely said.
</P>
<P>
   Before starting his new job, he took a 31/2-week vacation to
Italy, something he never could have done while he was working as a
global product manager at Applied. ``It's hard to take a long
vacation because the product cycles are so quick,'' Diffely said.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for companies like Applied is to keep from
shedding too many jobs. The Santa Clara company laid off 830
workers in 1996, but it hired many of them back three months later,
when business picked up.
</P>
<P>
   Workers can use their time off for reflection that's often
impossible when they're working 12 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``My goal is to get enough of a break to make the right
decision,'' said Lance Groody, 38, who was director of programming
for Broderbund's Red Orb Entertainment division. Since the layoff,
``my phone has been ringing off the hook'' with job offers, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Groody echoed many Broderbund workers' feeling that, since the
company was acquired in June by the Learning Co., he'd rather be
outside than inside. ``We're happier to be out looking for
something new than trying to rebuild in a different amalgamation,''
Groody said.
</P>
<P>
   Laid-off employees' upbeat attitudes reflect the new economy,
said Carl Weisiger, vice president in the San Francisco office of
Drake Beam Morin, an international career-transition-management
firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``High tech has the mind-set that this is a new world of work,''
Weisiger said. ``You expect a certain amount of change _ mergers,
acquisitions, shifting of the business. You may not work for the
same company for a long period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   With the changing climate, workers have changed, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are coming to us with a slightly different attitude
than they may have had'' in layoffs of bygone years, Weisiger said.
``They've already done their career management and networking. ...
People are able to redeploy and find new positions quickly. It's a
function of the market and of the differing attitudes.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the workers also hope their new opportunities let them
find a more stress-free lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   A man who goes by the name Mitra left the position of chief
networking technology officer at ParaGraph International when that
firm was bought by Silicon Graphics last year. Although he still
maintains a home in Fairfax, he considers himself a ``technomad''
and works as a consultant from wherever the spirit moves him _
England, India or, his latest home, Byron Bay, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd always figured that there wasn't much point in working
your whole life to accumulate a large pile of money, and then keel
over from stress-related ailments,'' said Mitra, 38. ``I've lost
friends to cancer and heart attacks. ... My friends are all working
60 hours a week. People's relationships are under stress.
Stress-based systems are endemic in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need to work as much to earn a happy living.''

CLINTONS CALL THE HILL TO TAKE THE TEMPERATURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: CLINTON-POLL, CLINTON-CONGRESS, CLINTON-REPUBS-MONEY,
CLINTON-PRESS, CLINTON-ASSESS, CLINTON-REPUBS-EXPAND.)

 By JAMES BENNET    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, have been
contacting members of Congress as they seek support and comfort
during the President's predicament, White House and Congressional
aides said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has made many more telephone calls to Capitol Hill than
Mrs. Clinton has, aides said. So far, the conversations appear to
be aimed more at taking the temperature of allies, they said, than
at reaching out to members who might be wavering.
</P>
<P>
   The president has called Sen. Tom Daschle, the minority leader,
but he has not called Rep. Dick Gephardt, the minority leader, who
has recently tempered his initial criticism of Clinton, said a
person close to the Democratic leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think he'd be on the phone with Gephardt at least once
in a while to say thank you if nothing else,'' this person said.
``But he hasn't been.'' One senior White House official said
Clinton had spoken to Gephardt on the telephone recently.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, Mrs. Clinton has simply returned calls made to
her, said her spokeswoman, Marsha Berry. ``She has certainly talked
to some members, making the case that she's very proud of the
president,'' Ms. Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   The president has called a number of friends in the Senate,
congressional aides said, including Robert Torricelli of New Jersey
and Patrick Leahy of Vermont. One White House aide said that
Clinton was calling as many as four or five members of Congress a
day, including some Republicans but that the lawmakers were
generally keeping the conversations private.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Panetta, a former White House chief of staff, who has been
informally advising the White House in recent days, said the
president needed to convey two messages to members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Panetta said the president must assure them that he would not
cave in to the Republicans on Democratic goals for health care,
education, and Social Security. And second, he said, they need to
hear that the president is not ``just moping around'' but ``has a
sense that he cannot only survive this but he can survive it in a
way that gives him the ability to lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met Thursday morning with the Congressional Black Caucus
and conveyed those messages by discussing their cherished issues,
including help for black farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., who is on the House Judiciary
Committee, emerged from the session to declare, ``We think that
this administration is doing a good job dealing with the issues of
concern to this country in the middle of whatever is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House has rebounded in recent days together with
Clinton's standing in the polls _ so much so that some Clinton
aides and associates are worried that the president and his party
might overplay their hand.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the president would go along with an agreement
that permitted him to escape impeachment with censure and some
other penalty, one Clinton associate said, ``I don't know, and the
more he sees these good numbers it's hard to know where he would
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton seemed confident and determined Thursday in the Rose
Garden as he used a shouted question about whether he saw ``any way
out of an impeachment inquiry'' to present himself as preoccupied
with more elevated matters. Recent polls have shown public
impatience with the inquiry into Clinton's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right thing to do is for us all to focus on what's best
for the American people,'' he said. ``And the right thing for me to
do is what I'm doing. I'm working on leading our country and I'm
working on healing my family.''
</P>
<P>
   The president went on to call for ``progress over partisanship''
and ``people over politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way out,'' he said. ``The way out here, and the
only way out, is for people in Washington to do what the folks in
America want them to do.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an opinion article to be published in The New York Times on
Friday, four experienced Washington lawyers suggest a way out for
Clinton himself _ censure and a fine.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the writers, Lloyd Cutler and Abner Mikva, have served as
White House counsels under the president, and Cutler is informally
advising the White House in this scandal. One person close to the
writers, who insisted on anonymity, said they had acted
independently of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said they were anxious not to appear to be
trying to negotiate a deal, although they were quietly sounding out
members of Congress and others about how to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, in a conversation with Rep. James Moran, D-Va.,
argued that the president's mistakes did not warrant impeachment,
the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call reported Thursday. Moran
declined to comment on his conversations with Mrs. Clinton on
Thursday, his aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Moran, who has been a harsh critic of the president recently,
was clearly impressed, the newspaper reported. ``If anybody should
feel offended and treated badly, it's her, and yet she is standing
tall,'' he was quoted as saying.

 &HT;    TSU needs a big game from Butterfield
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- When Tennessee State and Florida A&AMP;M met on a hot and
humid early-September night in Tallahassee a little more than a
year ago, it appeared the Tigers' all-everything junior Tyrone
Butterfield would lead his team to its first victory over the
Rattlers since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Butterfield, a Miami native who had transferred from Michigan to
the Ohio Valley Conference school in Nashville, scored his second
touchdown of the game in the third period to put TSU up 28-15.
</P>
<P>
   But the heat and FAMU's size and depth zapped the Tigers, who
lost 45-28.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the somewhat friendly rivals meet here for the fifth
time, the third in the Atlanta Football Classic sponsored by 100
Black Men of Atlanta, at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   If Tennessee State is to succeed where it has failed seven
straight times against the Rattlers, they certainly will have to
apply the ``Butterfield factor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a big part of our offense ever since he's been
here,'' TSU third-year coach L.C. Cole said about the 5-9,
190-pound All-American candidate.''He's our all-purpose guy, and we
need him to come up big.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, coming up big seems to be Butterfield's trademark.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does he line up at wide receiver for the Tigers, but he
also returns kicks as well anybody in I-AA.
</P>
<P>
   In the opener against FAMU last year, Butterfield caught seven
passes for 140 yards and two TDs en route to receiving OVC honors
as co-offensive player of the year. In games against Middle
Tennessee State and Jackson State so far this season, he has 17
receptions for 253 yards (14.3 yards a catch). He also has averaged
28.9 yards on six kick returns. That puts him among the top five in
I-AA in both categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt, he's one of the best receivers in the
country, regardless of classification,'' Rattlers coach Billy Joe
said of Butterfield. ``We're very much aware of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Butterfield often receives the attention of two opposing
defensive backs. After all, he was clocked at 4.2 seconds in the
40-yard dash before ballooning to 210 this past spring. He's now
back down to 190.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might be a short guy, but he turns over fast,'' Cole said.
``People are running alongside of him, then all of a sudden he's
gone _ like a little rocket.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: FAMU, after a 21-14 loss to Hampton, has scored 129
points in its last two games, including the 84 on Norfolk State two
weeks ago. ... While Butterfield is fourth in I-AA in receptions
yards with 126.5 per game, FAMU sophomore wideout Jacquay Nunnally,
the MEAC Rookie of the Year in '97, leads I-AA with a 131-yard
average. ... In its two games, a 28-27 loss to Middle Tennessee and
a 33-21 win over Jackson State, TSU averaged of 37.5 pass attempts.
The Rattlers have put the ball up 43 times a game.

 &HT;    Wiley hopes to solve Tar Heels
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- To explain what his industrial engineering major is
all about, Georgia Tech running back Charles Wiley pointed to the
lobby of the Georgia Tech athletic building and the maze of glass
cases honoring Yellow Jacket teams over the years.
</P>
<P>
   The flow of pedestrian traffic might be a problem an industrial
engineer is asked to solve, he explained. So is parking on Georgia
Tech's campus, although clearly on a much larger scale.
</P>
<P>
   Wiley never got to a third example, but he might as well have
started talking football.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring a way through North Carolina defenses in recent years
takes an industrious mind. Wiley and company haven't done it in the
past two meetings, but they take another stab at it Saturday night
in their ACC opener in Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are Wiley's major and position ideal for taking on the
task of the UNC defense, but so is his motivation. Wiley's last
trip to Kenan Stadium was the worst of his football life. He tore
an anterior cruciate ligament trying to tackle Dre Bly on an
interception return and missed the rest of the 1996 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to bring back some feelings when I get there,''
Wiley said. ``But I have to stay focused on the task at hand. It's
not like I have any bad feelings for Carolina because of that. But
I do want to perform well.''
</P>
<P>
   In last year's 16-13 loss to North Carolina in Atlanta, the
Yellow Jackets managed a meager 28 yards on 29 carries. That was
the lowest rushing total in a game by Georgia Tech since the Yellow
Jackets had five yards rushing against Florida State in 1994 _ Bill
Lewis' last game as Tech's coach.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina's defensive personnel is not the same. Gone are
three NFL first-round draft picks, defensive linemen Greg Ellis and
Vonnie Holliday and linebacker Brian Simmons. Drafted along with
them were safety Omar Brown, linebacker Kivuusama Mays and
cornerback Robert Williams.
</P>
<P>
   But the scheme is the same. The Tar Heels rely on ``mugging
up,'' using linebackers to fill the running gaps, instead of
sagging five yards back and waiting for something to happen. They
use man-to-man coverage on the receivers and let everyone else take
care of the run as their primary responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   After the Tar Heels' defensive meltdown against Stanford on
Saturday, North Carolina coach Carl Torbush has entertained
thoughts of using more zone coverages, but the Yellow Jackets
aren't anticipating wholesale changes.
</P>
<P>
   They figure the Tar Heels will be waiting for the run, just like
Tech's first two opponents. And why not, with Tech first in the ACC
in rushing offense and 32nd nationally with 197.5 yards per game?
Tech quarterback Joe Hamilton will throw to his young receivers to
get the Carolina defenders to back out of the box, but the running
backs still will have their own points to prove, especially Wiley.
</P>
<P>
   He's been on a mission since last year's North Carolina game
when he was stopped short on a fourth-and-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promised myself I'd never let that happen again,'' Wiley
said.

 &HT;    Female pros can beat the average guy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lisa Leslie, 26, is one of the marquee players in the WNBA and
has used her athletic ability and glamorous appearance to moonlight
as a model. The Los Angeles Sparks center talks about playing
against male basketball players.
</P>
<P>
   Men are just naturally stronger. Their muscles are going to be
stronger than ours. That doesn't mean they're better players,
unless you're talking about the elite athlete or the professional
player. The average man, unless he's really been working on his
game, your female professional can most likely beat playing
basketball _ whether one on one or in a pickup game.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the NBA guys, we can compete with all of them, but I
don't know that we'd necessarily win. We're not going to go out on
the court and beat them in a five-on-five game. I can just speak
from my experience playing in the summer with the guys.
</P>
<P>
   It's tough, but you have be ready to body up with them, elbow
them, push them around. But basically, I try to beat them down the
floor, run the floor and work on technique.
</P>
<P>
   They'll say, ``Lisa, you run the floor like Scottie Pippen.'' As
soon as the shot goes up, I'm down the floor, because I know I
can't go one on one with them in the post. So I'm going to step
outside and shoot a jumper.

 &HT;    LPGA not up to par with counterparts
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The former centerpiece of women's professional golf
is venting as she leaves the 18th green, and it has nothing do with
the round she just shot, the autograph seekers she must navigate
through or her steady drop on the money list.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Nancy Lopez is upset because, for all the pie charts and
growth statistics that LPGA executives spin out, she knows it could
be better. Should be better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come a long way, but we're so far behind,'' Lopez said.
``It really bothers me. I thought at one time we were catching up,
and now it's like we've been left behind again.''
</P>
<P>
   The LPGA turned 48 this year. It has grown from a low-budget,
seven-event-a-year diversion to 42 tournaments totaling $32 million
in purses. Last year, Annika Sorenstam won more than $1 million.
All but nine events are on TV.
</P>
<P>
   That's the stuff for press releases. The downside is that most
tournaments are not carried by networks but are on cable or
regional television. Players on the tour barely have a pulse in
endorsement circles. LPGA purses remain far behind the PGA and, of
some embarrassment, have been surpassed by the Seniors Tour, which
wasn't created until 1980 _ 30 years after the LPGA.
</P>
<P>
   Debates on why the LPGA is lagging ultimately come around to
sex: how the players are marketed, how they are perceived by the
public, whether lesbianism remains an issue despite tour
executives' insistence that escalating purses prove otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The LPGA has no excuse for being second to a tour of retirees,
says veteran golfer Jan Stephenson, 46, even though the PGA Tour
helps fund the older players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the Seniors,'' Stephenson said. ``But we have so much
more talent than them. We're younger, we have better personalities,
we have more competition, and we're playing for much less than they
are. You feel like you're treading water big-time.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson is the most outspoken critic of the LPGA's marketing.
She and Lopez were central to the tour's perceived boom time in the
late 1970s and '80s. They won tournaments, they were attractive,
and they were vehicles in cross-marketing efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Former NHL executive Ray Volpe was hired as the tour's first
commissioner in 1975. ``When he came here, that's when I was in
magazines, laying on a bed with my skirt up (my thigh), doing all
that stuff to promote,'' Stephenson said. ``I would go to (New York
nightclub) Regine's with Donald (Trump), Nancy would go to a
baseball game, and suddenly there'd be a photographer there. That
stuff doesn't just happen. Marketing became non-existent.''
</P>
<P>
   The LPGA has gone through four commissioners since Volpe left in
1982. The latest is Jim Ritts, who was hired in the summer of 1995,
two weeks after CBS commentator Ben Wright was quoted as saying
lesbianism hurts the LPGA's marketing efforts. An excerpt: ``When
it gets to the corporate level, that's not going to fly. They're
going to a butch game, and that furthers the bad image of the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1996, Muffin Spencer Devlin discussed in Sports
Illustrated her life as a lesbian on the tour. And one of the
tour's marquee stops, the Nabisco Dinah Shore in Rancho Mirage,
Calif., became widely recognized as a major social event on the
sports calendar for lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   Some might have thought Ritts was jumping into a fire. But he
said Wright's verbal pratfall and Devlin's magazine story became
flashpoints that helped dissolved any myth of lesbianism as a
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was more focus on us than at any other time, but we've
enjoyed our greatest growth in the last 2 1/2 years,'' he said.
``Nobody cared (about the lesbian issue), from a corporate or fan
standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   In an educational video, ``Homophobia in Sports,'' former
basketball player and gay rights activist Mariah Nelson Burton says
the LPGA has an image consultant who travels with the tour to
advise players on hair, makeup and clothes.
</P>
<P>
   That person is Beverley Willey, who denies that she is there to
make the golfers look more feminine. She said she approached
officials in 1986 only after a customer in her salon, golfer Janet
Coles, complained that she couldn't get a good haircut on the road.
Willey travels to 20 events a year, carrying four large duffle bags
filled with cosmetics and styling equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Willey is a former image consultant, but she said, ``I'm just
trying to make their life easier. I'm not trying to change them to
glamour girls _ and I've never been asked to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   As an image consultant, however, Willey said, ``There's
definitely a different perception of female athletes, and it's
totally unfair. Here I am talking to sponsors, using products, and
we don't have the support. We should have every female product
knocking down our door.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritts is trying to improve the tour's marketing. An ad agency
has created a series of TV and print spots. One commercial lists
Lopez's accomplishments, including ``giving birth three times,''
and challenges men to ``beat that record.'' Other spots focus on
the tour's stars and their accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   To Stephenson, Ritts is ``making a good effort,'' but she
maintains that the marketing ``has gone backwards in the last five
years.'' The tour's former sex symbol admits that she is unpopular
with many players for her postition on trying to maximize one's
looks for marketing effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like attractive people,'' she said. ``Why do you have
to make yourself look bad? Why is there this thing: `Our golf
speaks for itself.' People forget we're in the entertainment
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfredsson, who recently wrote a column saying people should
stop being so concerned with the players' sexuality, nonetheless
said, ``The worst thing is when you deny the stuff because it makes
it a bigger issue.''
</P>
<P>
   She also echoed Stephenson's comments on looks, saying, ``It's
part of being a woman. We like men, too. Why does everybody like
Freddy (Couples)? He's the best-looking guy out there. No one
really cares how he plays. You just like to see his bum.''

 Acquisition-Hungry BEA Systems Has Its Eyes on WebLogic   By Mark Veverka  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Enterprise software-maker BEA Systems is taking a close look at
buying WebLogic, a privately held maker of application servers,
software industry sources say.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Acquisition-minded BEA is a relatively young firm that is a
pioneer in the fast-growing business of developing ``middleware,''
which is software that can help different sizes and types of
computer operating systems talk to each other.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's WebLogic, on the other hand, is a startup
devoted to making application servers, software that acts as sort
of a traffic cop between personal computers and big mainframes or
server computers. Both mainframes and servers often store vast
amounts of important company data.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of the two businesses under a single roof makes
some sense, analysts and investment bankers say, because it would
allow BEA to offer its customers the application server technology
they need to effectively tap into the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Software industry sources say BEA scheduled an internal meeting
yesterday with employees to discuss the potential impact of such a
deal. BEA Chief Financial Officer Steven Brown would not confirm
that his company was in negotiations to buy WebLogic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done a number of acquisitions over the years, but we
don't comment'' on the companies that we have talked to, Brown
said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, BEA has been shopping for complementary businesses and
technology. Earlier this year, the middleware firm infused its war
chest with $240 million in cash after a successful debt offering.
</P>
<P>
   The cash has come in handy. In June, BEA bought Top End, the
middleware division of NCR Corp. for about $55 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret that (BEA) is looking for acquisitions,'' says
software analyst James Moore of BT Alex. Brown in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   A potential buyout of WebLogic ``makes some sense because BEA
needs to expand its footprint,'' and ``I know that the Web
application-server business is important to BEA going forward,''
says Moore, who rates BEA shares a strong buy. BEA shares closed
yesterday at $24.50, down 69 cents.
</P>
<P>
   At that price, BEA doesn't look very cheap. The company's stock
is trading 68 times its forward-looking earnings estimates for this
fiscal year. Goldman Sachs took it public in April 1997 at $6 a
share and followed with a secondary offering at $17 just three
months later, according to Bloomberg L.P.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Without knowing the details of what a WebLogic buyout would
be, Moore notes that it would be difficult to speculate just what
impact such a deal would have on the stock. He says that BEA's
philosophy is to execute smaller deals that tend not to dilute
earnings per share. (After the Top End deal was announced in
mid-May, BEA stock dropped about $6 until the sale closed a month
later.)
</P>
<P>
   BEA's earnings have been solid. For its second quarter, the
company reported profits of 7 cents a share, after one-time
charges, which matched Wall Street consensus estimates. And it has
either met or beat the Street for the past six consecutive
quarters, Moore says. In addition, he raised his earnings estimates
for fiscal 1999 by about 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, shareholders beware. Generally speaking, it's not
uncommon for shares of acquiring companies to suffer short-term
price dips after buying out other companies.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, analyst Thomas Berquist of Piper Jaffray in
Minneapolis suggests that some investors may react negatively to a
BEA buyout of WebLogic.
</P>
<P>
   While bullish on the stock with a buy recommendation and a
target of $30 a share, Berquist says some investors may react
negatively to such a deal because they are concerned that BEA is
having trouble growing organically _ without acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Berquist also points out that WebLogic isn't a perfect fit
because it may, in some ways, duplicate portions of the
application-server technology that BEA is already developing in
house. That said, he surmises that BEA is trying to jump-start its
application server business by buying a hot startup, which ``is a
way to get that market buzz.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Fair Point: &LR;  A Union Bank of California spokeswoman took issue
with a declaration in Wednesday's column that First Security Corp.
would be the second-largest bank holding company in the West after
the NationsBank merger with BankAmerica closes. Her argument: Union
bank has assets of about $30.9 billion compared to First Security's
$19.4 billion. The rub is that First Security, which was the source
of the information, doesn't view Union Bank as based in the United
States. While Union Bank is headquartered in San Francisco, it is
80 percent owned by Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, which of course is
based in Japan.

 By ROBERT PEAR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The proportion of Americans living in poverty
declined last year, mostly because of reductions in poverty among
black and Hispanic families, the Census Bureau reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The data reflected three consecutive years of growth in income,
which have restored household incomes and poverty to the levels
recorded in 1989, just before the last recession.
</P>
<P>
   The poverty rate was 13.3 percent last year, down from 13.7
percent in 1996 and 15.1 percent in 1993. The number of people in
poverty, 35.6 million last year, has dropped by 3.7 million since
1993.
</P>
<P>
   The poverty rate for non-Hispanic whites was unchanged at 8.6
percent last year. But the rate for blacks declined to 26.5
percent, the lowest since the government began collecting data on
poverty among African Americans in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   And the poverty rate for Hispanic Americans declined to 27.1
percent, from 29.4 percent in 1996 _ the largest one-year drop in
Hispanic poverty since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The data were a tonic for President Clinton, battered by eight
months of embarrassing disclosures about his affair with a young
White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the statistics vindicated his economic policies and
showed that low-income people were finally sharing the fruits of a
vibrant economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our growing economy is giving more and more families a chance
to work their way out of poverty,'' he said in the Rose Garden of
the White House. ``After six years, it can't be an accident
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidents generally get credit for economic growth and are
blamed if the economy declines. Clinton fought successfully for
increases in the minimum wage and in the earned-income tax credit
available to low-income workers, and White House officials said
those changes had helped reduce poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said that much of the decline in poverty was
attributable to the overall strength of the economy, which has
resulted from general fiscal and monetary policy. Republicans and
Democrats have tried, in different ways, to eliminate the federal
budget deficit, while Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal
Reserve, is often given credit for pursuing an enlightened monetary
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks have been among the president's most steadfast supporters
in recent months, and Thursday's data show that they have fared
well in the Clinton years.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the number of families in poverty declined last year by
384,000, to 7.3 million from 7.7 million in 1996. Black families
accounted for more than half of the decrease.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau found surprisingly robust growth in income
even among families headed by women. The incomes of households
headed by women rose last year by 8 percent for blacks, 10.3
percent for Hispanic Americans and 3 percent for whites. Among
non-Hispanic whites, hardly any change was seen.
</P>
<P>
   The poverty rate for children was under 20 percent last year for
the first time since 1989, and Clinton said the child poverty rate
had declined more since 1993 than in any other four-year period
since the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   But the poverty rate for people 18 to 64 years old was higher
last year than in 1987-89. And for households headed by people 35
to 54, income has not kept pace with inflation, so real income was
lower last year than in 1989, the bureau said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The welfare rolls are declining much faster than the number of
people in poverty. But Rebecca Blank, a member of the President's
Council of Economic Advisers, said, ``It's way too early to look at
these numbers and conclude very much about the successes of welfare
reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Politicians have repeatedly denounced growing inequality in the
distribution of income. But Census Bureau officials said their data
suggested that such inequality had stabilized.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the fourth consecutive year in which there was no
year-to-year change in overall income inequality,'' said Daniel
Weinberg, chief of the Census Bureau office that collects income
data.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Robert Reischauer, former director of the Congressional
Budget Office, said he found it remarkable that ``income inequality
has not been reduced after two years in which we've enjoyed the
healthiest economy in more than three decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg said the bureau's field interviewers probably missed
many people with very high incomes, just as they miss homeless
people. In addition, he said, anyone who reports income of more
than $1 million a year is listed as having $1 million of income.
</P>
<P>
   The data in the report are drawn from interviews with residents
of 50,000 households chosen to be representative of the nation. A
family of four was classified as poor if it had cash income of less
than $16,400 in 1997. The threshold for a family of three was
$12,802. Income, as officially defined, does not include capital
gains, health insurance or government benefits like food stamps,
Medicaid and housing subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau data show that the income of black households,
after adjusting for inflation, was higher in 1997 than at any other
time in the last three decades.
</P>
<P>
   The median income of black households rose 4.3 percent last
year, to $25,050, and since 1993 it has increased by 15 percent, or
$3,354, after adjusting for inflation. The number of households
above the median is the same as the number below it.
</P>
<P>
   For Hispanic households, the median income rose 4.5 percent last
year, to $26,628, and has risen 4.8 percent since 1993. But
Hispanic income appears to have stagnated and is about the same,
after adjusting for inflation, as in 1972, the first year such data
were collected by the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the Census Bureau also made these points:
</P>
<P>
   _ Median household income rose last year by 1.9 percent, to
$37,005 from $36,306, after adjusting for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   _ State poverty rates, measured by three-year averages, ranged
from an extraordinary low of 6.9 percent in New Hampshire to a high
of 24 percent in New Mexico. The next highest rates were found in
Mississippi (20.2 percent) and Louisiana (18.8 percent).
</P>
<P>
   _ The poverty rate for children last year (19.9 percent) was
nearly twice the rate for people 65 and older (10.5 percent). Of
the 32 million elderly Americans, 3.4 million live below the
poverty line, and 2.1 million are just above it, with incomes
exceeding the official poverty level by no more than 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ The number of blacks in poverty dropped last year by 600,000,
to 9.1 million, from 9.7 million in 1996. The number of Hispanic
people in poverty declined to 8.3 million, from 8.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ A majority of all poor families are headed by women. There are
7.3 million poor families in America, and 4 million are headed by
women.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the bureau said that the poverty rate for
noncitizens, 25 percent, was double the rate for people born in the
United States.

DAVIS-MILLS DUO KEEPS STEP WITH MOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ At least for now, Billy Davis and Ernie Mills do
not have to defend the Cowboys for not taking a wide receiver in
April's draft. Their play as the club's second and third wide
receivers is all the defense the Cowboys need.
</P>
<P>
   Through three games, the Davis-Mills combination has produced 14
receptions for 262 yards and four touchdowns. And even though Davis
and Mills play a different role from Minnesota's Randy Moss, whom
the Cowboys did not draft because of his troubled background, this
stat bears noting: Moss, whose production on third downs has made
him the early leading candidate for offensive rookie of the year,
has 41 fewer yards and one fewer touchdown than Davis and Mills.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing has been beaten into the ground,'' Davis said.
``Randy Moss is doing well in Minnesota and I'm happy for Randy
Moss. But the Cowboys can't do it all over and draft him again.''
</P>
<P>
   So for the first time since 1994, when Alvin Harper made
highlight reel-type plays, a wide receiver not named Michael Irvin
is consistently making plays in the Cowboys' passing game. The
sidebar is that Irvin has not been in the end zone. ``There will be
some issues if that doesn't change,'' Irvin said jokingly
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy and Ernie have done a good job of taking advantage of
their opportunities, which has helped take some of the pressure off
of Michael Irvin,'' said Troy Aikman, who, before he was hurt, had
thrown three of the scoring passes to Davis and Mills. ``More than
anything, it helps us when teams look at us on film and know we are
not just throwing to Michael.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Davis is the starter, Mills has received a fair amount
of repetitions with the first team. Both play on third-down
situations, and have been complements to Irvin, who is third in the
NFC with 20 receptions for 267 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael has gotten all the balls around here _ I'm just trying
for a 50- or 60-catch season,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't been the case lately for the player opposite Irvin.
Neither Kevin Williams in 1996 nor Anthony Miller in 1997 was able
to provide much of a threat to opposing defenses. Additionally,
players such as Jimmy Smith and Willie Jackson, who were drafted by
the Cowboys earlier this decade, have gone on to become playmakers
for other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' hits and _ mostly misses _ at the position have
created much public fanfare, especially after the club did not
draft Moss. Davis and Mills are aware of the fuss, but have,
understandably, grown tired of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been amazing to me all the attention paid to what the No.
2 wide receiver does around here,'' Mills said. ``I've really never
given it that much thought. But all the questions, since training
camp, have really been kind of amusing to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice president Stephen Jones said the club was still looking for
a wide receiver in the draft. In fact, the Cowboys scouted or
watched film of more than 50 wide receivers before April. But they
passed on Moss because of his past transgressions, and they would
have considered Kevin Dyson in the second round, but he was
selected in the first round by Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   So for the first time since 1983, the Cowboys did not choose a
wide receiver in the draft. And for the first time in a couple of
seasons, there is little complaint about the receiver opposite
Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a credit,'' team owner Jerry Jones said, ``to Billy
Davis and to Ernie Mills that they have been able to step up like
they have. They have both made some super plays for us.''
Notes
</P>
<P>
   With his fractured left collarbone tightly wrapped, Aikman threw
15-yard bullets to assistant strength and conditioning coach Blake
Cundiff for 10 minutes yesterday. ``I felt OK,'' said Aikman, who
had thrown softly on Wednesday. ``I was protecting my shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   The sight of Aikman throwing made Jerry Jones nervous. ``It's
going to be torture watching him throw the ball like that and not
having him in the ballgame,'' he said. Aikman is out until at the
least the Oct. 11 game against Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Though he wasn't at full speed because of a groin injury,
running back Emmitt Smith practiced, and coach Chan Gailey said he
was encouraged that Smith might be ready Sunday. Running back Chris
Warren also felt no setbacks after working out, and he'll at least
be the club's third-down back Sunday, Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will wait until Friday or Saturday before we name a
starter,'' Gailey said.

 &HT;    Ohio given one year to reduce smog
 &HT;    By Dale Dempsey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio -- Ohio, along with 21 other states and the
District of Columbia, have one year to come up with plans to
sharply reduce their airborne emissions of smog-producing nitrogen
oxide.
</P>
<P>
   Any plan will likely require coal-burning utilities in the
Midwest, including Dayton Power &AMP; Light, to add more costly
antipollution devices to their plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will definitely have a cost to it,'' said Jim Tomasiak,
managing director of DP&AMP;L.
</P>
<P>
   Under regulations made final Thursday by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, Ohio will have to make some of the most drastic
cuts in nitrogen oxide, or Nox, which combines with sunlight to
form ground-level smog. The U.S. EPA wants Ohio to reduce its
emissions by 43 percent. Ohio leads the nation in Nox emissions,
according to the Ohio Public Interest Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups praised the new regulations as necessary to
protect public health, while many Midwest governors and industry
groups say they will lead to lost jobs and higher electric costs.
</P>
<P>
   Although DP&AMP;L favored a plan by Ohio Gov. George Voinovich that
was less stringent and allowed more time to implement, Tomasiak
said DP&AMP;L will work with Ohio in developing a plan to meet the new
regulations. DP&AMP;L, which serves about 500,000 customers in 24
counties in southwest Ohio, has two coal plants. Hutching Station
in Miamisburg, built before 1980, is the one most likely to be
upgraded or phased out, according to industry analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Local air quality officials support the U.S. EPA's strict stance
and urged other measures to control smog.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in a position to disagree with the EPA position at
all,'' said John Paul of the Regional Air Pollution Control Agency.
``But it has to be part of a total package. We can't ignore mobile
sources either, and the EPA should push ahead with low-sulfur in
gas and Tier II (lower-polluting) vehicles. Those are national
measures that can really have an effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul said the Miami Valley had 19 days this summer when it
exceeded the nation's Clean Air Standard. The U.S. allows two
readings above the eight-hour, eight-parts-per-billion ozone
standard.
</P>
<P>
   Ozone or smog is a lung irritant that can aggravate illnesses
like asthma, especially in children, and bronchitis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a significant step toward cleaning our air,'' said
Kurt Waltzer of the Ohio Environmental Council. ``Cleaning up old
coal-burning power plants will improve our air quality and the
health of Ohioans.''
</P>
<P>
   EPA Administrator Carol Browner called the tougher controls the
``centerpiece'' of the agency's efforts to cut smog. EPA believes
smog produced in the Midwest travels downwind and dirties the air
in Northeastern states.
</P>
<P>
   The new requirements apply to Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware,
Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia,
West Virginia and Wisconsin. Those states have 40 old, coal-burning
power plants, which until now have operated under less strict
regulations than newer plants. Ohio's required 43 percent cut is
second only to West Virginia's 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ohio's smog affects Pennsylvania, but Indiana, Illinois and
Kentucky's air affects Ohio,'' said Paul. ``We've needed a
consistent national standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new regulations, states must have a plan ready by the
fall of 1999, institute controls by 2003 and meet the objectives by
2007. Browner said controls will cut 1.1 million tons, or 28
percent, of current levels of ozone.
</P>
<P>
   Browner said the new Nox regulations will allow 97 percent of
the country, including urban areas like Dayton, to meet Clean Air
standards by the year 2007.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. EPA said it would give states ``maximum flexibility''
in meeting the Nox standard, but also pointed out that tougher
controls on power plants was the cheapest way to reduce emissions.
The agency noted that it would cost $1,500 to cut a ton of nitrogen
oxide from a coal-burning plant compared to $3,400 from automobile
tailpipes.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of how much of the cost will be passed on to consumers
differ. The U.S. EPA said the regulations would only add $1 a month
to electric bills, but an analysis prepared by Voinovich last year
indicated they could rise as much as 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When the rules were proposed last year, DP&AMP;L's Tomasiak said
they could produce significant changes in the way the company's
plants operate and on its future plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an unproven technology,'' he said. ``A lot of
engineering and research needs to be done. We will have to see what
the state does. The effect could be severe or something more
limited.''

<P>
   DOBROSEVAC, Yugoslavia _ In the sullen silence of a makeshift
camp in the hills above the still smoldering villages of central
Kosovo, Fehmi Geshi, a 21-year-old student, stared blankly ahead
Thursday, barely able to comprehend that he is once again a
refugee.
</P>
<P>
   Thin and frail, dressed in a grubby turtleneck and slacks, Geshi
has fled repeatedly in the last six months, moving from one refuge
to another as he dodges Serbian authorities who are suspicious of
young Albanian males and avoids joining the guerrilla force seeking
Kosovo's independence.
</P>
<P>
   When the Yugoslav leader, Slobodan Milosevic, began his latest
armed offensive against the Kosovo Liberation Army on Tuesday,
Geshi fled with his uncle, who had been hiding him.
</P>
<P>
   Now Geshi, like the mothers rocking tiny babies in cradles in
the mud, is paralyzed with fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't go to Pristina'' _ the capital of Kosovo _ ``because
they'll think I'm a member of the liberation army, and I can't go
home because there are Serbian police there,'' he said as he flung
open his one suitcase to show his precious textbooks and University
of Pristina registration card.
</P>
<P>
   Western aid workers estimate that as many as 10,000 civilians
were dislodged from their villages on Tuesday. Many are stranded in
the Cicavica hills, too scared to move but living in precarious
conditions with little food and only flimsy shelters fashioned from
trees, blankets and plastic for the cold nights.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Geshi, are refugees several times over.
</P>
<P>
   The new refugees add to the more than 200,000 ethnic Albanians
who the U. N. High Commissioner for Refugees says have been forced
from their homes in the last six months.
</P>
<P>
   How to stop Milosevic from creating new refugees has become a
question for Western diplomats and NATO planners, who took another
step Thursday toward making good their threat of using military
force to stop what they see as a looming human crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the U.N.commission say they face a potentially
unmanageable situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think it is a statement of fact that at no time in the
Yugoslav conflict were so many people for such a sustained period
in such chronic insecurity,'' said Nicholas Morris, the director
for Bosnia, during a visit to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said many of the people being displaced by what looked
like a deliberate campaign of terror by the Serbs had nowhere to
go.
</P>
<P>
   ``We meet people who have been in the forests for three
months,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many Albanians say they are too frightened to go back to their
villages because of the Serbian police, who often knock on the
doors of families who dare to return home and take the men away for
questioning.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Milosevic appears intent on separating the Albanian civilian
population from the guerrillas. He is doing this by pummeling
villages where the Yugoslav National Army and the Serbian police
believe there may be either guerrillas or supporters of the
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   He then seems to expect the civilians to be happy to return to
damaged villages surrounded by Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week Milosevic has been on what one Western diplomat
called a ``charm offensive,'' insisting there are no refugees in
Kosovo. He sent the Serbian president, Milan Milutinovic, to Kosovo
on Wednesday, where Milutinovic called on ``the small number of
Albanians who have not yet returned to their homes'' to do so.
</P>
<P>
   More than 90 percent of the 2 million people in Kosovo are
Albanian; fewer than 10 percent are Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989 Milosevic revoked the autonomy that Kosovo enjoyed
within Yugoslavia and made it part of Serbia. He wants to keep it
that way.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian guerrillas want independence, a goal that Western
countries do not support. Rather, Washington is trying to get both
sides to agree to a form of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Because Kosovo is not an independent country suffering from
external aggression, the West has found it hard to come up with a
formula for intervention. Further, Western diplomats say, Milosevic
is not aiming to clear Kosovo of the ethnic Albanians in a campaign
of ``ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs can't occupy Kosovo and they know it,'' said a
Western diplomat. ``This is not like a town in Bosnia where they
killed Muslims and then moved in their own people.''
</P>
<P>
   A former Yugoslav Army general, Vuk Obradovic, who is now a
political opponent of Milosevic, said the president is trying to
humiliate the Kosovo Liberation Army by burning villages and
showing the Albanians that the guerrillas are unable to protect
them.
</P>
<P>
   If he wanted to, Milosevic could sweep Albanians out of Kosovo
in 24 hours, Obradovic said.
</P>
<P>
   A journey in the Cicavica hills Thursday showed that the
guerrillas, who have a camp a few miles from Dobrosevac and were
milling around in camouflage uniforms, are unable to do much for
the refugees just up the hill.
</P>
<P>
   But the men and women, their faces drawn after two long nights
in the open, said they were terrified of the Serbs and were defiant
about not going back to their villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are traumatized; we didn't leave for nothing,'' said
Kosovare, 20, who declined to give her last name for fear of
retribution. ``It's very cold here. The kids have been crying all
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Her extended family of 20 people includes six children under the
age of 18 months, she said. Some have scratches on their faces from
the brambles in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the kids are sick because of the first night of
cold,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A wood-burning stove pulled out of their kitchen and stashed on
the back of a tractor trailer provided a little warmth and a means
to make bread.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovare seemed aware of both the domestic and international
politics revolving around Kosovo. ``How can they call us
criminals?'' she asked. ``And when will NATO intervene? Are they
waiting for all the houses to burn?''
</P>
<P>
   Her family, she said, has no intention of going down the other
side of the hill to Slatina, a town where some of those who fled
their villages on Tuesday were heading on foot and by tractor
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs are there,'' she said. ``We have lost everything at
home. We will stay in the hills.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Sponsors struck with Reece's looks, not skills
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- At the end of a suddenly sand-covered Buckhead
street, lined with watering holes and nightspots that are
momentarily quiet, Gabrielle Reece pops out of a stretch limousine.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when rush hour sets in, several hundred people will
mingle along the sidewalks to catch a glimpse of the part-time
athlete, full-time cover girl in a beach volleyball exhibition. But
now, a few hours before the match, the game already has begun.
There are autographs to sign. A half-hour taped TV gig and
interviews to do. Happy talk with sponsors to conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``The song and dance,'' as she calls her routine in progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I train for it really hard,'' confides Reece, 28, wearing a
tank top and snug-fitting blue-jean shorts, as she equates the song
and dance to an athletic competition. ``(It's) the thing that gives
me more notoriety and pays for my house. It comes down to taking
the stereotype of an attractive woman and just moving it, or using
that to get the foot in the door and then trying to do other
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, I never wear eye makeup in my regular life,''
says Reece, her cinnamon-brown skin sweating under the formidable
midafternoon sun. ``I put this on to go to TV this morning. It's
just a little conscious thing that I did because I'm trying to seem
appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   Named by Elle magazine as one of the Five Most Beautiful Women
in the World, Reece has an engaging mind to go with a striking face
and a lithe build. Gabby, as she likes to be called, knows the
marketing game and has played it well. She's comfortable saying,
``I'm a babe for a living.''
</P>
<P>
   Reece was rated the fourth-most appealing female athlete
product-endorser in a survey of 1,000 sports-marketing
decision-makers, ahead of far more accomplished athletes Picabo
Street, Steffi Graf, Lisa Leslie, Nancy Lopez and Sheryl Swoopes.
</P>
<P>
   She seems to embody what corporate America wants in women
endorsing its products. She's wholesome. She's married, to champion
big-wave surfer and ``all-around water guy'' Laird Hamilton. She
radiates equal doses athleticism and femininity.
</P>
<P>
   What's missing from the formula? Outstanding sports
achievements. Reece owns no Olympic medal. In fact, her event _ the
obscure four-woman beach volleyball, in which fewer skills are
required than the pairs variety _ is not part of the Games.
</P>
<P>
   She does belong to the Florida State Hall of Fame, and she's
twice been named top offensive player on the pro circuit. But the
women's pro league's December bankruptcy left Gabby to play Gabby
in appearances and promotional stops across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Reece is a 6-foot-3 symbol of the differences in how Madison
Avenue perceives male and female athletes. Guys may strike it big
on the endorsement circuit partly for good looks or a charming
personality. But before that happens, Michael Jordan wins an NBA
title and an MVP award, Troy Aikman collects a Super Bowl ring,
Andre Agassi wins Wimbledon. First, they accomplish something
significant on the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   With Reece, credit sex appeal for attracting males to the
magazine covers and the endorsements. But that's just half it.
</P>
<P>
   She also enjoys a substantial female audience, which sees her as
a role model who is physically fit and financially set. She is
sometimes viewed as the modern woman, juggling careers while taking
care of her health.
</P>
<P>
   ``She appeals to many different age groups of women for many
different reasons,'' her agent, Jane Kachmer, said. ``Young girls
look to Gabby as someone who exemplifies a spirit that they are
living: `You can do what you want. It's cool to be in sports.' Then
she appeals to older women, based on the fan mail she gets, because
they look to her for a lot of fitness information. Or because they
see her speaking out on a lot of women's sports issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then this whole thing of breaking barriers, of allowing
women the ability to make a living in sports and have endorsements.
It's all new, and Gabby is out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The unspoken aspect of her marketing success also applies to
soccer star Mia Hamm, figure skater Michelle Kwan, tennis standout
Martina Hingis and basketball all-stars Swoopes, Leslie and Rebecca
Lobo.
</P>
<P>
   All convey an image of heterosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporate America doesn't try to market to gay demographics,
so I'm sure that weighs into their considerations,'' said Lobo, who
is pictured in Reebok ads and is a spokeswoman for Basketball
Barbie produced by Mattel. ``It might hurt a (lesbian's) chances
for endorsements. But you also have to look at the personality, the
way the person comes across. Their physical appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do they want it written on your forehead that you're gay?
No.''
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: Martina Navratilova. The greatest women's tennis
player ever has a single major endorsement, Rainbow Card _ a Visa
card marketed to the lesbian and gay community.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Williams, president of Chicago-based Burns Celebrity
Service, says lesbian athletes will continue to get the
advertisers' cold shoulder as long as much of society is hesitant
to accept their lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   And Gabrielle Reece will be welcomed with open arms.
</P>
<P>
   Her face stares out from the covers of such women's magazines as
Harper's Bazaar, Shape and Women's Sport &AMP; Fitness. She
occasionally crosses over to male-oriented publications, sharing
the cover of a recent issue of ESPN Magazine. Conde Nast Sports for
Women magazine pays her to write a fitness column. Nike introduced
her as its female Bo Jackson in a tongue-in-cheek commercial in
1993 and has since put out a series of cross-training shoes _ the
Air Zoom GR _ in her name. She has made as much as $35,000 for one
day's modeling work. She has endorsement deals with Coppertone and
Bally's fitness gym. And a book, ``Big Girl in the Middle.''
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledges that the timing couldn't be better for her.
Female athletes and their games are coming into vogue. Still, Reece
wouldn't be cashing in without the look _ ``models with muscles,''
as she and others are called in the marketing world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to use the example of TV news, where the newsman can be
75 years old, but all we care is he knows what he's talking
about,'' Reece says. ``But if you get a woman who's 60 years old,
(people say,) `Oh, my God, look at the old bag. What is she doing
on there?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Granted, women are judged by their abilities as well, but
instinctively they're judged by their appearance. And the young
girls have often been taught that what they have to offer is how
attractive they are. Women do it to other women, so it's not just
men, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Reece wants you to know she fully grasps how the game is played
away from the sand. In her mind, she controls her own exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was modeling, I saw the weird curiosity around
fashion,'' says Reece, who studied marketing at Florida State but
never earned a degree. ``Here I was getting involved with a
professional sport. And people don't care that much, but they're
really intrigued with girls that are pretty. They want to interview
girls that are on magazine covers and ask them their opinion. Even
though, who cares?
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `OK, I'll play that card if I have to _ first of all,
to support myself playing the sport, so I don't have to be a
teacher in the offseason. I don't think (the system) is right. But
if I didn't think I could represent myself and my sport
athletically on a high level, I wouldn't play the other part
because it wouldn't be funny. Then, it would be hypocritical.
Because I train hard, work hard and have delivered, then I'm
comfortable with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Segments of the beach volleyball fraternity resent Reece hogging
the limelight. Then again, she has brought the sport more exposure
than anyone else over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   She vows not to do anything to embarrass the sport: ``I play in
running tights, not a bikini.''
</P>
<P>
   Reece realizes that sponsors are attracted to her more for her
looks than her athletic feats. She looks forward to the day when
that won't be possible, when appearance becomes secondary to
swished jump shots, smashing forehands and kills at the volleyball
net.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the women competing and people sponsoring take care of it
and promote it slowly, women's sports will grow and become a
regular part of our culture,'' Reece says. ``But it's such a freak
show now.''
</P>
<P>
   And Reece is the star of the show.

COTTON DEAL MAY MEAN DATE CHANGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
C.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that the Cotton Bowl has enhanced its matchmaking ability by
adding the Southeastern Conference, the 62-year-old bowl must face
the possibility of further change.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, the Cotton Bowl announced it had agreed to a
four-year deal that will bring a Southeastern Conference team to
Dallas to play the Big 12 Conference host team starting this
season.
</P>
<P>
   However, the deal means the Cotton Bowl might have to alter its
Jan. 1 date or time.
</P>
<P>
   The Jan. 1 Citrus Bowl, which has the first selection of SEC
teams not playing in the Bowl Championship Series, has a contract
clause that prevents an SEC team from playing in another bowl with
a similar time slot. The Citrus kicks off at noon; the Cotton kicks
off at 12:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than likely, we're going to have to move off the Citrus,
one way or the other,'' Cotton Bowl executive director Rick Baker
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, which airs the Cotton Bowl, is studying the feasibility of
moving the Cotton Bowl to Jan. 2. That would make it the only
afternoon bowl game on that Saturday, putting it up against NFL
playoff games on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton Bowl officials expect to have a decision on this year's
time or date within the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement with the SEC should prove a boon to the Cotton
Bowl. In three years of its canceled deal with the Pacific-10 and
Western Athletic conferences, attendance had been below average.
</P>
<P>
   The Cotton, Outback and Peach bowls will select from a pool of
SEC teams. The teams could include an SEC division champion or a
division runner-up or teams with a record comparable to the team it
will face in the bowl that selects it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the flexibility to provide the best possible
matchups,'' said SEC commissioner Roy Kramer, who worked with Big
12 associate commissioner Donnie Duncan to make the deal happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tremendous situation for us,'' Baker said. ``Most of
the time we're going to get an SEC West Division team. Having two
conferences like the Big 12 and the SEC should mean we get a
terrific matchup every year.''
</P>
<P>
   SEC West Division teams include Arkansas, Louisiana State,
Alabama, Auburn, Mississippi and Mississippi State.

<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton's standing with Americans has rebounded
broadly in the days since the release of his videotaped testimony
before a grand jury, according to the latest New York Times/CBS
News Poll.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the poll shows there are stirrings of a backlash
against the Republican-controlled Congress and the House Judiciary
Committee in particular as it presses forward with an impeachment
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   By a clear majority, Americans said they disapproved of how the
Judiciary Committee has handled the matter. While committee members
said they released the videotape for the public's benefit, 78
percent of all Americans, and 65 percent of Republicans, said it
should never have been released.
</P>
<P>
   People said they objected to the committee's prying into what
they regard as a private family matter and that it was unnecessary
to make public salacious details about sex. In addition, 65 percent
of Americans said Republicans in Congress were unfairly trying to
weaken the president and the Democrats. Thirty-nine percent of
Republicans saw it that way as well.
</P>
<P>
   But even in the face of a turnabout for Clinton, the first
glimpse of how the Monica Lewinsky scandal could play out six weeks
from now in the national elections helps explain why Republicans
are sticking with an aggressive strategy. The Republican strategy
is popular with the party's core voters, and those voters are most
likely to turn out at the polls on Election Day. Appeals to a
narrow, partisan core of Republicans may carry long-term risks,
however, if it gives the party a lasting image as overly partisan
and out to topple a president.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent resurgence for Clinton has come swiftly _ and is
surprisingly pronounced. Not only has the months-long slide in his
personal ratings halted but, in a marked shift from only a week
ago, Americans also trust him more as a leader, like him more, are
less inclined to think he committed perjury before the grand jury
and increasingly believe that the scandal is a private matter that
has little to do with his job as president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is also helped by a growing sense among Americans that
the investigation by Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent
counsel, has spiraled out of control.
</P>
<P>
   In a telling display of the public's exasperation with the
entire matter, people are now divided over whether Clinton should
be censured by Congress. Forty-six percent of all Americans favor
censure, as do 55 percent of Republicans; only a week ago 57
percent of all Americans wanted such a punishment, as did 70
percent of Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the more promising news for Clinton _ his job approval
rating has risen in the past week to a solid 67 percent and even to
a respectable 40 percent among conservative Republicans _ his gains
should be viewed in relative terms. Most Americans, for example,
continue to say that the president does not share their moral code.
</P>
<P>
   But the most striking finding in the telephone poll, which was
conducted on Tuesday and Wednesday with 960 adults nationwide, was
that on question after question Clinton recaptured support. The
poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Summing up the sentiment of many Americans who have grown
impatient with the Judiciary Committee, Virginia Caperton, a
68-year-old retired factory supervisor in Fennville, Mich., said,
``I just feel like the Judiciary Committee is too partisan.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Caperton, a Democrat, explained in a follow-up interview:
``I don't think they're going to give him enough time to go through
all of the testimony. I don't think that the offense that he
committed is worth all the time and the trouble and the expense of
impeachment hearings.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Huisken, a poll respondent from Montague, Mass., said,
``The members of Congress should look to themselves first and tidy
up their own backyards.''
</P>
<P>
   Expressing weariness about the duration of the inquiry, Ms.
Huisken, 42, a freelance writer who is an independent, said of
Clinton, ``It's appropriate for him to be censured, but it needs to
be done as expeditiously as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   And Nancy Thirtyacre, 46, a Republican respondent from
Wellsville, Ohio, who described herself as a housewife, put it this
way: ``This whole thing is a personal matter between him and his
wife now, and we should let the guy do his job so we can get back
on track.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the 53 percent of Americans who said they would be
satisfied if no action was taken against the president and the
matter was dropped, Ms. Thirtyacre added: ``This whole thing has
gone so far now that they're trying to dig up every little bit of
dirt they can. But let's face it _ there's dirt on everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   She also was among the overwhelming proportion of 8 in 10
Americans who said the investigation has not been worth all its
cost, Starr's inquiry has cost at least $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   Seven in 10 Americans said they saw or heard some part of
Clinton's appearance before the grand jury, although only 1 in 10
said they sat through the entire four hours.
</P>
<P>
   Six out of 10 people who watched Clinton's testimony said he
mostly tried to avoid answering the questions. But, by the same
margin, Americans who watched said it was appropriate for him to
refuse to answer questions about his sexual relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky. Among Republicans, 4 out of 10 said his refusal to answer
those questions was understandable.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's bounce back in the last few days was reminiscent of
when his popularity shot up after his State of the Union Message in
late January, which he delivered shortly after allegations about
his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House intern,
were disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The president's gains seemed to have come at the expense of
Congress and Starr. The overall rating of Congress is 48 percent,
roughly where it has been all year. But last week it was unusually
high, at 56 percent. However, the current rating is still
impressive for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1994, just before the last midterm elections, only
20 percent of Americans approved of the way Congress was doing its
job. A year later there was a backlash against Republicans in
Congress when the public thought lawmakers had gone too far and
shut down the government for partisan purposes. At that time,
approval of Congress was at 26 percent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The suport for Clinton may come because a majority of Americans
think Starr has conducted a mostly partisan investigation to damage
Clinton. Sixty-four percent of Americans say the investigation is
partisan; last week, 55 percent held that view. And 49 percent now
say they believe the president committed perjury before the grand
jury, down from 56 percent in a CBS News poll last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Americans also made clear that they do not expect any president
to be a model of rectitude. Only 21 percent said that having a
moral role model is most important; 65 percent said they would
rather have presidents who could do their job effectively.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton's personal ratings have improved since last week _
he is viewed favorably by 45 percent of Americans and unfavorably
by 38 percent _ those of House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who is
leading the Republican congressional strategy, have slipped
further. The speaker's favorable rating is 18 percent and his
unfavorable rating is 34 percent; last week, the rating was 24
percent and 31 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans warn that Democrats should not be too heartened by
the poll findings. ``It's like they're in the eye of the
hurricane,'' said Rich Galen, an adviser to Gingrich. ``I wouldn't
take the plywood down from the windows just yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey underscored the gap that has confounded many
politicians between the general mood of the public and that of the
conservative Republican constituency. Throughout the poll, the
views of conservative Republicans were dramatically different from
those of liberal and moderate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when offered the options of censuring Clinton,
beginning impeachment hearings or dropping the matter, 61 percent
of conservative Republicans preferred to begin hearings, compared
to only 35 percent of moderate and liberal Republicans. The more
conservative Republicans are historically most likely to vote, and
it is to those loyalists that congressional Republicans are aiming
their appeals.
</P>
<P>
   While no national poll can measure the mood of voters in
individual congressional districts, it can provide clues to how the
election could unfold. There are signs that Republicans at this
point are in by far the stronger position.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether they would vote for the Republican candidate or
the Democratic candidate in their congressional district, 39
percent of registered voters said the Republican and 44 percent
said the Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   But as other conditions are applied, such as past voting
behavior, attention to the ongoing campaign and certainty of voting
in November, those numbers become more favorable to Republicans.
The loosest definition of a likely voter produces a split of 44
percent Republican to 43 percent Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   When conditions are applied that reflect typical turnout in a
midterm election _ that is, with about 34 percent of eligible
voters casting ballots _ the Republican advantage is 50 percent to
41 percent. If turnout is unusually low, the gap would widen to 53
percent to 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Americans say the firestorm that has enveloped the White House
is dominating the nation's political and policy agenda, and
preventing necessary work from getting accomplished. Worries about
the inquiry and related issues like declining values have eclipsed
other concerns, including the economy, education and crime. Nearly
two-thirds of the public said the inquiry has prevented the White
House and Congress from doing any other work.
</P>
<P>
   The public wants Clinton to finish his term even if it turns out
that he committed perjury. Twenty-nine percent want him to
apologize; 31 percent want him to resign; 26 percent want the
matter dropped, and only 11 percent want Congress to move ahead
with impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   One poll respondent who is squarely against impeachment hearings
is Martin Valle, 72, a retired military technician from Hanford,
Calif. ``If he did lie, he was just trying to protect himself _ any
man would answer that question in the same way,'' said Valle, a
Democrat. ``I don't consider this an impeachable offense.''

MARKET PLACE: ATTIC-CLEANING ON THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now we know what it takes to shake Wall Street's IPO blues:
Beanie Babies and lots of them.
</P>
<P>
   In the first initial public offering in nearly a month, shares
of Ebay, an Internet auction house, jumped from the offering price
of $18 to close at $47.375.
</P>
<P>
   In an electronic variation on classified advertising, Ebay lets
people auction off whatever is in their attics or, for that matter,
their vaults. It has attracted a cult following among fans of
various collectibles, including the little bean-bag dolls. Indeed,
the 714,792 items for sale on the site Thursday included no fewer
than 35,608 Beanie Babies, some with prices as high as $400. The
inventory also included 2,979 autographed baseballs, 849 marbles
and 501 paperweights.
</P>
<P>
   Ebay charges sellers 25 cents to $2.50 to list their items, and
it collects a commission of between 1.25 percent and 5 percent on
completed sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their business model is great,'' said Mary Meeker, the
Internet stock analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. Ms. Meeker
took the unusual step of issuing a report recommending the shares
of Ebay, even though the stock underwriting was managed by Morgan's
arch-rival, Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meeker said she likes the company because it is attracting a
large and growing audience and sales volume while its costs are
low. Ebay even turns a small profit, a rarity among Internet
companies.
</P>
<P>
   She suggests that the company's market potential is huge, since
in the traditional markets, people spend $17 billion a year to buy
classified advertising, $80 billion in auctions and $103 billion on
collectibles. The Internet, she argued, makes matching buyer and
seller much easier than traditional markets do.
</P>
<P>
   What about the stock price, which values Ebay at $1.9 billion,
or 25 times Ms. Meeker's estimate of its 1999 revenues? (Never mind
that the price is 306 times her estimates of Ebay's 1999 profit.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Valuation is always an issue for Internet companies,'' she
said with some understatement. ``It's a great company with
extraordinary growth potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some Internet bulls, however, are shying away from Ebay.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Basham, the investment officer of Standard &AMP; Poor's
small-capitalization stock service, rates Ebay a stock to avoid,
even though he recommended Geocities and Broadcast.com, two of the
summer's hottest Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Basham said he did not believe that Ebay would be able to grow
its revenue enough to justify the current valuation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't buy the argument that margins on the Internet will be
much higher than any other business,'' he said. ``Over time,
competition will drive down margins.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Basham said that Ebay already had potent competitors
from search services like Yahoo and Excite, as well as from the
traditional players in classified advertising, newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great idea,'' he said. ``It's just that everyone can
have the same idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond classified advertising, the issue most on people's minds
in much of Silicon Valley is the initial public offering. And
investment bankers said the success of the Ebay offering would be
of little help in opening up the market for the dozens of other
companies that have been waiting to go public.
</P>
<P>
   Ebay, after all, is profitable, and it is for now the clear
leader in its category. Many other Internet companies waiting to
issue shares are neither. For example, TheGlobe.com and Xoom are
two ``community'' Internet services that have filed to go public on
the heels of Geocities, the No. 1 company of that sort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IPO market is fairly closed,'' said Suzanne Richardson,
head of corporate finance for technology companies at Friedman
Billings &AMP; Ramsey. ``Just because one transaction is priced doesn't
mean you will see a flood of deals.''
</P>
<P>
   Standards have tightened for now, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those companies that are larger, have longer operating
histories and stronger backing will have access to the public
markets,'' Ms. Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   James Feulle, head of investment banking at Volpe Brown Whelan,
a San Francisco brokerage firm, said the fate of public offerings
was dependent on the overall market for small-capitalization
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the market is trending upward and every stock in investors'
portfolios starts to work, then they get more confident and will
take a little more risk,'' he said. Since most small-cap funds are
down for the year, investors are now especially cautious, he said,
adding, ``People get overly depressed in the dry periods and overly
excited in the good periods.''
</P>
<P>
   Investment bankers might consider buying up those 35,608 Beanie
Babies and sending them out to cheer up the rest of the technology
investors.

PORT AUTHORITY VOTE PUTS WORLD TRADE CENTER UP FOR LEASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Port Authority board voted unanimously Thursday
to put the World Trade Center up for long-term lease, and several
major real estate figures have already expressed interest in
becoming the new landlord of one the world's most prominent
properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be interested,'' Donald Trump said. ``It depends on
the numbers, but at the right numbers, anything is feasible.''
</P>
<P>
   LCOR Inc., a Pennsylvania-based developer involved in the
privatization of another big Port Authority project, the new
International Arrivals Building at Kennedy International Airport,
said it would also take a serious look at the Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   The authority expects to request bids formally in the next 2
months for a 99-year lease on the 11-million-square-foot complex,
which includes the skyline-defining twin towers and four other
office buildings. The authority hopes to have a lease signed by
next fall.
</P>
<P>
   Authority commissioners have said they hope to get $1.5 billion
for the complex, with $300 million up front, but officials shied
away from hard numbers Thursday. Charles Gargano, the vice chairman
of the authority, would say only that he hoped to get ``as much as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Heading off a confrontation _ at least for the time being _ with
the administration of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Gargano, who is also
chairman of the Empire State Development Corp., said that whoever
leased the Trade Center would have to pay full property taxes. The
Giuliani administration says the complex should pay about $105
million in taxes, $80 million more than is now paid by the Port
Authority, which is tax exempt but pays a fee.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki had said Wednesday only that the lessee would
have to pay ``fair taxes.'' The Port Authority would presumably
fetch a higher price for the property if it could get the city to
agree to a tax break for the lessee.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani insisted Thursday that, in private hands, the
complex would be taxed like any other building. Real estate
analysts said that at full taxation, the Trade Center was probably
worth closer to $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   With Gargano's assurance on the tax question in hand, Deputy
Mayor Randy Levine called the authority's decision to lease the
Trade Center ``a great victory for the city and for the mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Authority officials were vague about their plans for any money
the lease would bring in above the more than $100 million a year in
net rental income the Trade Center generates now.
</P>
<P>
   The authority's chairman, Lewis Eisenberg, said that if there
was extra income, some of it could be used to pay off bonds. He
added, ``Whatever proceeds come will likely be spent on
transportation infrastructure and the economic development of the
region.''
</P>
<P>
   The authority has been under increasing pressure from the
governors who control it, Pataki and Gov. Christie Whitman of New
Jersey, to sell off its vast real estate holdings and concentrate
on transportation projects like dredging New York Harbor and
building a rail link to Kennedy Airport from Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest question now, however, is who will bid on the Trade
Center.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Trump, who is already in the midst of building and seeking
financing for the $3 billion Riverside South project on the Upper
West Side, said his interest in the Trade Center would depend in
part on ``what the economy is like at the time they put it up.'' He
declined to go into detail on how he might finance the project, but
John Lyons, the executive managing director of Granite Partners, a
national real estate investment banking firm, said that any
developer who wanted to take on the Trade Center would have to hook
up with ``a deep-pocketed entity that is looking at this primarily
as an investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Several real estate executives had said that Tishman Speyer
Properties, which runs Rockefeller Center, might be a likely
candidate, but the company said Thursday that it would not be
interested.
</P>
<P>
   For LCOR, the Trade Center is not an unfamiliar property: the
company, based in Berwyn, Pa., bid on an earlier attempt to
privatize the Trade Center's retail space, which was eventually
folded into the current plan.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives will give the proposal ``a very close look,''
said Frank Marino, a spokesman for the company. In addition to
holding a 40 percent interest in the Kennedy Airport terminal
project, LCOR drew up the master plan for the upcoming relocation
of Pennsylvania Station and developed the federal office building
at 290 Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Gosin, the chief executive of Newmark &AMP; Company Real
Estate, said that a big real estate investment trust might also be
able to handle the project. But most REIT's have taken a beating in
the stock market recently, which would make it harder for them to
raise the money needed to acquire the Trade Center.

IN PARIS, A WALL STREET VETERAN ARGUES THE CASE FOR LAISSEZ-FAIRE  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 27)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ France has been governed by the Socialists for the
entire year that Felix Rohatyn has been the U.S. ambassador in
Paris. So Rohatyn, the former Lazard Freres partner who oversaw the
rescue of New York City from the brink of bankruptcy in the 1980s,
has spent a lot of time trying to explain American ``popular
capitalism'' to the French.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I mean is a highly advanced market system in a democratic
country, with large participation by the population in the
ownership of capital assets, coupled with an active and intelligent
government that provides an advanced social safety net and
sophisticated regulatory systems, in a law-abiding culture,''
Rohatyn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that we have casino capitalism in the states, and no
social protection, is very widespread here. It has negative effects
not only on us but in terms of policies that might help the French
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a man who spent most of his adult life on Wall Street,
and who knows that up is not the only direction markets can move.
Back in July, he told a French audience that ``someday, markets are
likely to turn down, and popular capitalism will encounter some
difficult moments.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, here we are,'' he laughed the other day in the
ambassador's residence, a palace with a back garden as big as
President Jacques Chirac's just down the street.
</P>
<P>
   Rohatyn and his wife, Elizabeth, prefer quiet dinners incognito
at unpretentious bistros like Quincy, near the Gare de Lyon, or
Chez Tante Louise, near the residence, to black-tie functions in
official surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never lost the feeling that somehow I don't belong, or
that if I belong it's only because of the intervention of fate,''
he reflected, as if at 70 he could somehow still be blacklisted by
French society.
</P>
<P>
   His life has taught him respect for adversity. He acquired his
perfect French as a boy at the Lycee Janson-de-Sailly in Paris from
1937 to 1940, after his family, all Polish Jews, came here from
Vienna to get away from the Nazis. They fled again in May 1940,
when the Germans invaded France.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our driver tried to take my mother, her mother-in-law, our old
Polish cook and me across the border into Spain, but all the roads
were closed,'' he recalled. ``We decided we'd at least be better
off in the part of France that wasn't occupied by the Germans. When
we turned a corner in the woods we came to a German checkpoint, and
it didn't take much imagination to see what was probably going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Fate did intervene. ``The German turned and lit up a cigarette
after waving through the car in front of us. My mother held her
driver's license up at the window, and he let us through without
checking our papers. I was 12 at the time. A year later they were
deporting people, including children, to Auschwitz from occupied
France.''
</P>
<P>
   The family eventually made its way to Casablanca and from there,
by boat, to the United States, where Rohatyn would later go into
finance and find success.
</P>
<P>
   But it is only recently that Rohatyn has felt able to revisit
the happier moments of his own past here and seek out a few former
classmates from his old school.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as he looks at the world, he sees Washington preoccupied
with scandal and economies in grave trouble in Russia, Asia and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe President Clinton's call for a conference of foreign
ministers to review the current state of the financial system is a
welcome response to current concerns,'' he said, adding that it
``will offset the eroding confidence which is beginning to paralyze
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Rohatyn now acknowledges that ``popular capitalism'' might not
be the right answer for every country at every stage of
development, and he thinks European countries will probably always
prefer a wider social safety net than Americans do. But he tells
visiting Americans to look at what the Socialist prime minister of
France, Lionel Jospin, has done toward privatization of state-owned
aviation, military and banking companies.
</P>
<P>
   The French and American business communities could learn a lot
more from each other if they had a forum for exchanging ideas, he
said, so he has started the French-American Business Council.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Rohatyn's activities gave him hundreds of close
contacts in French business and financial circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I first met a lot of these guys in the early 1980s, when
France was nationalizing companies and imposing credit controls,''
he said. ``There's been incredible change since.
</P>
<P>
   ``France is one of the major foreign investors in the United
States, with almost 350,000 Americans working for French companies,
and similar numbers for American investment in France,'' he said.
``Companies like Compagnie de Saint Gobain in glass and Danone in
food products have a big presence in the states. Here, you have
companies like IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Motorola, Procter &AMP; Gamble,
Coca-Cola _ but there was no forum for them to dialogue with each
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started talking last fall to a few people on both sides _
Dana Mead, chairman of Tenneco; George David at United Technologies
Corp., Jean-Louis Beffa at Saint Gobain, Antoine Riboud at Danone,
and others. And last June, when Jospin went to Washington on a
working visit, he and President Clinton attended the first meeting
of the council in the Executive Office Building, with about 50 CEOs
in attendance.''
</P>
<P>
   On that occasion, Jospin said he and others in France had
underestimated the ability of the low-tax, free-market American
economy to produce hundreds of thousands of permanent high-paying
jobs _ instead of just the low-paying, fast-food jobs that so many
intellectuals here had derided whenever anyone suggested that
France should follow America's lead.
</P>
<P>
   Crushing welfare-state tax burdens and labor regulations are
often blamed for France's failure to reduce unemployment, which is
at 11.8 percent after years of economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Rohatyn, whose business background often makes him chafe at
governmental inertia, looks for ways in which an ambassador can
make a difference. His latest tilt at the bureaucratic windmills is
an effort to increase the official American presence in the French
regions outside the capital, where most American assets are today.
</P>
<P>
   His plan calls for setting up simple ``American presence
posts,'' a sort of miniature consulate with a staff of two or three
people. The first is expected to open shortly in Lyons; Rohatyn
hopes to add others in Lille, Toulouse, Bordeaux and Rennes.
</P>
<P>
   That would be satisfying, but not quite like arranging a
billion-dollar leveraged buyout. ``I don't yearn to be back making
deals, but what I used to do always had a beginning, a middle and
an end,'' he said. ``This is more like a continuum. It's never
clear when you've actually accomplished something.''

THREE GAMES IN ATLANTA HOLD METS' PLAYOFF FATE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After six months and 159 games, the Mets' soap opera of a season
now comes down to three days in Atlanta. It is there, beginning
Friday night, that they will have to try and beat the best team in
the National League perhaps once, or twice, or maybe three straight
times in order to capture the National League wild-card race
outright or simply stay alive for a one- or two-game playoff on
Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That it has come to this for the 1998 Mets seems appropriate.
This is a team that has put together a decent 88-71 record but
seems to always avoid the easy route. With a chance to open up a
commanding lead in the wild-card race in recent days, they managed
to lose three out of five games at home to the Florida Marlins and
the Montreal Expos, two teams that are a combined 86 games under
.500. And yet every time the Mets have come up short this season _
with the bullpen blowing ninth-inning leads, with the offense doing
nothing for a week at a time _ they have managed to rebound, often
against good teams.
</P>
<P>
   So who knows whether the Mets will be in Houston next Wednesday
to begin the first round of the National League playoffs or will be
dispersed in two dozen directions, lamenting lost opportunities
that kept them from getting back to the post-season for the first
time in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's going to happen, but no matter what does,
it's not going to surprise me, the way our season's gone,'' Mike
Piazza said after the Mets lost consecutive games to the Expos on
Tuesday and Wednesday and managed to go 17 straight innings without
scoring a run.
</P>
<P>
   In their three games against the Braves, the perennial National
League East champions and the winners of 103 games this season, the
Mets will look to the starting pitchers Rick Reed, Al Leiter and
Armando Reynoso. They will face the rookie left-hander Bruce Chen
Friday night, but Saturday and Sunday go up against two of the best
pitchers in baseball _ Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   It is not an easy task for the Mets, who all the while will be
keeping one eye on the scoreboard to keep abreast of how the
Chicago Cubs and San Francisco Giants are doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if somebody said at the beginning of the year we would be
tied for the wild card with three days left in the season, I think
we would have taken it,'' said Brian McRae as he sat with Tony
Phillips in a somber, but not devastated, Mets clubhouse after
Wednesday night's loss. ``We're going to end up playing Monday,''
he added in what amounted to a prediction of a wild-card playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a crying shame that we play all those games and it comes
down to the last three,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really doesn't,'' responded McRae, mindful that the Mets
won plenty of games they should have lost this season and lost just
as many they should have won.
</P>
<P>
   As for facing the Braves _ who will apparently not have Glavine
or Maddux on a pitch count even with the post-season looming _
Phillips said, ``Do I have a choice? But I'd rather play them than
Montreal.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering that the Mets dropped 8 of 12 games to the Expos
this season, Phillips' reasoning is understandable. But the Braves
will have incentive to play hard this weekend. By knocking the Mets
out of the wild-card race, the Braves would play either the Cubs or
Giants in the first round of the playoffs, instead of the San Diego
Padres, a strong first-place team. If the Mets were to be the
wild-card team, the Braves wouldn't play them in the first round
because both teams are in the same division.
</P>
<P>
   There are other incentives for the Braves. Glavine is trying to
bolster his Cy Young candidacy. Maddux is trying to put a recent
slump behind him. And the Braves, like the Expos, are viewed as a
team that doesn't like Mets Manager Bobby Valentine's
self-confident style and enjoys beating him.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves won their first five meetings with the Mets this
season, including a three-game sweep at Turner Field before the
All-Star Game break, a series that concluded with the Mets
exploding in fury after the Braves were awarded an 11-inning
victory on a controversial call at home plate. But three weeks ago,
the Mets took three of four from the Braves at Shea Stadium, with
two of the victories coming on dramatic eighth-inning home runs,
first by Phillips and then by Edgardo Alfonzo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we play the way we did against them that last series, we'll
be up for the challenge,'' pitcher John Franco said.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Mets play the way they did against the Expos and
Marlins, they will be finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two days, we had a three-run lead and then got only
one hit after the first inning,'' Franco said. ``And then we had
three hits on Wednesday, and Bobby Jones had one of them. It kind
of makes you scratch your head. Who knows? Maybe we're saving our
hits for Atlanta.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEGGY'S COVE, Nova Scotia _ Perhaps it is the endlessly swelling
sea with its lacy waves that lend this place its timelessness. Or
the granite boulders, shoved to the edge of cliffs by a retreating
glacier 10,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The knickknacks for sale in the Sou'Wester restaurant's gift
shop may seem like intrusions, but the lopsided fishing shacks
along the cove still sparkle with the silver of freshly caught
mackerel, and the lobster traps piled up outside the cedar-shingled
houses are there not for decoration but for making a living.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern of life traditionally followed by the 60 residents
of Peggy's Cove was shattered on a clear night at the beginning of
the month when a huge jet tumbled out of the sky and slammed into
the Atlantic with enough force to make earthquake detector
instruments quiver.
</P>
<P>
   The fishermen here were among the first to head out into the
night, choking on the noxious fumes of jet fuel in a vain search
for survivors. All 229 aboard were lost to the sea.
</P>
<P>
   People here, and in the tiny villages along the old coast near
here, will always remember those anxious, terrifying and deeply
saddening first days after the crash of Swissair Flight 111 on
Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   But the hordes of reporters and satellite trucks are gone now,
the tourist buses have come back, the fishermen have gone back to
their boats, and Grace Manuel has hung out the wash to billow in
the sea breeze behind her house.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy's Cove is returning to some kind of normalcy, some echo of
the timeless routine of the past. And now, what everyone wants to
know is if it can ever be the same again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well yes and no,'' said Mrs. Manuel, 63, who has never lived
anywhere but Peggy's Cove. She said that when she and a friend
walked down to the post office in the lighthouse to get their mail
for the first time since the crash, her friend found it too
depressing.
</P>
<P>
   She said she had talked to people from out of town who said they
had been thinking about coming to see the cove's famous
red-and-white lighthouse but changed their minds because they said
it wouldn't feel right.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I get my garbage picked up and I went square dancing three
days this week,'' she said the other day. ``Life goes back to
normal.''
</P>
<P>
   People who live by the sea know disaster in an intimate way that
landlubbers can only try to understand. Every fisherman who goes
out on the water, except for the most foolhardy, never loses
respect for the fury of nature, and never stops wondering whether,
when the shore slips out of view, he will ever see it again.
</P>
<P>
   Local people have had more than their share of hauling bodies
from the sea. There have been more than 5,000 shipwrecks off Nova
Scotia, and a cemetery in Halifax holds the graves of 150 victims
of the Titanic whose bodies were brought ashore in 1912 and never
left again for home.
</P>
<P>
   Seagoers are great monument builders; converting a memory into
something as concrete, and as resistant to time, as a monument is
at least one way of compensating for their helplessness before
nature.
</P>
<P>
   In Peggy's Cove, which some say took the name of a lone survivor
of a shipwreck, the face of a gigantic granite boulder has been
carved into a memorial to the village fishermen lost to the sea
over the years. The old lighthouse itself, converted into a post
office in summertime, is a memorial to the countless mariners who
have been guided by its beacon.
</P>
<P>
   And now it seems likely there will be another memorial, this
time to the people aboard the flight who died within sight of
Peggy's Cove without ever knowing it was there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I never knew you, I shed tears for you,'' says a card
attached to a bouquet of red carnations and blue wildflowers
placed, along with many others, at the base of the lighthouse.
Flowers sprout from the cracks of the smooth rocks all around. In
one nook formed one boulder leaning against another, someone has
placed a wreath of roses with red-and-white ribbons.
</P>
<P>
   People in Peggy's Cove are now wrestling with the question of
where to put the permanent memorial they are sure will come. Some,
like John Beale, a shop owner, think that putting it by the
lighthouse would be ``the death of tourism'' in the cove and that
the local church would be more appropriate. Those like Roger
Crooks, descendant of one of the early families, say that if the
relatives of the victims want it there, that's where it should go.
</P>
<P>
   But Crooks has avoided going down by the rocks himself. ``It
just tears at your heart because something like that happened near
your home,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Crooks and his wife, Sheila, operate a bed and breakfast and a
gift shop in the village. He is also a lobsterman during the
season, going out on his 35-foot red lobster boat that bears the
striking name Reverence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of people remark about it,'' Crooks said, ``but it's
something that we need a lot more of.''
</P>
<P>
   The disaster that unfolded east of Peggy's Cove is already
providing reverence to the people who pour out of the tour buses.
They stand on the rocks and peer out toward the flotilla of gray
Canadian and U.S. Navy ships searching for the remains of the jet,
and the victims. Snippets of their conversation catch on the salty
air, and words like ``horrible'' and ``sad'' linger long enough to
be picked up by others.
</P>
<P>
   When the family of one of the victims appeared, accompanied by
Constable Brad Reid of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, everyone
watched, from a respectful distance. With slumped shoulders the
relatives tossed carnations into the water and stared as they
caught the current and floated out toward the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   The tourists watched as one member of the family scampered down
the slippery rocks to fill a plastic bottle with water to bring
home as a memorial. They watched as the mother who lost her son
embraced Reid and told him to thank everyone from Peggy's Cove for
all they had done.
</P>
<P>
   ``She also told me, personally and for everybody I have contact
with, to savor every moment we have,'' Reid said afterward. A
resident of nearby Tantallon, he has been at Peggy's Cove almost
continuously since shortly after the jet crashed. He believes the
cove has been changed forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between now and next spring, things will weigh heavy on the
hearts of the people here,'' he said. ``Come next September, family
and friends of the victims will gather here for a memorial service,
and it will be tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Without the reporters and the camera crews, the local people,
who put up with bitter winters to be here during the glorious
mornings of summer, are wandering back, too.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Moore of Tantallon brought her young grandchildren Emily,
6, and Ben, 8, so she could try to explain why people would come
from so far away to put flowers at the base of a lighthouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's because people died near here,'' Mrs. Moore told Emily,
who screwed up her face in doubt, probably because Peggy's Cove
still seemed so quaint, so peaceful. Ben spied a wet teddy bear
that had been left among the flowers and asked whether it belonged
to somebody who died on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all very moving, and very sad,'' Mrs. Moore said. She
climbed up toward the small door that leads into the lighthouse,
passing a brass plaque that provides the constant warning, now
swollen with meaning, that ``the ocean and rocks are treacherous.''
</P>
<P>
   She doubts the cove has really changed. Like many others who
have lived on the coast of Nova Scotia for a long time, she has
come to realize that the area's rugged splendor and recurring
tragedy are hopelessly entangled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peggy's Cove will not only be remembered for its beauty,''
Mrs. Moore said, ``but for this disaster, for a long time to
come.''

KINGS SIGN STORR TO THREE-YEAR DEAL
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Los Angeles Kings signed Jamie Storr to
a three-year contract Thursday, solidifying their goaltending and
reducing to one their number of unsigned players.
</P>
<P>
   Storr, 22, the seventh player chosen in the 1994 NHL draft,
signed a contract believed to be worth about $1 million this season
and a little more than $3 million over its term. He earned $550,000
last season, in which he posted a 9-5-1 record with a 2.22
goals-against average and his first two NHL shutouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a long negotiation on both sides,'' said Storr, who
practiced earlier this week with the Long Beach Ice Dogs, the
Kings' IHL affiliate. ``(The contract) is something we're both
happy with. The way (General Manager Dave Taylor) treated us was
nothing but the best. I'm happy I can start playing hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to prove to the NHL that I can play, be a regular
goalie in the league and not just a backup (to starter Stephane
Fiset),'' Storr said. ``I know I have to do it with hard work and
dedication. That's what I'm looking forward to doing.''
</P>
<P>
   With Storr agreeing to terms, the only missing King is
defenseman Aki Berg, who is playing in his native Finland. A source
close to Berg reported no progress in negotiations as of Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   On the spot (subhed)
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with tonight's exhibition game at the Forum against
Phoenix, the two weeks leading to the start of the season may be
vital to 21-year-old center Donald MacLean's future with the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, MacLean made the roster and scored five goals early
in the season, but was sent to Fredericton in the AHL when his
consistency lagged. The lack of a consistent effort, which MacLean
acknowledges, has continued in training camp, with MacLean making
just one preseason appearance thus far (he scored a goal against
Colorado).
</P>
<P>
   Coach Larry Robinson spoke with MacLean following practice
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a tendency to have ups and downs,'' Robinson said. ``I
told him, `You can't afford to have one good game, one bad game.
You've got to be solid, game in, game out.' ''
</P>
<P>
   MacLean said, ``Ever since I've been ankle high, I've had a
consistency problem. I'm getting better. I still have a way to go
to play at this level. I'm going to try to put 14 days of hard work
together. I want to be here. I want to be known as a consistent
player.''

troubles. (Librado Romero/New York Times Photo)

   MARKETS DECLINE AS FEARS OF ADDITIONAL LOSSES GROW
</P>
<P>
   The $3.5 billion rescue of a large investment fund verging on
collapse unnerved many markets around the world, raised a clamor
for a government investigation and created fear that other losses
might surface.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than contain the problem and bring stability, the cash
infusion late Wednesday by a consortium of banks and brokerage
firms to salvage Long-Term Capital Management only seemed to rattle
investors.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss bank UBS said it expected to report a third-quarter
loss as high as one billion Swiss francs _ $721 million _ related
to losses in emerging markets, equities and the near-collapse of
Long-Term Capital Management. Its charge for an equity stake in and
derivatives transactions with Long-Term Capital Management was
estimated at $685 million.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA WARNS OF A FURTHER DEFAULT
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Shokhin, Russia's deputy prime minister of financial
affairs, took a harsh line with the International Monetary Fund and
other creditors, warning them of a potential default on its
long-term debt if more Western aid is not delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman Brothers won a court order freezing the British bank
accounts of two big Russian banks. It contends the two banks
defaulted on $110 million of obligations to it and its clients.
Other foreign creditors are scrambling to recover whatever they can
from their Russian holdings.
</P>
<P>
   SHARES OF AN INTERNET IPO SURGE
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Ebay, an Internet auction house, closed at $47.375
Thursday, after climbing $29.375 from its offering price. The first
initial public offering in nearly a month was priced at $18, opened
around 12:15 p.m. at $52, but fell later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   ECONOMIC DATA SHOW STRONG GROWTH
</P>
<P>
   Two government reports indicated that the nation's economy
remains strong. Gross domestic product grew at a 1.8 percent annual
rate in the second quarter _ from the 1.6 percent estimated a month
ago, but still well below the growth rate of 5.5 percent in the
first quarter. In another report, orders for durable goods jumped
1.6 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
   INCOME HIGHER FOR MOST AMERICANS
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau said the proportion of Americans living in
poverty declined last year, mostly because of reductions in poverty
among black and Hispanic families. The data reflected three
consecutive years of growth in income, which have restored
household incomes and poverty to the levels recorded in 1989, just
before the last recession.
</P>
<P>
   LOOK UNDER `H' FOR HOSTILE BID
</P>
<P>
   Day Runner, a manufacturer of personal organizers, made an
unsolicited 47.9 million pounds, or $80.5 million, bid for Filofax,
maker of the leatherbound diary that became a 1980s accessory, but
has since lost ground to electronic organizers.
</P>
<P>
   TV NETWORKS FAULTED ON LABELS
</P>
<P>
   One year after the television networks revised their movie-style
ratings code to add labels alerting parents to sexual or violent
content, a study has found that the networks are not regularly
adding those labels, like V for violence or S for sexual content,
to the ratings in printed listings and on screen.
</P>
<P>
   PROFITS OFF AT LUXURY GOODS MAKERS
</P>
<P>
   Falling profits were reported by LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis
Vuitton, the Gucci Group and Diageo, Europe's leading producers of
luxury fashion goods. &QL;

`HEAT-ISLAND' EFFECT PROMISES TO TURN PHOENIX AREA INTO INFERNO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE YOZWIAK  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ You think the Valley of the Sun _ the Phoenix
metropolitan area _ is known, is hot now?
</P>
<P>
   Stick around another generation and feel the heat with twice as
many people.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix area temperatures could continue to increase _ perhaps
as much as 15 to 20 degrees above historic averages _ as buildings,
roads and parking lots march across former croplands and virgin
desert.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix is becoming the quintessential example of what
scientists call an urban heat island.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a huge dome of air over the city _ hottest at its center
and cooler at its edges.
</P>
<P>
   As development spreads, increasing amounts of asphalt and
concrete soak up the sun's radiation during the day. Those
artificial surfaces then release heat at night more slowly than
irrigated farmland or natural desert soils.
</P>
<P>
   This retained heat means higher electric bills, more smog,
higher wind velocities, more water usage _ and more deaths. Yet
experts predict it may be decades before the increased heat and its
effects discourage most people from moving here.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as Phoenix grows, there's little doubt that it will
get warmer,'' said Robert Balling, director of the Office of
Climatology at Arizona State University.
</P>
<P>
   It was Balling who a decade ago documented a curious trend, one
that explains why people here don't keep their windows open at
night as often as they once did.
</P>
<P>
   Since World War II, when many Phoenix residents still slept on
porches outdoors, average summertime lows have broken through the
comfort zone. They've risen more than seven degrees over the past
half century, from a balmy 73 degrees to more than 80 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   What happened over 40 years was a tenfold increase in the
Valley's population, from 150,000 residents to more than 1.8
million people when Balling completed his study in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Valley's population has grown half again to
nearly 2.8 million. It is expected to pass 4.6 million by 2020, and
7.3 million by 2050, according to Tom Rex, research manager for
ASU's Center for Business Research.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, average daytime summer highs in Balling's study
remained about the same _ hovering between 102 and 104 degrees.
This relative constant is due to the wind's dispersal of the sun's
energy during the day.
</P>
<P>
   Is this still the case? Balling isn't sure, having switched his
study to global warming.
</P>
<P>
   A compilation of National Weather Service data by ``The Arizona
Republic'' shows that both the average summertime highs and lows in
the past decade have increased slightly.
</P>
<P>
   But Balling said the data cannot be accurately compared, since
the location of the Weather Service monitoring station at Sky
Harbor International Airport was switched in 1994. The new location
records temperatures 2 degrees cooler than the old location, and
still the averages are higher, said Craig Ellis, Weather Service
meteorologist.
</P>
<P>
   To find out more precisely what is happening, a team of federal
investigators from the Environmental Protection Agency and the
National Aeronautic and Space Administration recently began a study
of the heat island effect in 10 U.S. cities, including Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we want to do is provide information to decisionmakers _
city councilmen, mayors, city planners, even health officials,''
said Dale Quattrochi, senior research scientist at NASA's Global
Hydrology and Climate Center in Huntsville, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to understand how we as people living in cities
can actually modify the urban environment . . . the overall heat
island effect,'' said Quattrochi, who will be a featured speaker
Oct. 14 at a Tucson forum, Hot Topics-Cool Solutions, aimed at
finding ways to keep cities cool.
</P>
<P>
   Quattrochi estimated that Phoenix temperatures likely will
increase as much as 15 degrees, and possibly up to 20 degrees, over
historic averages the next several decades.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, one of the most studied heat islands, researchers
found that storms skipped over the city and left downwind rural
areas with more rain.
</P>
<P>
   In Sacramento, scientists have detected swings in temperature of
more than 50 degrees between buildings and nearby wooded areas.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Phoenix, Atlanta and Sacramento, the federal research
project involves Tucson, Salt Lake City, Houston, Chicago, Los
Angeles and Nashville, and Baton Rouge, La.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we make (cities) supportive environments, so in the
future we don't make cities so oppressive . . . that we can't live
in them anymore?'' Quattrochi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Developing countries are expanding so rapidly that you have to
ask how they affect local and regional weather, and possibly even
global climate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wil (CORRECT SPELLING) Orr, director of the Sustainability and
Global Change Program at Prescott College, called human-caused
climate change ``civilization's defining issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want this region to be economically competitive in the
future, we need to do everything we can to reduce the impacts on
the environment,'' said Orr, who has identified heat island impacts
in the simplest of actions.
</P>
<P>
   Flipping a light switch, for example, creates more heat inside
the home, which must be cooled by an outside air-conditioning unit.
The more the air-conditioner works to keep the inside cool, the
more hot air it dumps outside, Orr said.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, a car takes in relatively cooler air and releases it
as hot exhaust.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the solutions, therefore, also involve simple actions,
scientists said, such as buying cooler compact fluorescent light
bulbs, driving less, planting trees (and in the right places),
using lighter colors on walls, roofs and pavements that reflect
heat, rather than retain it.
</P>
<P>
   One computer study by the University of California-Berkeley
showed that summertime temperatures in Los Angeles could drop up to
nine degrees, simply by covering buildings and roads with
light-colored surfaces. Other scientists, however, question if
covering surfaces in all light colors may prove too glaring or ugly
for some tastes.
</P>
<P>
   That same study showed that, by reducing heat, the amount of
smog also could be reduced by up to 10 percent, or the equivalent
of removing more than 3 million cars from the road. It also showed
consumers would save up to $100,000 per hour in reduced energy
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the Valley, the Salt River Project estimates that for
every degree increase in temperature, the utility's 610,000
residential customers pay $3.2 million to $3.8 million extra per
month in cooling costs, or about $5 to $7 per customer per month.
</P>
<P>
   Reducing energy use also is a way to reduce the amount of
greenhouse gases produced by coal-fired electric plants, thereby
reducing the possibility of higher temperatures due to global
warming.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole discipline of landscape architecture, design and
urban planning ought to be closely linked to consider climate; to
design our cities so they don't heat up,'' said Tony Brazel, a
professor of geography at ASU who has worked with Scottsdale to
diminish the heat island effect in that city.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Milillo, Scottsdale's environmental coordinator, said his
city's planners are trying to discover the secrets to
``sustainability,'' such as preserving natural open space.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's allowing the city of Scottsdale to maintain the quality
of life that people have come to expect long into the future,
without having negative impacts on our environment, our economy or
our sense of community,'' Milillo said.
</P>
<P>
   How hot can it get before the Valley's quality of life is
compromised?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there is no limit, said ASU's Balling, who is among the
world's most skeptical of scientists when it comes to human
influence on global warming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that in the next century, the technology curve will
stay out ahead of the warming curve, and the majority of people in
the city will live quite comfortably. We should withstand most heat
stress incidents, because the car is air-conditioned, the house is
air-conditioned and the office is air-conditioned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's going to be a limiting factor at all. I do
not believe people are going to stop moving to Phoenix because it's
too darn hot here.'' &QL;

DEADLY GEORGES TAKES AIM AT FLORIDA 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPLES, Fla. _ Residents sought high ground as Hurricane Georges
raked Cuba and began to buffet the Florida Keys late Thursday on
its slow, deadly romp across the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Communities along both the east and west coasts of Southern
Florida boarded up in advance of the storm's lumbering progress.
Businesses and schools closed and emergency preparedness officials
spread hurricane warnings to 4 million residents.
</P>
<P>
   More than 650,000 people were asked to evacuate flood-prone
areas along the Atlantic Coast as far north as Fort Lauderdale, and
along the Gulf Coast up to the Tampa Bay area.
</P>
<P>
   With winds of 85 mph, Georges was barely at hurricane strength.
But forecasters expected it to intensify to a Category 2 hurricane,
with winds between 96 mph and 110 mph, as it moved northwest across
the warm Florida Straits at about 14 mph. Forecasters said the
storm could build to 125 mph by Sunday in the northern Gulf of
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 people have been killed in the Caribbean since the
storm began its devastating sweep last weekend. Widespread
flooding, mudslides and high winds flattened thousands of homes and
destroyed crops on several islands.
</P>
<P>
   During a 24-hour period Thursday, the storm dumped nearly a foot
of rain across eastern Cuba, where officials evacuated 500,000
people, including thousands of tourists from resorts along the
northern coast.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, hurricane preparations moved into high gear at dawn
Thursday. Authorities ordered the mandatory evacuation of mobile
home dwellers and urged those living in low-lying areas to leave
because of the danger of flooding.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami-Dade County, where people still recount Hurricane
Andrew's 1992 devastation in chilling detail, local government
officials warned that up to 12 inches of rain from the outer edge
of the storm could threaten low-lying areas like Homestead.
</P>
<P>
   That community, south of Miami, was hard hit by Andrew, and many
residents chose public shelters rather than risk even a minor
hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Penelas, the mayor of Miami-Dade County, issued a special
appeal for the 13,000 people living on islands in Biscayne Bay,
between Miami Beach and the mainland, to get away.
</P>
<P>
   The islands are studded with multimillion-dollar homes belonging
to celebrities such as Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan and
talk show host Oprah Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to be cautious, but at the same time, respectful
of our citizenry,'' Pinelas said. Referring to Andrew, he said, ``I
do not want people in this community, again, to be lulled into a
false sense of security.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the western coastline, Collier County officials ordered
the mandatory evacuation of low-lying areas in Naples, as well as
Marco Island and the Isle of Capri. A steady line of traffic was
heading north before sunset from Marco Island, a resort community
with miles of recently-built high-rise condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Griffes, a commercial banking representative, had made
hotel reservations inland Monday. He nodded at the water that
lapped against his Isle of Capri back yard. ``We're only two feet
above water here,'' he said. ``Where's it gonna go if it comes in
on a surge?''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Kerwin, an employee at a Naples tire dealer, said he had
taken the cautious approach and boarded up his home Tuesday. ``This
storm is one we're taking seriously,'' said store manager Howard
Hoffman. ``We've had a lot of time to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   At a shelter at Naples' Barron Collier High School, Nancy
Marshall was celebrating her 72nd birthday with her husband, her
son, a cake _ and a roomful of nervous strangers also fleeing the
storm's approach.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to the oxygen line clipped to her nose, she said she
could not risk her home losing power during the storm.
</P>
<P>
   Officials ordered the 80,000 residents of the Florida Keys to
leave the 100-mile long island chain Wednesday. But many stayed
behind, Key West police said, despite a curfew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people who have stayed behind (in the Keys), you are
taking a tremendous risk. We urge you to take this last opportunity
to evacuate,'' National Hurricane Center director Jerry Jarrell
said Thursday. Estimates of how many Keys dwellers had left varied
between 50 percent and 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On the Atlantic Coast, NASA canceled its plans to move the
shuttle Discovery from its seaside launch pad.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-story spacecraft would have been unprotected from
lightning strikes throughout the six to eight-hour move to a
hangar, so managers decided it would be safer to leave it within a
protective cover on the pad.

HEDGE COMPANY'S FALL RAISES QUESTIONS IN CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Iowa, N.Y.)  (See also HEDGEFUND-BAILOUT, HEDGEFUND-TEAM, HEDGEFUND-RISK.) 
(af) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration played down Thursday the
potential risks to the financial system from Long-Term Capital
Management LP's brush with collapse, but the fund's fall raised
questions in Congress about whether regulators can keep up with the
increasing complexity and speed of the markets.
</P>
<P>
   A day after helping big banks and investment firms work out a
rescue package that will give Long-Term Capital some time to deal
with its financial problems, the Federal Reserve emphasized that it
had not put any taxpayer money into the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Fed officials said, the deal calls for Long-Term
Capital's owners to suffer potentially substantial losses from
their investment strategies gone wrong. As a result, they said, the
deal was not a bailout and should not be seen by investors as a
sign that the government was willing to protect investors from
their mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at a time of instability in markets worldwide, the
episode was seen by some members of Congress and economists as a
new application of the ``too big to fail'' doctrine, under which
regulators take steps to keep institutions afloat because allowing
them to collapse would drag down other firms and endanger the
entire financial system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would appear that Long-Term Capital Management was deemed
by the Federal Reserve to be too leveraged and too intertwined to
fail,'' said Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, who is chairman of the House
Banking Committee. ``The question that remains for the economy is
what other risk exists in the hedge fund and derivatives
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional aides said that discussions were under way about
holding hearings into Long-Term Capital's problems, and the more
general issue of the complex, risky investments made by hedge
funds, but that no decisions had been made.
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues certain to be debated is whether the Fed, by
using its influence to help keep Long-Term Capital afloat, was
sending big investors a signal that it will provide a safety net
when they are at risk of suffering huge losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should the weight of the federal government be brought to
bear to help out a private investor?'' Paul Volcker, a former
Federal Reserve chairman, said in a speech in Boston Thursday,
Bloomberg News reported.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, was kept apprised
of the talks on Wednesday but played no active role in the
negotiations, which took place at the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Fed takes the role within the Federal Reserve
system of monitoring financial markets and had been tracking
Long-Term Capital's condition for several weeks, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said Thursday that he had no
concerns about any broader fallout. ``The only issue that I have to
worry about are issues that have systemic effects, that can affect
the overall economy,'' Rubin told reporters. ``I believe the system
can handle everything I'm aware of'' relating to Long-Term
Capital's problems.
</P>
<P>
   But there were indications that Fed officials were concerned
that the incident would create a further perception of risk within
the financial markets, exacerbating a developing credit squeeze and
further slowing the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Long-Term Capital was hammering out a deal with its
creditors, Greenspan was telling the Senate Budget Committee that
the global crisis had become ``more virulent'' in recent weeks,
with direct effects on the American markets.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Bakstansky, a spokesman for the New York Fed, said it was
wrong to characterize the situation as an application of the ``too
big to fail'' doctrine, especially since no government money was
involved and the Fed's only role was to bring Long-Term Capital
together with its creditors. But he said the Fed had to be aware of
potential ``disruptions'' to the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``These situations are learning experiences, and we're looking
at what we can do effectively in the context of our
responsibilities,'' Bakstansky said. ``We're not assigned to set
margin requirements for the bond markets. We don't have regulatory
authority over offshore hedge funds. But we do have responsibility
for the safety and soundness of the banking system.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Litan, the director of economic studies at the Brookings
Institution, said it was hard to evaluate the Fed's approach to
Long-Term Capital without knowing more about the investment firm's
positions _ always a problem with hedge funds, which are largely
unregulated and operate in considerable secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole premise of hedge funds _ the reason they're not
subject to regulation _ is that they are limited to very large
investors and that the creditors to them are big boys who are
supposed to be able to take care of themselves,'' he said. ``This
may cause policy makers to revisit that assumption. Maybe one
outcome of this will be more data collection.''

CAN A GENERATION LEARN TO SHARE?  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 27)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)  (af) 
 By JAMES SCHEMBARI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On graduation day, during that walk to the auditorium to return
our caps and gowns, giddy about the future, were we ever so
confident as to imagine that we'd be where we are now? That we'd
have lucrative jobs, full retirement accounts and nice homes
soaring in value?
</P>
<P>
   An American living in Geneva told me last summer, after I
marveled about his city, that, yes, it was lovely, but that ``I
wish we had your economy.'' A few days later, a Paris businessman
told me the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   America's baby boomers are indeed fortunate. But what are we
doing with our good fortune? What good have we done? There are
moral issues involved in such plenty, and there is evidence that we
are not responding as we could. How do we measure up, say, to our
parents' generation when it comes to philanthropy?
</P>
<P>
   ``You Americans are very generous,'' my friend in Paris said,
``but you are so ... '' He stopped, not knowing the English word.
He spoke in French to another person at the table, who then turned
to me and said, ``clumsy.''
</P>
<P>
   Still probably not the right word, but the image of falling down
was clear.
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that since the bull market began, stocks have
created about $8 trillion of wealth. Money is now the national
sport. We chat about our investments, show off our new kitchens,
our Range Rovers. Even as the market sputters, there seems to be no
limit to what we can have or do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the first time in history that the phrase `we can't
afford it,' cannot honestly be used to determine choices of
consumption in a family,'' said Paul G. Schervish, director of the
Social Welfare Research Institute at Boston College. ``Affluence
opens up the opportunity for charitable giving. But it also opens
up the opportunity to buy a second home and then say, `I don't have
enough for charity.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So while no one says boomers lack hearts, there is concern that
they are not approaching philanthropy with the same passion as
consumption.
</P>
<P>
   One measure of philanthropy is the percentage of personal income
given to charity. In the mid-1960s, when many boomers' parents were
in their 40s, it was 2.2 percent. Now it is 1.9 percent. And
surveys show that giving by high-income people is not increasing as
quickly as wealth.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the boomers are close to their parents in giving,
close somehow seems so inadequate in the midst of so much wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baby boomers' parents were happy with a two-bedroom
cottage and one-car garage,'' said Sara Melendez, president of
Independent Sector, an association of nonprofit groups. ``Now it's,
`How many TV sets do we have?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby boomers are at the peak of their earnings,'' she added,
``and certainly when you are making more than you ever have before,
that is the time to give more.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounds like our parents, prodding us to finish the food on
our plates. ``There are children starving in China,'' my mother
would say. Of course, now there are schools that have been forced
to hold classes in bathrooms. And that's in New York.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard not to see the point. I've always warded off guilt
with the feeling that I've been generous. I write checks to
charity, and I volunteer at my church. But I took a harder look
when I began researching this column.
</P>
<P>
   I do volunteer work for six hours a month, every other month.
That's less than an hour a week. Those checks I write come out to
2.4 percent of my income, above the national average but still
below what I know I can afford.
</P>
<P>
   Why? I share the fears of many other people about the future:
How will I ever have enough for my children's college education? My
retirement?
</P>
<P>
   But I've never asked the questions from the heart: Do I really
need my three cars? Did I really need to renovate the bathroom?
Should I have gone to the Poconos instead of to Paris this summer?
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Hodgkinson, a research professor of public policy at
Georgetown University, says that until the pressures of college and
retirement are relieved, boomers probably will not increase their
giving. But history suggests that they will change someday.
</P>
<P>
   The most generous givers tend to be 65 to 74, donating almost 4
percent of their incomes. So charities have their fingers crossed,
hoping that the boomers, blessed with so much, will eventually
arrive on the other side of their economic worries and do one great
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first wave of the baby boom has the capacity to engage in
philanthropy like no previous generation,'' Dr. Hodgkinson said.
That will happen, she said, when they realize how much has piled up
in their 401(k)s. ``That's the moment when we need to ask this
generation about their obligation to future generations.''

REPORTER PLEADS GUILTY IN THEFT OF VOICE MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Cincinnati Enquirer's lead reporter on an expose that was
later retracted by the newspaper pleaded guilty Thursday to two
felony charges that he stole internal voice mail messages from the
Chiquita banana company, which he had been investigating.
</P>
<P>
   In the Hamilton County courthouse in Cincinnati, the reporter,
Michael Gallagher, pleaded guilty to one count of unlawful
interception of wire communications and one count of unauthorized
access to computer systems, which could bring two and a half years
in prison and a fine of $7,500. He is scheduled to be sentenced on
March 19.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher was dismissed by the Enquirer shortly after it
retracted the May 3 article, an 18-page special report, which
questioned Chiquita's Central America business dealings and
included accusations of a bribery scheme in Colombia. The Enquirer
retracted the article on June 28, running a front-page apology, and
made $10 million payment to Chiquita. The articles hinged largely
on information Gallagher got from the voice messages, which he said
had come from a high-ranking Chiquita official with authority over
the voice mail system.
</P>
<P>
   In its apology, which ran for three consecutive days, the
newspaper said that ``an Enquirer employee was involved in the
theft of this information in violation of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the Enquirer's retraction, a special prosecutor was
assigned to investigate possible criminal activity.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Gallagher, George Ventura, a former lawyer for
Chiquita, was indicted on Sept. 16 and pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Perry Ancona, would not comment on the
continuing investigation, but The Associated Press reported that
Ancona told the judge in court Thursday that Gallagher has agreed
to cooperate with the investigation. Gallagher and his lawyer did
not comment.
</P>
<P>
   While the newspaper's $10 million payment pre-empted any lawsuit
against it by Chiquita, Gallagher still personally faces a civil
suit alleging slander and defamation. Chiquita officials would not
comment on the outstanding suit, but said they were pleased with
the progress of the criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's guilty pleas by the lead reporter, Mike Gallagher,
clearly support the fact that the series of articles was false,
misleading and lacking credibility,'' said Steve Warshaw, president
and chief operating officer of Chiquita Brands International, the
parent company of the banana producer.
</P>
<P>
   Harry M. Whipple, publisher of the Enquirer, which is owned by
Gannett Co., would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the agreement with Chiquita, which is based in
Cincinnati, the newspaper ran the apology for three days. The
Enquirer apology came in a summer of retractions by news
organizations. The Boston Globe, which is owned by The New York
Times Co., dismissed two columnists for fabrication; writer Stephen
Glass was discovered to have made up sources in articles for
various magazines, including The New Republic, and Time Magazine
and CNN retracted a story about use by the U.S. military of nerve
gas during the Vietnam War.

   NOW HERE'S A VOUCHER EVEN LIBERALS CAN LOVE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Who wouldn't like to cut their taxes by $300 or $400 a year?
Such savings are available to commuters whose employers set up a
transit voucher program to take advantage of provisions of the
transportation law enacted in July.
</P>
<P>
   For the employee, the voucher for public transit or van pools _
worth up to $65 a month this year and rising to $100 a month by
2002 _ is a tax-free benefit that can be taken in lieu of wages.
For the employer it is a deductible expense, but no payroll taxes
are due, as they are for wages.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Stieglitz, a partner in Anchin, Block &AMP; Anchin, a New
York accounting firm, said employers previously could offer transit
vouchers as a tax-free benefit but could not reduce salaries to pay
for them. Matthew R. Rosenberg, senior tax partner, said that with
the new law, ``the employer has a tax savings and creates goodwill
among employees.''
</P>
<P>
   If, say, a worker pays $135 for a monthly ticket on a commuter
train, she can apply her $65 voucher toward the cost. If she is in
the 28 percent federal bracket, her tax savings will be $303 a
year. Because many states base deductions on federal rules, and
many people are in higher brackets, overall savings could easily
surpass $400.

   INFLATED PAY AWAITS DEFLATED EXECUTIVE EGOS
</P>
<P>
   Golden parachutes are expanding, thanks to the addition of
so-called gross-up features for executives who face tax liabilities
when companies change control and the executives lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   William M. Mercer Inc., the consulting firm, has found that 64
percent of 350 large publicly traded companies provide financial
protection for one or more key executives, most often the chief
executive, if the company changes control.
</P>
<P>
   Of those offering such golden parachutes, nearly two-thirds
include gross-ups in the agreements, up from fewer than half in
1994. A gross-up inflates an executive's severance package to cover
excise taxes and any additional income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Internal Revenue Service scrutiny of golden parachutes,
they are standard practice, said Howard Golden, a Mercer principal
in New York, because without them, ``companies would find their
top-level recruitments and retention strategies seriously
compromised.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, an executive is covered for two to three years and is
given a severance payment equal to three times annual salary plus
bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Jan M. Rosen
</P>
<P>
   IT HASN'T BEEN THIS GOOD SINCE JIMMY CARTER'S DAY
</P>
<P>
   Hiring in the final quarter of the year will be the highest for
any fourth quarter since 1977, according to Manpower Inc. In its
Employment Outlook Survey for the quarter, Manpower found that 29
percent of companies would add to their work forces, 60 percent
would remain at present levels, 7 percent planned to cut back and
the remaining 4 percent did not yet know their plans. Demand was
especially strong in wholesale and retail trades and in
construction.

BANGING THE DRUM FOR HONG KONG  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 27)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By MARK LANDLER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ This former British colony has neither an army nor
an air force. But these days, it does have a general _ a career
civil servant with a Chinese name, a British knighthood and a
warrior's determination to crush the foreign speculators whom he
accuses of preying on Hong Kong's economy.
</P>
<P>
   His name is Sir Donald Tsang, and for two weeks last month, he
ordered the Hong Kong government to mount a huge, unprecedented
intervention in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Donald's goal was to burn overseas hedge funds that he said
had bet heavily that the Hong Kong market would decline. Brokers
estimate that the government spent at least $10 billion to prop it
up.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sir Donald holds the title of financial secretary of
Hong Kong _ a post similar to United States Treasury secretary _ he
comes off more as Robert E. Lee than Robert E. Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to realize that we are in the middle of a battle,''
said Sir Donald, in a typically spirited briefing on the
intervention. ``I would not wish to disclose how many tanks I
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Such military rhetoric may seem odd coming from a bureaucrat
known for his natty bow ties and fondness for bird-watching. But
with Hong Kong suffering through its worst economic downturn since
World War II, Sir Donald has restyled himself as the man who would
keep the barbarians at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he is taking his act abroad. Sunday, Sir Donald is
scheduled to start a three-week tour of Europe and the United
States to try to persuade policy makers and investors that Hong
Kong has not abandoned the free market. It will be a tough sell,
given that the intervention has been deplored by investors and
criticized by officials like Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I'm going to the United States,'' Sir Donald said
in an interview. ``That's why I'm stopping in practically all the
financial centers on earth. The purpose of my trip is to explain
our case.''
</P>
<P>
   His case, simply put, is that the intervention was a necessary
response to hedge funds, which were cynically manipulating Hong
Kong's currency and stock markets. If the government had not
thwarted these speculators, the argument goes, they would have
devastated the market.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to buying shares, Sir Donald has curtailed
short-selling and the trading of futures contracts. He said the
restrictions would restore order to a market that had become so
unfettered that it was seen as an easy mark for outsiders seeking
to capitalize on Hong Kong's fixed exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Donald would seem the perfect candidate to plead Hong Kong's
case. A 53-year-old native of Hong Kong, he has spent his entire
career as a bureaucrat dealing with finance and trade issues. He is
the ultimate product of a British civil service that transformed
Hong Kong from a trading post into a center of global finance.
</P>
<P>
   But it is this very lifelong tenure in government that some
critics say blinds Sir Donald to day-to-day realities of
international finance.
</P>
<P>
   They also say Sir Donald's prickly nature has led him to
overreact. ``Whenever there is a run on the Hong Kong dollar or the
stock market, he takes it as a personal affront,'' said Yeung Wai
Hong, the publisher of Next, a muckraking Hong Kong magazine. ``He
feels the need to avenge it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeung said Sir Donald had squandered a hefty chunk of Hong
Kong's foreign reserves. But more than that, Yeung and others fear
that the policy is fueling a xenophobia in Hong Kong similar to
that in Malaysia, which recently imposed capital controls on its
markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong government ``has drummed up anti-foreigner
feelings, reminiscent of the Boxer Rebellion,'' said Martin Lee,
the territory's most prominent pro-democracy politician.
</P>
<P>
   People who know Sir Donald said his zeal in defending Hong Kong
is rooted in his background. The son of a policeman, he joined the
civil service in 1967 without going to college. He rose through the
ranks and was chosen to attend Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government.
</P>
<P>
   By 1985, Sir Donald was overseeing implementation of the
Sino-British Joint Declaration, which set terms for Hong Kong's
handover to China.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Sir Donald became the first ethnic Chinese to be named
financial secretary, the third-ranking post in Hong Kong. And just
before last year's handover, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth. He
was then retained by Tung Chee-hwa, Hong Kong's Beijing-appointed
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sir Donald is proud of his knighthood, it is a
distinctly dubious honor in a Communist-controlled city-state. He
does not, for example, attach it to his name in official
publications.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Donald may stand at an awkward crossroads between British
Hong Kong and Chinese Hong Kong. But colleagues say he has the
steadfast support of Tung, the public backing of Beijing and
soaring public approval ratings.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing that unhinges Sir Donald is the suggestion
that he is turning Hong Kong into another Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a nationalistic issue; it is simply a monetary and
financial issue,'' he said. ``So it's a bit unfair to tar my name
with some other foreign leaders who might have a different notion.
Sorry, I'm getting indiscreet again.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Mothers bathed their babies in the sinks,'' Helen
Schulman was saying softly. She was reading from a book on a
battered lectern placed before a ratty framed picture of paraders
in Red Square. ``Hershleder could believe this,'' she continued.
</P>
<P>
   The rapt audience facing her was frozen in concentration until a
yawping, wailing firetruck clattered past the second-floor window.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schulman paused. The siren receded. ``There, like here, was
a place to come in out of the cold, the rain, the heat,'' she
resumed, reading from ``The Revisionist,'' her new novel. Ms.
Schulman spoke hypnotically and without amplification, bringing the
audience firmly back to the words. After all, it was reading night
at the KGB Bar in the East Village in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Soviet memorabilia crowded the walls about them. Ashtrays were
overflowing. Red Stripe and Guinness were being consumed in this
decaf-latte-free zone, a dark, smoky watering hole at 85 East
Fourth St.near Second Avenue, across the street from La Mama
Experimental Theater Company.
</P>
<P>
   If downtown is the city's hothouse of literary fiction, ``KGB is
at the heart of what's going on right now,'' said Fran diLustro
Gordon, founder of the tonier reading series at the National Arts
Club on Gramercy Park South. ``They have the best of contemporary
American literature, and the audiences are full of young writers
just beginning their own journeys.''
</P>
<P>
   And lately, what began as a grungy salon of the downtown lit
pack has begun to develop an outsized reputation. Not only is its
claustrophobic space frequently overwhelmed by crowds spilling into
the ancient tiled hallway and down the stairs, but KGB has
burnished its own mystique with the publication this month of ``The
KGB Bar Reader.'' The anthology of 28 stories was edited by Ken
Foster, the curator of the reading series, and it is already in its
second printing.
</P>
<P>
   In this virtual age, ``there is a hunger among audiences to see
writers in the flesh now,'' said Laurie Stone, a cultural critic at
The Village Voice who is coordinating her own new reading series at
the Bat Theater Company in TriBeCa.
</P>
<P>
   There are thousands of auctorial readings in the five boroughs
every year: nearly two dozen just about every night solely in the
city's literary superstores, including the 18 Barnes &AMP; Noble
emporiums, the two Borders Books and Music stores, and the Tower
Records Bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   The reading roster is swelled by dozens of events at public
libraries, universities and other institutions ranging from the
60-year-old mother-of-all-series at the 92nd Street Y to sessions
at galleries, theaters, cafes and a legion of impromptu spaces that
include public parks.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the others inhabit a former Ukrainian social club
that was once a meeting place for Cold War Communists and
socialists. On the walls are Stalinist woodcuts, World War II
Communist anti-Nazi posters, a picture of Valentina V. Tereshkova
(the first woman in space), hammer-and-sickle flags and the odd
Lenin bust and balalaika.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the bar's artifacts had been stored in the building;
they were dusted off to serve night-owl capitalism as emblems of
retro Commie chic. Initially this dismayed some of the leftward
literary grazers, for these days, the bar is better read than Red.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my very first drink here with my father when I was 5,''
said Denis Woychuk, the bar's principal owner, who leases three
other floors of the red-brick building, excluding the offices of
the Ukrainian-American League, which still functions in the
basement.
</P>
<P>
   The league operated the building as a private social club from
1948 to 1988. Woychuk's father once worked for the league, and the
second-floor space was the social club's bar. Like everyone else in
the joint, Woychuk has his own literary resume as the author of two
children's books and a memoir of his work as a lawyer for the
mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   KGB's noirish past also included a stint as a speak-easy, the
Palm Casino, under the control of Lucky Luciano. ``We have
carefully fostered the rumor that Lucky hung out there all the
time,'' said Melvin Jules Bukiet, a part owner of KGB, who teaches
creative writing at Sarah Lawrence College and has written two
novels and two collections of stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my favorite place to read,'' said Rick Moody, author of
``The Ice Storm,'' who has taken the lectern there four times. In
comparison with other places, KGB is ``casual and more open to
experimentation and spontaneous magic,'' he said.

 &HT;    Carter Center marks anniversary of accords
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Kurylo
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Twenty years ago, President Carter worked a miracle
of sorts: He brokered the Camp David Accords, a breakthrough in
relations between Israel and Egypt that offered new hope for
calming tensions in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the former president celebrated the occasion with a
couple hundred friends and representatives of the Israeli and
Egyptian governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes many approaches and many innovative ideas and a great
deal of human courage ... to bring about a step toward peace,''
Carter told the crowd at an invitation-only gathering to mark the
opening of a new exhibit, ``Camp David: Historic Grounds for
Peace,'' at the Museum of the Jimmy Carter Library.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years after the accords ``not a single word of that peace
treaty has been violated on either side,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said he is still an optimist about peace in the Middle
East. ``I still say so, and I say because Israeli mothers want
peace and the Palestinians' mothers want peace and the Lebanese
mothers want peace and the Syrian mothers want peace. To me that is
the foundation of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit, which opens to the public today and continues until
April 11, takes visitors inside a Camp David cabin. It also
includes the White House desk on which the accords were signed and
a life-size re-creation of the key participants in achieving the
deal: Carter and former Israeli and Egyptian leaders Menachem Begin
and Anwar Sadat.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's gathering and again today, the Marine One
presidential helicopter also will be on display outside the museum.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit opening was one of several appearances by Carter
during the day.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, he met with Blaise Compaore, president of the West
African nation of Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
   Compaore, who is chairman of the Organization of African States,
briefed Carter on conflicts on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came to tell him that it is not time as yet for him to
retire from public life,'' Compaore said. Later, Carter and his
wife, Rosalynn, discussed their international work during a town
hall meeting at the Carter Center.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first in a series of four programs called
``Conversations at the Carter Center,'' designed to increase
awareness of national and global issues. Tickets for each event are
$6 per person. For more information, call 404-420-3804.

 &HT;    PAX TV special features book on biblical 'secrets'
 &HT;    By Marguerite M. Plunkett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- PAX TV will air an original special,
Secrets of Bible Code Revealed, based on a book that claims the
Bible includes buried information on events of the past, present
and future.
</P>
<P>
   The West Palm Beach-based network, which parent Paxson
Communications (AMEX: PAX, $9.75) launched last month, will air the
two-hour special from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. Oct. 30, according to
Paxson.
</P>
<P>
   The company declined to reveal how much the special would cost.
Producers are Chuck Sellier and Dave Balsiger of Grizzly Adams
Productions, spokeswoman Lea Sloan said.
</P>
<P>
   The special explores the ``revelations'' from Michael Drosnin's
best-selling book, The Bible Code, according to a Paxson release.
It will ``inform, inspire and entertain viewers of all ages,
allowing them to form their own opinions,'' said Bill Scott, Paxson
programming president.
</P>
<P>
   Drosnin's book says the original Hebrew text of the first five
books of the Bible gives the names of rabbis who lived centuries
later as well as modern-day assassinations when decoded by
computer.
</P>
<P>
   It foretells events, including the assassination of President
John F. Kennedy and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, plus the circumstances
surrounding the death of Princess Diana, according to the Paxson
release.
</P>
<P>
   PAX is built on a foundation of rerun programming including
Touched by an Angel, Diagnosis Murder and Dr. Quinn, Medicine
Woman. The network runs Worship programming overnight, which shows
images of nature run while running scripture.
</P>
<P>
   The programming is distributed on 95 owned, operated and
affiliated stations as well as cable throughout the country.
WPXP-Channel 67 is Paxson's West Palm Beach station.

 NEW YORK: he said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the four-year-old KGB series draws boldface fiction writers
and memoirists such as Junot Diaz (``Drown''), A.M. Homes (``The
End of Alice'') and Kathryn Harrison (``The Kiss''), it also
highlights newcomers like Jaime Clark and David Ryan. They met as
writing students at Bennington College in Vermont and will be
reading together on Nov. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the draw is KGB's status as a neighborhood bar,
beckoning with its scuzzy red-and-blue-neon sign, one flight up the
marble treads worn down by generations of Ukrainians. KGB gets its
share of bikers and roistering fraternity pals who join the bar's
garden-variety downtown pan-artistic clientele of academic types,
painters, would-be filmmakers, actor gonnabes and assorted
word-workers. KGB is the kind of place that requires a bouncer for
its tough early-hours weekend crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Readings at KGB (which also has a poetry series and nonfiction
authors events) are free; no one, from the writers to Foster, gets
paid. ``The only ones taking in any money are the bartenders,''
said Woychuk, 45, who of course shares in the take.
</P>
<P>
   But the intimate, 800-square-foot club is scouted by editors and
agents, and a successful appearance can build the kind of buzz that
starts careers. Among the writers who have landed publishing
contracts after reading at KGB are Diaz, Lowell Handler, Elissa
Schappell and Joanna Greenfield.
</P>
<P>
   Though there have never been reading-related fisticuffs in the
bar itself, KGB has been the scene of two quasi-legendary
altercations between Gordon Lish, the fiction editor and literary
gadabout, and Bukiet. Both traded insults in shouting matches that
upstaged the readers they were supposedly introducing.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the memorable Thomas Pynchon ``Imitators
Contest'' evening last year, offering Pynchonesque readings as a
celebration of the publication of the reclusive author's
long-awaited novel, ``Mason and Dixon.'' A writer for The Times of
London, James Bone, thought he spotted the real Pynchon at KGB; but
he found a gentleman in floppy hat and sunglasses to be, well, an
imitator.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after a feverish binge of detection, Bone ultimately
tracked down the man he contended was the real Pynchon in
Manhattan. He ambushed the man on the street with a camera, and
presented the resulting picture as the first to be taken of Pynchon
since 1955. ``I felt very personally sad that our event may have
led to the outing of Pynchon,'' Bukiet said.
</P>
<P>
   If there has been tumult, there has been connectedness as well.
Three years ago Marc Aronson, a senior editor at Henry Holt &AMP; Co.
who often comes to KGB to scout new talent, took a writer, Marina
Budhos, to a reading at the bar on their first date. ``Let's say it
was intellectually intense and romantic,'' Ms. Budhos said. So
romantic that they married a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   At KGB the crowds are usually attentive and supportive, but
``someone threw up during one of my readings once,'' said Dani
Shapiro, who teaches writing at Columbia University and the New
School and was the scheduled cleanup hitter after Ms. Schulman at
that night's reading lineup. ``I didn't take it personally.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, KGB and other reading venues are the showroom floors of
the nation's proliferating university writing programs, ``which
produce so many graduates waving all these stories in the air,'' as
one KGB regular (who insisted on anonymity) put it.
</P>
<P>
   As literary spectators in good standing, some audience members
feel free to trash the series. ``They have too many memoirists,''
said one visitor at a recent reading, Erik DuRon, 28, who toils in
a bookstore and who has been to a dozen KGB sessions. ``I think of
all that as the `poor me' school of writing.''
</P>
<P>
   If some ever-envious downtown transgressive types snipe that KGB
is establishment-endangered these days, the bar is still a very
long way from slick. ``We're kind of bozos,'' Bukiet said. ``We
can't even get a mailing list together.''
</P>
<P>
   But will success spoil KGB? ``Interesting question,'' said
Bukiet, as Ms. Shapiro took the lectern to read from her new book,
``Slow Motion.'' Bukiet laughed. ``Perhaps we can only hope so.''

GE AGREES TO CLEAN PART OF TAINTED RIVER IN MASSACHUSETTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The General Electric Co. has agreed to spend $150
million to $200 million to clean up a contaminated stretch of river
in western Massachusetts in a settlement that federal regulators
described Thursday as a significant victory for the environment and
a city.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the deal, the company and the Environmental
Protection Agency said removing sediment laden with PCBs from an
abandoned electric-transformer plant would rejuvenate a two-mile
stretch of the Housatonic River and the city it flows through,
Pittsfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement apparently ends months of negotiations that began
some two decades after industrialists and regulators alike
recognized that PCBs, polychlorinated biphenyls, once widely used
in manufacturing, were dangerous to human health and might cause
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Carol M. Browner, who heads the environmental agency, said an
economic redevelopment package that GE had agreed to as part of the
deal would help return prosperity as well as environmental safety
to Pittsfield, an economically ailing city of about 50,000 people
in the Berkshires.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, GE said in a statement by Stephen D. Ramsey, its
vice president for corporate environmental programs, that it was
``pleased to enter a new phase of investing in the future of
Pittsfield and Berkshire County.''
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the Pittsfield agreement seemed to invite
comparisons with the environmental agency's continuing battle
against GE over PCB contamination of the Hudson River from two
abandoned plants in Fort Edward and Glens Falls, but people
familiar with both cases cautioned that they were far from
parallel.
</P>
<P>
   They are vastly different in scale (2 miles of the Housatonic
will be cleaned; some experts say about 40 miles of the Hudson
should be dredged), and the Hudson River case is in a much earlier
stage: the EPA may not announce its long-range plan for cleaning up
the river until December 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the Hudson cleanup could be far higher if the most
radical proposals, including dredging many miles of contaminated
riverbed, are carried out. GE has insisted that leaving the tainted
sediment alone might be safer than removing it.
</P>
<P>
   The Housatonic was fouled around Pittsfield by a GE complex that
opened more than a half-century ago, employed about 13,000 workers
at its peak and closed in the early 1980s when the company quit
making large electric transformers, company spokesmen said
Thursday. (GE has a separate plastics unit in Pittsfield that
employs about 700.)
</P>
<P>
   Company officials often point out that many companies used PCBs
before their hazardous nature was recognized, and disposed of them
in ways that were legal then, like letting waste flow into rivers.
At Pittsfield, PCBs were used in liquid that seemed an ideal
replacement for the flammable mineral oil, which was once used in
transformers, said Bruce Bunch, a GE spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The Housatonic accord, which lawyers on both sides expect to be
spelled out in a consent decree in federal court before winter,
calls for GE to divert the worst stretch of river, a half-mile
section that flows through the 250-acre plant complex, remove the
tainted sediment and put the river back on its original course.
</P>
<P>
   Tainted sediment will also be removed from a separate
one-and-a-half-mile stretch downstream, though the environmental
agency will bear some of that cost. GE has agreed to restore soil
and vegetation to damaged riverbanks and to pay some $15 million to
bolster the surrounding wildlife habitat. GE will tear down some
buildings in the old complex and refurbish others before turning
them over to Pittsfield for new development.
</P>
<P>
   Bunch estimated the total cost to General Electric at $150
million, but an environmental agency official said it could top
$200 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can do it in less, God bless them,'' this official
said.
</P>
<P>
   The accord averted use of the Superfund law, under which the
government could have done the cleanup, then billed GE. John De
Villars, the agency administrator for New England, said the
agreement carried ``a spiritual and psychic value'' for all
parties, one ``that can't be quantified but is every bit as
important as the substantial financial and economic factors.''
</P>
<P>
   But if this settlement produces good will, it seems likely to be
tested. GE is liable for more than 70 cleanups under the Superfund
law, including the mammoth Hudson River project.

SEX ADDICTS FLOCK TO THERA PISTS IN WAKE OF CLINTON LEWINSKY
TRYST 
</HEADLINE>
 ADDICTS-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIE AMPARANO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Sex therapist Patrick Carnes barely has time for lunch
these days. Seeking to escape shame and ruin, sex addicts across
the country are flocking to his Wickenburg clinic and other
renowned sex therapy practices in the state.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt about it. President Clinton's tawdry trysts with Monica
Lewinsky are making people question their own sexual digressions
and seek help for them. Ralph Earle, of Psychological Counseling
Services, alone has witnessed a 25 percent increase in such visits
to his Scottsdale practice.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,000 miles from the White House sex scandal, Arizona
is feeling the fallout. That's because the Grand Canyon state has a
little-known distinction: It's an international mecca for sex
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of healing that goes on in Arizona,'' said
Robert Weiss, a board member of the National Council on Sexual
Addiction and Compulsivity and clinical director of the Sexual
Recovery Institute in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   At Psychological Counseling Services in Scottsdale, people from
as far away as India have come to cure their sexual addictions. The
Meadows treatment center in Wickenburg routinely admits people from
Europe, Mexico, Canada and other countries. &UR; In southern Arizona,
Sierra Tucson also gets people from all over the country for sexual
addiction problems. Around the country, self-help groups such as
Sexaholics Anonymous, Sex &AMP; Love Addicts Anonymous and Sex Addicts
Anonymous are witnessing a surge.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people are talking about sexual addiction, and more
people are seeking help for it,'' said Erik Sachs of Sex &AMP; Love
Addicts Anonymous, with headquarters in Boston and chapters
throughout Arizona. ``President Clinton and the media have raised
the awareness.''
</P>
<P>
   At a program for sex addicts in the Phoenix area, two people
leave the meeting for a few minutes to discuss their illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to ruin my life like Clinton,'' said a middle-age
man, who had a $1,500-a-month strip-joint habit. His
single-mindedness, he confessed, nearly drove him to financial ruin
and led to the break-up of his marriage. ``You can see the same
thing happening to Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Another recovering sex addict contends his cravings for ecstasy
caused him to lose his job. He knew it was dangerous territory,
indulging in cyber sex and Internet pornography on the job. But he
was possessed.
</P>
<P>
   The successful manager would ignore his duties, cancel meetings
and retreat to his office where he would indulge in brazen images
and wild promises. The hours quickly slipped by.
</P>
<P>
   Their stories aren't unusual.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Sexual Addiction Problems estimates
that 6 percent to 8 percent of Americans are sex addicts. That's 16
million to 21.5 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Several politicians, movie stars and evangelists have
acknowledged being sex addicts after being caught in compromising
positions.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Clinton adviser Dick Morris admitted that he was a
sex addict after a national tabloid published pictures of him with
a prostitute. Michael Kennedy made a similar confession when news
of his relationship with his baby-sitter hit the newsstands.
</P>
<P>
   Is President Clinton part of that group? Since he hasn't been
treated, no one knows for sure. But therapists, sex addicts and
researchers say the signs are certainly there.
</P>
<P>
   One word sets sex addicts apart from others: Compulsion.
Ordinary people want to have sex. For sex addicts, it's an
obsession.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, they'll take big gambles to get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll take the risk of losing their job, their family, their
reputation, everything for this rush,'' explained Marilyn Murry, a
sex therapist at Psychological Counseling Services and a professor
at Ottawa University. ``No matter what anyone tells them. They'll
continue to do it. No matter the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Council on Sexual Addiction &AMP; Compulsivity defines
sexual addiction as ``persistent and escalating patterns of sexual
behavior acted out despite increasing negative consequences to self
and others.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnes, the Clinical Director of Sexual Disorders at the
Meadows, puts it like this: A sex addict is a person preoccupied
with sexual thoughts, compulsive sexual behavior and then feelings
of despair and shame until the cycle begins again.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the cycle can be broken if people seek help,'' said
Carnes, who wrote the first book on sexual addiction in 1983. He
coined the term ``sex addict'' and is considered to be the nation's
leading expert on sexual disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Murry breaks sexual addiction into four levels. The first is
characterized by compulsive masturbation, usually accompanied with
pornography. The second is marked by multiple affairs, strip clubs,
multiple or anonymous partners, frequent phone- or cyber-sex and
prostitutes. The third level includes sex with an unwilling
partner, obscene phone calls, flashing, voyeurism. The fourth
level: rape, molestation, sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, none of these activities individually suggests
addiction, explains Earle, of Psychological Counseling Services and
author of ``Lonely All'' ``the Time,'' a book on sexual addiction.
</P>
<P>
   What distinguishes sexual addiction, he says, is the inability
to stop an ongoing _ and usually escalating _ pattern of
self-destructive sexual behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Clinton is a sex addict, and I can't say that he is since I
haven't treated him, then he would be at level two,'' Murry said.
</P>
<P>
   Sex addict or not, President Clinton's sexual escapades are
having a lucrative impact on the sexual addiction field.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the long-simmering debate over whether sex
addiction is really a disease is being opening discussed now.
</P>
<P>
   Many people haven't recognize sexual addiction as an illness. In
fact, sexual addiction still is not defined _ or even mentioned _
in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
considered to be the definitive mental-health reference book.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the controversy stems from the fact that no one has
proven a chemical cause of sexual addiction. Drugs and alcohol are
known to trigger addiction by causing measurable changes in the
brain chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   But specialists believe that unknown changes in brain chemistry
do cause sex addicts to become addicted to the chemical arousal,
the rush of adrenalin, rising heart rate, sweaty palms.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss, of the National Council on Sexual Addiction and
Compulsivity, compares it to gambling addiction, which is listed in
the mental-health reference book.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only a matter of time before sexual addiction makes it
into the book,'' he predicted. ``People have to recognize that
sexual arousal has far more potent stimulus than gambling.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnes says sexual addiction is where alcoholism was ``25 or 30
years ago. It was difficult for people to see that alcoholism was a
disease.''
</P>
<P>
   But to truly be cured, therapists and addiction experts say sex
addicts must come to terms with the void or pain they are trying to
mask. Others need to recognize that addiction runs in their family.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of an addictive personality run through President
Clinton's family. Brother Roger was addicted to cocaine. His
mother, Virginia Kelley, gambled. Grandmother Edith used morphine.
</P>
<P>
   But society also contributes to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   S. Lee Spencer, an associate professor of sexuality and sexual
functioning, says there are few examples of healthy, normal
intimacy on television, movie screens and now in many songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're normalizing behavior that goes along with sexual
addiction,'' she said. ``By seeing so many instances of it, people
begin to think that it's OK, it's normal, when it's not.'' &QL;

CART SUFFERS SERIOUS BLOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL SCHLOTTER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The FedEx Championship Auto Racing Teams series will survive and
race again next season. The world will continue to turn, the sun
and moon will rise and set.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday's long-expected announcement that Alex Zanardi will
leave the series next season to return to Formula One racing was
not good news for open-wheel racing in America.
</P>
<P>
   Just three years after losing its premier event, the
Indianapolis 500, the CART series has lost Zanardi, its two-time
champion and reigning star. And with the pending retirement of
Bobby Rahal and the recent sub-championship performances of former
stars Michael Andretti and Al Unser Jr., CART is left a tour much
in need of an identity.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there are some fine racers out there. Zanardi's teammate
Jimmy Vasser is a proven winner. Andretti still runs at the front
on occasion. And young drivers like Greg Moore, Dario Franchitti
and Bryan Herta might become dominating champions and household
names.
</P>
<P>
   But mention the names of most CART drivers to any but diehard
fans and prepare for blank stares.``Mauricio who? Gil de where?''
They know the cars, but they can't put a face on the guys who drive
them.
</P>
<P>
   In his three short years on the circuit, the 31-year-old Zanardi
was becoming the answer to that marketing dilemma. With his
aggressive _ reckless at times _ style and his flamboyant
postvictory doughnuts, Zanardi and his red Target racer gave the
tour its identity.
</P>
<P>
   CART will miss him far more than he will miss it.
</P>
<P>
   And as NASCAR tightens its grip on the mantle as America's No.1
racing tour, CART, once the most recognized racing tour in the
world, desperately needs a new star and a quick return to the
fading limelight still generated by the Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   __ U.S. Grand Prix in Indy?: Broadcast and published reports
from Indianapolis claim the Indianapolis Motor Speedway is close to
a deal to bring Formula One racing back to the United States,
possibly by September 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's Indianapolis Star, citing an unnamed source close to
the negotiations, said the Speedway and Formula One have a spoken
agreement to stage the U.S. Grand Prix in September 2000 on a new
$15 million 2.5-mile road course to be built for the event. The
Speedway is also required to post $10 million to host the event,
the Star reported.
</P>
<P>
   The last Formula One event held in the U.S. was in Phoenix in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   __ Formula for drama: Mika Hakkinen and Michael Schumacher are
tied for the Formula One points lead heading into Sunday's
Luxembourg Grand Prix with only November's race in Japan remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Although both drivers have 80 points, Hakkinen could wrap up his
first tour title with a win Sunday while scenarios resulting in
Schumacher's third championship can't play out until Japan. To take
the title, Hakkinen must finish first and hope Schumacher winds up
short of the top six point positions.
</P>
<P>
   A Schumacher win would leave him short of clinching the title
regardless of Hakkinen's finish since Hakkinen has a tiebreaker
advantage in having finished second twice this season to
Schumacher's once. Both drivers have six wins.
</P>
<P>
   __ NBC tunes in NASCAR: With the addition of NBC last week,
NASCAR now has contractual agreements with six networks to
broadcast its stock car racing.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's initial premier effort comes on Nov. 13-14 next year with
the inaugural Busch Grand National and Winston Cup events at
Homestead, Fla. Officials of NBC, which recently lost the rights to
American Conference NFL games, said NASCAR racing was their first
choice to fill the void.
</P>
<P>
   __ Making the pass: Busch Grand National points leader Dale
Earnhardt Jr. is on his way to joining his dad on the Winston Cup
circuit. He's also on his way to joining him as a millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old namesake son of seven-time Winston Cup champion
Dale Earnhardt signed a five-year contract with Budweiser this week
to sponsor his Chevy Monte Carlo in Winston Cup races through 2004.
The deal has been reported to pay Earnhardt Jr. around $10 million
a year.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt Jr. will continue to drive full-time next year on the
Busch Tour _ where he leads the points chase by 150 points over
Matt Kenseth _ but will make five starts for Budweiser on the
Winston Cup circuit. Beginning in 2000, he will run full-time on
the Winston Cup tour for Budweiser.

MARKETS UNNERVED BY BAILOUT OF INVESTMENT FUND  (Eds: See also(mk) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The $3.5 billion rescue of a big, risky investment
fund verging on collapse unnerved markets around the world
Thursday, raised a clamor for a government investigation and
created fear that other enormous hidden losses might become evident
in the weeks and months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than contain the problem and bring stability to Wall
Street, the cash infusion late Wednesday by a consortium of banks
and brokerage firms to salvage Long-Term Capital Management LP only
seemed to rattle investors. Banks began to tighten lending
requirements to other investment funds, raising fears of a credit
shortage.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. stocks fell broadly, with the Dow Jones industrial average
losing more than half its 257.21-point gain on Wednesday. Shares of
financial stocks were particularly hard-hit.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital, with a portfolio worth $90 billion, is one of
the best-known hedge funds, financial investments that cater to the
rich and make big and often risky investment bets with the hope of
spectacular returns. The recent turmoil in financial markets,
particularly the collapse in Russia, led to staggering losses for
Long-Term Capital.
</P>
<P>
   Investors tried to absorb not only what had happened to
Long-Term Capital and its founder, the Wall Street bond trader John
Meriwether, but what the deal to salvage the fund meant for markets
now.
</P>
<P>
   As details of Long-Term Capital's fall to earth began to trickle
out and the shock among traders, brokers and bankers began to fade,
worry set in. Members of Congress called for an inquiry into what
went wrong and resentment grew that an elite firm, populated by
industry stars and two Nobel laureates, was saved from a disaster
of its own making.
</P>
<P>
   By midday, it was clear that Long-Term Capital's problems were
not going to be confined to the firm and a few high-roller
investors. The ripple effect started with UBS AG of Switzerland,
Europe's largest bank, which said its risky investments with
Long-Term Capital and ownership stake in the fund would result in
an accounting charge equivalent to $685 million against the bank's
earnings. Its stock fell 10.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Of deep concern to the financial world is what impact the fund's
debacle will have on worldwide bond markets, which have already
been badly shaken by events in emerging markets in the last two
months. Fear of a pullback in lending by major financial
institutions also grew Thursday, as banks were awakened to the
risks in their previous easy-money attitudes toward borrowers. If
difficulty in borrowing money lasted more than a few weeks, it
could cause a significant slowdown in the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   The implications of Meriwether's troubles are great for hedge
funds, which operate relatively freely in world markets with little
oversight from regulators. Many believe that Long-Term's
near-collapse and its effective takeover by big banks and brokers
will translate into increased client nervousness and rising
redemptions of shares at other firms. For funds operating in the
already damaged bond market, redemptions would cause a continued
drop in the value of those portfolios. And if some of these areas
sustain further damage, like high-yield bonds, heavy redemptions
could damage plain-vanilla mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is worry on Wall Street that the debacle will
bring increased scrutiny by regulators to hedge funds. Rep. John
LaFalce, D-N.Y., the ranking minority member of the House Banking
Committee, said Thursday that ``the virtual collapse and bailout of
Long-Term Capital Management makes clear that the banking committee
must continue its inquiry into potential risks posed by any gaps in
the regulation of hedge funds.'' He said he would call on Rep. Jim
Leach, R-Iowa, the chairman, ``to do precisely that.''
</P>
<P>
   The specter of Long-Term's near-failure is not going away any
time soon. Indeed, it will dog the financial industry through at
least the end of the year. Traders said the possibility that its
$90 billion portfolio might be sold would keep much of the
fixed-income markets frozen. If the Federal Reserve cuts interest
rates next Tuesday, as many expect, that would hurt many of
Long-Term Capital's trades, which were bets on higher rates.
</P>
<P>
   An immediate reaction to Long-Term's woes was that major banks
and brokerage firms began demanding increased margins, or partial
payments from their hedge fund customers on new trades.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the details of the bailout were being firmed up. Late
in the day, investors in the fund were waiting to hear where they
stood. It is expected that existing investors will end up with 10
percent of their original stakes in the firm and that the
consortium of banks and brokers will hold a combined 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   An oversight committee with representatives from the banks will
direct overall strategy at Long-Term Capital. In one of the many
paradoxes attending the crisis, Meriwether will be reporting to
people who were, in some cases, very junior traders on his desk at
Salomon Brothers in the 1980s.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In addition to the shock on Wall Street that Meriwether's
best-and-brightest firm had almost closed, there was also anger
that the firm was not allowed to fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public-policy implications of such a bailout are
considerable and very negative,'' said Stephen Modzelewski, a hedge
fund manager at the Watermark Group in Princeton, N.J., and a
former Salomon trader. ``To rescue a large, overly risky hedge fund
can only encourage other hedge funds to increase their risk
profiles to imprudent levels and to discourage global financial
institutions from requiring prudent margins from their large hedge
fund customers.''
</P>
<P>
   A former Federal Reserve chairman, Paul Volcker, also expressed
doubt about the idea of the U.S. central bank moving to help save
Long-Term Capital, a risk-taking securities-trading operation.
Bloomberg News reported that in a speech in Boston, Volcker asked,
``Why should the weight of the federal government be brought to
bear to help out a private investor?''
</P>
<P>
   A week before the Long-Term bailout was negotiated at the
headquarters of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Alan
Greenspan, the Fed chairman, testified to Congress that bankers
knew exactly what they were doing in the policing of hedge funds,
and their attendant risks. On Sept. 16, he assured Rep. Richard
Baker, R-La., that risk in hedge fund lending was well under
control.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant question that remains unanswered is what
impact the rescue of Long-Term Capital will have on world markets
and on the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   While the deal between Long-Term Capital and its creditors put
an end to rumors of impending crisis that had plagued the firm in
recent weeks, it did nothing to inject badly needed money into the
non-Treasury fixed-income markets. If anything, the fact that the
portfolio of money-losing trades still exists added to a view that
the market is paralyzed and will remain so for quite some time.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Long-Term says the $3.5 billion infusion will allow
it to keep its trades in place until they work, the widespread
belief on Wall Street is that these things are for sale. For
investors who want to sell their high-yield bonds, emerging-market
debt, convertible securities and even some mortgage-backed issues,
there is still no place to go. As the year's end approaches and
hedge funds and dealer firms in these securities try to get out,
the market may get even less liquid than it is now.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the higher-quality markets will likely recover, however,
from current, beaten-down levels. This includes AA-rated corporate
bonds, some U.S. government agency issues and zero-coupon
Treasuries. Riskier issues will stay in the doghouse.
</P>
<P>
   But a great concern that has emerged from the Long-Term Capital
debacle is that it may result in a protracted reduction in credit
available to businesses. Even though they have been warned by
regulators for months, banks tend to require a disaster of this
magnitude to awaken to the risks involved in lax lending. Borrowing
will be harder to obtain, and to the degree that the economy's
growth has been fueled by credit, that growth may now be stunted.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Peabody, an analyst with Mitchell Securities, said he
feared a recession in such a credit squeeze. ``Regulators are going
to go into the examination process at banks and begin identifying
specific risk areas and require more capital against them,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the gloom on Wall Street Thursday, there was gallows humor.
One trader said he soon expected to see someone wearing a sandwich
board that read, ``Will Manage Market-Neutral Hedge Fund for
Food.''

POLL FINDS MANY FANS ROOTING FOR A MCGWIRE-SOSA TIE

   Sammy Sosa's two home runs Wednesday, matching Mark McGwire's
total of 65, no doubt pleased the many Americans who would like to
see this year's pursuit of the home run title end in a tie.
According to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll, 26 percent of
adults would like to see McGwire hold the record for most home runs
at the end of the season, 15 percent would prefer that Sosa end up
with the most, and 42 percent would rather they finish in a tie.
</P>
<P>
   The pursuit and eclipse of Roger Maris' 37-year-old record
appears to have rekindled Americans' interest in baseball.
Two-thirds of adults said they were interested in the game,
compared with 42 percent in a Times poll conducted at the same time
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the baseball strike, I lost interest in following the
Braves, but the home run race has been interesting to watch,'' said
Scott Holtzclaw, a 40-year-old fan from Douglasville, Ga., who was
reinterviewed after this year's poll was completed.
</P>
<P>
   The latest poll shows the highest percentage of baseball fans
since the Times and CBS News first asked a question about interest
in the game in 1985. Twenty-two percent of the adults questioned
said they were very interested in watching or following baseball,
and 41 percent said they were somewhat interested. The national
poll, conducted by telephone Sept. 22-23 with 960 adults, has a
margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The race for the home run title is seen as compelling. ``It's
definitely made the game more exciting,'' said Michelle Mobraten,
26, a homemaker from Burlington, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The home run race has really caught my attention,'' said
Joseph Carthey, of Spring Grove, Minn. The 43-year-old teacher said
about Mark McGwire, ``If you're looking for really authentic
heroes, I would say he fits that mold.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to McGwire and Sosa, Holtzclaw said: ``Both those
players are classy guys. They both deserve to win the title.''

ERNST RUDOLPH JAAKSON, 93, ESTONIAN DIPLOMAT-IN-EXILE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARBARA STEWART   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ernst Rudolph Jaakson, the ambassador from Estonia
who maintained a consulate in New York after the Soviet Union
absorbed the country, died on Sept. 4 in New York, the Estonian
Consulate said. He was 93, and had been a diplomat for 75 years _
the longest-serving diplomat in the world, according to the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Jaakson was revered by his fellow Estonians for being an
ambassador without a country and for making the consulate in
Rockefeller Center a symbol of freedom in the decades that the
country was a part of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   In those years, he represented Estonia's interests before the
government and businesses of the United States and broadcast
messages of hope on the Voice of America. He also continued to
issue Estonian passports, leftovers from its years as a free
nation, which ended in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   Jaakson passports, as they came to be known, were honored by
many Western countries, including the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The admiration of Estonians for Jaakson was exhibited by Lennart
Meri, the current president of Estonia, during a New York visit in
the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   He made his way to Rockefeller Center, according to the center's
magazine, and went to the 14th floor, to the offices of the
Estonian consulate. But rather than enter, he stood in the hall,
gazing silently at the consulate's black door. After a while he
rode the elevator back down. He did not want to bother Jaakson, he
later explained. It was enough to see the door of the consulate
Jaakson had maintained for so long.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Riga, Latvia, in 1905, Jaakson was a teen-ager when he
began working part time at the Estonian Consulate there, cleaning
and organizing the files. After he studied at the University of
Latvia and the University of Tartu in Estonia, the consulate sent
him to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In 1932, three years after coming to America, he moved to New
York, where he helped to open the consulate. He also earned a
degree in economics from Columbia University, graduating in 1934.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Estonia won back its independence and he was made
ambassador to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Claire, died earlier. There are no survivors.

WITH ALMOST 200 DEAD IN CARIBBEAN, STORM HEADS TOWARD FLORIDA
KEYS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MIAMI _ As the death toll from Hurricane Georges's rampage
through the Caribbean rose to nearly 200, the storm crossed Cuba
Thursday, turned northward and took aim at southern Florida, where
750,000 people were advised to evacuate mobile homes and low-lying
coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
   At least 125 of the deaths were reported in the Dominican
Republic, where workers recovered 76 bodies Thursday from a river
in San Juan de la Maguana, 120 miles west of the capital, Santo
Domingo. Earlier, at least 45 people in the town of San Cristobal
were killed when the walls of a school being used as a shelter
collapsed in flood waters.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dominican Republic and Haiti, which share the island of
Hispaniola, hundreds of people were missing and feared dead. Leonel
Fernandez, president of the Dominican Republic, said the storm had
left more than 100,000 people homeless and severely damaged sugar,
banana, rice and coffee crops that were nearly ready for harvest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a national tragedy,'' Fernandez said in a
televised address to the country's 7.5 million people. ``We face a
titanic task.''
</P>
<P>
   The airport in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, was closed
because of damage to the control tower and terminals. It was
uncertain when it would reopen, but the earliest estimate for
restoration of jet traffic was Sunday, American Airlines said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 3.8 million residents of Puerto Rico were reported
still to be without electricity and water. The local telephone
company said 339,000 of its customers had no long-distance service,
making communication with relatives in the continental United
States difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Some shops and restaurants have reopened, using generators as
their power source, and the government said it hoped to restore
power to half the island by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, officials reported two dead from the hurricane, both
electrocutions because of downed power lines. Civil Defense
officials warned residents to expect mudslides and coastal flooding
in the eastern part of the island up to Cayo Coco, a small island
popular with tourists north of Ciego de Avila in central Cuba, and
urged them to avoid the streets.
</P>
<P>
   About 370,000 people had been evacuated to safer areas in the
eastern provinces, but some had begun returning home Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Government television showed some rivers overrunning their banks
after seven hours of rain, cutting off some municipalities and
flooding nearby housing. Power was out in many areas.
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday, the energy expended by Hurricane Georges in its
four-day rampage across Puerto Rico, Hispaniola and Cuba appeared
to have exhausted the storm. But as the hurricane moved back out
over the warm waters of the Caribbean, it gained force, and
meteorologists warned that it could strengthen to a Category 3
storm, with winds over 125 miles per hour, by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   With the storm gaining speed and strength as it moved toward the
Florida Straits, forecasters predicted that the eye would strike
the Florida Keys early Friday. From Miami to Tampa, millions of
residents rushed to complete their storm preparations in
anticipation of that landfall and the flooding and destruction that
are expected to accompany it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1992, we weren't as ready for Hurricane Andrew as we should
have been, and I vowed not to let that happen again,'' said Lisa de
Grandy as she loaded plywood into a van outside a home-supply store
here this morning. ``It's tense in there, like a scavenger hunt,
and this is not something I really want to be doing again, but we
want to suffer as little damage as possible this time.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The course Hurricane Georges is thought most likely to follow in
the coming days would take it directly over the lower Keys early
Friday and on into the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of both Miami and Fort Lauderdale awoke Thursday to
find that a hurricane warning had been issued for their
communities, while a hurricane watch was extended northward, to
Longboat Key just south of Tampa Bay on the Gulf Coast and to
Stuart on the Atlantic Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may become a major hurricane, and we need to be ready for
that,'' Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center
here, cautioned Thursday, after radar images indicated the eye of
the storm was reorganizing. ``People really need to count on it
being bad.''
</P>
<P>
   As Hurricane Georges was regrouping, Alex Penelas, the mayor of
Miami-Dade County, which has 2 million residents, issued a decree
for the evacuation of Miami Beach, Key Biscayne and other
communities on barrier islands facing the Atlantic. But the
directive was strictly voluntary, and many residents, especially
young people and those who did not experience Hurricane Andrew,
said they had no intention of complying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been in a hurricane before, but I'm not
panicking,'' said Carolina Aguirre, a 32-year-old teacher and Miami
Beach resident. ``It's more dangerous to leave than to stay, so I
will stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents of mobile homes and trailer parks, many of whom
experienced the full force of Hurricane Andrew and its 150 mph
winds, seemed to be treating a mandatory evacuation order for them
more seriously.
</P>
<P>
   At Fowler's trailer park in southern Miami-Dade County, Xiomara
Lopez, 44, and her family of five were loading an air-conditioner
and clothes into a truck and preparing to leave for a relative's
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``This trailer survived Andrew, but we're not taking any
chances,'' said her daughter, Ayza Corujo, 23. ``We're lucky,
because a lot of the people here are poor and don't have anyplace
to go. We're just praying that our home is still here when we come
back, because we don't have any insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   The evacuation directive also applied to Homestead and Florida
City, both of which were leveled by Hurricane Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are extremely concerned because of the extensive flooding
we believe will be associated with this hurricane,'' Penelas said
Thursday afternoon in explaining the measure and announcing the
opening of public shelters across the county.
</P>
<P>
   James Witt, director of the federal Emergency Management Agency,
said: ``It is the storm surge coming behind the Keys that will have
a lot of the force. We're worried about flooding and crop damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Key West, through which the eye of the storm is expected to
pass, was reported Thursday to be virtually a ghost town, with
tourists having fled and hotels, bars and boutiques along normally
bustling Duval Street closed. The airport was closed this morning,
and a 9 p.m. curfew was ordered for the city and all the rest of
Monroe County.
</P>
<P>
   At Cape Canaveral, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration initially ordered the space shuttle Discovery rolled
back to its hangar, three and a half miles from the Atlantic, but
decided Thursday evening to keep it on its seaside launching pad.
The shuttle had been moved to the pad on Monday for next month's
flight with Sen. John Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels in nearby Orlando were filling rapidly with residents
fleeing threatened areas further south, and MacDill Air Force Base
in Tampa was ordered evacuated.

SEVERAL TOP EXECUTIVES AT YOUNG &AMP; RUBICAM ARE SHIFTED `TO PUT
PEOPLE IN THE RIGHT POSITIONS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A cadre of top executives at Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc. in
New York is being redeployed as the huge agency company seeks to
build on the momentum gained from recent high-profile account
assignments.
</P>
<P>
   The intent is ``to put people in the right positions'' as part
of efforts to ``put together the best of all our crafts to produce
results for our clients,'' said Peter Georgescu, chairman and chief
executive of Y&AMP;R. He discussed the revamping of the executive ranks
in a telephone interview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The new senior management lineup consists of executives who had
previously been identified as among the up-and-coming, hot and
happening leaders at Y&AMP;R, the world's No. 5 agency, with billings
estimated at $13 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Among its blue-chip clients are the AT&AMP;T Corp., the Philip
Morris Companies and Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. Since May, Y&AMP;R has landed
lucrative additional duties from such major clients as Cadbury
Schweppes PLC, Groupe Danone and the Ford Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   The changes, involving eight executives, include the departure
after 24 years of Mitch Kurz, a vice chairman and chairman for
client services, who profited mightily from the initial public
offering of Y&AMP;R stock.
</P>
<P>
   One senior officer gaining new duties is Thomas D. Bell Jr., who
has served as chief executive of two important Y&AMP;R units, the
Burson-Marsteller public relations agency and the Diversified
Communications Group that oversees agencies specializing in public
relations, corporate identity and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Another executive being promoted is Linda Srere, the president
and chief executive of the flagship New York office of Young &AMP;
Rubicam Advertising. She is also being named as one of ``the 50
most powerful women in American business'' in the Oct. 12 issue of
Fortune magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to put the best people where they'll do the most
good,'' said Edward Vick, who is chief operating officer of Y&AMP;R as
well as chairman and chief executive of the Y&AMP;R/Wunderman
Partnership, a unit that coordinates advertising and direct
marketing operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Building brands is so tough today,'' he added, ``and clients
understand that all their pieces of communication have to work
together.''
</P>
<P>
   A central element of the changes is a move by Vick, 54, to
relinquish a third title, as worldwide chairman and chief executive
of Y&AMP;R Advertising, to Bell, 48. Bell has worked for Y&AMP;R twice in
his 25-year career, which also includes stints at Gulfstream
Aerospace and the Ball Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, in an interview, described how he was involved ``in the
production of print, television, radio and outdoor'' for Republican
candidates like Lamar Alexander, Dan Quayle and John Tower at a
Washington political advertising agency from 1971 to 1980.
</P>
<P>
   However, he added, ``I would expect people to say `Tom Bell is
not an ad guy' '' because he lacks experience in bread-and-butter
advertising fields like packaged goods.
</P>
<P>
   That is not necessarily a detriment, Bell said, because ``the
way our business is going, clients are increasingly looking for
more strategic advice and want their advertising put into a
strategic context.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our principal point of differentiation is trying to bring a
more integrated approach to brand-building advertising for our
clients,'' he added. ``I hope to bring our capabilities there
together more frequently and more powerfully.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell's duties as chairman of the diversified communications unit
_ overseeing Burson-Marsteller, Cohn &AMP; Wolfe, Landor Associates and
Sudler &AMP; Hennessey _ are being assumed by Graham Phillips, 59, who
continues as chairman of Burson-Marsteller in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's duties as chief executive of Burson-Marsteller are being
assumed by Chris Komisarjevsky, 53, who has been president and
chief executive of Burson-Marsteller's United States operations.
</P>
<P>
   At Burson-Marsteller, Don Cogman, 51, worldwide chief operating
officer, adds the title of president. He forms the senior
leadership team there along with Phillips, Komisarjevsky and Kurt
Krauss, 49, chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second round of management changes at
Burson-Marsteller in a week, coming after the appointment of Ken
Rietz, 57, global practice chairman for public affairs in
Washington, as chief executive for Europe, based in London.
</P>
<P>
   John Smith, 54, who had served as interim European chief
executive, has resumed his duties as global chairman of the
agency's health care practice in London.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ms. Srere, 43, she has been promoted from her post at Y&AMP;R
Advertising New York to succeed Kurz at Y&AMP;R with the titles of vice
chairwoman and chief client officer. She will oversee what Vick
described as ``our key corporate accounts, which make up half our
business''; they include Citicorp, the Colgate-Palmolive Co. and
the Xerox Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Srere is one of only two women in advertising to land on the
Fortune list. The other is Shelly Lazarus, chairwoman and chief
executive of the Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide unit of WPP Group PLC in
New York. Ms. Srere, ranked 43rd on the list, was praised for being
``key to Y&AMP;R's win last year of the Citicorp global branding
account.''
</P>
<P>
   Vick praised Ms. Srere as ``probably the best we have at pulling
together all our different resources at our different companies for
a client.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurz, 46, is leaving to pursue what were described as nonprofit
or entrepreneurial endeavors. The value of the shares he owns in
Y&AMP;R, which began trading on May 12, is estimated at more than $20
million.
</P>
<P>
   Though several longtime top Y&AMP;R executives are leaving as a
result of growing rich from the offering, Georgescu said, ``We
haven't been surprised by anyone so far.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The IPO has also served the purpose of giving some individuals
the freedom to give back to the community,'' he added. ``A couple
of people are going into teaching, which is just great.''
</P>
<P>
   No successor to Ms. Srere at Y&AMP;R Advertising New York is being
named. Peter Stringham, 49, chairman and chief executive of Y&AMP;R
Advertising North America, to whom the New York office reports,
will assume direct responsibility for that operation.

EDITORIAL: A HEDGE FUND CRASHES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Sept. 25:
</P>
<P>
   The concept of ``too big to fail'' has now been extended to a
huge hedge fund that was run by people thought to be financial
wizards. The bailout of the fund by a consortium of the country's
leading financial institutions is a reminder of how fragile the
world's financial markets now are, and of the risks of making big
bets that markets will act in predictable ways.
</P>
<P>
   The hedge fund was run by John Meriwether, the former Salomon
Brothers official widely viewed as a Wall Street genius. His forte
was in trading bonds, buying those that were relatively cheap and
selling those that were relatively expensive. The idea was to make
a little money on each trade, and make a lot of money overall by
using borrowed money to buy bonds in large quantities. For every
dollar put up by investors in the fund, Meriwether seems to have
borrowed more than $20.
</P>
<P>
   In determining what investments to make, Meriwether and his
colleagues, including two Nobel Prize-winning economists, had
sophisticated computers that reviewed historical prices of bonds
and other financial instruments and found relationships between
them. Strategies were then calculated on the assumption that events
that had never happened before could not happen at all. But they
did. Bond prices almost always rise and fall together. But in the
current financial crisis, the prices of U.S. Treasury bonds have
soared as investors bought them in search of safety while the
prices of most other bonds _ backed by corporations or by other
governments _ have fallen, as investors grew nervous about the
risks involved.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Meriwether, who at the peak was managing more
than $100 billion _ the vast majority of it borrowed money _ had
bet against such an occurrence. After all, that is what happens
almost all the time.
</P>
<P>
   The odds were with Meriwether, whose fund returned profits of
more than 40 percent a year in 1995 and 1996, and of 17 percent in
1997, even after hefty management fees. But betting the way he did
turns out to be a little like Russian roulette: the odds of winning
are very good, but you can't play again if you lose.
</P>
<P>
   Effectively, Meriwether's fund has been taken over by the banks
and brokerage houses that lent money to it. Investors in the fund _
who had to put up a minimum of $10 million each _ are likely to
lose virtually all the money they invested. There is no public
money in the $3.5 billion bailout, but it was organized by the
Federal Reserve, which stepped in because of fears that shaky
financial markets would suffer even more if Meriwether's fund was
forced to liquidate its holdings.
</P>
<P>
   At best, markets will return to normal and the banks that kept
Meriwether's fund afloat will make some money, perhaps even enough
to share with the original investors. At worst, markets will
continue to sink and the bailout money will vanish.
</P>
<P>
   The great bull market of the 1980s and 1990s has been built in
significant ways on leverage, as big players found ways to borrow
to the hilt. Now the banks that made the loans are getting nervous
and demanding more collateral before lending to other hedge funds.
That contraction in credit is prudent, but it will put more
pressure on financial markets that are already feeling the strain.

HURRICANE WIPES OUT UCLA-MIAMI GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With most of South Florida shut down in
preparation for Hurricane Georges, officials from UCLA and the
University of Miami followed suit Thursday and postponed Saturday's
football game in the Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from both schools could talk as soon as Monday about
rescheduling the game for Dec. 5 in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know our president and UCLA chancellor Al Carnesale spoke
(Thursday), and I don't know if they spoke about it then, but
they'll probably talk Monday about it,'' Miami coach Butch Davis
said. ``We have a common (open) date on Dec. 5, and that's
something we would be interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 5 is the first Saturday both teams are free. Third-ranked
UCLA (2-0) ends its season Nov. 21 against USC. Miami ends its
regular season Nov. 28 at Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a possibility it will be made up at the end of the
year,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo said. ``It will be decided in the
next few days. One of the things about coaching and playing is you
do it to play games. We would like to play it if at all possible.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA officials said this was the first time a Bruins football
game was postponed because of weather.
</P>
<P>
   Georges has already killed at least 110 people in the
Carribbean, with hundreds more missing, and is projected to
devastate the Miami area. The Florida Marlins postponed Thursday's
game against the Philadelphia Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   The decision not to play Saturday came about 15 minutes before
the Bruins were to board buses to take them to their charter at Los
Angeles International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision we made is not a decision I made, but one I
wholeheartedly believe in,'' said Toledo, who noticed trepidation
in some of his players. ``They had one eye on The Weather Channel
and ... there was a look in their eyes of, `Why are we doing this?'
I think there was a little sigh of relief. They're disappointed
because they wanted to play against Miami, but they're relieved
they don't have to go into a situation that was very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   If the game isn't rescheduled, it could hamper UCLA's run at a
national title, even if the Bruins finished the regular season
10-0. With a bye this week, UCLA could drop in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's a real possibility and an unfortunate one,''
Toledo said. ``It's not our fault the game isn't being played.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also the Cade McNown-Heisman Trophy issue.
</P>
<P>
   The game was going to be broadcast nationally by CBS, with a
noon start in the East. The contest provided many of the non-West
Coast Heisman voters with an opportunity to see McNown, UCLA's
senior quarterback, early in the day. It was also UCLA's only
scheduled trip east this season.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Miami wants to play as badly as UCLA does is in
question. Miami's athletic department offices were vacated in
anticipation of Hurricane Georges, but a release from the school
said season-ticket holders would receive credit toward their 1999
renewals. Single-game ticket holders could exchange their ticket
for another home game this season. Approximately 42,000 were
expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``A decision was reached to cancel the UCLA-Miami football game
because the potential conditions posed by the threat of Hurricane
Georges were too great to put the young men and staffs of both
schools at risk,'' UCLA athletic director Peter Dalis said in a
statement. ``This decision was a mutual one between the senior
management at both schools.''

IN GREENWICH VILLAGE, FLASHY PARADE IS UNDER FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like the neighborhood in which it is set, the
Greenwich Village Halloween Parade, a mile-long train of 20,000
marchers outfitted in elaborate, often naughty costumes, has long
celebrated creativity, eccentricity and the liberating power of
bending the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as parade organizers prepare for the 25th-anniversary
march, some neighborhood leaders are concerned that the event,
which draws a boisterous crowd of more than 1 million to the
Village each year, has traveled too far down the road from
irreverent to unruly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great deal of sentiment that the excesses of the
parade have gone too far,'' said Alan Jay Gerson, chairman of
Community Board 2 in the Village. ``If it does not work out this
year, this could be the last parade.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerson's board will hold a hearing next month on the future of
the parade, at which time he hopes to hear ideas on how to
alleviate the traffic snarls and rowdiness that have damaged the
event's standing within the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   But city Councilman Thomas Duane, who represents the Village,
has gone even further, formally asking the Giuliani administration
to cancel the parade now or move it to another neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Duane is supported by some community board members and
neighborhood leaders who contend that the event, which started as a
local procession by a few dozen friends, has grown into an
overcrowded nuisance, a magnet for drunken hooligans and a flash
point for bias crimes against homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own personal experience is that it is a sea of homophobia
out there,'' said Duane, who is gay.
</P>
<P>
   The parade organizers and their supporters, including the
Greenwich Village Chamber of Commerce, say Duane is overreacting
and threatening to kill a carnival, the ``Mardi Gras of New York,''
that has become an economic engine for the Village and a vital
thread in the cultural fabric of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the parade should just end because there are
some potential problems with it,'' said Ralph Lee, 63, a mask
designer who founded, but no longer runs, the event. ``It seems
like rather than chuck the whole thing, something should be done to
work these problems out.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Fleming, a theater director who runs the parade from her
Dutchess County home, said: ``This is a joyful night for the whole
city. Very little goes wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The parade debate comes at a time when many people in Greenwich
Village are alarmed by a rash of crimes, including three recent
murders and several reported assaults against homosexuals.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a Sept. 21 letter to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Duane, a
Democrat who is running for the state Senate, said the city should
withhold the parade permit until it held a public hearing on the
parade.
</P>
<P>
   Community leaders estimate that as many as 2 million people may
line the police barricades this year to be entertained by the
routinely unusual assortment of giant animated puppets, kazoo
bands, stilt walkers and exotically costumed marchers, some of them
acting in zany harmony, like the 40 public school teachers who
showed up one year disguised as Imelda Marcos' shoes.

SPORTS COLUMN: SEPT. 23, 90 YEARS APART 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In their clubhouse, the Chicago Cubs were getting dressed like
zombies, still in silent shock from Brant Brown's blunder. But
upstairs in County Stadium in Milwaukee late Wednesday afternoon, a
voice with a Chicago persuasion put the Cubs' sudden loss in
historical perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't lose for 90 years by coincidence,'' that voice
moaned. ``You've got to be good at it.''
</P>
<P>
   If there's such a thing as a baseball team being good at finding
ways to lose, the Cubs own the copyright: The last time they won
the World Series was, yes, 90 years ago, 1908, the year that
``Merkle's boner'' put the Cubs in the World Series instead of the
New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, every other big-league franchise of that era has won
the World Series _ even the Red Sox in 1918, when Babe Ruth was a
left-handed pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   In their inimitable manner, since 1908 the Cubs have found ways
to lose the World Series seven times, the latest in 1945, and to
lose a National League Championship Series twice, in 1984 and 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs also found ways to lose the 1969 NL East to the New
York Mets, who trailed them by nine and a half games on Aug. 13,
then went on a 38-11 tear and won by eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Cubs are hoping that they haven't already found a way to
lose the NL wild-card playoff race that is all even entering the
season's final weekend: the Mets in Atlanta, the Cubs in Houston
(and the San Francisco Giants still alive, only one game back, in
Colorado).
</P>
<P>
   If the Cubs emerge as the wild card, Brant Brown's blunder will
be forgotten. But if the Cubs don't emerge, every index finger in
Chicago will point to his misplay of a routine fly ball that
allowed three Brewer base runners to score in the ninth for an 8-7
loss.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Cubs and Mets need a wild-card playoff Monday at Shea
Stadium, the index finger of every baseball historian will point to
``Merkle's boner'' in 1908 that provoked what amounted to a pennant
playoff between the Cubs and New York's NL franchise then, the
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Almost hauntingly, Brant Brown's blunder and Fred Merkle's boner
each occurred on Sept. 23, exactly 90 years apart.
</P>
<P>
   In 1908, the 19-year-old Merkle was the Giants' rookie first
baseman. In the ninth inning of a 1-1 game against the Cubs at the
Polo Grounds, his two-out single moved left fielder Harry ``Moose''
McCormick to third. When shortstop Al Bridwell singled, McCormick
hurried across the plate with the apparent winning run; Merkle,
knowing the game was over, veered toward the Giants' clubhouse in
center field.
</P>
<P>
   As hundreds of Giant fans hurried onto the field to celebrate
the Giants' one-game lead in the pennant race, Johnny Evers, the
Cubs' second baseman, noticed that Merkle, in the accepted practice
on a game-winning hit at the time, had not touched second.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks earlier in Pittsburgh, Evers had protested to Umpire
Hank O'Day that a Pirates base runner had not touched second on a
similar game-winning hit. O'Day had not seen that base runner turn
away, so he couldn't rule otherwise. But Evers had raised the issue
of the proper application of the rule.
</P>
<P>
   As the plate umpire in the Polo Grounds now, O'Day noticed
Merkle turn away into the celebrants. Evers, meanwhile, shouted for
the ball that Bridwell had hit.
</P>
<P>
   Getting both Umpire Bob Emslie's attention and the ball (or just
a ball, some said), Evers stepped on second. Technically, that
forced Merkle for the third out, thereby nullifying McCormick's
winning run. But with so many fans on the field and darkness
approaching, O'Day hurried to the umpires' room.
</P>
<P>
   When the Cubs' manager, Frank Chance, protested, O'Day, fearing
a riot, announced he would make a ruling at 10 o'clock that night.
He ruled a 1-1 tie. Harry Pulliam, the NL president, ordered the
game replayed on Oct. 8, the day after the season, if it were
necessary to decide the pennant.
</P>
<P>
   When the Giants and Cubs each finished with a 98-55 record, the
replay was necessary. The Cubs won, 4-2, as Mordecai ``Three
Finger'' Brown outpitched Christy Mathewson. Then the Cubs won the
World Series from the Detroit Tigers in five games, but they
haven't won it since then.
</P>
<P>
   And with only a wild card at stake, Brant Brown's blunder won't
be as infamous in Chicago as Fred Merkle's boner was 90 years ago
in New York.

   NEW YORK _ There are high notes Barbara Cook no longer tries to
hit, and at 70 the voice is changed _ richer and more interesting,
actually, since she was Marian the Librarian in ``The Music Man''
40 years ago, with a lyric soprano that was just like every other
ingenue's lyric soprano, except hers was better.
</P>
<P>
   She sings about being in love with a wonderful guy, at the Cafe
Carlyle, and she's so full of the fullness of Rodgers and
Hammerstein love (in terms of calories, about the richest love
there is), you wonder: Is Barbara Cook acting, is she remembering,
or is she meeting somebody after the show?
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs to Ms. Cook's flower-filled suite for an answer:
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing it so long, the emotional part is more
available to me than you'd think,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   So is there a wonderful guy?
</P>
<P>
   ``No. I have lots of friends, and I don't know that I would want
that now. Sometimes I think I would. Maybe like a companion, but
it's not something I despair over. I'm really pretty content.''
</P>
<P>
   When was the last time there was a wonderful guy?
</P>
<P>
   A flustered reply from Ms. Cook, who clearly prefers singing
about love to discussing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A long time. I would say in the 70s. A long time.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been two chapters in Barbara Cook's career: musical
comedy star in the 50s, when she weighed 106 pounds and could fit
the petite, blonde, beautiful mold those roles seemed to require,
and then, after a famous weight gain made romantic leads impossible
to obtain, the cabaret star.
</P>
<P>
   Whether her weight, which has been high for most of her cabaret
career, has been a factor in her romantic life, Ms. Cook cannot
say. She says the absence of suitors may have to do with signals:
her longtime music arranger and accompanist, Wally Harper, used to
tell her that this man or that in the audience was interested in
her, but she never noticed. Also, she says, that last romance was
painful.
</P>
<P>
   Not that she seems down.
</P>
<P>
   She talks about the beauty of the sun-drenched corner apartment
on Central Park West that she finally allowed herself. ``I lusted
over it,'' she says. She says she has no plans to retire. There
have been some changes, but her voice _ Ms. Cook pauses to knock
wood _ is stronger than ever. When she gets really old, she says,
she'll be out there in a walker.
</P>
<P>
   It's just, one gathers, that there's an old tape going through
her head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have this terrible condition I have dealt with virtually all
my life,'' Ms. Cook says. ``The inappropriate use of food, food as
a mind-altering substance. It really is an addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have the advantage of knowing how good they are,''
she says.``They see themselves clearly as a commodity early on and
where they fit in. Streisand was like that _ she and I have the
same agent. I didn't have that at all. It would have been very
helpful if I had seen my worth.''
</P>
<P>
   She launches into some lyrics not found in Oscar Hammerstein,
though Lorenz Hart would have understood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a neurotic girl from Atlanta,'' Ms. Cook says. ``I did
not have a lot of self-esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father was a traveling salesman. He and her mother, a
milliner, divorced when Ms. Cook was 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother,'' she begins. ``Oh, boy. Here we go. She _ how to
word this? _ I think in her despair over losing my father, she
didn't think before she spoke. I had a younger sister who died very
young _ she had pneumonia and I had whooping cough _ and I
overheard my mother saying, if I hadn't given my sister whooping
cough, she might have lived. I took that to mean I had killed my
sister. Then my mother asked me to ask my father to come back, and
that of course failed. Then my mother said she believed that if my
sister had lived, my father wouldn't have left us. This was major
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cook sang from the time she was a child. She also, from the
time she was a teen-ager, struggled with her weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm five-three,'' she says. ``I have small bones. I should be
about 110, 115. When I came to New York, when I was 21, I was about
136 pounds _ I am one of those people who can recall what weight I
was every moment in my life. I remember walking in the street and a
guy yelling, `Hello there, Chubbo!'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cook managed to lose 30 pounds in six months and kept the
weight off for several years, through ``Oklahoma!,'' ``Carousel,''
``Candide'' and ``She Loves Me.'' By her late 30s, she was divorced
with one child, her weight was up to 250 pounds and she was no
longer working in musical comedy.
</P>
<P>
   She gave some interviews saying it was liberating to no longer
be concerned about weight; in others, she blamed a lack of decent
roles for her weight gain.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ms. Cook simply speaks of a food addiction. Buying her
new apartment two years ago was so stressful, she says, that she
put on 35 pounds. Since January, she has lost 50. She will no doubt
struggle with the problem for the rest of her life. And yet, she
says, she's feeling pretty good. She's still singing. She is close
to her son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three or four months ago,'' she says, ``I was not quite awake,
and there was this feeling that just stabbed into my heart.''.
</P>
<P>
   She enacts a woman struggling to interpret an unfamiliar
sensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This feeling. Could it be? I think'' _ Ms. Cook is laughing
now _ ``I think I'm actually happy.''  &QL;

 &HT;    Florida takes measures to protect art
 &HT;    By Gary Schwan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Multimillion-dollar art collections went
under wraps throughout South Florida Thursday because of Hurricane
Georges.
</P>
<P>
   Literally, in the case of the Norton Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   The familiar statues of Acteon and Diana on the museum's facade
were shrouded with tarpaulin for protection. The museum will be
closed through Monday, along with many area art museums.
</P>
<P>
   The Norton is in a flood plain. But the art-storage facility in
its expanded building is no longer on the ground floor, said
spokesperson Sarah Flynn.
</P>
<P>
   The Flagler Museum in Palm Beach is ready to restore damaged art
year-round. It has two strategically placed carts loaded with
restoration materials such as oil absorbent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say, you have a painting soaked in a storm,'' said director
John Blades. ``If you can apply some treatment to it right away,
you can sometimes minimize long-term damage.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the massive building, the former home of railroad pioneer
Henry Flagler, Blades said ``it has withstood two major hurricanes
in its time. I think it can get through this.''
</P>
<P>
   Water, not wind, worries Morikami Museum officials in Delray
Beach. ``Our concern is flooding because the water level of our
lake is already very high,'' said director Larry Rosensweig.
Unprotected art has been moved off the ground floor, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Boca Raton Museum of Art, officials were preparing to
move more than a half-dozen large metal sculptures indoors if the
storm neared the city. Some huge sculptures are bolted to concrete
and would remain outside. ``These are two- and three-ton metal
sculptures,'' said museum registrar Marc Ransdell. ``If a hurricane
can move them, we're all in trouble.''

 &HT;    Georges ravishes Florida
 &HT;    By Mary McLachlin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ After all the waiting, worrying, buying
and boarding up, G-Day finallay has arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Georges broke free of Cuba Thursday night, gathered
its strength and began pelting South Florida with wind-driven
squalls from the Keys northward to Palm Beach and the Treasure
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Its threat brought the daily routines of millions to a halt:
Governments, schools and businesses closed and emergency shelters
opened; airports shut down, trains, trucks and buses stopped
running; thousands fled their homes for higher ground, and hardy
holdouts dug in to battle the storm or party it through.
</P>
<P>
   Georges' center is expected to sweep across the middle Keys near
Marathon by midday and grind into the Gulf of Mexico with
rejuvenated winds of more than 100 miles per hour. The hurricane
left nearly 200 dead, hundreds missing and billions of dollars in
damage across the Caribbean
</P>
<P>
   ``This storm looks like it's all set to explosively intensify
once the eye gets over water,'' said Jerry Jarrell, director of the
National Hurricane Center. ``We're extremely concerned that the
land areas will be inundated with water and we'll lose a lot of
folks down there (in the Keys).''
</P>
<P>
   The first band of rain blew into Marathon at 6 p.m. insert
latest advisory
</P>
<P>
   Miami-Dade, Broward, Collier and Monroe counties braced for
hurricane winds of 75 miles and higher. Tropical storm winds of
35-45 mph with gusts to 55 mph are forecast for Palm Beach and
Martin counties' coastal areas, while St. Lucie should have 25-35
mph sustained winds gusting to 45 mph.
</P>
<P>
   But communities south of Lake Okeechobee _ Belle Glade, South
Bay, Pahokee, Clewiston _ will be closer to the storm's center as
it moves westward and could have sustained winds of 50-60 mph with
gusts of hurricane strength, the National Weather Service said.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters issued a flood watch for all of Florida south of
Daytona Beach due to heavy rains and high tides. They predicted
8-10 inches of rain for the Keys and Miami-Dade, and 6-8 inches for
Palm Beach and Treasure Coast counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to rain off and on continuously until well into
Saturday,'' said Jim Lushine, storm warning coordinator for the
weather service.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross opened five shelters in Palm Beach County
and two in Hendry County. By 9 p.m., more than 230 had checked in,
including 120 at Glades Central High School in Belle Glade.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen staff and volunteers manned the phones at Palm
Beach County's emergency operations center Thursday. By 8 p.m.,
they had taken more than 2,000 calls from residents asking where
the shelter were, where the storm was, whether they should put up
shutters and if somebody could come help them.
</P>
<P>
   By 8:30 p.m., 6,900 customers in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm
Beach counties already had lost power, Florida Power &AMP; Light Co.
spokesman Tom Veenstra said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to keep crews out restoring these outages as long
as weather permits,'' Veenstra said. FPL had 2,000 FPL employees
and 1,000 contractors on standby to tackle problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
   PalmTran stopped sending out buses when the last one came in at
9:45 and said it would decide today when to resume service.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Highway Patrol, which already had its troopers
working 12-hour shifts from Broward south, planned to do the same
at 7 a.m. in Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast, Lt. Pembrook
Burrows said. That means all troopers will be on dury. Palm Beach
Gardens public works employees were on duty through the night
Thursday and today to monitor drainage and respond to flooding
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County's 12 oceanfront parks will be closed today,
and county lifeguards warn beachgoers to stay out of the water
because of rising swells. If weather permits, county beaches will
reopened Saturday, said Chuck Price, district supervisor for the
county beach patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Worth closed its municipal beach at 11 a.m. Thursday
because of rip currents and floating debris, such as wood planks
and coconuts, presumably from hurricane-stricken islands. City
workers also removed 200 feet of breakaway planking on the Lake
Worth pier.
</P>
<P>
   In the Everglades farming region, sugar, vegetable and citrus
growers worked grimly to lower water levels in fields and groves
and fretted about the water and wind damage that Georges could
inflict on their vulnerable crops.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Crystals Corp., owned by the Fanjul family of Palm
Beach, expected some of its Glades holdings to be flooded. The
Fanjuls still hadn't learned how much damage Georges did to their
250,000 acres of sugar cane in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The citrus harvest begins next month, so trees are heavy with
fruit that is susceptible to wind damage. And the trees don't like
standing water.
</P>
<P>
   Callery-Judge Groves in Loxahatchee sent most workers home at
noon, except for security and drainage crews. The company boarded
windows, put essential files into a waterproof vault and got all
electronic equipment off the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though it may be a lot of work for nothing,'' manager
Mark Dubois said, ``it may be a lot of work for something.''
</P>
<P>
   Supermarkets were crowded as people picked up storm supplies,
but they weren't chaotic, said Terry Walsh, Winn-Dixie district
marketing director. That's because more residents, seasoned by
Hurricane Andrew in 1992, didn't wait until the last minute, Walsh
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before they were even under a watch, they were shopping,''
Walsh said. ``I think they were 24 hours ahead of schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot trucked 80,000 sheets of plywood to southeast and
southwest Florida Thursday, bringing the three-day total to 340,000
sheets, said Don Harrison, a company spokesman. The chain expects
to send more wood up the west coast in anticipation of the storm's
path, he said. At the Home Depot west of Boca Raton, shoppers were
still crowding in Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' manager Pat Sheehan said. ``There was a huge
cheer when the next truck pulled up for plywood.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheehan said the plywood was still hot from the gluing process
at the mill.
</P>
<P>
   A special price-gouging hotline set up by the Florida Attorney
General's office had already received about 60 calls by Thursday
afternoon, most of them from the Miami area, spokesman Joe Bizarro
said. He said the hotline had received only two from Palm Beach
County and none from the Treasure Coast.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,500 members of the Florida National Guard were ordered
to report to armories Thursday night to be ready for hurricane
assignments today. Four C-130 aircraft were reserved to fly troops
to the Keys for post-storm security.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic through the Keys was down to a trickle on Thursday, and
police ordered a curfew and alcohol ban beginning at 9 p.m. Many of
those left in the Conch Republic of Key West and the kite-tail of
islands connecting it to the mainland had already settled down to
serious hurricane partying.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Cuda, a popular musician in Key West, left his piano gig
at Sloppy Joe's Bar and headed north to Cudjoe Key to screw down
the shutters on his house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've invited a lot of people to stay here with me, but no one
accepted, so now it's just me and my dogs to ride it out,'' Cuda
said. ``I'm having a glass of wine every hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuda said he expects to be back at work as soon as the road
opens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, the band went down playing on the Titanic.''

NBA POSTPONES CAMPS; REAL GAMES COME NEXT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Another domino fell Thursday in the NBA's
87-day-old labor stalemate, as the league postponed training camps.
If the chain reaction continues, cancellation of regular-season
games will certainly follow within the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to even agree on a framework for negotiations with the
players association, NBA officials called off camps _ slated to
begin Oct. 6 _ and canceled 24 exhibition games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, it is now clear there will not be enough time
for teams to fill their rosters and go through the necessary period
of conditioning and be ready to play preseason games by
mid-October,'' deputy commissioner Russ Granik said.
</P>
<P>
   So all exhibition games through Oct. 16 are scratched, and a
week from now, another week of games could fall. A week after that,
the NBA will be encroaching on the 28-day window leading into
opening night, Nov. 3. Teams need about four weeks to sign players,
hold camp and play a couple of exhibition games before the season
begins, so if a new contract isn't in place by the week of Oct. 5,
regular-season games will be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants to miss the whole season,'' Granik said, ``but
there are 29 owners that are willing to do so if they have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Union officials could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides have held just one negotiating session _ and a
fruitless one at that _ since NBA owners imposed a lockout July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Granik and commissioner David Stern did meet for an hour
Wednesday with union director Billy Hunter and president Patrick
Ewing, but that was described as simply a feeling-out session to
determine whether they could agree on parameters for negotiating.
No further talks are scheduled. The meeting was described as
cordial, which is at least an improvement over the Aug. 6
negotiating session, which terminated when the owners walked out
after hearing a union proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Owners want to rein in player salaries by imposing a ``hard''
salary cap on teams. The current system includes numerous loopholes
to the cap, including the so-called Larry Bird exception, which
allows a team to pay any amount to re-sign its free agents. Players
oppose elimination of the Bird exception or anything resembling a
hard cap.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's announcement means the Lakers will not train in
Hawaii, where they were scheduled to open camp Oct. 6. Two
exhibition games against the Golden State Warriors in Honolulu,
Oct. 14 and 16, are also canceled.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers were slated to train at College of the Desert in
Palm Desert and have lost games at Phoenix on Oct. 14 and at home
against Vancouver on Oct. 16. Team officials are prohibited from
commenting on the lockout and all player personnel issues. But the
announcement was not a surprise to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of felt all along that would probably happen with
training camp,'' said Lakers guard Derek Fisher. ``When I found
out, I was kind of bummed out.... It's thrown me for a loop as far
as preparing (for the season).''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher is hopeful the threat of canceled games will ignite
negotiations, but he's worried about the consequences if it
doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't start on time, the fans will be sorely
disappointed. Whenever we start back, they aren't going to just
start loving us again as if nothing has changed,'' he said. ``If we
don't start on time and we don't come back, and then if Michael
(Jordan) is not there, whatever (fans) are filling the void with
when the NBA is gone, they'll just continue to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Pending is the union's grievance with arbitrator John Feerick
claiming that 220 players with guaranteed contracts worth about
$800 million should be paid during the lockout. Feerick could rule
anytime between now and Oct. 19, but if the players win, owners
will challenge the ruling in federal court.

VALLONE BACKED BY 133,000-MEMBER TEACHERS' UNION 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In payback for Gov. George Pataki's budget vetoes
last spring, the New York City teachers' union _ one of the state's
most potent political operations _ endorsed his democratic
opponent, Peter F. Vallone, Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone, the New York City Council Speaker, trails in the polls
and desperately needs the phone bank and direct-mail operations _
to say nothing of the votes _ of the 133,000-member United
Federation of Teachers, which bills itself as the nation's largest
union local in any field.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the state's powerful and traditionally democratic labor
unions, convinced that Pataki is a cinch for re-election, have
decided to sit out this race, depriving Vallone of much of the
organizational support on which he was counting.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement took some of the luster off Pataki's day spent
portraying himself as a champion of children. In ceremonies in New
York City and Albany, he signed a bill expanding the state's health
care program for children of the working poor, and one raising
penalties for day-care providers who break laws governing their
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In April, after the legislature passed a state budget, Pataki
infuriated lawmakers and countless interest groups by vetoing 1,300
separate items, totaling more than $1 billion in spending.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, the diciest of the vetoes had to do with education:
he eliminated $500 million for school construction, $77 million to
bolster teacher salaries in urban districts, and money for programs
that were intended to help teachers hone their skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the governor knows very clearly where we stand on
these issues, why we're doing what we're doing,'' Randi Weingarten,
president of the teachers' federation, said at a news conference in
City Hall Park to announce the endorsement of Vallone. ``And he
knew very much the disappointment we had with the vetoes last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Vallone, she said, ``has a record, in good budgets and in bad
budgets, of supporting public schools and the issues we care deeply
about, such as lower class sizes, repair and maintenance of
buildings, higher academic standards.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor declined to comment directly on the endorsement.
``I'm very proud of our record on education,'' he said. ``We've
committed more resources than the state has ever done before'' to
schools.
</P>
<P>
   But Vallone said Pataki's vetoes showed a ``lack of concern or
understanding of the problems for our children and education.''
</P>
<P>
   In the months before Pataki's vetoes, leaders of the teachers'
federation said they were unlikely to take sides in his re-election
contest. And even after the vetoes, while teachers and union
leaders were clearly furious, Democrats worried that the union
would refrain from any assault on the governor.
</P>
<P>
   The federation's parent union statewide, the New York State
United Teachers, an arm of the American Federation of Teachers,
probably will not make an endorsement in the race, according to its
top officials. The smaller of the two statewide teachers' unions,
the New York chapter of the National Education Association, has
endorsed Vallone.
</P>
<P>
   But Vallone's continuing problems with organized labor were on
display Thursday at Mount Sinai Medical Center on the Upper East
Side, where one of the state's most important and politically
astute labor leaders, Dennis Rivera, stood at Pataki's side as the
governor signed a children's health bill into law.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera, president of 1199, the National Health and Human Service
Employees Union, has remained silent on the governor's race, and
Thursday, he had warm words for the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera's was the most aggressive union in attacking the governor
in 1995 for his proposed cuts. But since then, the two men have
worked closely on various issues, including the legislation Pataki
signed Thursday, and on obtaining $1.25 billion from the federal
government to aid New York's hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Governor Pataki was elected governor, we had a rocky
beginning; we all know about that,'' Rivera said. But now, he said,
``there's a whole body of work that we have done together.''
</P>
<P>
   The signing Thursday was a stark turnabout for Pataki, who last
year proposed only a bare-bones plan for expanding the Child Health
Plus plan, drawing howls of protest from Democrats in the
legislature and children's advocates. By his own admission, it was
because of intense lobbying that he agreed to a much more generous
package of benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Marian Wright Edelman, the president of the Children's Defense
Fund, joined Pataki for the signing and called New York's expanded
program ``a model for the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's signing provided the governor a chance not only to
take credit for that outcome, but to pose for news cameras while
sitting in a sea of toddlers, and to bask in the praise of liberal
icons like Rivera and Ms. Edelman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about any of us,'' Pataki said. ``It's about the
smiling faces you see here before you.''
</P>
<P>
   Child Health Plus provides free or low-cost health coverage for
children of working parents with low or moderate incomes and no
health insurance _ those who are not poor enough to qualify for
Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   It began under Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in the late 1980s and was
greatly expanded under Pataki two years ago. Last year, Congress
and President Clinton allocated money to create and expand such
programs nationwide, leaving it to the states how to spend the
money, and New York's share is $256 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, there are 680,000 children without health
insurance. Of those, 420,000 are eligible for Child Health Plus,
but only 230,000 are enrolled so far.
</P>
<P>
   The bill Pataki signed makes an additional 45,000 children
eligible, by raising the income limit to $41,000, from $34,000, for
a family of four. It also greatly expands the package of benefits
to include dental, vision, hearing, mental health and substance
abuse treatment, and devices like hearing aids and wheelchairs. &QL;

   In the race for Senate, the state Democratic Party, in a novel
twist on advertising strategy, announced that it had taped a
Republican advertisement that warns against New York City
influence, and that is now being shown only upstate, and would
begin broadcasting it in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats said they would take a second Republican
advertisement intended only for downstate audiences _ in which Sen.
Alfonse M. D'Amato is endorsed by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Edward
Koch, the former mayor _ and begin broadcasting it upstate.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats added a message that appears onscreen over the
Republican advertisements: ``The ad Al D'Amato and the Republicans
don't want you to see.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic advertising campaign is intended to draw
attention to what Judith Hope, the state democratic chairwoman,
said was an effort by Republicans to divide the state
geographically.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Democrats said that their main purpose was to encourage
newspapers and television stations to do a story about the
advertisements; the cost of television time bought by the Democrats
was described as minimal.

THE HOLDERS OF RUSSIAN DEBT BEGIN BLOCKING OVERSEAS ASSETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As foreign holders of Russian debt struggle to recover some of
their billions in losses, they have begun blocking Russian bank
accounts and other assets overseas, resorting to the courts to
unravel a tangled skein of loan, bond and currency-contract
defaults.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday Lehman Brothers Holdings won a court order in London
freezing the British bank accounts of two big Russian banks,
Inkombank and Unexim Bank. Lehman contends that the two banks
defaulted on $110 million of obligations to Lehman and Lehman
clients.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of other foreign creditors are scrambling to recover
whatever they can from their Russian holdings. A consortium of 17
banks led by Deutsche Bank are pressing the Russian government to
offer better terms to holders of defaulted bonds. A group of U.S.
hedge funds, some of the main investors in Russian debt, are
fighting for a seat at the bargaining table, arguing that foreign
banks do not necessarily represent their interest in talks with the
Russians.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government in August defaulted on $40 billion of
domestic bonds and allowed the ruble to devalue sharply. The
default hit high-risk investors who held once-lucrative Russian
bonds. Moscow has also prohibited Russian banks from paying foreign
claims for 90 days, making it impossible for international banks
and investors to collect on currency hedges. Most of Lehman's
claims involved such currency forward contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The legal action is expected to prompt a rush to freeze or lay
claim to financial assets held by Russian debtors abroad. It is
also a signal that some big U.S. banks have little faith in the
continuing talks between international creditors and the Russian
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you will see people trying to get in court what they
can't get in the market,'' said a U.S. lawyer who specializes in
Russia, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``We have clients
who are trying to find what the Russians own and whether they can
make a claim.''
</P>
<P>
   Inkombank, Russia's second-largest bank, criticized Lehman's
lawsuit. ``Lehman Brothers is trying to use force to get ahead of
other creditors and to be the first seizing everything it can,''
Bloomberg News quoted a bank official as saying.
</P>
<P>
   A Lehman spokesman declined to comment in detail on the court
action. But he said the firm was taking action on behalf of clients
for whom Lehman acted as an agent arranging contracts to swap
dollars for rubles at a certain exchange rate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The legal battle comes as creditors are also pressing Russia to
improve the terms it is offering holders of domestic bonds. Foreign
banks negotiating with the government won a week-long extension,
until next Friday, of the deadline Russia set to swap defaulted
bonds for new securities. The new securities would be valued at
only 10 percent of the old ones before the default, and the banks
are pressing for more time to bargain for a better deal.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. hedge fund investors are also lobbying to have their voices
heard. A new group representing 60 hedge funds and asset managers
has formed to press the Russian government to make good on
contracts or risk long-term exclusion from international capital
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the ultimate holders of this debt,'' said Steven
Halliwell of River Capital Management, which organized the hedge
fund lobby. ``So we need to take action, including possible legal
action, to protect our interests.''

RIVALS IN SENATE RACE TRY TO OUT-TOUGH EACH OTHER ON CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just two weeks old but already rancorous, the
Senate race has become in large part an acid debate over crime,
with Rep. Charles Schumer and Sen. Alfonse D'Amato trading
accusations almost daily that the other is soft on criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al D'Amato is not close to being as tough on crime as Chuck
Schumer,'' Schumer, a Democrat from Brooklyn, said recently in a
typical campaign remark. To which D'Amato, a Republican of Long
Island, replied, ``It was Chuck Schumer who worked and voted
against tougher penalties for dangerous criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Their peevish discourse notwithstanding, there are substantive
differences, and often striking similarities, in the positions
Schumer and D'Amato take on crime, a review of their parallel
18-year congressional careers shows. It also shows that neither man
can be aptly labeled a coddler of criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Though D'Amato has described his rival as a liberal well outside
New York's political mainstream, Schumer has in fact angered
liberals, blacks and civil libertarians _ core Democratic Party
constituencies _ by voting to lengthen prison sentences, limit
appeals by death row convicts, expand capital punishment to cover
more crimes and broaden the authority of investigators to use
wiretaps.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Schumer's efforts to portray D'Amato as weak
on crime have sometimes seemed a bit like trying to outrun the
wind: it has been a rare day when D'Amato has opposed legislation
intended to strengthen criminal penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Yet all their one-upmanship has often blurred important
distinctions between the two men, which are most glaringly evident
on the issue of gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer has been a leading proponent of gun control, contending
that it reduces violent crime and protects police officers. D'Amato
has been a steadfast opponent of any restrictions on gun ownership,
taking the position that tougher penalties are the best deterrent
to crime.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer has also shown greater interest than D'Amato in
financing alternatives to prison, like drug treatment and youth
programs. One reason D'Amato voted against the 1994 crime bill,
which Schumer helped write, was that he felt it included too much
money for prevention programs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the two men agree on some fundamental issues. Both
support the death penalty and have voted to make more federal
crimes subject to capital punishment. And both have pushed to give
federal lawyers the authority to prosecute certain street crimes,
though not the same ones.
</P>
<P>
   As a former chairman and current ranking minority member of the
House subcommittee on crime, Schumer has been one of Congress' most
active architects of crime legislation this decade. He was a chief
sponsor of the Brady law, which established a five-day waiting
period to buy handguns, and of legislation that made carjacking a
federal crime.
</P>
<P>
   He is currently a sponsor of a measure that would expand the
power of criminal investigators to wiretap phones, a measure civil
libertarians strenuously oppose.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the 1994 crime bill that Schumer points to most often
as his greatest achievement, and as D'Amato's most glaring failure.
</P>
<P>
   The measure embraced a remarkable range of policies intended to
win support from conservatives and liberals. It mandated sentences
of life without parole for three-time felons, made scores of crimes
eligible for capital punishment and provided funds for police
officers, prison cells, drug treatment and youth programs.
</P>
<P>
   It made stalking and domestic abuse federal crimes, banned
certain assault weapons and made it illegal to import child
pornography.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's campaign now says D'Amato's vote against the 1994 bill
showed that he was weak on crime, unconcerned about women and had
``sided with child pornographers and the gun lobby.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato has countered by ticking off a number of Schumer's votes
that he contends demonstrate a lack of resolve, including one
against a 1995 bill that would have penalized states that did not
require criminals to serve a minimum of 85 percent of their
sentences.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato has been the author of bills intended to increase
penalties for using guns in crimes. He contends that such measures
would do more to reduce violent crime than restricting gun
ownership.
</P>
<P>
   But many criminal justice experts contend that one such D'Amato
bill, which would authorize federal attorneys to prosecute gun
crimes, would clog federal courts with cases that local courts
could handle just as well.

million) bid for the 1980s emblem that fell victim to a new era and
lost ground to electronic organizers. But if its reputation had
slumped, shares of Filofax Group PLC rose Thursday by 62.5 pence,
to 202.5 pence. Day Runner's bid at 200 pence ($3.36) a share was a
42.9 percent premium on Filofax's 140 pence closing price on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Filofax Group did not say whether it would accept the bid.
</P>
<P>
   For those too young to recall, the Filofax was a stunning
marketing phenomenon of the 1980s, a brand that seized imaginations
in booming times by offering what was billed as a power tool _ a
one-stop ring-binder where the upwardly mobile could bring together
an appointments diary and a forward planner, address book and
project notes in a compact format suited to an incredibly busy
lifestyle. Indeed, its products expanded to include maps and
expense sheets, even records of squash games.
</P>
<P>
   More than that, though, the Filofax became a widely used part of
business and office life, with worldwide sales that surpassed sales
in its British base. In the year ending March 31, Filofax sales
totaled (PS)37.7 million ($63 million), with (PS)16.7 million
($27.8 million) in Britain and (PS)5.2 million ($8.6 million) in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After an ill-starred foray into the greeting cards business,
though, Filofax began looking for a partner in April, only to call
off the search in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1980s, the brand had a reputation and a recognition to
be envied, but today the story is a different one,'' said Mark
Vidovich, the chairman of Day Runner.
</P>
<P>
   In this decade, the company has seesawed under different
managements. ``The brand name is a good one,'' Vidovich said. ``And
it has great potential. But it hasn't been exploited properly.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde said
Thursday that if the House votes to hold a formal impeachment
inquiry on President Clinton's behavior in the Monica Lewinsky
affair, the hearings would likely extend beyond the November
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois Republican told reporters that his 37-member panel
would decide Oct. 5 or 6 whether to recommend an inquiry. If
approved by the committee, the full House would likely vote on the
resolution by Oct. 9.
</P>
<P>
   But with all 435 members of the House up for re-election Nov. 3,
Hyde suggested the need to campaign might keep the hearings from
beginning in earnest until after Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our members feel constrained to campaign for
re-election _ not the least of which is me,'' he said. ``Our guide
is deliberate speed _ not too fast that people can accuse us of
rushing to judgment and not too slow so people can accuse us of
deliberately stretching it out for political purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Polling indicates a substantial majority of Americans do not
want Clinton impeached and would like to put the scandal behind
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like all Americans, I want to bring this matter to closure as
soon as possible,'' Hyde said. ``The timetable I've proposed today
is the most expeditious schedule we can follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee Democrats, however, contended that Congress could wrap
up any inquiry before the elections, if it spent less time
skirmishing over what information to make public.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an effort to run out the clock so that the election
comes and goes with this totally unresolved, with all the questions
hanging,'' said committee member Barney Frank, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the dilemma my Republican colleagues face is they have
a significant part of their party that wants an impeachment, and to
their disappointment, the public does not yet appear ready to join
them. ... Therefore, they don't want to take any conclusive action
one way or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, another Democratic member of
the committee, called on Hyde and the Republicans to ``get a
grip,'' as she put it. ``Stop politicizing this and get back to due
process,'' she said on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Frank and Jackson Lee also criticized Hyde's position that none
of the audio tapes of Lewinsky's confessions about Clinton to her
former friend Linda Tripp should be made public. The 27 tapes that
Tripp recorded secretly were the basis for independent counsel
Kenneth Starr launching his inquiry into whether Clinton lied under
oath about having a sexual relationship with Lewinsky and tried to
cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said the tapes contained ``a lot of information that really
does not pertain to this investigation'' and would embarrass
``innocent people.'' But he insisted that transcripts of the tapes,
along with some 60,000 other pages of information, would be
released after the committee decides in a closed-door meeting
Friday what parts should be edited out.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Lee and most other Democrats on the Judiciary Committee
have been opposed to releasing any the information supplied to
Congress by Starr. But she called it hypocritical of the
Republicans to push for the release of the president's videotaped
testimony before the grand jury investigating the Lewinsky matter
and not the Tripp tapes.
</P>
<P>
   According to committee sources, the accuracy of some tapes is in
question and still under investigation by Starr. They say the tapes
are also much more graphic than the testimony released by the
committee thus far and show that Tripp may have been trying to
manipulate what Lewinsky says in some of their conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Hyde said transcripts would contain all relevant
information, regardless of whether it helps or hurts the president.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Tripp tape transcripts, the Judiciary
Committee is also expected to decide Friday how much more of the
Starr information to release, including the grand jury testimony of
Tripp, Clinton friend Vernon Jordan, and the president's personal
secretary Betty Currie. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Under the House resolution authorizing the release of the Starr
report, all 16 boxes of supplemental information must be released
by Sept. 28. But Hyde said it was unlikely that the material would
be released until at least midweek.
</P>
<P>
   As Hyde was meeting with reporters, Clinton was preparing for a
White House event on the nation's falling poverty rate, barely
taking note of the controversy that threatens to bring down his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he believes there is any way to avoid impeachment
hearings, Clinton said: ``The way out here, and the only way out,
is for people in Washington to do what the folks in America want
them to do _ which is to take care of their concerns and their
children and their future.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Democrats had tried to strike a deal with House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., to avoid impeachment hearings, which
now appear inevitable. But Gingrich, under heavy pressure from
House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, and other GOP
conservatives, rejected the idea of a lesser punishment, such as
censure.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay said Thursday that the Constitution did not give Congress
the authority to censure a president as a lesser punishment for an
impeachable offense. He encouraged Hyde and his Republicans
colleagues to see the impeachment process through, which could
result in Clinton's removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the possibility of censuring Clinton instead of
trying to impeach him, Hyde said he was ``not entranced by that
idea,'' adding that there was no precedent for it.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of constitutional lawyers said Congress can pursue
whatever course of action it wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Congress wants to pass a resolution that approves of
Mother's Day or disapproves of the conduct of the president, it
seems to me kind of a stretch to say either of those is
unconstitutional,`` said University of Houston law professor David
Crump.

HANDICAPPER WANTS HORSES TO BEAT ODDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Dick Mitchell volunteered last winter to raise money for
the ``Save the Horses'' initiative on the Nov. 3 California ballot,
campaign leader Kathleen Doyle was surprised.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell is a horseplayer, famous in the racing world for three
handicapping how-to books and the handicapping computer software
created by his Cynthia Publishing Company of Studio City. Doyle is
an animal-welfare advocate, and she figured a horseplayer for a
bottom-line guy without a sensitive bone in his lazy body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I quite honestly expected him to be (all about) `return on
investment,' in it for the buck,'' said Doyle, whose campaign is
also based in Studio City. ``I was taken back by his take on the
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   What she heard from Mitchell, 59, shattered the stereotype of
horse bettors. At press conferences and in letters to more than
9,000 fellow horseplayers on the Cynthia Publishing mailing list,
Mitchell has enthusiastically touted Proposition 6, which would
prohibit the slaughter of California horses for use as food in
countries where their meat is a delicacy.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 6 backers say about 10,000 horses a year are sold to
slaughter plants in Texas and Canada and suffer brutally painful
deaths. One-quarter of those, by one estimate, are former
racehorses.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell thinks that's a practice everybody should oppose,
especially racing fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real simple: I'm passionate about animal issues _
period,'' he said this week. ``I think the way we treat animals is
abominable... God, we go out there (to the track) every day and
they thrill us. And how do we thank them? We brutalize them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't wind up as a trainer's pet, they wind up in a
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Prop. 6 supporters aren't suggesting a retirement home can be
found for every used-up racehorse. They're promoting euthanasia as
a humane alternative to slaughter. Mitchell would also like to see
the elimination of the use of whips in racing and an end to the
racing of immature 2-year-olds. But first things first.
</P>
<P>
   The former Los Angeles City College math teacher said the
response to his letters has been modest but heartening: about
$5,000 in contributions, ranging from $5 and $10 ``votes of
confidence,'' to $100 and $200 checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``My general feeling, just being around handicappers, is that
they're a decent lot that doesn't put up with cruelty,'' Mitchell
said. ``I have to characterize the average handicapper as a decent
soul.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed law is opposed by the Libertarian Party. But Doyle
said a poll showed 70 percent support.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle was amused by a recent conversation with Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Well, I !ital!guess!off! we're going to win,' ''
Doyle said. ``He said, `You're nuts! Of course this is going to
win! Coming out against this would be like coming out against
motherhood!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken with the conviction of a horseplayer.
</P>
<P>
   __ Let a pro do it: If, as expected, the clenbuterol charges
announced Monday against seven California trainers are challenged,
the cases probably will set a welcomed precedent on the way such
cases are resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Hearings will be presided over by an administrative law judge
and the California Horse Racing Board's side will be presented by
the state attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, medication hearings were conducted by track
stewards and the CHRB's case was put forth by state racing
investigators. It was like asking police officers to serve as
prosecutors, and it was no surprise when the amateurs' Hamilton
Bergers were outfoxed by the trainers' Perry Masons.
</P>
<P>
   CHRB spokesman Mike Marten said the change was made because of
the volume and complexity of the clenbuterol cases, and because the
board wanted to get in step with other state agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing dates have yet to be scheduled and no verdicts should be
expected before the new year in the cases involving trainers Ted
West, Vladimir Cerin, Peter Eurton, Paco Gonzalez, Bruce Headley,
Declan Jackson and Darrell Vienna and 14 horses whose postrace
tests revealed the presence of the bronchial-dilator clenbuterol.
</P>
<P>
   __ The weekend: The short Fairplex Park racing season ends
Sunday with the Ralph M. Hinds Pomona Invitational Handicap, in
which Score Quick will try to defend his 1997 title for trainer Mel
Stute and jockey Matt Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   The 1[-mile Invitational has produced seven repeat winners in
the past 45 years, most recently Elegant Bargain in '90-91.
</P>
<P>
   Next on the calendar is the 32-day Oak Tree Racing Association
season at Santa Anita. It opens Wednesday at 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   __ Charmed and dangerous?: Silver Charm will try to salvage a
season gone bad when he races for the first time in nine weeks in
the Kentucky Cup Classic at Turfway Park on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A victory might persuade owners Bob and Beverly Lewis to pay the
supplemental nomination fee and finally challenge long-distance
rival Skip Away, now a lock for Horse of the Year, in the Nov. 7
Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   __ Less is more: The 1999 schedule approved last week by the
CHRB will offer 11 fewer dates than 1998, and that's a small but
worthwhile step toward easing the glut that has caused race fields
to shrink.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, there will be two days, instead of just one,
between the close of one track and the opening of the next. Even
Del Mar, which jealously guarded its annual 43-day allotment, will
have to cut back to 42 by opening on Thursday instead of Wednesday
next summer.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The proportion of Americans living in poverty
declined last year, mostly because of reductions in poverty among
black and Hispanic families, the Census Bureau reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The data reflected three consecutive years of growth in income,
which have restored household incomes and poverty to the levels
recorded in 1989, just before the last recession.
</P>
<P>
   The poverty rate was 13.3 percent last year, down from 13.7
percent in 1996 and 15.1 percent in 1993. The number of people in
poverty, 35.6 million last year, has dropped by 3.7 million since
1993.
</P>
<P>
   The poverty rate for non-Hispanic whites was unchanged at 8.6
percent last year. But the rate for blacks declined to 26.5
percent, the lowest since the government began collecting data on
poverty among African Americans in 1959. The rate among blacks was
28.4 percent in 1996 and 33.1 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   And the poverty rate for Hispanic Americans declined to 27.1
percent, from 29.4 percent in 1996 _ the largest one-year drop in
Hispanic poverty since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   The data were a tonic for President Clinton, battered by months
of embarrassing disclosures about his affair with a White House
intern.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the statistics vindicated his economic policies and
showed that low-income people were finally sharing the fruits of a
vibrant economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our growing economy is giving more and more families a chance
to work their way out of poverty,'' he said in the Rose Garden of
the White House. ``After six years, it can't be an accident
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidents generally get credit for economic growth and are
blamed if the economy declines. Clinton fought successfully for
increases in the minimum wage and in the earned-income tax credit
available to low-income workers, and White House officials said
those changes had helped reduce poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said that much of the decline in poverty was
attributable to the overall strength of the economy, resulting from
prudent management of federal spending and interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks have been among the president's most steadfast supporters
in recent months, and Thursday's data show that they have fared
well in the Clinton years.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the number of families in poverty declined last year
by 384,000, to 7.3 million from 7.7 million in 1996. Black families
accounted for more than half of the decrease.
</P>
<P>
   The welfare rolls are declining much faster than the number of
people in poverty. But Rebecca Blank, of the President's Council of
Economic Advisers, said, ``It's way too early to look at these
numbers and conclude very much about the successes of welfare
reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats have predicted that cuts in welfare programs,
such as time limits on the payment of cash assistance, will tend to
increase poverty. On the other hand, many Republicans say poverty
will decline as mothers move from welfare to work and fathers pay
more child support. In any event, it will be hard to separate the
specific effects of the 1996 welfare law from changes in the
economy. The Census Bureau found surprisingly robust growth in
income even among families headed by women. The incomes of
households headed by women rose last year by 8 percent for blacks,
10.3 percent for Hispanic Americans and 3 percent for whites. Among
non-Hispanic whites, hardly any change was seen.
</P>
<P>
   The poverty rate for children was under 20 percent last year for
the first time since 1989, and Clinton said child poverty had
declined more since 1993 than in any other four-year period since
the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   But the poverty rate for people 18 to 64 years old was higher
last year than in 1987-89. And for households headed by people 35
to 54, income has not kept pace with inflation, so real income was
lower last year than in 1989, the bureau said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Politicians have repeatedly denounced growing inequality in
income distribution. But Census Bureau officials said their data
suggested that inequality had stabilized.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the fourth consecutive year in which there was no
year-to-year change in overall income inequality,'' said Daniel
Weinberg, chief of the Census Bureau office that collects income
data.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Robert Reischauer, former director of the Congressional
Budget Office, said it was remarkable that ``income inequality has
not been reduced after two years in which we've enjoyed the
healthiest economy in more than three decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg said the bureau's field interviewers probably missed
many people with very high incomes, just as they miss homeless
people. He said, anyone who reports income of more than $1 million
a year is listed as having $1 million of income.
</P>
<P>
   The data in the report are drawn from interviews with residents
of 50,000 households chosen to be representative of the nation. A
family of four was classified as poor if it had cash income of less
than $16,400 in 1997. The threshold for a family of three was
$12,802. Income, as officially defined, does not include capital
gains, health insurance or government benefits like food stamps,
Medicaid and housing subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau data show that the income of black households,
after adjusting for inflation, was higher in 1997 than at any other
time in the last three decades.
</P>
<P>
   The median income of black households rose 4.3 percent last
year, to $25,050, and since 1993 it has increased by 15 percent, or
$3,354, after adjusting for inflation. The number of households
above the median is the same as the number below it.
</P>
<P>
   For Hispanic households, the median income rose 4.5 percent last
year, to $26,628, and has risen 4.8 percent since 1993. But
Hispanic income appears to have stagnated and is about the same,
after adjusting for inflation, as in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the Census Bureau also made these points:
</P>
<P>
   _ Median household income rose last year by 1.9 percent, to
$37,005 from $36,306, after adjusting for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   _ State poverty rates, measured by three-year averages, ranged
from an extraordinary low of 6.9 percent in New Hampshire to a high
of 24 percent in New Mexico. The next highest rates were found in
Mississippi (20.2 percent) and Louisiana (18.8 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The report also said the number of blacks in poverty dropped
last year to 9.1 million, from 9.7 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Hispanic people in poverty declined to 8.3
million, from 8.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ A majority of all poor families are headed by women. There are
7.3 million poor families in America, and 4 million are headed by
women.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the bureau said that the poverty rate for
noncitizens, 25 percent, was double the rate for people born in the
United States.

BLOOD ON BRONZE  
 A LOW-FAT FIGHT  
 CHANGE OF VENUE   
 PRESIDENTIAL MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 BY JAMES BARRON with ALEX KUCZYNSKI and JOYCE WADLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The jar marked ``blood'' was still open, but Yoko Ono
had finished spattering the substance on the bronze replica of a
man's blue shirt.
</P>
<P>
   The red stuff was not blood but a resin mixture. The bullet hole
over the pocket was real, though _ the sculpture had been shot at
by workers at the foundry in Brewster, N.Y., where it was cast.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ono said it was the second such shirt she had made. The
first, she said, was made several years ago, when she prepared an
exhibition of small surrealistic objects, including a box, a
hairbrush and a pair of high heels. All had been spattered with the
red resin mixture.
</P>
<P>
   To many viewers, the items she chose symbolized her proximity to
the assassination of her husband, John Lennon. But she said the
idea of displaying what appeared to be bloody objects began as a
``feminist statement.'' Later she decided to include the man's
shirt because ``I wanted to show that men are subject to violence,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Foundry workers said they had been told the shirt had belonged
to Lennon. Absolutely not, Ms. Ono said. ``It could be any guy's.
It symbolizes New Age man, as opposed to Edwardian man.''
</P>
<P>
   But one would have to be as strong as Hercules to wear this
shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people think it's real,'' she said. ``Then they bump into
it.''
</P>
<P>
   A Low-Fat Fight
</P>
<P>
   Michael Milken, whose hunger for junk bonds led to an
unappetizing stay in prison after his conviction for securities
fraud, has developed a taste for Caesar salads.
</P>
<P>
   Not just any Caesar salads, but the 51-calorie kind.
</P>
<P>
   Milken, who is helping to organize a conference and candelight
vigil in Washington to focus attention on what he calls the
``cancer epidemic,'' has written a cookbook with low-calorie,
low-fat recipes.
</P>
<P>
   The vice chairman of Barnes &AMP; Noble, Leonard Riggio, will give a
party for ``The Taste for Living Cookbook: Mike Milken's Favorite
Recipes For Fighting Cancer'' in New York on Monday. Don't expect
the canapes to be foie gras.
</P>
<P>
   Milken's doctor told him five years ago that he had 12 to 18
months to live. Since then, he has been a tireless fund-raiser for
cancer-fighting charities and a tireless critic of what he says is
America's unbusinesslike approach to cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're spending $107 billion a year on cancer care and $2
billion a year on research. No business would spend 2 percent
trying to fix the problem and 98 percent trying to service the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Change of Venue
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You know what happens when new owners take over a
restaurant: the old, familiar things are changed. The menu, maybe.
The paintings on the walls, for sure.
</P>
<P>
   But a portrait of James Beard, the influential chef and cookbook
writer who died in 1985, has not gone from the Four Seasons
restaurant to a flea market.
</P>
<P>
   The Arbit Blatas painting had hung in a private room in the
restaurant on East 52nd Street for years. But the new co-owners,
Julian Niccolini and Alex von Bidder, decided it was time to change
things. So the painting came down. Thursday night Niccolini and von
Bidder presented it to the James Beard Foundation, a nonprofit
group with headquarters in the town house Beard owned on West 12th
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Niccolini and von Bidder didn't like Beard _ or didn't
like the painting as much as the former owners, Tom Margittai and
Paul Kovi?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely fond of James Beard,'' said Niccolini, who once
worked at the Four Seasons as a headwaiter. ``I'm here over 20
years. He used to come in almost every day; he never gets a check.
One day I mention this to Margittai. He says: `Don't worry about
it. If James Beard ever saw a check, he would faint. He has been a
friend here forever.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Presidential Music
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is scheduled to fly to Chicago Friday Tena
Clark knows what he will hear if he picks up the earphones and
listens to the in-flight sound system. She chose the music.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force One carries several of the 22 channels she programs
for United Airlines (classical, country, pop, jazz and something
called ``center stage,'' which features everyone from Tom Petty to
Eric Clapton to the president's brother, Roger Clinton). Hoping to
give the First Saxophonist what he would like to hear, she also
created an all-saxophone channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I really sat there and thought about it, it would be pretty
overwhelming to think that you're programming music for someone
that powerful,'' said Ms. Clark, who changes the music every 60
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we tried to do is look at it like he was no different
from anybody else: what is this person really going to like?''

EDITORIAL: REAL REFORM VERSUS MAYORAL EXPEDIENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Sept. 25:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The rumbling from New York's City Hall suggests that
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is ready to veto an excellent campaign
finance reform package passed last month by the City Council. The
Council can easily override the mayor's veto, but Giuliani would
send a far more worthy signal to New Yorkers if he would simply let
these reforms pass, either by signing the three bills or stepping
aside and letting them become law.
</P>
<P>
   Recently the mayor has been arguing that these reforms, pushed
by Council Speaker Peter Vallone and Public Advocate Mark Green,
would cost the city too much money. The city's Campaign Finance
Board has come up with a very rough estimate that the cost of an
election would double _ from $6.5 million in 1997 to $13 million in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the amounts are relatively tiny. The board's current
report cites a quote from Giuliani in 1991 explaining that the cost
of the city's campaign finance system is ``infinitesimal. You can't
find it (in the city budget). It's a percentage of a percentage of
a percentage.'' An infinitesimal amount, even if quadrupled, is
still a pittance compared with the public cost of having
politicians more beholden to special interests than to the voters
who elected them.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has also been arguing for his own campaign reform
package prepared for a referendum on the Nov. 3 ballot by his
Charter Revision Commission. But this is an ill-considered product
rushed out to bump Vallone's referendum on Yankee Stadium from the
ballot. Although Vallone's measure barring use of city money to
move the Yankees to Manhattan was also ill advised, the charter
item that replaces it is just as unnecessary. Moreover, it could
complicate the Council's reforms that will make the city's campaign
finance law one of the fairest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Charter Commission's referendum, already opposed by Common
Cause/NY and other public advocates, is a bad substitute for the
reforms now sitting on the mayor's desk. Perhaps he should take the
weekend off and let them become law on Monday morning.

EDITORIAL: A WILD WILD-CARD RACE

 (ATTN: Ill.)  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Sept. 25:
</P>
<P>
   For the last month, while the Yankees have been marking time,
the New York Mets have been playing the most exciting baseball in
the City of New York. Besides reawakening the interest of many fans
who deserted them earlier in the decade, they have raised the
possibility, however faint, that two New York teams could meet in
the World Series for the first time since the Dodgers-Yankees
series of 1956. But first the Mets have to win a spot in the
playoffs, which in turn means disengaging themselves from the
Chicago Cubs, with whom they have been locked in an energetic if
slightly bizarre tango for the least seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   During that period, no more than one game has ever separated the
two teams in the standings. When one plays well, so does the other.
When one falters, the other falters. One week ago, with both teams
playing well, the Cubs defeated the San Diego Padres in a crucial
series in which Sammy Sosa went on a tear, driving in all six runs
in one game, four of them with his 63rd home run. Meanwhile, the
Mets won three of four games from the Houston Astros with
late-inning heroics, including home runs from Brian McRae, John
Olerud and Mike Piazza. On the downside, the Cubs lost a game they
should have won on Wednesday afternoon when the left fielder
dropped a a routine fly ball. Hours later the Mets returned the
favor by losing 3-0 to the feeble Montreal Expos, a team that has
scared nobody this year except the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Should both teams swoon in the three days left in the regular
season _ the tango, as it were, becoming a danse macabre _ the San
Francisco Giants could ease into the wild-card spot. But that is
not our dream scenario. Our own rooting interest here lies with the
Mets, even though that would deny Sosa a well-deserved chance to
display his talents on the postseason stage.

FRANCELIA BUTLER, 85, CHAMPION OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Ohio, Va., Tenn., Maine)  (mk) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS JR.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Francelia Butler, a late-blooming academic of such passionate,
unorthodox ways that she has been credited with almost
single-handedly transforming the study of children's literature
from a stepchild of library science into a recognized academic
discipline, died last Friday at a nursing home in Windham, Conn. A
resident of Mansfield Hollow, Conn., she was 85 and had been a
professor at the University of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   When they hired her in 1965, it's a safe bet that the men who
ran the English department at the University of Connecticut knew
that Dr. Butler, a native of Cleveland who grew up in Elyria, Ohio,
was a 52-year-old widow who had returned to school after her
husband's death, received a doctorate in Renaissance literature
from the University of Virginia just two years earlier and spent
the intervening years teaching at the University of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   It's an even safer bet that her Connecticut superiors did not
know that in 1934, as a fresh Oberlin College graduate with a
degree in the classics, Dr. Butler had gone to Washington to write
a pamphlet for an education association on ``The Brotherhood of
Man'' and been swiftly dismissed from the project after overriding
her boss' directive to go easy on Hitler lest she offend
association members who agreed with Hitler's policies.
</P>
<P>
   Or that she had been dismissed from her next job, as publicity
director of a segregated Washington hotel, after letting black
Oberlin alumni attend a banquet there.
</P>
<P>
   Had they been aware of her record of ad hoc social activism, her
superiors might have had second thoughts about relegating Dr.
Butler, a small woman with a will of steel, to children's
literature, a course so scorned by the Connecticut English faculty
that it was known derisively as ``kiddie lit.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly her superiors would not have been as surprised as they
were when Dr. Butler, sensing that the academic disdain for
children's literature reflected a disdain both for children and for
women as children's traditional caretakers and teachers, proceeded
to turn the course into a platform for reform.
</P>
<P>
   The faculty's sneers at her course were understandable. Although
children's literature had been taught in American universities
since the turn of the century, generally as part of the library
science or education curriculums, it was a reflection of the
subject's lowly standing that it had no academic association and no
academic journal.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Butler swiftly made up for lost time. Among other things she
established the journal Children's Literature, helped to create the
children's literature division of the Modern Language Association
and served as a founding director of the Children's Literature
Association in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way Dr. Butler's own course became one of the largest
and most popular at the University of Connecticut, in part because
she turned it into something resembling a three-ring circus with a
string of guest lecturers that included falconers, puppeteers,
troubadours, Maurice Sendak, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Bruno
Bettelheim, Dr. Benjamin Spock, Big Bird and the Wicked Witch of
the West (the actress Margaret Hamilton.)
</P>
<P>
   Some of her colleagues predictably complained that the course's
success was based more on showmanship than scholarship, but Dr.
Butler, many of whose students went on to to teach children's
literature at other colleges, was no slacker as a scholar.
</P>
<P>
   She turned out reams of scholarly papers, edited anthologies and
in 1989 published ``Skipping Around the World,'' an exhaustive
study of international jump-rope rhymes.
</P>
<P>
   For all the acclaim she won, Dr. Butler chafed at what she saw
as Connecticut's indifference or active opposition to her efforts
to wrest children's literature from its vocational moorings and
locate it within the humanities.
</P>
<P>
   When, by her account, her upstart Journal was actually banned
from the University of Connecticut bookstore, Dr. Butler found
another academic sponsor: Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   Although her male colleagues suggested that the university had
been more supportive than she claimed, after her retirement in 1992
at the age of 79, Dr. Butler, who typically had led the campaign
that overturned Connecticut's mandatory retirement at 70,
transferred her journal and her papers to Hollins College in
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her daughter, Ann Wandell of Windham; a
brother, Bruce McWilliams of Little Deer Isle, Maine; four
grandchildren and one great-grandchild.

ANALYSIS: THE DEMOCRATS FAN OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ind., Mass., Ill., Mich.)  (See also: CLINTON-POLL, CLINTON-CONGRESS, CLINTON-REPUBS-MONEY,
CLINTON-PRESS, CLINTON-DEMS, CLINTON-REPUBS-EXPAND.) 
(mk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the report of Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater
independent counsel, landed like a bombshell on Capitol Hill, the
devastating questions all concerned President Clinton's behavior.
But in the weeks since then, Democrats have done everything they
can to refocus the spotlight onto congressional Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Using the aggressive defense tactics that they have perfected
across three years of fighting Republican investigations _ from the
inquiry into Whitewater by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., to the
examination of campaign finance abuses by Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind. _
the Democrats are fanning out in formation each day to switch the
subject away from the president.
</P>
<P>
   And so the issue, amplified in televised news conferences,
becomes whether House Republicans want to release documents too
hastily. Or whether Starr has some hidden information that might be
helpful to the president. Or why Republicans will not agree to end
the entire impeachment inquiry in a month.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., asked why Republicans
were willing to put out the videotape of Clinton but seemed to be
leaning toward giving out edited transcripts, rather than tapes, of
Linda Tripp's tape recordings of Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``There does seem to be one consistent principle guiding them:
to make the president look bad,'' Frank said. (But even while
taking Republicans to task, Frank acknowledged that he himself
opposed the release of the tapes.)
</P>
<P>
   The point of this kind of scrapping is to make an impeachment
proceeding _ the most extraordinary and serious congressional
investigation of them all _ sound to the American public like just
another partisan dogfight on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   And against that backdrop Clinton, regaining some of his
confidence, sailed in Thursday to criticize partisanship, outlining
policy challenges before the nation and adding, ``The right thing
to do is if we all put progress over partisanship, put people over
politics, put the American people first.''
</P>
<P>
   There are already indications of shifts in public opinion,
though it is not clear how much of this is due to any kind of
Democratic-White House damage control and how much it is Americans'
sorting out how they feel about the rapid-fire revelations of the
past month.
</P>
<P>
   Since Clinton's grand jury testimony was broadcast on Monday,
the president's standing with the public has strengthened and
people have directed their ire against the House Judiciary
Committee, which presides over impeachment proceedings, and Starr,
according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll. And nearly
two-thirds of Americans said the Republicans were not trying to
judge the accusations against Clinton fairly.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, in some exasperation, say the Democrats are not
even consistent in their demands. On Wednesday, even as Rep.
Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., the House minority leader, was urging that
impeachment deliberations be wrapped up in little more than a month
for the sake of the nation, he was also calling on Starr to turn
over another 20 boxes of evidence to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans have given the Democrats openings, even as
they emphasize bipartisanship.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican majority on the House Judiciary Committee
requested that a federal judge send the committee Clinton's
videotaped deposition in Paula Corbin Jones' sexual harassment case
without first consulting committee Democrats. Republicans have been
grudging about Democrats' requests that they too have subpoena
power, should a full-scale impeachment inquiry be approved by the
House.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Newt Gingrich himself handed Democrats a political gift
when he alone answered reporters' questions about impeachment after
a bipartisan leadership meeting on Wednesday, making himself the
face of the impeachment deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   It may well have been inadvertent. Gephardt had refused a joint
appearance with the speaker and Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman
of the House Judiciary Committee, was still in a side room
negotiating with his Democratic counterpart, Rep. John Conyers Jr.
of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McCurry, the White House press secretary, immediately said
that Gingrich was the one calling the shots on impeachment in the
House and painted him as an extremist. This is the same strategy
the White House used in 1995 to temper the Republican revolution
and to win re-election in 1996. And for Democrats, a personalized
fight with Gingrich has many benefits.
</P>
<P>
   While the speaker is idolized among the Republican faithful, he
still is not popular with the public at large. Moderate
Republicans, who have reservations about impeachment, become
nervous when the speaker becomes too prominent. And nothing rallies
Democrats like being against Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask a House Democrat how they feel about Bill Clinton,
you'll get a broad range of answers,'' a Democratic strategist
said. ``But they all feel the same about Newt Gingrich.''
</P>
<P>
   So on Thursday Republicans sought to return the focus to
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please don't forget, when all the distractions and definitions
have been pronounced, at the end of it all, we are about one mighty
task _ to vindicate the rule of law,'' Hyde said at a packed news
conference. ``Therefore it's important to keep our eye on the ball
and not get distracted by attempts to cut deals or cry wolf about
partisanship.''
</P>
<P>
   With a touch of humor, he also asserted that he, not the
speaker, was in control of his committee. ``All I know is that
whenever I give advice to Newt, he nods his head affirmatively,''
Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   And behind the scenes, the White House and Democrats kept trying
to find the right combination of reprimand, censure or fine that
could seem like a stern-enough punishment for the president.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that the Republicans have already said they will not
accept a deal and therefore short-circuit the impeachment process.
This is a deal being designed for Democrats, according to those
involved in the negotiations.

WILLIAM PIEL JR., 88, EX-CORPORATE LAWYER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)  (js) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Piel Jr., a leading corporate lawyer of his time, died
Sept. 13 at his home in Sherman, Conn. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Piel joined the law firm of Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell in 1935 and
became a partner in 1946. At his retirement in 1980 he was the
firm's senior litigating partner.
</P>
<P>
   Born in New York City on Nov. 28, 1909, Piel graduated in 1932
from Princeton University. He entered Harvard Law School and joined
Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell soon after graduation.
</P>
<P>
   Piel served as lead counsel at trial and on appeal for a lengthy
roster of corporate America, including Phillips Petroleum Co. and
Eastman Kodak Co.
</P>
<P>
   When Kodak was assessed $112.8 million by a federal court jury
in 1978, after accusations by Berkey Photo Inc. that Kodak used its
technological dominance to restrict competition, Kodak turned to
Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell to overturn the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Piel led the appeal in what was widely regarded as an uphill
fight. In 1981, eight years after the antitrust suit was filed, a
settlement was reached in which Kodak agreed to pay $4.8 million in
cash and $2 million in credits to be applied toward the purchase of
Kodak goods.
</P>
<P>
   Piel is survived by his wife of 46 years, the former Eleanor
Green, a novelist and short-story writer; three sons by a previous
marriage, Michael, of Longwood, Fla., Anthony, of Crassy-Divonne,
France, and Joel Thomas, of Sherman, and by his former wife, Mary
Loomis, of Sharon, Conn.

ALL THAT CHAZZ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Throughout Cal State Northridge's training camp,
the NFL scouts came to see running back Melvin Blue, but invariably
their attention was diverted to a 6-foot-3, 207-pound cornerback.
He had quick feet, covered the small and speedy CSUN receivers
wonderfully, was physical and could tackle. And he rarely allowed a
completion.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and he was big, which is what the NFL scouts kept coming
back to. One of the biggest cornerbacks in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always wanted to know who that cat was, so I figured that
out early and just started pointing him out,'' CSUN coach Ron
Ponciano said. ``I'm just echoing what other scouts have said, but
he's got the potential to play in the NFL. When you have that many
people visit and say, `Who is that guy?,' then you know you have
something special.''
</P>
<P>
   That guy is junior Chazz Moore. In scouts' eyes, the most
important thing he does is run 40 yards in 4.4 seconds. And he
should get faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm dedicating the whole (offseason) to speed,'' said Moore,
who makes his home debut Saturday as CSUN hosts Eastern Washington
at 3:05 p.m. ``I was telling coach Ponciano I was going to play
basketball this season, too, because I can play basketball, and a
scout was telling me he'd rather see me run track and improve my
speed so when I would go to the (NFL) combine I would have good
speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to run track, but I'm going to have some kind of
speed coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Unquestionably, it is Moore's size that initially intrigues
anyone watching, but it is his ability to cover that will cause
scouts to chart his progress during the next two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Matadors defensive coordinator Craig Wall said it took only a
few practices for him to be comfortable with Moore's shift from
safety to cornerback, a move necessitated by CSUN's lack of depth
at the corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottom line in covering is speed, and he has it,'' Wall said.
``It was apparent right away that he could cover. He's got speed
and he's got athleticism.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore's technique already was solid, but there was a question
whether he possessed the all-important cornerback mentality, the
one allowing a guy to get torched one play and cover superbly
thereafter. That question was answered after two games.
</P>
<P>
   Moore was beaten by Rodney Smith for a touchdown in the second
quarter in the season opener at Boise State. He didn't get beat
again.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, he shut down one of the Big Sky Conference's top
receivers, Northern Arizona's Francis St. Paul. St. Paul made two
catches for 14 yards. In addition, Moore forced two fumbles in the
game, one of which he returned 93 yards for a touchdown. Add five
tackles and a sack and Moore was named the conference's defensive
player of the week.
</P>
<P>
   But even Moore knows he is far from being a finished product.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting an opportunity to play a lot of man, so coach
wants me to get my hands on the wide receivers,'' Moore said.
``Technique-wise, I have to get better playing off of the ball. I
know I'm a real good man-to-man player when it comes to jamming and
getting my hands on them, but I think getting out of my backpedal
on the quick routes, I have to get better at that.''

EDITORIAL: IRAN'S DIPLOMATIC OFFENSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Sept. 25:
</P>
<P>
   Iranian government leaders consolidated several days of
effective public diplomacy at the United Nations Thursday by
formally repudiating their country's death threat against Salman
Rushdie, the British writer. Though the announcement by Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi does not entirely eliminate the danger to
Rushdie, the author of ``The Satanic Verses,'' it would appear to
end any government role in trying to kill him. Rejection of the
assassination threat removes one of the primary obstacles to
improved relations between the United States and Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   The death threat, or fatwa, has disgraced Iran since it was
imposed in 1989 by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Along with the 1979
seizure of American hostages, the threat symbolized the vindictive
policies of the clerics who turned Iran into an Islamic
fundamentalist state. Rushdie was forced to spend much of the last
decade in hiding and under heavy guard.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, where Rushdie lives, quickly restored relations with
Iran Thursday. The United States should not move so swiftly. For
one thing, an Iranian foundation still offers a $2.5 million bounty
to anyone who kills Rushdie, and it is unclear whether the
spiritual leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei, accepts the lifting of the
death threat. But even if Rushdie is soon in the clear, other
issues need to be resolved. Iran must give up its effort to fashion
nuclear weapons and end all support for terrorist groups. The
Iranian government has backed away from such assistance, but has
yet to make the kind of clear declaration it did about Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
   Still, these have been potentially productive days in the
evolution of Iran's cautious opening to the United States.
President Mohammad Khatami, in his first visit to America since his
election a year ago, presented himself and his government as forces
for moderation in Iran. The self-portrait was largely supported by
the steps he has taken at home to ease the clerical stranglehold on
many aspects of Iranian life.
</P>
<P>
   Though Khatami said it was premature to open an official
dialogue with Washington, and Kharrazi pointedly avoided a U.N.
meeting about Afghanistan so he would not encounter Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, the Iranians seemed eager to shed their
country's menacing image. By removing the government's gun from
Rushdie's head, they clearly advanced that goal.

TV SPORTS: ABC LOSING ITS HOLD ON MONDAY RATINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's ailing ABC's ``Monday Night Football''?
</P>
<P>
   Through three weeks _ one competitive game and two blowouts _
the Nielsen rating is down 11 percent from last season, to a 13.6,
a record low for ``Monday Night Football.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it the early start time? Competition from baseball? The
peculiar pre-game show? Bereft Frank Gifford fans protesting his
being replaced by Boomer Esiason, who was also the host of last
Saturday's Miss America Pageant on ABC? Is it viewers missing the
game to apply for loans from Advanta National Bank on the sage
advice of the pitchman Dan Dierdorf, a ``Monday Night Football''
analyst? Or is it wrestling?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's early, and we've had a couple of games that weren't
competitive,'' said Brian McAndrews, executive vice president of
ABC Sports. ``We're winning our time period,'' he added, ``but we'd
be happier if we were up.''
</P>
<P>
   The soundest alibi ABC can muster is that viewers in the Central
time zone have been big-time Nielsen culprits. Through three games,
that time zone's rating is off 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And no wonder: only one game so far has featured a team, Dallas,
from the Central time zone, but the Cowboys play in the National
Football Conference's East Division. The best bet for Central zone
recovery: Oct. 5's Minnesota-Green Bay matchup.
</P>
<P>
   What is surprising is that viewers in the West are tuning out
less than any region except for the East, though they must tune in
at 5 p.m. Through three games, the Pacific time zone rating is down
only 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monday Night Blast,'' the pre-game show, pushes the kickoff to
8:20 p.m., 47 minutes before the old start. Now, ``MNF'' is vying
against not only other networks' prime-time programming, but also
against professional wrestling: from 8-11 p.m. from TNT's ``WCW
Monday Nitro'' and from 9-11 p.m. from USA's ``WWF Raw.''
</P>
<P>
   Who knows how many devoted fans of Goldberg, Hulk Hogan or Ric
Flair switched from WCW's scripted, costumed grappling at 9 o'clock
on TNT last year to the unscripted, costumed grappling on ``MNF''?
</P>
<P>
   Now, the early start for ``MNF'' has created head-to-head
competition at 8 o'clock for the hearts and souls of violence
lovers, a desperate choice between Brett Favre and Stone Cold Steve
Austin, Barry Sanders and the Undertaker.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling's ratings are up on both cable networks. TNT is
averaging a 4.7, up from a 4.2, and USA is averaging a 4.0, up from
a 2.3. The combined 8.7 cable rating is the equivalent of a 6.5
broadcast rating.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the soft focus of ``Monday Night Blast'' helps wrestling
start strong. The ``Blast's'' host, Chris Berman, is no action
hero, so ABC's solution may be to start the game immediately, at 8
o'clock.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Blast,'' which emanates from the ESPN Zone, a sports bar
in Baltimore, remains a work in progress. It is improving, becoming
less frantic and more comprehensible. Still, last Monday's was a
strange amalgam of football chat from the announcers; noise from an
ESPN Zoneful of masticating patrons; a feel-good feature (Cowboys
quarterback Jason Garrett and his father, Jim) introduced by
Gifford from a quiz show's soundproof booth and a feature with an
ABC star (``Spin City's'' Michael J. Fox at the Giants' camp).
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal wasn't how do we promote `Spin City,' but who do we
get that would be great on the show?'' McAndrews said. ABC
commentator George Will is in talks to be Reggie White's
conservative dogma-spouting tackling dummy on Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   At halftime, Berman hurtled through ESPN's Top 10 Plays of the
Week (including one of Esiason high-fiving a Miss America
contestant), and Willie Nelson rewrote one of his songs as a paean
to ``Monday Night Football.'' ABC is soliciting well-known singers
to do as Willie did. Too bad Tiny Tim is dead.
</P>
<P>
   A SENSIBLE IDEA: ESPN wants to erase doubt in viewers' minds
about how far the offense must go for a first down. Sure,
announcers say it and you may see a yardstick on top of the screen.
But now, Sportvision, a new technology company, will electronically
insert a yellow line marking the first down. The line could be
visible in a typical camera shot or appear in a third-and-long
situation when the camera follows a receiver as he runs over it.
</P>
<P>
   The line is accurate within 6 inches, so it will not be the
ultimate judge in short-yardage situations. Think of it as a
reference point. But it will be bound to provoke arguments. ``This
is meant to help viewers, not as a tool to scrutinize officials any
more than they already are,'' said Jed Drake, an ESPN vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   The system will be used exclusively by ESPN through the regular
season, but could be seen on ABC's National Football League playoff
games and college bowl games.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, expect all networks to use it.

LAWYERS FOR JONES AND CLINTON ARE SEEKING TO SETTLE LAWSUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: The following story is an added starter on The New York Times
front page.) (lh) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawyers for Paula Jones and President Clinton said
Thursday they are engaged in serious discussions about reaching a
financial settlement to end her sexual-misconduct lawsuit, which
set off the events that led to the possible impeachment action
against Clinton that is now before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers said that the latest effort to resolve the lawsuit
began more than a week ago, when lawyers for Mrs. Jones contacted
Robert Bennett, Clinton's private lawyer, and made a proposal with
an extraordinary concession. The Jones lawyers said they would
agree to drop their appeal of the lawsuit, which was dismissed last
April, without an apology from Clinton if he paid her $1 million.
For the first time after several rounds of previous settlement
talks, an apology was not one of Mrs. Jones' conditions for
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett initially rejected the offer, but on Wednesday he
telephoned Mrs. Jones' lawyers in Dallas and asked if they would
consider $500,000, according to lawyers familiar with the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   One of the lawyers said he was not sure what the result of the
latest negotiations would be, but added, ``This is as serious as
it's ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement discussions, first disclosed in the Washington
Post in its early Friday editions, closely track overtures this
week by the White House to make a deal with lawmakers on Capitol
Hill to avoid a months-long impeachment inquiry into whether
Clinton lied and obstructed justice in the Jones case. But
Republicans have rebuffed Democrats' proposals that Clinton be
subject to a censure and fine, and have insisted on proceeding with
impeachment deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   How a settlement in the Jones case would affect the
deliberations in Congress was unknown. The Whitewater independent
counsel, Kenneth Starr, has asserted in his impeachment report to
Congress that Clinton deliberately covered up an affair with Monica
Lewinsky, a White House intern, to evade charges of sexual
harassment in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 17, when Clinton admitted the affair in grand jury
testimony and to the nation, the Jones lawyers said they would use
his admissions as part of their appeal. In his grand jury
testimony, the president insisted that he did not commit perjury in
his Jones deposition on Jan. 17, when he denied having ``sexual
relations'' with Ms. Lewinsky. He testified, in a videotape
released this past Monday, that he engaged in ``inappropriate''
intimate physical contact with Ms. Lewinsky, but would not
elaborate, despite repeated attempts by prosecutors to press him on
the details.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his lawyers have based their arguments that he did
not commit perjury on a narrow definition used in the Jones case.
Clinton himself said he did not consider oral sex to be included in
that definition _ an act described by Ms. Lewinsky in her grand
jury testimony as the most common form of sex between the two.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton were to settle the Jones lawsuit, it might not
eliminate his legal culpability for his misleading and possibly
perjurious answers in the Jones deposition. But some White House
advisers said that if the Jones lawsuit ended, some of the energy
behind the anger over Clinton's behavior might dissipate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The judge in the Jones case, Susan Webber Wright, had suggested
in a recent opinion that she might hold Clinton in contempt for his
answers in the Jones deposition, since he had since admitted to a
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Previous efforts to settle the lawsuit always foundered on
bitter disagreement between the sides over whether and to what
degree Clinton would acknowledge the accuracy of Mrs. Jones'
accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones has charged that in 1991, when Clinton was governor
of Arkansas and she was a state clerical employee working at a job
fair in the lobby of a Little Rock hotel, he summoned to his suite
and made a crude sexual advance.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Wright decided in April that even if those accusations
were true, they did not meet the legal standard for sexual
harassment or deprivation of constitutional rights, as Mrs. Jones
had claimed.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals is scheduled to
hear Mrs. Jones' appeal of that ruling in St. Paul, Minn., on Oct.
20.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones' lawyers have said they planned to argue to the
appeals court that Starr's impeachment report to Congress bolsters
their case.
</P>
<P>
   In his grand jury testimony, Clinton repeatedly lashed out at
the Jones legal team and its strategy of pursuing him.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so their strategy, since they were being funded by my
political opponents, was to have this dragnet of discovery,'' he
complained. ``They wanted to cover everybody. And they convinced
the judge, because she gave them strict orders not to leak, that
they should be treated like other plaintiffs in other civil cases.
And how could they ever know whether there had been any sexual
harassment unless they first knew whether there had been sex?
</P>
<P>
   ``And so with that broad mandate, limited by time and employment
in the federal/state government, they proceeded to cross the
country and try to turn up whatever they could _ not because they
thought it would help their case. By the time they did this
discovery, they knew what the deal was in that case. And they knew
what was going to happen. Judge Wright subsequently threw it out.''

DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR CONNECTICUT GOVERNOR BEGINS TV AD
CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD _ Trying to re-ignite her flagging campaign to unseat
Gov. John Rowland, U.S. Rep. Barbara Kennelly began her
long-delayed television campaign Thursday as the two met in the
first of a series of back-to-back, head-to-head appearances.
</P>
<P>
   With the start of Mrs. Kennelly's ads, Connecticut television
viewers are being given the candidates' conflicting views on
regulating health-maintenance organizations. But the onslaught will
be somewhat unbalanced. Rowland, a Republican, has spent about
$180,000 for 10 days of television ads, while Mrs. Kennelly, a
Democrat, plans to spend about $70,000 for the same length of time,
on stations that would include some cable outlets in the
Connecticut suburbs of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the intense pressure on modern candidates to reach
voters through television, Mrs. Kennelly had just two words when
asked how she felt about the start of her ads. ``Thank God,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Adopting a favorite plank of Democratic candidates throughout
the country this year, Mrs. Kennelly has been arguing that patients
should have the right to sue a health maintenance organization that
denies or delays care. Her commercial features a white-coated
doctor from Fairfield County bashing ``HMO bureaucrats.'' Rowland
anticipated his opponent's assault on the issue and began running
ads last week highlighting steps the state had already taken to
make health care more widely available.
</P>
<P>
   That theme pervaded remarks the candidates made in consecutive
appearances Thursday at a luncheon given by the Greater Danbury
Chamber of Commerce. Mrs. Kennelly said she was running to make
Connecticut great again, while Rowland said the state had never
been better off. It was the first of nine such joint appearances,
in which the candidates are to speak separately; they will also
take part in four debates.
</P>
<P>
   For Mrs. Kennelly, it was a tough room. Danbury, which tends to
vote Republican, is in a district that Rowland used to represent in
Congress, and the moderator was a Republican who used to be speaker
of the Connecticut House of Representatives. No one in the audience
had a question for Mrs. Kennelly, and she left after her speech.
Rowland egged the crowd into asking question after question, then
stayed for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Kennelly entered the race last year, polls showed her
and Rowland in a tie. Taking action in areas where he was
vulnerable and undertaking a year-long television campaign, Rowland
built a strong lead that in one recent poll stood at 37 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennelly's ads were released Thursday and are to be
broadcast starting on Friday. ``If an HMO makes a decision to delay
or deny health care and it injures a patient, they should be
responsible,'' Mrs. Kennelly says. Without referring directly to
Rowland, the doctor in the ad _ shown in a waiting room _ concludes
by saying, ``That's the difference. Barbara Kennelly will fight for
a Patient's Protection Act to improve your health care and make
HMOs liable for their decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, on the other hand, argues that an appeal process
enacted by the state Legislature should be given a chance to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want something that's workable, something that gives relief
to a patient or a family that's upset or feels that they haven't
gotten the right answers,'' Rowland said after his remarks
Thursday. ``The legal process takes an awfully long time.'' When
pressed about his opponent's ad, he said, ``Mrs. Kennelly has never
introduced an HMO bill in the 16 years she's been in Congress.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennelly said Rowland was a late convert to concern about
HMOs. ``He never said it in '95, '96, '97,'' she said. ``He waited
till '98 and he made a commercial. I've been working for health
care every year.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor in the ad is Steven Fisher, an internal-medicine
specialist who is based in Bridgeport. Fisher is a Democrat, and
said he hoped the issue would help Mrs. Kennelly reach across party
lines. ``My family has HMO insurance, too, I'm sorry to say,''
Fisher said. ``I talk about this every day. If I didn't get
involved, I should stop talking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennelly's campaign manager, Jonathan Pelto, said she knew
she would be far outspent by Rowland on television. ``By focusing
on the differences between the candidates and the issues people
really care about, we can be effective,'' Pelto said. ``As we enter
the final phase of the campaign, the paid media will allow us to
frame the debate and reach those who are most likely to
participate.''
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's forum, both candidates said that voters wanted
Congress to speed up its response to the charges against President
Clinton by the special counsel, Kenneth Starr. Mrs. Kennelly said
her e-mail, letters and phone calls from constituents had been
split on the issue until the release of Clinton's grand jury
testimony on Monday. Then, she said, more than three-quarters were
saying: `` `Leave him alone. Stop. Enough.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland suggested that Congress take a week's time out from
debating the issue. ``They ought to just go home,'' he said. ``Take
a break and get themselves back together. There's a feeding frenzy
taking place in Washington right now. It's not our best moment, and
it's not even partisan. It's not Republicans. It's not Democrats.
It's a mess.''

ALBERT MANISCALCO, 90, STATEN ISLAND POLITICAL LEADER
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Albert Maniscalco, who was the borough president of
Staten Island during its dizzying shift from rural to urban
borough, died on Sept. 2 at the Sisters of Charity Medical Center
there. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Maniscalco, a lifelong politician who joined a Democratic Party
club at the age of 14, was borough president from 1954 to 1965, a
period in which the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge was planned, built and
completed. The bridge, which opened in 1964, brought a flurry of
development that caused the population of the city's least populous
borough to multiply and new neighborhoods to sprout like mushrooms
in what had been farmland.
</P>
<P>
   Ada Louise Huxtable, the architecture critic of The New York
Times, wrote in 1965 that development was racing forward on Staten
Island with ``a haphazard abandon that could not be better
calculated to destroy the countryside if it had been planned by
enemy action.''
</P>
<P>
   But she praised Maniscalco for delaying an urban renewal project
that would have accelerated the damage. In essence, it would have
involved putting a Manhattan-style street grid on the island. He
also opposed running a parkway through land that became parkland.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenbelt Conservancy, a private parks group, honored him
for his role in saving land that eventually became an emerald spine
of natural areas on Staten Island. Indeed, the term ``greenbelt''
was first used by Maniscalco at a meeting of the Board of Estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone called Maniscalco Al, although he was always careful to
use the proper title of any person to whom he spoke. He was revered
for his politeness, and he spoke a version of English that some
considered rarefied.
</P>
<P>
   Maniscalco was born in Manhattan in 1908, a fact he never tired
of repeating in his public speeches. His family moved to Staten
Island when he was 9. Five years later, he joined the South Beach
Democratic Club and a year later was the club's secretary. He was
particularly interested in helping immigrants achieve citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   ``While most kids were playing games after school, I was hanging
around Democratic meetings,'' he said in an interview in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   He left high school to work as an engine cleaner for the
Baltimore &AMP; Ohio Railroad, but later earned a bachelor's degree and
a law degree by attending night classes at St. John's University.
In 1938, he was elected to the state Assembly, and served for two
terms. He then served as borough secretary under two borough
presidents and on the City Council for one year before becoming
borough president.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 62 years, the former Grace
Fiorelli; a son, Dr. Albert Maniscalco of Staten Island; a
daughter, Linda Calarco of Woodbridge, Conn., and four grandsons.

MARY FRANN, 55, THE STABLE WIFE ON `NEWHART' 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mary Frann, an actress best known for playing the wife of the
comedian Bob Newhart in his second successful CBS series,
``Newhart,'' died on Wednesday at her home in Los Angeles. She was
55.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was not officially determined as of Thursday, though
Ms. Frann, whom friends reported had been in good health,
apparently died in her sleep.
</P>
<P>
   For eight seasons in the 1980s, Ms. Frann played Joanna Loudon,
the pleasant, stable wife of the often harried Dick Loudon, the
character played by Newhart. The Loudons had moved from New York to
Vermont to run a small inn and were surrounded by colorful New
England types like George, a slow-moving caretaker, and a handyman
threesome of brothers from the backwoods, two of whom were named
Darryl, for no apparent reason. Only the third brother, Larry, ever
spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Frann was a more or less traditional sitcom wife dropped
into the center of these offbeat and bizarre characters. While
Newhart's character was often exasperated by the encounters with
eccentricity, Ms. Frann's Joanna was more often bemused by them.
</P>
<P>
   Newhart said: ``I played a sort of Everyman character and she
was the wife of Everyman. That can be a tough road to hoe.''
Referring to the classic comedy ``I Love Lucy,'' Newhart said: ``If
Mary was Lucy, the show would not have worked. She had to be
grounded.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Newhart'' is perhaps best remembered for its wildly original
concluding episode, which ended with Dick Loudon getting hit in the
head with a golf ball, losing consciousness and waking up in bed.
The bed was the one Newhart used in his previous series, ``The Bob
Newhart Show,'' and next to him in the bed was Suzanne Pleshette,
who played his wife in that show. The scene indicated that the
eight years of ``Newhart'' had all been a dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Mary had a little problem with that,'' Newhart said.
``But we were all thrilled at how the audience reacted when we did
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the years since the ``Newhart'' show ended, Ms. Frann worked
mainly as a guest star in other series and television movies.
Earlier in her career, she had a four-year run on the NBC daytime
soap opera ``Days of Our Lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in St. Louis, Ms. Frann began a career in show business as
a child model. She attended Northwestern University on a
scholarship from the Junior Miss Foundation, majoring in drama.
After her work on ``Days of Our Lives'' Ms. Frann had a starring
role in 1982 in a series called ``Kings Crossing'' on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Frann, who is survived by two sisters, Patricia Sauve and
Jacqueline Rogers, and a brother, Harry Luecke, all of Los Angeles,
was also active in charity work. Her publicist, Jeffrey Lane, said
she was most involved with the Los Angeles Mission, where she
worked with women in rehabilitation from problems with drugs,
alcohol or prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   Lane said Ms. Frann helped form a ``celebrity women's action
committee'' with a group of other female television stars including
Diahann Carroll, Donna Mills, Linda Gray and Joan Van Ark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always told Mary she was the glue that held it all
together,'' Newhart said.

 &HT;    Inquiry vote likely on Oct. 5 or 6
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Henry Hyde tried to dispel Democrats'
suggestions Thursday that Speaker Newt Gingrich is directing the
Judiciary Committee's impeachment review, saying the committee is
unlikely to expand its investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, the committee chairman, said the panel is likely to vote
on an inquiry of impeachment against President Clinton Oct. 5 or 6,
with the full House voting a couple of days later. Republicans and
Democrats alike generally believe that an inquiry is all but
certain to take place.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is scheduled to meet today in a closed session to
determine how much material to edit out of some 60,000 pages of
documents that will be made public next week. The documents will
include transcripts of testimony from Clinton friend Vernon Jordan,
Clinton secretary Betty Currie and Linda Tripp, the former White
House employee who secretly taped telephone conversations with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also is expected to release abridged trancripts of
those conversations, but not the tapes themselves, Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois Republican, discussing recent comments by Gingrich
that portend a potentially far-reaching impeachment investigation,
said he does not want his panel to become ``a catchall magnet for
all kinds of things that don't pertain to the main thing we're
looking at,'' Clinton's sexual relationship with Lewinsky and his
efforts to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, if independent counsel Kenneth Starr sends
Congress evidence of additional potentially impeachable offenses by
Clinton or if other congressional committees pass on such
information, the Judiciary Committee would examine it.
</P>
<P>
   The 74-year-old Hyde also said it is unlikely his committee
would call Lewinsky to testify, but left open the possibility of
asking Starr to appear.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde answered reporters' questions in the same committee hearing
room that was the scene of impeachment proceedings against Richard
Nixon 24 years ago. His portrait, unveiled Tuesday, hung on the
wall behind the committee dais, next to one of Peter Rodino, the
New Jersey Democrat who led the panel during the Nixon hearings.
</P>
<P>
   But Hyde faced questions Rodino never had to answer concerning
his authority to lead this initial review of Starr's report, a
likely impeachment inquiry and potential impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``As to whether I am in charge of the investigation, all I know
is every time I give advice to Newt he nods his head
affirmatively,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he described his demeanor when Gingrich talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I listen carefully, but I don't feel bound by it,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, however, said Hyde is merely executing decisions made
by Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an effort to run out the clock so that the election
comes and goes with this totally unresolved, with all the questions
hanging,'' said Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.).
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans also believe their party is being perceived as
too partisan by the public, said Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.). He referred
to some ``Republican squishes'' among his colleagues who represent
districts that are evenly divided between Democrats and
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some low-level whining,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde offered no timetable for the committee's work in the event
the House authorizes an inquiry, but said he would proceed with
``deliberate speed,'' not too fast or too slow. ``Like all
Americans, I want to bring this matter to closure as soon as
possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats pointed out that the committee has yet to decide on
standards for what constitutes an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   The committee will meet again in closed session late next week
to hear from lawyers for both sides on the grounds for moving
forward with an impeachment inquiry or, conversely, dropping the
matter altogether.
