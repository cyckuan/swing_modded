    TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Reshea Bristol and Felecity Willis each scored 17
points as No. 23 Arizona snapped a two-game losing streak with a 72-61 victory
over Arizona State on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The victory moved Arizona to 10-4 in the Pacific-10 Conference and 21-5
overall. Arizona State, which has lost three straight, fell to 7-7 in the Pac-10
and 13-11 overall. It was the 14th straight time Arizona has beaten the Sun
Devils.
</P>
<P>
	   Rachel Holt led Arizona State with 20 points. Tatum Brown added 11 points
for Arizona.
</P>
<P>
	   Arizona State led 28-27 at halftime, in part because it held Wildcats center
Tatum Brown to two points. The Wildcats were able to get the ball inside to
their center Brown in the second half.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sun Devils, who lost for just the second time at home this season,
trailed 58-54 with 4:17 remaining. Arizona then went on an 8-2 run to pull away.
Bristol had two baskets during the run.
</P>
<P>
	   Arizona State tried to get back into the game late with 3-pointers but
failed miserably. The Sun Devils made just 5 of 17 3-point attempts in the game.
The Sun Devils also had trouble holding onto the ball. Arizona made 17 steals.
</P>
<P>
	   Arizona won the first meeting with Arizona State 60-58 at home.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Tries To Regain Spotlight  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- On the northwestern-most tip of Washington state, Bill
Bradley had a great crowd -- 2,000 Bellingham residents rocking the ferry
building to the Rolling Stones' ``Start me up!''
</P>
<P>
	   Only, he needed someone to notice.
</P>
<P>
	   In the final weekend of his go-for-broke bid for Washington, Bradley found
that a year traversing the campaign trail, millions of dollars in advertising
and an almost-win in New Hampshire (he lost by 4 percent) came down to this:
</P>
<P>
	   Hardly any national reporters bothered with his Friday rally. So, on his
cell phone, he dialed one of the two dozen journalists traveling with his
Democratic presidential rival, Vice President Al Gore. ``Just wanted to say hi.
Haven't seen you in a while,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   There's also the frustration of idling far behind in polls and name ID.
</P>
<P>
	   A new CNN/Time poll released Saturday pushed Gore even further ahead in
California, with 56 percent to Bradley's 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Bradley? I know nothing about him. Not one thing. I don't even know what
he looks like,'' said Cleveland construction worker Rick Kekick.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, where Bradley is considered best known from his years on the
Knicks basketball team, the latest poll found that about half of Democrats
didn't know enough about Bradley to say whether they view him favorably or
unfavorably.
</P>
<P>
	   And then there's Republican John McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, the come-from-behind fascination who threatens to topple George W.
Bush, is honing in on Bradley's support among independents.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's been hurt by circumstance,'' said Spokane lawyer John Etter, a
Bradley supporter. ``McCain's emergence has been unhelpful to Bradley. It's
taken him off the front pages.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley dismissed those who suggest he is wasting time in the political
wilderness of Washington. The Tuesday primary here is essentially a beauty
pageant because it elects no delegates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can only help ourselves,'' Bradley told The Associated Press in that
Friday phone call. ``We can't do anything but gain since everybody expects us to
lose.''
</P>
<P>
	   Everybody, including Clara Staunton, who happened upon Bradley at Seattle's
Discovery Park. She said she will vote for Bradley because ``he makes a lot of
sense on the issues,'' but she had little faith in his chances.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He may win here, but things don't look good overall,'' Staunton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley plunged forward Saturday, rallying about 400 Spokane supporters:
``This will be the launching pad and you can be the rockets that lift this
campaign and make it take off.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Seattle Times, which first endorsed Bradley in December, editorialized
in Sunday editions: ``Bradley is well prepared to help keep the economic boom
alive and vital. ... Inclusion is his theme -- from race to the economy and
health care.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley enlisted Marcy Bloom, head of Aradia Women's Health Center, the
oldest women's clinic in the Northwest, in a radio ad hammering at Gore's old
anti-abortion record. ``We need a president with an unwavering and consistent
commitment to a woman's right to choose a safe, legal abortion,'' Bloom says.
</P>
<P>
	   Intent on denying Bradley a symbolic Washington win, Gore has matched
Bradley's investment in TV advertising here, aides confirmed, and added five
stops in the Seattle area this weekend, including Saturday night's NAACP dinner,
where Bradley was also speaking.
</P>
<P>
	   At a state party chili fest, Gore asked voters to hand him a ``clear and
decisive choice'' next week. ``I come here today to ask you to unite this
Democratic Party and let's get on with the task of winning the election,'' Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
	   One new Gore ad surprisingly features his climb of Mount Rainier last summer
with his son, Albert III -- an outing Gore long insisted was private and
off-limits for public discussion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'll fight like hell,'' said Gore spokesman Todd Webster.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore cruised through California giddily piling up official support. ``He's
for you! And he's for me!'' he trilled in sing-song Friday after Oakland Mayor
Jerry Brown offered his endorsement.
</P>
<P>
	   At a San Jose coffee shop Saturday, Gore, a former journalist, playfully
grabbed a reporter's notebook and, without a word, scribbled out his version of
the day's story: ``In a hastily arranged and extremely significant endorsement,
Ron Gonzales, the first Hispanic mayor of a large city in modern California
history, cast his lot with Vice President Al Gore today.''
</P>
<P>
	   In San Francisco, he promised ``to bring full Internet access to every
home.''
</P>
<P>
	   Twice in Washington and once earlier, in South Carolina, Gore partisans
pelted Bradley with missives denouncing his scrutiny of Gore's record on
abortion, gun control and campaign finance reform as destructive to the party.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As you continue to campaign here, please respect the voters of Washington
and the Democratic Party. Save your attacks for Republicans,'' Washington
Democratic chairman Paul Berendt wrote Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month, Bradley was at a South Carolina airport when he was
handed a similar letter from state chairman Dick Harpootlian, saying it was time
for Bradley to drop out and support Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is predictable. This is how the establishment operates,'' Bradley
told AP. ``Those are his supporters. They don't want to face the record.''
</P>
<P>
	   His campaign has accused Gore, who rarely entertains questions from his
traveling press corps, of trying to hide and win the nomination on the basis of
its inevitability.
</P>
<P>
	   To wit, Bradley explained his phone call to the Gore press bus: ``I wanted
to give you the chance to speak to a presidential candidate.''

<HEADLINE> Kings 90, Grizzlies 102  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Shareef Abdur-Rahim had 22 points and 11
rebounds as the Vancouver Grizzlies overcame a 16-point deficit to beat
Sacramento 102-90 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Kings star Chris Webber had 36 points on 17-of-33 shooting, but scored only
two points in the fourth quarter. Vancouver outscored Sacramento 52-24 over the
last 19 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Othella Harrington added 20 points for the Grizzlies, and Mike Bibby had 19
points and 15 assists -- including a team-record 13 in the second half. Nick
Anderson added 18 points for the Kings, who have lost 10 of their last 14.
</P>
<P>
	   Grant Long hit two free throws with 8:14 remaining to give Vancouver its
first lead at 81-79. The Grizzlies pushed the margin to nine with just under
five minutes left on Dennis Scott's 3-pointer from the baseline.
</P>
<P>
	   Webber took advantage of the absence of Vancouver center Bryant Reeves,
scoring 12 points in the opening quarter as the Kings raced to an 11-point lead.
Reeves was placed on the injured list before the game because of a bruised bone
on his right knee.
</P>
<P>
	   Webber added 10 points in the second quarter to help the Grizzlies take a
54-46 lead at the half.
</P>
<P>
	   Sacramento opened the second half with a 10-2 run to take a 16-point lead.
The Grizzlies rallied with a 21-9 run, including a leaning 3-pointer by
Abdur-Rahim at the buzzer, to pull within two at 75-73.

<HEADLINE> Slovenia's Kunc Wins Slalom Race  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   YONGPYONG, South Korea (AP) -- Mitja Kunc, continuing Slovenia's recent
victory splurge, overtook first-run leader Ole Kristian Furuseth of Norway to
win a men's World Cup slalom Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	Kunc, whose best previous results in an 11-year career were seconds in giant
slaloms in 1994 and 1995, completed two runs down the Rainbow course in 1
minute, 31.97 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	Furuseth, the 1998 Yongpyong winner who led the first run by a 10th of a
second, was runner-up in 1:32.70.
</P>
<P>
	Mario Matt of Austria, who made it to the second run only after a video review
of his first run, took the other spot on the podium in 1:32.97.
</P>
<P>
	Matt was originally disqualified for missing a gate in the first run, but
judges reinstated him after reviewing videotape and determining that he had made
all of the 55 gates.
</P>
<P>
	Erik Schlopy of Park City, Utah, had his best result since rejoining the World
Cup after three years on the pro tour. Starting 42nd, Schlopy was 10th after the
first run and improved to a final placing of ninth in 1:33.77.
</P>
<P>
	It was the best American slalom placing of the season, surpassing the 10th in
Wengen, Switzerland, last month by Sacha Gros of Vail, Colo.
</P>
<P>
	The icy, rock-hard course, bathed in sunshine throughout, favored late
starters. Kunc started 20th and Mario Reiter of Austria, the fourth-place
finisher, started 29th.
</P>
<P>
	Notable for his absence was Austria's Hermann Maier, the runaway leader in the
World Cup overall standings. Maier seldom skis slalom and he felt it wasn't
worth the trip to South Korea just to ski in a giant slalom. He turned out to be
right, because he retained comfortable leads in the overall and GS standings.
</P>
<P>
	Kjetil Andre Aamodt of Norway, the only skier with a mathematical chance of
catching Maier in the overall chase, was 14th in Sunday's slalom and added just
18 points to his total. He has 1,260 points, 310 behind Maier with nine races
remaining.
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt had the consolation of adding to his lead in the slalom standings. His
chief challenger, Slovenia's Matjaz Vrhovnik, had his worst race of the season,
placing 16th, his first finish outside the top 10 in nine slaloms this season.
</P>
<P>
	Last weekend, Vrhovnik won his first-ever World Cup race while, on the women's
side, Slovenia's Spela Pretnar won a women's slalom, her third straight and
fourth this season.
</P>
<P>
	Kunc set the stage for Sunday's victory with a fourth place in Saturday's giant
slalom, won by Austria's Benjamin Raich.
</P>
<P>
	Although he didn't win, Furuseth added to a fine record in the Far East. The
podium was his sixth in the area and second in South Korea. He won the inaugural
Yongpyong slalom two years ago.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Cuban diplomat who ignored a State Department demand
that he leave the country on his own was taken into custody by U.S. authorities
Saturday evening and flown out of the country on a government plane. Jose
Imperatori, 46, accompanied by his lawyer, was escorted away in a late model
Buick by FBI officials. Late Saturday morning, Imperatori announced his plan to
defy the State Department expulsion order so he could contest allegations
linking him with a U.S. immigration official charged with spying for Cuba.

Bush Ahead in National Polls

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A recent poll shows that although he suffered an upset
last week in Michigan and Arizona, Texas governor George W. Bush maintains a
large approval rating nationwide. Among likely Republican voters in California's
primary, a Time/CNN poll found Bush leading 48 percent to 23 percent. McCain
held a slight but statistically insignificant edge over the Texas governor among
Democrats and people without declared party preferences, but only registered
Republicans' votes will count in the GOP race. California awards the winner 162
delegates to this summer's national convention to nominate a candidate.

Missing Reporter in Russian Custody

footage aired Saturday that he had traded himself into Chechen hands in exchange
for Russian prisoners. After not contacting family or colleagues for weeks,
Babitsky turned up Friday in Makhachkala when he was detained for having a
forged Azerbaijani passport, Dagestan Interior Minister Adilgerei Magomedtagirov
told reporters Saturday. Babitsky's reporting from the rebels' side of the war
has angered Russian officials. He was detained by federal forces in Chechnya in
January, after which Russia said it exchanged him for two Russian prisoners

Diallo Verdict Sparks Rallies

rally against the acquittal of four white police officers in the Amadou Diallo
case. "Killer cops have got to go!" shouted a crowd of more than 2,500 people
who marched down Fifth Avenue in midtown Manhattan. About 40 people were
arrested when they sat down in the street near St. Patrick's Cathedral and
blocked traffic. Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, was shot down by the
officers last year in a flurry of bullets outside his Bronx apartment building.

Dark Matter Study Contradicts Others

	   STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- A group of physicists said their Stanford
University experiment to detect so-called "dark matter" particles that hold the
universe together could contradict earlier findings by an Italian team.
Physicists have long theorized that "dark matter" particles could account for
much of the universe's mass. But new research presented Friday by University of
California-Berkeley physicist Richard Gaitskell suggests that it is unlikely
that a Stanford University detector had found as many of the elusive particles

<HEADLINE> Sharks 6, Kings 3  </HEADLINE>
    By ROB GLOSTER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Owen Nolan scored a pair of goals, the San Jose
Sharks broke a four-game home losing streak and a lot of fans felt silly for
wasting perfectly good hats.
</P>
<P>
	   Nolan scored his 37th and 38th goals in a 3:03 span of the second period,
and had another taken away from him later in the period, as the Sharks defeated
the streaking Los Angeles Kings 6-3 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Nolan initially was credited with a third goal in the final minute of the
second period and fans pelted the ice with caps as Nolan celebrated what
appeared to be his 11th career hat trick.
</P>
<P>
	   But the goal was changed to Mike Ricci after officials determined the puck
was kicked in by Kings defenseman Sean O'Donnell and that Nolan never touched
it. Ricci, the last Shark to touch the puck, got credit for the goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Nolan, second in the league in goals this season to Florida's Pavel Bure,
had to settle for his 10th multi-goal game of the season and the 47th of his
career.
</P>
<P>
	   Todd Harvey, Vincent Damphousse and Ronnie Stern added goals for the Sharks,
who moved past idle Colorado into seventh place in the Western Conference with
67 points. Stern's goal went into an empty net with five seconds left in the
game.
</P>
<P>
	   Jaroslav Modry, Jozef Stumpel and Glen Murray scored for the Kings, who lost
for only the fourth time in their last 13 games. Luc Robitaille had two assists
for Los Angeles to extend his streak to 13 consecutive games with at least one
point.
</P>
<P>
	   The loss ended an 11-day trip for Los Angeles, which went 4-3 on a journey
that began Feb. 16 and included games in four time zones. The Kings now return
home to begin a seven-game home stand on Tuesday against Vancouver.
</P>

<P>
    CORVALLIS, Ore. (AP) -- Sissel Pierce scored a game-high 21 points in the
final home game of her career to lead Oregon State to a 72-52 victory over No.
22 UCLA on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Beavers (13-13, 10-5 Pacific-10) held UCLA (15-9, 9-5) to their
second-lowest point total of the season and limited Bruins standout Maylana
Martin to only eight points, well below her 17.5-point average. Martin scored 39
points in a loss at Oregon on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Felicia Ragland added 14 points, 10 rebounds, six steals and five assists,
and Cherrith Wiersma had 11 points to help the Beavers to their 10th victory in
their last 13 games.
</P>
<P>
	   Oregon State beat a ranked team for the first time since knocking off
Stanford during the 1994-95 season.
</P>
<P>
	   Oregon State, which was 4-10 overall at one point in the season, moved into
undisputed possession of fourth place with its fourth straight victory.
</P>
<P>
	   UCLA, the defending conference co-champion, dropped into fifth place after
losing twice on its Oregon road trip. No Bruins player scored in double figures.
</P>
<P>
	   UCLA shot only 34 percent (18-of-52) from the field and was outrebounded
40-28.
</P>
<P>
	   Oregon State took control with a 19-1 run that started after Erica Gomez's
3-pointer gave UCLA its last lead at 45-44 with 8:48 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   Oregon State's Chassie Wiersma hit a 3-pointer with 8:22 left to send the
Beavers back on top 47-45 and Ragland added another 3-pointer after a UCLA
turnover.
</P>
<P>
	   The Beavers eventually built their lead to 58-45 before a free throw by
UCLA's Janae Hubbard ended a string of 14 straight Oregon State points. The
Beavers then scored seven more in a row for a 63-45 advantage with 1:10 to play
before UCLA scored again.

by Anderson before Coles lost the dribble in the paint at the other end. Odom
then made one of two free throws to give Los Angeles its winning margin.
</P>
<P>
	   Mutombo rebounded Odom's second free throw, but backup center Keith Closs
blocked a shot and knocked a couple of inbounds passes out of bounds near the
Hawks' basket. Atlanta inbounded for the last time with four seconds left, but
Coles lost the ball out of bounds before the Hawks could attempt a game-winning
basket.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clippers made only two of their first 13 shots in the fourth quarter --
a layup by Odom and a 3-pointer by Eric Piatkowski that extended their lead to
72-64. The Hawks had cut the margin to three on Ellis' short hook, a running
jumper by Coles and an 18-footer by Ellis in the first two minutes of the
period.
</P>
<P>
	   But The Hawks responded with a layup by Ellis, a 15-footer by Coles and a
3-pointer by Rider that put them within 72-71 with 2:43 to play. After Odom's
3-pointer gave the Clippers a 77-73 edge, Rider answered with a reverse layup
and a 22-footer to tie it at 77.
</P>
<P>
	   Tyrone Nesby's dunk with 5:47 left in the third quarter gave the Clippers
their biggest lead, 59-43. But the Hawks ended the quarter with a 13-6 run
ignited by Jim Jackson's two layups and capped by his 3-pointer, which narrowed
the gap to 65-56.
</P>
<P>
	   Returning from the third 0-7 road trip in franchise history and first since
1987-88, the Clippers used their 17th different starting lineup of the season
and got 11 points from Anderson en route to a 46-34 halftime lead. Todd tried
Odom at point guard, and the rookie helped Los Angeles take a 24-17 lead through
one quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clippers extended their margin to 10 points with 7 1-2 minutes left in
the second, as Odom dished off twice to Piatkowski for a 3-pointer and a dunk
during a 9-2 spurt. Atlanta's 34 points were the fewest allowed by the Clippers
in one half this season, matching Chicago's total on Feb. 19.

night to help the Calgary Flames move closer to a playoff spot with a 5-2
victory over the Atlanta Thrashers.

<HEADLINE> Rape Victims Worry About AIDS  </HEADLINE>
   By JAMES PILCHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- When Annie Newton puts her twins to bed, there are no
goodnight kisses after nightly prayers. She washes her hands before hugging the
10-year-old girls, and won't let them in the kitchen while she's cooking, for
fear they might touch her blood if she cuts herself.
</P>
<P>
	   Newton doesn't have AIDS and she has tested negative for HIV, but, like
millions of other sexual assault victims, she constantly fears the man who raped
her gave her the deadly virus.
</P>
<P>
	   While Newton has been told that her attacker had AIDS, many other rape
victims are left knowing only that the possibility exists.
</P>
<P>
	   Privacy laws prevent some states from releasing inmates' HIV test results or
causes of death, even to their victims. In recent years, some state
legislatures, including Arizona, Hawaii, Kentucky, South Carolina and Wisconsin,
have amended their laws to give victims access to such records. In Georgia,
district attorneys are allowed to inform victims.
</P>
<P>
	   Many victims say their inability to find out their attacker's status makes
their ordeal even worse.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm constantly thinking that I may have survived the attack, but he might
eventually murder me with HIV, and not knowing is just eating me up right now,''
said Kellie Greene, an Orlando, Fla., woman who was attacked in 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   Greene has sued Florida to get the medical records of her attacker but has
been told several times she can't access them due to privacy considerations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why does he have any privacy rights?'' Greene said. ``He certainly
disregarded mine.''
</P>
<P>
	   Newton's attacker recently died in prison after a long bout with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
	   ``On the one hand, I was happy he died after what he did to me,'' she said.
``But then I started thinking that my time might come soon.''
</P>
<P>
	   Victim advocates say Newton's chance of infection is greater than that of
women who have normal sexual intercourse with an HIV-positive man because the
brutal nature of the attack led to more blood contact.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's something that crosses every victim's mind,'' said Debbie Andrews,
executive director for the Rape Abuse &AMP; Incest National Network. ``You have to
go through that struggle of not knowing for sure, even if the first test is
negative.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta estimates there are as many as
900,000 people infected with HIV in the United States. Doctors say it can take
years for AIDS to develop, though the presence of HIV is usually detectable
within three months of exposure.
</P>
<P>
	   Advocates say few statistics have been compiled on the number of women who
contract HIV through rape. A 1990 study published in the New England Journal of
Medicine showed that less than 1 percent of victims surveyed contracted the
disease through the attack.
</P>
<P>
	   Liz Flowers, executive director of the Georgia Network to End Sexual
Assault, said that percentage probably wasn't accurate because many women aren't
tested.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Many attacks are by someone they know or a former sex partner,'' Flowers
said. ``That brings the fear level about HIV and AIDS way down, even though the
risk is just as high.''
</P>
<P>
	   That wasn't the case for Newton and other victims of Joseph Patrick
Washington. He died in prison last October while serving a life sentence in
conjunction with five separate Augusta area attacks in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington forced the women into his car at gunpoint, drove to a remote
location, shot them and then raped, prosecutors said at his 1995 trial. One
witness testified that Washington had said he wanted to infect as many women as
he could because his former girlfriend had given him HIV.
</P>
<P>
	   But fearing lawsuits for breach of privacy by Washington's family members,
state corrections officials would only say he died from ``natural causes.''
Georgia Department of Corrections spokesman Scott Stallings said that all
incoming inmates are tested for HIV, but the results are not made public.
</P>
<P>
	   Newton was told Washington had AIDS by Augusta's district attorney.
</P>
<P>
	   Victims advocates say the specter of AIDS makes it hard for women to recover
after an attack.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Rape produces post-traumatic stress syndrome, and if you can't put some
distance between yourself and the attack, it will never go away,'' Flowers said.
``And the longer possibility of AIDS just keeps hanging there, so will the
effects of the attack.''
</P>
<P>
	   Deborah Baxley, 44, was attacked by Washington in 1993 and has been tested
three times since then. All have turned up negative, but she still can't shake
the fear of contracting HIV.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I might have escaped dying the first time, but there's no telling if it
will come back around again.''

<P>
    GOLD COAST, Australia (AP) -- Karrie Webb remained perfect in three starts
this year, winning her third straight Australian Ladies Masters title Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Australian star birdied three of the final four holes for a 4-under-par
68 and a one-stroke victory over Canada's Lorie Kane. Webb had a 14-under 274
total on the Royal Pines course.
</P>
<P>
	   Webb, the sixth player to win an LPGA Tour event three times or more, made a
15-foot putt on the final hole to hold off Kane, who finished with 17 straight
pars for a 71.
</P>
<P>
	   England's Laura Davies, who started the round tied for the lead with Kane at
12-under, shot a 77 to tie for third.
</P>
<P>
	   Webb earned $112,500 to take the lead on the LPGA Tour money list with
$225,000. She won The Office Depot in January in Florida in her only other tour
start. Last week, she won the Australian Women's Open at Yarra Yarra.

Group Claims Abuses in Chechnya

	   MOZDOK, Russia (AP) -- A human rights group said Saturday it had medical
evidence that Russian troops had tortured Chechen civilians, the latest charge
to taint Russia amid a new wave of international criticism of the Chechnya war.
Russian officials denied the accusations. Moscow was still smarting from
television footage aired Friday that suggested Russian soldiers had committed
atrocities against Chechens. Preliminary findings from a random survey of
refugees by Physicians for Human Rights revealed Chechen civilians had
systematically faced summary executions, illegal detention or torture, the group
said in a report released Saturday.

held a slight but statistically insignificant edge over the Texas governor among
Democrats and people without declared party preferences, but only registered

Babitsky turned up Friday in Makhachkala when he was detained for having a

<HEADLINE> Matthew Shepard Show Opens in Wyo.  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL KUCHWARA AP Drama Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- An emotional audience greeted the world premiere Saturday of
``The Laramie Project,'' a unique collaboration between a New York-based theater
troupe and the people of Laramie, Wyo., about the murder of Matthew Shepard.
</P>
<P>
	   They cried and then cheered at the end of the three-act, nearly three-hour
performance attended by nearly 50 townspeople and members of the media.
</P>
<P>
	   The play about the death of the gay University of Wyoming college student
was the brainchild of Moises Kaufman, founder of the Tectonic Theater Project,
whose members collaborated on the drama now on view at the Denver Center Theater
through April 1.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To actively step back and sit and watch everything unravel is surreal,''
said Matt Galloway, bartender at the Fireside Lounge, where Shepard met the men
who killed him. ``I had so much anticipation. It is interesting to undo the
wound that you think is healed, but it hasn't.''
</P>
<P>
	   The production was a monumental effort involving 18 months of preparation,
including six trips by members of the company to Laramie for interviews with
scores of residents and friends of the 21-year-old Shepard. Their thoughts and
opinions were pieced together by the troupe, working under the guidance of
Kaufman and Leigh Fondakowski, a company member who put together the script.
</P>
<P>
	   Shepard's death in October 1998 received national attention. He was beaten,
hung on a fence in a lonely prairie field and left to die. Two young men, Aaron
McKinney and Russell Henderson, are serving life sentences for the murder.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaufman has called the murder ``a watershed event,'' one that captured what
this nation is and where it is going as a society.
</P>
<P>
	   In that respect, it echoes, Kaufman says, his best-known work, ``Gross
Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde,'' which had a long New York run, as
well as a successful engagement at the Denver Center Theater last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The play, which chronicled Wilde's downfall, was based, in part, on trial
transcripts, trials that eventually send the homosexual Wilde to prison for
``gross indecency.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The thing that shocked me about the trials of Oscar Wilde was that in
reading the transcripts, you did not only see the story of this man's downfall
but you saw exactly where Victorian society was at in terms of class, gender,
sexuality, the monarchy, imperialism, capitalism,'' Kaufman has said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``And I think that in the same way, Matthew Shepard's beating, cruel
victimization and murder, did a similar thing.''

Reformists Gain Control in Iran
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- President Mohammad Khatami said Saturday that the
social and political reforms he started will not come at the expense of Islam,
and it doesn't matter "what others say or want." The reforms are "part of the
essence" of the 1979 Islamic revolution that installed the clergy's rule in
Iran, the president said. Khatami's remarks to Foreign Ministry officials came
as his allies took firm control of parliament after the final count in the Feb.
18 elections was announced Saturday.

GOP Governors Rally Around Bush

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rallying around one of their own, Republican governors
say they're confident in their colleague from Texas, mobilizing a show of unity
they hope will boost George W. Bush's struggling campaign. Still, they're
brimming with free advice. In town for their winter meeting, GOP governors gave
Bush their early and powerful backing at an earlier gathering -- even before he
declared he was running. That support helped rally the Republican establishment
around the Texas governor as the party's best chance for taking back the White
House. "I'm confident we made the right decision," said Gov. Ed Schafer of North
Dakota.

	   MOZDOK, Russia (AP) -- A human rights group said Saturday it had medical

to taint Russia amid a new wave of international criticism of the Chechnya war.
Russian officials denied the accusations. Moscow was still smarting from
television footage aired Friday that suggested Russian soldiers had committed
atrocities against Chechens. Preliminary findings from a random survey of
refugees by Physicians for Human Rights revealed Chechen civilians had
systematically faced summary executions, illegal detention or torture, the group
said in a report released Saturday.

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Protesters took to the streets of New York City Saturday to
rally against the acquittal of four white police officers in the Amadou Diallo
case. "Killer cops have got to go!" shouted a crowd of more than 2,500 people
who marched down Fifth Avenue in midtown Manhattan. About 40 people were

	   DENVER (AP) -- An emotional audience greeted the world premiere Saturday of
"The Laramie Project," a unique collaboration between a New York-based theater
troupe and the people of Laramie, Wyo., about the murder of Matthew Shepard.
They cried and then cheered at the end of the three-act, nearly three-hour
performance attended by nearly 50 townspeople and members of the media. The play
about the death of the gay University of Wyoming college student was the
brainchild of Moises Kaufman, founder of the Tectonic Theater Project, whose

round in their welterweight fight. De La Hoya, who lost to Felix Trinidad in his
last bout, said the new year would bring a new, improved fighter. He certainly

Clippers snapped a 13-game losing streak Saturday night, surviving five inbounds
plays by Atlanta in the final 22.5 seconds to hold on for a 78-77 victory.
Rookie Lamar Odom had 10 points, 12 rebounds and a go-ahead free throw in the
final minute for the Clippers, who won for only the second time in 24 games and
hadn't tasted victory since beating New Jersey 98-93 at Staples Center. Isaiah
Rider and Bimbo Coles each had 16 points and Dikembe Mutombo added 17 rebounds
for the Hawks, who had beaten the Clippers 10 consecutive times and seven
straight in Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> Union Talks Break Down at Boeing  </HEADLINE>
    By MIKE WELLS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATAC, Wash. (AP) -- Talks between The Boeing Co. and its striking
engineers union broke down late Saturday with sides still far apart on major
issues, a union spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   No further talks were scheduled.
</P>
<P>
	   The stalemate came after three days of negotiations attended by C. Richard
Barnes, the nation's top federal mediator. Barnes had earlier said he hoped a
resolution could be reached over the weekend, but has since left.
</P>
<P>
	   The union, the 22,600-member Society of Professional Engineering Employees
in Aerospace, went on strike Feb. 9 seeking more guaranteed pay raises and
bonuses similar to those received by the larger Machinists union.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing has insisted on mostly selective pay increases, reductions in life
insurance benefits and some changes in health insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   The company made a third offer to the union on Saturday, but "it was closer
to the first offer made back in November," said Craig Buckham, president of the
aerospace union. Company spokesman Peter Conte called the proposal "good."
</P>
<P>
	   The aerospace giant has delivered only four airplanes so far this month. In
February 1999, the company delivered 47 aircraft to customers.
</P>
<P>
	   Union spokesman Bill Dugovich said late Saturday workers are "in it for the
long haul" with Boeing.
</P>
<P>
	   "If they want a long strike," he said, "that's what they'll receive."

<HEADLINE> Gene Therapy May Heal Some Injuries  </HEADLINE>
    By IRA DREYFUSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An injection of a therapeutic gene may someday help to
heal an athlete's badly damaged muscle, fractured leg or blown-out knee,
researchers say.
</P>
<P>
	   In lab animals, gene therapy has knit together broken bones and made injured
muscles grow stronger. Preliminary human trials already have begun, and experts
believe these experimental findings will develop into treatments.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the chances are extraordinarily high," said Dr. R. Rodney Howell, a
University of Miami School of Medicine professor who is president of the
American College of Medical Genetics, a professional group. "It's going to take
a while, but I think the chances are overwhelming it will work."
</P>
<P>
	   Therapies may start to show potential for sports injuries in 2 to 5 years,
researchers say. "These are very complicated studies," Howell said. "The time
frame will be substantial. It's not going to be next week or next year."
</P>
<P>
	   Much of the work centers on growth factors, proteins that the body produces
to help various tissues grow. Because genes direct the production of growth
factors, researchers are working on ways in which to add copies of these genes.
</P>
<P>
	   One method is to genetically engineer a virus, such as one that causes the
common cold, by removing the illness-causing material and replacing it with a
growth factor-triggering gene. The virus is then inserted into a test animal,
where the new gene implants the growth factor gene in the cells.
</P>
<P>
	   Another method is to remove cells from the test subject, add growth
factor-triggering gene to those cells and inject them back into the subject. At
this point the virus method is more efficient, said an article in The Physician
and Sportsmedicine, a medical journal. But the engineering of a patient's own
cells could have greater potential, said researcher Johnny Huard of the
University of Pittsburgh, one of the paper's authors.
</P>
<P>
	   Certain cells, known as muscle-derived stem cells, seem to be progenitors of
bone, tendon, ligament or muscle, and can be directed to grow into one or the
other, Huard said. Substances called bone-muscle genetic protein seems to act as
the switch, but it's not yet known how the body decides which way to direct the
stem cells to develop, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   However, in lab experiments, Huard and other researchers have been able to
heal tissue.
</P>
<P>
	   Using muscle-derived stem cells, Huard's lab was able to almost completely
heal broken skulls in mice. Researchers at the UCLA School of Medicine healed
broken mouse leg bones with similar stem cells derived from marrow. And at
Harvard University, using growth factor carried on a virus, researchers were
able to make mice show progressive increases in muscle mass.
</P>
<P>
	   If the research lives up to its potential, the main benefit for athletes
could be healing of joints, and bones that are too badly damaged to heal
correctly under current therapies, researchers said. Ligaments and tendons
especially tend to grow back slowly, so a boost from gene therapy could speed
the process.
</P>
<P>
	   Muscle heals anyway, so gene therapy might only be needed for very bad
injuries, said Dr. Jay R. Lieberman of UCLA. However, muscle-restoring
techniques could benefit people with muscle-wasting diseases such as muscular
dystrophy.
</P>
<P>
	   Techniques to inject genes for anti-inflammatory proteins could treat joint
diseases such as arthritis.
</P>
<P>
	   Scientists such as Howell think that findings from disease-focused studies
could carry over to benefit athletes. "The basic mechanisms by which they work
is very similar," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Human trials into possible benefits for athletes are only in the early
stages, and the studies are aimed at establishing that the therapies are safe.
</P>
<P>
	   Risks include the possibility that genetically engineered cells could grow
out of control, leading to cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   Another possibility is that viral cells used to carry the gene may infect
the recipient with viral disease. One patient died in a recent gene therapy
trial.
</P>
<P>
	   And for athletes, there is the additional issue of doping. Genes that
normally occur in the body might not be found in tests by athletic
organizations, leading to the possibility that the winning athlete might be
simply the best-engineered.

<HEADLINE> Ohio Surgeons Test Goggles  </HEADLINE>
    By JAMES HANNAH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KETTERING, Ohio (AP) -- The future of brain surgery just might be strapped
around a plastic foam bust in an operating room at Kettering Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   The helmet-like device with square-framed goggles and reflective lenses is
waiting to play its part in another operation.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is going to be useful," said neurosurgical specialist Tim Gillum, who
has worn the device during an operation. "Nobody else I know of is using this
technology."
</P>
<P>
	   The goggles project computer-generated images and data into the surgeon's
eye. Called Virtual Retinal Scanning technology, it uses low-power laser beams
to paint rows of pixels onto the retina, creating a high-resolution, full-motion
image that appears to be an arm's length away.
</P>
<P>
	   The prototype, which is being tested by the hospital, is designed to allow
surgeons and surgical assistants to operate without having to stop and look up
at computer screens to read a patient's vital signs, tumor scans and other data
that could affect the operation.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin Satter, a physicist with the hospital's Wallace-Kettering
Neuroscience Institute, said surgeons sometimes have to swivel their heads so
often, it looks like they're watching tennis.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were looking for some new technology to kind of break through this
problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Satter checked the Internet and found the Web site of Microvision Inc., a
Bothell, Wash.-based company that made retinal-display products for the
military.
</P>
<P>
	   Satter talked the company into developing goggles for the medical field.
Several members of Congress helped get funding for the project through a
cooperative agreement with the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers at nearby Wright-Patterson Air Force Base helped develop the
technology in the 1980s so pilots can fly with their heads up.
</P>
<P>
	   "We really got the first of these devices that wasn't planned for military
use," said Satter.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Rep. David Hobson helped hospital officials get $4.9 million in federal
money to help fund the project. The Ohio Republican has long been interested in
transferring technology developed by the military to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
	   "This looked to me like a good one," said Hobson. "I thought it was a
win-win for everybody."
</P>
<P>
	   Hobson said the goggles might eventually be of use to the Veterans
Administration and federal health agencies. In addition, he said, the military
might get some new ideas on how to use the technology.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Lake, president of the Dayton Regional Development Alliance, said it
is a good example of technology transfer.
</P>
<P>
	   "And it's a way to develop our region as a high-tech area," said Lake.
</P>
<P>
	   Surgeons wearing the goggles can focus on the surgery while images of
critical data float right before their eyes. The images are transparent and do
not obstruct the surgeon's view, Satter said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the goggles should not only reduce fatigue created by the constant
head-swiveling but also enable surgeons to respond faster to any problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Theodore Bernstein said he has used the goggles for short periods during
surgeries. "It's a very interesting way of looking at things," Bernstein said.
"You can look through the display at the patient." But not everyone is convinced
of the value of such goggles at a time when hospitals are under pressure to
reduce costs.
</P>
<P>
	   "It sounds as if you've got an interesting technology looking for a reason
to exist," said Dr. Joseph Piepmeier, professor of neurosurgery at Yale
University's medical school. "The most useful tool a surgeon has is between his
ears."
</P>
<P>
	   Piepmeier said vital-sign data is not something he would normally look up to
check "unless the roof was caving in." However, he said the goggles could be
helpful if they displayed the right information.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's an enormous outpouring of technology that's being transferred to
the operating room, and this is just a piece of that," he said. "It probably
expands capabilities."
</P>
<P>
	   Microvision spokesman Matt Nichols said the goggle systems, depending on the
quality of computers and lasers included, could cost anywhere from $10,000 to
more than $100,000 when they go on the market.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not just a technology looking for a home," Nichols said. "What we're
looking at is a marketplace coming to us saying we have a problem."
</P>
<P>
	   Nichols said Baylor College of Medicine in Texas has agreed to test the
technology in heart and abdominal surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   Surgeons at Kettering are expected to continue testing the prototype helmet
on selected surgeries over the next few months and let Microvision know how it
can be improved.
</P>
<P>
	   "We haven't yet ironed out all the bugs," said Satter, adding that the
helmet can get heavy after a while.

<HEADLINE> Iran Reformers May Back Ex-President  </HEADLINE>
   By VIJAY JOSHI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- In a sign of an emerging rift in the reformist
coalition that won Iran's elections, a major faction said it will back a former
president for the key post of parliament speaker even though he has been
increasingly considered a conservative.
</P>
<P>
	   The Executives of Construction Party will talk Monday with other factions to
lobby in favor of former President Hashemi Rafsanjani, said Mohammed Atrianfar,
a top policy-maker of the party. The party supported Rafsanjani in the Feb. 18
elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Atrianfar told The Associated Press that Rafsanjani was a reformist at heart
and could help the movement because of his influence with the hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
	   But Atrianfar acknowledged that the other major reformist party -- the
Islamic Iran Participation Front -- bitterly opposes Rafsanjani. The front, as
well as smaller reform groups, see Rafsanjani as representing the old guard.
</P>
<P>
	   This is the first informal nomination of a candidate for the race for the
speaker's post -- the country's top spot after the supreme leader and the
president. It could be a battle that would expose the fractious nature of the
new parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   Reformists won 29 of the 30 seats in the crucial district of Tehran.
Rafsanjani finished 30th.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, recounting was ordered in a few ballot boxes in Tehran following
a complaint about counting errors by a candidate who finished 31st, said Mostafa
Tajzadeh, head of elections headquarters. The recount will finish within two
days, but is not expected to change the overall result, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The reformist coalition won 170 seats in the 290-seat parliament with 65
seats to be decided in run-offs. Elections are not fought on party lines but
political affiliations of most candidates are well known.
</P>
<P>
	   The Construction Party and the Participation Front control about an equal
number of seats in parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   The hard-liners, who will certainly support Rafsanjani, won 44 seats, losing
control of the parliament for the first time since 1979, when the clergy came to
power.
</P>
<P>
	   Rafsanjani was speaker from 1980-89, when he was elected president. He
served until 1997. As head of state, he gained popularity as a moderate at a
time when the country was in the grip of hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
	   It was with his tacit approval that the Construction Party came into
existence in 1996, advocating social and cultural reforms. Though the party's
program was modest, its ideas were radical for the time.
</P>
<P>
	   Rafsanjani's successor, President Mohammad Khatami, started a much more
ambitious and wider reform program in 1997, loosening many restrictions imposed
by the ruling clergy.
</P>
<P>
	   With his reputation overshadowed by Khatami, Rafsanjani began tilting toward
the hard-liners before this month's parliamentary elections, attracting charges
of being an opportunist.
</P>

	   ``Rafsanjani is being victimized by a propaganda campaign by radical
reformists,'' Atrianfar said. He said his party will appeal to Khatami to
persuade other reformists to support Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
	   Atrianfar hailed Rafsanjani as the original reformist by starting an
economic revival program during his presidency to rebuild a nation devastated by
eight years of war with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   But reformists blame Rafsanjani's presidency for many of the country's
current economic woes and ruining Iran's international credit record.

<HEADLINE> EU Debates New Defense Policy  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT WIELAARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SINTRA, Portugal (AP) -- Eager to put years of ``wind-baggery'' behind them,
America's European allies are setting out to prove they can act militarily
without first needing a cue from Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, the European Union stages its first meeting of defense ministers.
Over the year, they will craft a security policy to allow Western Europe to
defuse crises beyond its borders with America's blessing but not always its
troops.
</P>
<P>
	   Shaping a credible defense policy means the EU nations must improve
decision-making procedures, boost defense spending and agree to more
co-production of arms, and jointly put troops in the field.
</P>
<P>
	   The impetus for a greater security role has been a decade of foot-dragging
in successive Balkan crises when the Europeans left it to Washington to take the
lead in bringing peace and stability to the region.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are not embarked on an exercise in wind-baggery. We have seen where
Europe has failed,'' EU External affairs Commissioner Chris Patten told EU and
U.S. legislators in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is our duty to do better,'' he said. ``It was the Balkan crisis that
obliged us to engage more directly in conflict prevention and crisis management.
The simple truth is that we have not been organized or equipped for this work.''
</P>
<P>
	   The EU goal is to create a Rapid Reaction Force by 2003 of as many as 60,000
troops that can deploy within 60 days. The force would serve not to defend EU
territory, but as peacekeepers -- or peacemakers -- in trouble spots beyond EU
borders.
</P>
<P>
	   Monday's meeting is mainly a technical one to set up the structure. It was
preceded with assurances the U.S.-led NATO alliance will remain the key European
security provider.
</P>
<P>
	   A European Rapid Reaction Force must be able to mount campaigns lasting at
least a year and it will rotate troops in and out, bringing the total commitment
to 200,000 soldiers, according to EU officials.
</P>
<P>
	   That also means real money for defense -- an area where the Europeans have
not done well.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense spending of the European NATO members is 60 percent of U.S. defense
spending yet their ability to project military force is only 10 to 15 percent of
Washington's.
</P>
<P>
	   The Balkan crises have produced embarrassing statistics: There are 2 million
soldiers in EU armies, yet governments could barely deploy 2 percent of that
number into Kosovo. Three quarters of the aircraft, four fifths of the ordinance
and most of the intelligence in the former Yugoslavia were provided by the
United States.

<HEADLINE> Cyclone Batters Queensland State  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE CORDER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Tropical cyclone Steve battered the tourist city
of Cairns in Queensland state with 105 mph winds Sunday, tearing roofs off
houses and uprooting trees.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no immediate reports of injuries or deaths from the storm, whose
eye passed directly over Cairns, 1,860 miles north of Sydney.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses had described Cairns as looking like ``a bomb had gone off,'' said
emergency services spokesman Wayne Hepple.
</P>
<P>
	   There was widespread structural damage to houses, he said. Trees were down.
Much of the city plunged into darkness because of blackouts caused by fallen
power lines.
</P>
<P>
	   The cyclone came as residents mopped up from a rainstorm that dumped 6
inches of water on Cairns in just six hours Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The cyclone began to weaken Sunday night as it moved inland, but more
flooding was expected Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Cairns, a city of 130,000, is the busiest tourist gateway for boats visiting
the spectacular coral formations of the Great Barrier Reef.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly one third of Queensland state and swathes of inland New South Wales
and South Australia states, which are arid and dusty for most of the year, have
been left underwater by torrential rainfall in recent days.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of sheep and cattle are feared drowned.

<HEADLINE> China Criticizes U.S. Human Rights  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China scoffed Sunday at the United States' human rights
record, saying America is plagued by racism and other problems and should not
pass judgment on other nations.
</P>
<P>
	   The accusations, contained in a government report, ``U.S. Human Rights
Record in 1999,'' was China's response to the U.S. State Department's annual
human rights report, which criticized Beijing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The United States does not have a good human rights record of its own but
likes to play the role of the `world's human rights judge','' the Information
Office of China's State Council said in its 10,000-word paper.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The American government needs to keep an eye on its own human rights
problems, mind its own business and stop interfering in the internal affairs of
other countries by utilizing the human rights question,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. State Department report, issued Friday, said Beijing's rights
situation deteriorated markedly last year. It listed such examples as
intensified suppression of dissent and control over unregistered churches,
restriction of fundamental freedoms of minority groups including Tibetan
Buddhists, and increased manipulation of the press and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   The Chinese report responded that the safety of U.S. citizens is threatened
by widespread violent crime and a huge number of privately owned firearms.
Police brutality is common, child labor is rampant and ``the state of children
in the U.S. is grim,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In overcrowded American prisons, inmates are mistreated and violence
prevails,'' it said. ``The human rights of female prisoners are seriously
violated.''
</P>
<P>
	   It said the shooting of African immigrant Amadou Diallo by four New York
City police officers came ``to symbolize the violent behavior of the American
police.'' The officers were acquitted Friday of murder and other state criminal
charges.
</P>
<P>
	   ``U.S. police all too often suspect colored people are guilty of crime, even
when little or no evidence is available,'' the Chinese report said.
</P>
<P>
	   It also criticized the war against Yugoslavia over Kosovo, saying air
strikes by U.S.-led NATO forces caused ``the biggest humanitarian catastrophe in
Europe since the end of World War II.''
</P>
<P>
	   While the paper culled much of its statistics and information from U.S.
media reports, it also criticized the American media as ``a propaganda machine
used by the authorities to manipulate public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
	   The report was carried by Xinhua, China's government-controlled news agency.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- A member of the ETA Basque separatist group stopped his hunger
strike on Sunday out of fear for his life after fasting over two months, his
family said.
</P>
<P>
	   Daniel Derguy, 39, lost 57 pounds by drinking only water for 63 days, a
record for ETA prisoners. A statement from his supporters said Derguy's
temperature had plummeted dangerously and the walls of his stomach were stuck
together.
</P>
<P>
	   The jailed separatist had demanded that France and Spain jail ETA prisoners
in Basque country rather than send them to faraway prisons. Other French and
Spanish prisoners joined in the strike, and nineteen are still fasting.
</P>
<P>
	   Derguy was transferred from prison in Fresnes to the hospital at
Kremlin-Bicetre outside Paris when his health began deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
	   A Paris court last week sentenced Derguy to 10 years in jail for his role in
bombing attacks. He was already in jail on a prior conviction.

<HEADLINE> US Commander Talks Taiwan in China  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN LEICESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIJING (AP) -- The commander of U.S. forces in the Pacific will discuss the
sensitive issue of Taiwan and work on repairing ties with the Chinese military
during a visit to China that began Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Adm. Dennis Blair's five-day visit comes amid rising tensions over Taiwan
following Beijing's threat to use force against the island if it continues to
put off negotiations about reunification.
</P>
<P>
	   China issued the threat in a government policy paper on Feb. 21 and created
a stir in Taiwan, which has resisted communist rule since the two sides split
amid civil war 51 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Blair's trip, which includes three days of meetings with Chinese officials,
also is part of efforts to restore military ties that China severed in May,
after U.S. warplanes hit the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia during the war over
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Gen. Xiong Guangkai, a deputy chief of the general staff of the People's
Liberation Army, will be among the Chinese officials that Blair will meet in
Beijing on Monday and Tuesday. He then travels south to meet Wednesday with
Chinese military officials in the central city of Nanjing and visit a military
facility.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for Blair, Navy Capt. T. McCreary of the Pacific Command, said
Taiwan would come up during the visit, but that it was only one issue of several
to be discussed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The ability to engage China's military and to have an opportunity to
interact with them is important on several fronts,'' McCreary said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the visit was scheduled several weeks ago, before Beijing's latest
threat to use force against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   The threat put pressure on the three leading candidates in Taiwan's
presidential election, scheduled for March 18. None of the three support
unification on Beijing's terms.
</P>
<P>
	   A Taiwanese opposition candidate for vice president on Sunday shrugged off
Beijing's threat, saying it would only force Taiwanese voters to pick a leader
more ready to protect their interests.
</P>
<P>
	   ``China should realize that it is not dealing with just a piece of their
land, but with 23 million well-educated, democratically minded people,'' said
Annette Lu, the running mate of Chen Shui-bian of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party.
</P>
<P>
	   No Taiwanese would choose as their leader ``a messenger from Beijing'' who
bows to China's demands, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the United States acknowledges China's claim to Taiwan, Washington
is obligated by law to aid the defense of Taiwan, an ally throughout much of the
Cold War.
</P>
<P>
	   Taiwan's people enjoy many things mainlanders don't have: democracy, freedom
of speech and a well-developed economy. Beijing still regards the island as part
of its territory, and the threat only served to step up the rhetoric against
Taiwan. China has previously said that only a declaration of independence or
foreign interference would prompt a Chinese attack.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Spy May Have More Secrets  </HEADLINE>
   By MARK LAVIE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ASHKELON, Israel (AP) -- Sending contradictory signals, imprisoned spy
Mordechai Vanunu hinted Sunday he may have more secrets to spill about Israel's
nuclear weapons program, but then denied having anything new to tell.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli lawmaker Yossi Katz, who spoke with the 45-year old spy in a rare
prison meeting Sunday, said Vanunu appeared to mix fact with fantasy. Katz said
his impression is that Vanunu is ``not a (mentally) healthy man.''
</P>
<P>
	   While working as a technician at Israel's top-secret nuclear reactor in
Dimona, Vanunu took dozens of pictures and smuggled them out. Then he gave the
pictures and descriptions of what he said were dozens of nuclear weapons to the
London Sunday Times in 1986.
</P>
<P>
	   Lured into a trap by a female Mossad secret service agent in Europe and
whisked back to Israel, Vanunu was found guilty of espionage and sentenced to 18
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the meeting at the maximum security Shikma prison, The Associated
Press asked Katz to relay a question to Vanunu -- whether he has any further
secrets to disclose after his release. Katz said Vanunu replied that he does
not.
</P>
<P>
	   But at another point in their 45-minute conversation, Katz quoted Vanunu as
saying he would ``not talk about anything that has not been published.'' Katz
said that contradicted Vanunu's claim that he has already told all.
</P>
<P>
	   Security authorities apparently also believe Vanunu still has some secrets
under his belt. They extracted a pledge from Katz not to ask Vanunu anything
about the Dimona reactor.
</P>
<P>
	   The meeting was the second time that Vanunu had met with Katz, known as a
maverick in Ehud Barak's Labor party. Following the first visit 1 1/2 years ago,
prison authorities agreed to allow Vanunu to interact with other prisoners,
ending his 12 years in solitary confinement.
</P>
<P>
	   Vanunu is due for release in another 3 1/2 years. A parole commission
rejected the standard reduction of one-third of a prisoner's sentence for good
behavior, though there are no complaints about Vanunu's conduct.
</P>
<P>
	   Except for a ban on talking to Palestinian prisoners, Vanunu is free to roam
the Shikma prison in this southern Israeli town from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m., Katz
said. He spends much of his time writing and reading letters. Katz said Vanunu,
who is considered a hero abroad by many human rights activists, received more
than 1,000 letters last Christmas.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli officials have said Vanunu's disclosures did more damage to Israel's
security than the deeds of any other person. Israel continues to deny it has
nuclear weapons and has barred Vanunu from speaking to reporters while in
prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Vanunu has refused to express regret for his actions and charges that he has
been severely mistreated by Israeli authorities. He told Katz his main goal upon
release is to leave Israel.

<HEADLINE> Thai Schoolgirls Drown in Accident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Six schoolgirls drowned after walking into a pond
during a hike teachers told them to make blindfolded, Thai newspapers reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The reports said the reason for blindfolding the children was unclear. The
girls, aged 10-12, were on a Red Cross youth training outing when the accident
occurred Friday afternoon in Singha Nakhon district in the southern province of
Songkhla, according to the Bangkok Post newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   Eight girls walked into the 33-foot pond, although it was unclear from the
accounts if they were told to enter it. The Post reported that the girls
panicked and only two made it out safely.
</P>
<P>
	   Another newspaper, The Nation, reported that the girls' teachers, who were
not identified, were too afraid to jump in and rescue them. It said it took four
hours for police to recover the bodies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No teacher has come forward to take responsibility yet, not even the
school's principal,'' said Dollahman Dumlae, father of a victim, in The Nation
article. ``I want someone to make sure justice is done. It's not right.''

<HEADLINE> Chechnya's Environment Said Damaged  </HEADLINE>
   By NICK WADHAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   URUS-MARTAN, Russia (AP) -- Huge pillars of greasy black smoke rise into the
Chechen sky, towering over people who trudge past long-uncollected trash and
fear drinking the water. After six months of war, Chechnya suffers environmental
damage that makes it barely recognizable to its residents.
</P>
<P>
	   Chechnya's environment was devastated in a 1994-96 war with Russia, and its
soil, air and waterways still hadn't recovered when fighting resumed last fall.
In some places, it is bare of all foliage -- cut down by residents desperate for
wood to heat their homes.
</P>
<P>
	   In the southwestern city of Urus-Martan, residents say the sewage system
stopped working long ago, and people who fled here to escape fighting between
Russian forces and rebels elsewhere in the republic tell of land tainted by oil
from destroyed wells and littered with animal cadavers.
</P>
<P>
	   Snow sometimes falls in black flakes and a slick oil grime that covers
streets and homes can be tasted in food and water, they say.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You wake up in the morning and if you breathe too deeply, you start
coughing, said Asya Azimova, who recently fled the village of Oktyabrskoye.
``You drink the water and it feels like you're swallowing a rock.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``You live in a place all your life and you leave for a few months. When you
return, you can't recognize it because all the trees have been cut down,'' said
Shakhid Arsamerzayev, a 32-year-old refugee from the town of Alkhan-Kala.
</P>
<P>
	   Most damage has come from Chechnya's oil wells, many of which have been
blasted by Russian warplanes. Refugees say scores of wells have been burning out
of control for months, often turning the daytime sky black.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the most damaged areas in the mountainous republic is the capital,
Grozny, which is surrounded by oil refineries and was the target of massive
Russian airstrikes for months. More than 2 million tons of crude oil has leaked
from the refineries, Gen. Boris Alexeyev, director of environmental safety for
the Russian military, said recently.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The oil pollution is a colossal problem,'' said Alexei Yablokov, a
prominent Russian environmentalist. ``The spills are huge and just sitting
there, not being cleaned up, contaminating important waterways.''
</P>
<P>
	   Oil pollution was also a major problem after the first Chechen war, when
bombs and sabotage from both sides burst open wells.
</P>
<P>
	   After that conflict, hundreds of makeshift refineries sprouted up around the
republic as enterprising Chechens siphoned off oil from a major pipeline for
fuel. Those refineries were not built with ecological safety in mind and
contributed to pollution even before the war damage.
</P>
<P>
	   Yablokov also said that bombs had damaged storage facilities holding
radioactive waste around Grozny. The dumps store used medical and research
equipment that contain radioactive cesium and other elements, which could cause
health risks to people living nearby, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Alevtin Yunak, the deputy chief for ecological safety in Russia's armed
forces, told the ITAR-Tass news agency that a third of Chechnya's territory has
become ecologically unsafe.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials in Dagestan, which borders Chechnya to the east, say that the
Terek River, Chechnya's largest waterway, is completely covered by a film of
oil, in some places up to 2 inches thick.
</P>
<P>
	   Refugees also said infection was spreading quickly in several areas of
Chechnya because dead animals had been left to rot in the fields. They said some
had been poisoned after grazing on ground spoiled by oil and bombs, while others
were shot.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We go into a village and there are the bodies of dogs, chickens, cows,
sheep, horses just rotting there. The snipers pick them off for pleasure,''
Azimova said.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the walnut trees and oaks that once lined the main highway leading
west from Grozny have been whittled down to stumps by Chechens seeking firewood.
The few farms that survived or revived after the last war again stand empty or
ruined.
</P>
<P>
	   Refugees described ruined forests and barren and burning fields where homes
once stood.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The ecological situation in Chechnya is catastrophic,'' said Zalina
Abiyev, a 57-year-old refugee who fled Grozny. ``We're all afraid to go back
because we'll die like flies there, guaranteed.''

<HEADLINE> New Jersey lawmakers find computer 'cookies' unappetizing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Who wants cookies?
<P>
	   That's the question being asked by New Jersey lawmakers troubled by how
Internet marketers track the movements of, and learn about, people who cruise
the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Web sites attach "cookies," or virtual tags, to a person's computer
that identify the user when he or she returns. Cookies are what allow a
book-selling site, for instance, to welcome you back by name and suggest new
reading selections based on your prior purchases.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics say more sinister purposes are also possible.
</P>
<P>
	   In one high-profile case, the Federal Trade Commission and some states are
investigating whether the nation's largest online advertising firm, DoubleClick
Inc., violated the privacy of consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan Attorney General Jennifer Granholm alleged DoubleClick implants
electronic files on the hard drives of users' computers and plans to use the
customer information to create personal dossiers for marketing purposes.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is a disturbing reality that when we are online, everything we read and
write, every Web site that we visit, may be secretly monitored, recorded and
shared by companies looking to profit from our behavior," Sen. Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J., said in a speech on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
	   Torricelli recently introduced a bill that would presume computer surfers do
not want Web sites to share their information unless they "opt in" - that is,
notify the site that sharing information with marketers is OK.
</P>
<P>
	   A small number of sites now offer an "opt in" option; on others, it is
possible to "opt out." But in a letter to colleagues seeking support for the
bill, Torricelli said the problem with the "opt out" option is that Internet
users do not know how to do it or that doing it is possible.
</P>
<P>
	   "Rather than opting out of having personal details shared, the burden should
be placed on companies to contact consumers so that they have control over
whether or not personal information is disclosed," Torricelli wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics say placing that burden on Web sites could cripple marketing and
commerce on the Internet because so few people would bother to "opt in."
</P>
<P>
	   But Torricelli said his idea strikes "a workable balance" between
entrepreneurial opportunity and the right to privacy.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-Harding, is a believer in the "opt out"
concept. His recently proposed bill would require commercial Web sites to notify
visitors if any personal information is being collected while they are on the
site.
</P>
<P>
	   Visitors would be asked if they wanted to "opt out" of having that
information used or disseminated by the site operator.
</P>
<P>
	   "The bottom line is that the American public has the right to know who is
collecting information about them, and how that information is used,"
Frelinghuysen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Another New Jersey lawmaker, Rep. Bob Franks, R-Berkeley Heights, is pushing
a bill that would prohibit the sale of children's personal information without
the consent of their parents.
</P>
<P>
	   A second Franks bill would ban Web sites from disclosing to a third party
the Social Security number or related information of a visitor to the site
without the person's prior written consent.
</P>
<P>
	   Both bills were introduced a year ago but have not advanced.
</P>
<P>
	   The Center for Democracy &AMP; Technology offers a list of 10 ways to protect
privacy online.
</P>
<P>
	   They include:
</P>
<P>
	   -Look for privacy policies at Web sites. If none is found, e-mail the site
and urge posting of a policy.
</P>
<P>
	   -Teach children that giving out personal information online is like giving
it to strangers.
</P>
<P>
	   -Search your computer's hard drive for a file with the word "cookie" in it
and check it out. Consider deleting it.

<HEADLINE> Food Fears Foul French Festival  </HEADLINE>
    By EMMANUEL GEORGES-PICOT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PARIS (AP) -- France's food lovers gathered in Paris Sunday for the opening
of the nation's annual agriculture show, where farmers and political leaders are
reassuring the public that traditional products have never been safer despite
recent food safety crises.
</P>
<P>
	   "France is probably one of the countries where food safety is most assured,"
said French President Jacques Chirac, who inaugurated the 37th Salon de
l'Agriculture. "There's still progress to be made, but our farmers are
determined to do what's necessary."
</P>
<P>
	   The agriculture show comes as France confronts a listeria crisis that has
infected 26 people, seven of whom have died. Officials think a traditional
specialty, pork tongues in gelatin, is the likely cause of the epidemic. Other
food fears include mad cow disease and a dioxin scandal this summer.
</P>
<P>
	   Visitors lined up at tasting stands and crowded around makeshift farmyards
at the Porte de Versailles convention center to see the more than 1,000 sheep,
pigs and cows brought in from the country.
</P>
<P>
	   One prominent attendee at the show was Jose Bove, the radical farm leader
who has become a mascot for traditional farming with his campaign against "foul
food" -- bland, globalized products. Bove presented Chirac with a copy of his
latest book, and the president promised to read it.
</P>
<P>
	   Organizers expect 630,000 visitors to attend the show before it ends March
5. They say transparency is at the heart of this year's fair, as consumers have
become more concerned about what happens to their food before it reaches their
plates.
</P>
<P>
	   Jean Glavany, agriculture minister, said that if the French want to
safeguard traditional cuisine such as pates and pork tongues, they must
acknowledge the health risks such products can pose.
</P>
<P>
	   "One way to limit cases of listeriosis is to stop eating products that might
carry (the bacteria)," Glavany said in an interview with the weekly Journal du
Dimanche. "But I think the French want to continue to eat cheese made with raw
milk, pork meats and smoked fish."
</P>
<P>
	   "We need to learn how to limit these risks collectively rather than think we
can get rid of them," Glavany added.
</P>
<P>
	   Healthy people rarely contract listeriosis, which can cause high fever,
severe headaches, neck stiffness and nausea. It can be potentially fatal to
people with weak immune systems, including infants and the elderly, and can also
cause miscarriages and stillborn births.

<HEADLINE> US Carmakers Struggling in Europe  </HEADLINE>
    By BRUCE STANLEY AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- U.S. automakers are struggling to boost sales in Europe, and
analysts say the meager array of new models they plan to introduce at the
International Motor Show in Geneva this week won't do much to help.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford Motor Co. and, to a lesser extent, General Motors Corp. are lagging
behind their competitors in Europe, the most competitive of the world's mature
car markets. This is particularly true in the important small-car segment of the
industry.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford and GM have their "backs to the wall," said John Lawson, an industry
analyst with the U.S. investment bank Salomon Smith Barney in London.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're the weak players in the market at the moment," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   DaimlerChrysler Corp.'s Chrysler brand, meanwhile, is a relative newcomer to
Europe and has yet to make a big impression on brand-conscious consumers here.
</P>
<P>
	   Europeans seemed to favor Volkswagens, Peugeots and other homegrown products
last year when they bought a record 15.07 million passenger cars.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet none of the three U.S. automakers is angling to make a big splash in the
Geneva show, which opens to the public Thursday, by introducing a host of new
models for the European mass market.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford saw its market share in Europe slip last year from 11.8 percent to 11.2
percent, according to Salomon Smith Barney. The automaker suffers from excess
production capacity in the region and is laying off 1,350 workers at its biggest
plant in Britain as part of an effort to trim costs.
</P>
<P>
	   The company has a compelling need to restructure. Its profit from European
operations was only $28 million last year on sales of $30 billion. By contrast,
it earned $193 million in 1998 on regional sales of $24 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford's Focus compact, which competes with Volkswagen AG's Golf, has been its
star performer in Europe. But the company has postponed plans to develop a model
for the high-growth compact minivan market.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford plans to unveil what it calls a "newly freshened" Galaxy minivan in
Geneva, but has no completely new models in store.
</P>
<P>
	   General Motors maintained its 11.5 percent share of the European market last
year, selling 1.74 million vehicles. GM is well established in Germany, Europe's
largest car market, thanks to its Opel brand.
</P>
<P>
	   However, GM has a weak stable of upper-midsized models, and its smaller cars
are older and less exciting than comparable designs from PSA Peugeot Citroen and
Renault S.A., said Ludovic Fava, an analyst at Credit Lyonnais in Paris.
</P>
<P>
	   GM plans to introduce three new Opel models in Geneva -- the two-seater
Speedster, the luxury Omega V8 and the Agila microvan. The Speedster and Omega
are niche vehicles and will appeal to a limited number of consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   The prototype of GM's Cadillac Imaj also will make its debut. The Imaj marks
GM's latest effort to portray Cadillac as a high-tech worthy competitor to
Mercedes, BMW and other recognized luxury brands.
</P>
<P>
	   Europeans bought a minuscule 1,500 Cadillacs last year. The brand suffers
from doubts about the quality of its workmanship, Dresdner Kleinwort Benson
analyst Adam Collins said.
</P>
<P>
	   Chrysler, the third major U.S. brand, sold 19,000 passenger cars in Western
Europe last year -- just 1 percent of Ford's 1.68 million in total European
sales.
</P>
<P>
	   "The smallest thing they make is the Neon, which is probably too big for the
market," said Jim Collins, a European auto analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
	   Chrysler plans to introduce the Sebring, a new mid-sized car for Europe, at
the Geneva show.
</P>
<P>
	   DaimlerChrysler has seen modest but growing European sales of two other
Chrysler models -- Jeep and the Voyager minivan.
</P>
<P>
	   "As a niche player they do pretty well, but they're not a volume player.
Volume requires investment, and whether or not they make that investment is
quite the hot topic now," said Collins of DLJ.
</P>
<P>
	   Europe's auto industry has an excess production capacity of some 25 percent,
and that means DaimlerChrysler has little incentive to build a new plant.
</P>
<P>
	   The company also could expand by buying a smaller carmaker. Observers have
speculated that Peugeot, Fiat SpA and Honda Motor Co. are all potential takeover
targets.

<HEADLINE> Volunteers to compile guide to NJ's reptiles and amphibians  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SEWELL, N.J. (AP) - From now through September hundreds will go,
communing with nature, their children in tow.
<P>
	   They'll slog through the swamps and wade through the bogs, compiling a list
of the snakes and the frogs.
</P>
<P>
	   ----
</P>
<P>
	   Call them the census takers of the animal kingdom, reptilian division.
</P>
<P>
	   To date, more than 200 "citizen scientists" have been recruited by the
state's wildlife agency to help compile the first "New Jersey Herptile Atlas," a
catalog of the numbers and habitats of the state's reptiles and amphibians.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 160 attended a training session here over the weekend to study up
for the big count. They spent the day being briefed by naturalists and learning
to identify some 73 varieties of toads, frogs, lizards, salamanders, turtles and
snakes they'll be looking for.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 50 other volunteers previously took the course, and interest is so
great that another 60 are on a waiting list, said Eric Stiles, senior zoologist
with the state Department of Environmental Protection's Endangered and Nongame
Species Program.
</P>
<P>
	   Local and state officials will use the end product of their work - the "Herp
Atlas," as participants call it - to make better-informed land-use decisions,
Kathleen Clark, principal zoologist with the endangered species program, told
The Press of Atlantic City for Sunday's editions.
</P>
<P>
	   The atlas will help officials identify land that might merit special
protection because it is home to endangered species or a large variety of herp
species, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "As we get more and more people out there, it will increase knowledge of
endangered and threatened species," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The environmental protection aspect is important to volunteer Kevin Lippert,
41, of Mays Landing, who pointed out that the endangered Eastern tiger
salamander, a striking orange and black amphibian that grows 8 inches long, was
discovered last week on the site of the proposed Cape May County branch of
Atlantic Cape Community College.
</P>
<P>
	   "People are not looking for what they are supposed to be looking for before
they build, and this is going to help," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   For other volunteers, like Paul Long, 45, of Vineland, and his son, David,
11, the project also offers an opportunity for quality time together. They plan
to survey an area near their home and the elder Long's childhood home in nearby
Millville.
</P>
<P>
	   "I guess we'll take any excuse to spend time outdoors," he said.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Ricans Vote for GOP Hopefuls  </HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS HAWLEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- They can't vote in presidential elections.
They have no vote in Congress. But in Sunday's Republican Party primary, the
people of Puerto Rico exercised a rare chance to be heard on the national stage.
</P>
<P>
	   Wielding 14 delegates -- the same number as Maine, Rhode Island and Hawaii,
and more than Vermont or Delaware -- they chose between George W. Bush and John
McCain in a primary seen as a test of popularity among Hispanic voters and a
chance to gather important momentum.
</P>
<P>
	   But the vote's relatively low profile -- no candidate visits, no CNN exit
polls -- underscored America's ambivalent relationship with its Caribbean
territory of 4 million Spanish speakers, U.S. citizens all.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was hoping to be able to carry (Puerto Rico) without going down,'' Bush
told The San Juan Star newspaper, which endorsed him Saturday, joining the local
party's strongly pro-Bush establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   The vote, which began at 8 a.m., was open to all 2.3 million registered
voters -- including Democrats -- and results were expected Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Govan, an adviser to the Bush campaign here, said a convincing
victory should underscore the Spanish-speaking governor's ability to attract
mainland Hispanics as well.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday Bush swept all 12 delegates chosen at caucuses in three other
U.S. island territories -- the nearby Virgin Islands and Guam and American Samoa
in the Pacific -- giving him 79 delegates compared to 96 for McCain; 1,034 are
needed for the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   As in most elections here, voters said the most important issue was
candidates' view on Puerto Rico's unusual status. Under the commonwealth, Puerto
Ricans pay no federal taxes, but receive billions in federal funds; they serve
in the U.S. military, but other than the party primaries, they cannot vote for
president.
</P>
<P>
	   The local Republican Party overwhelmingly favors U.S. statehood, but is
frustrated with the Republican Congress because of its failure to pass a 1998
bill that would have made that possible. Bush -- like his father -- is a strong
supporter of statehood for the island, even though it would likely send mostly
Democrats to Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Bush is the candidate that I like and who can bring statehood to Puerto
Rico,'' said Dinora Perez, 64, as she cast her vote in San Juan.
</P>
<P>
	   Nancy Nunez, 34, praised McCain as ``a military man (who) knows how to make
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
	   The vote comes at a low point in relations between Puerto Ricans and the
Republican Party, for reasons beyond its coolness to statehood.
</P>
<P>
	   Many islanders resent Congress' decision in 1996 to eliminate special tax
breaks that helped Puerto Rico climb out of devastating poverty over the last
four decades.
</P>
<P>
	   Islanders are also annoyed at Republican opposition to their demands that
the U.S. Navy close a bombing range on the island of Vieques. The push to expel
the Navy has generated a rare consensus among the island's political leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   Islanders are fearful that a future Republican president might overrule
President Clinton's January directive -- reached after months of negotiations --
under which the Navy must leave by 2002, if the residents of Vieques vote for
it.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has said he would stick to that plan, but McCain only says he would
consider it and that the Pentagon should seek other training grounds while
keeping in mind the importance of Vieques. The Navy calls Vieques the ``crown
jewel'' of its Atlantic Fleet training program.
</P>
<P>
	   The more influential Democratic caucuses, scheduled for March 26, will
apportion the 58 voting delegates Puerto Rico sends to the Democratic convention
-- more than 23 states.
</P>
<P>
	   Pro-statehood Gov. Pedro Rossello is Vice President Al Gore's campaign
adviser on Hispanic issues and one of his biggest fundraisers. Bill Bradley
visited the island in August and courted Rossello's rivals -- members of the
Democratic faction that support commonwealth.

<HEADLINE> Pope Says Vatican II Still Relevant  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- The work of the reform-making Second Vatican Council
will guide the Roman Catholic Church into the new millennium, Pope John Paul II
said Sunday, implicitly rejecting the idea of a new council to push for
additional reforms.
</P>
<P>
	   The pope spoke at a Vatican assembly about the 1962-65 Second Vatican
Council, or Vatican II, which championed historic changes in the church's
liturgy, bureaucracy and relations with other religions. One of the council's
most noticeable revisions was replacing Latin with local languages during Mass.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's already given us many rewards in these 35 years of life, and will
give us many more in the years to come,'' said John Paul, recently returned from
the first of his 2000 Holy Year pilgrimages.
</P>
<P>
	   The church's job now, he said, was to study the commitments made in Vatican
II and to put them into effect.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Catholic liberals, hoping for changes such as an increased say for the
laity,and married and women priests, have urged the church to call a new
council.

<HEADLINE> Despite Diallo trial, cameras no sure bet to return to court  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The Diallo verdict is in, but it remains far from
clear whether the use of courtroom cameras in that trial will provide the
impetus to restore audio-visual coverage of other New York courtrooms.
<P>
	   Legislation restoring camera coverage of trials will be introduced in the
wake of the Diallo experience, aides to legislative leaders and Gov. George
Pataki said. But the same objections which prompted the state to stop allowing
cameras in criminal courts three years ago are still being voiced, despite few,
if any, complaints about the coverage of the Diallo trial.
</P>
<P>
	   The Diallo trial was the first televised trial in the state since lawmakers
stopped renewing a temporary law allowing cameras into trials and criminal court
hearings in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   State Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi ruled the Diallo trial should be
televised after he found that a law banning cameras from courtrooms in New York
is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's absolutely wonderful," Albany Law School Professor Vincent
Bonventre said. "It certainly helps lay people understand what goes on in
criminal prosecution."
</P>
<P>
	   Teresi's ruling was not binding to other judges, but it did establish
judicial precedence. At least three other judges in New York allowed cameras
into their courtrooms following Teresi's decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Diane Kennedy, president of the New York Newspaper Publishers Association,
called the television coverage of the Diallo trial a "success." Teresi's
decision probably averted more violent protests by those unhappy with the
acquittal of the four police officers charged with killing African immigrant
Amadou Diallo, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Diallo trial was moved from the Bronx, where Diallo was killed, to
Albany after a state appeals court agreed with defense contentions that the
officers could not receive a fair trial in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
	   "It gave people who had a right to see the trial a view inside the
situation," Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
	   New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani likewise praised the decision to let
the Diallo trial be telecast. It allowed people to sort through the difficult
legal issues in the Diallo case themselves and not rely on others'
interpretations, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents of courtroom cameras cited the excesses of the coverage of the
O.J. Simpson trial as a reason for abandoning New York's
cameras-in-the-courtroom law in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Bonventre said the coverage of the Diallo trial showed that Teresi was no
Lance Ito, the much-criticized judge who presided over the Simpson case.
</P>
<P>
	   "Teresi is magnificent. He keeps everybody on a short leash," Bonventre
said. "It certainly makes it hard for lawmakers to make a case against cameras
in the courtroom. It's going to be very difficult to argue against cameras now."
</P>
<P>
	   But state Sen. James Lack, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said
Friday he "hasn't gotten any excited reflexes" from other legislators on
reinstating the cameras law.
</P>
<P>
	   "Legislatively, there have been problems of getting a law allowing cameras
in the courtroom enacted on a permanent basis," Lack said. "Hopefully (the
Diallo trial) will serve as one more example that when done right, televised
coverage of a trial presents a positive viewpoint to the public."
</P>
<P>
	   State Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno said following the Diallo verdict
that the case showed that cameras can work in court. He said bills to restore
visual coverage of trials are being discussed in both chambers of the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, considered by media
representatives to be the biggest impediment to allowing cameras in the
courtroom, is ready to re-examine the issue, spokesman Charles Carrier said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're prepared to take a serious step about considering a cameras in
courtroom bill this year," Carrier said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Kennedy questioned Silver's seriousness, calling the speaker the "one
and only roadblock" to allowing cameras in courtrooms.
</P>
<P>
	   "He has said he's going to pass a bill but he hasn't done anything," she
said. "How long does it take to pass a camera bill?"
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents of cameras generally argue that lawyers, witnesses and judges
could play to courtroom cameras, and that defendants' rights to fair trials
could be violated in the process.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki has said he favors restoring cameras in court and his spokesman
Michael McKeon said the governor will also propose a bill.
</P>
<P>
	   In the absence of agreement on a new courtroom camera law, Kennedy said
coverage decisions will be made on a judge-by-judge basis until the state's
highest court, the Court of Appeals, ultimately decides whether cameras should
be in or out of courts.
</P>
<P>
	   A recent poll suggests that New Yorkers are of two minds about camera
coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   The Quinnipiac College Polling Institute poll, conducted during the Diallo
trial for the New York Law Journal, showed half of New Yorkers endorse
televising criminal trials while 43 percent said they thought it is a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
	   Two-thirds of the respondents said they believe that televising trials helps
the public understand the criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll of New York state voters had a margin of error of 3 percentage
points.

<HEADLINE> Bush 'Regrets' Bob Jones Flap  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- In a letter to the leader of New York's Catholics,
Gov. George W. Bush says his campaign appearance at a South Carolina school with
anti-Catholic views was a ``missed opportunity causing needless offense, which I
deeply regret.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has come under steady criticism for his Feb. 2 visit to Bob Jones
University, a Christian school whose founder has criticized the Pope and labeled
the Catholic church a ``Satanic cult.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's opponents have assailed him for not using the appearance to speak out
against the policies of the school, which also bans interracial dating. Bush
spoke about his conservatism.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to Cardinal John O'Connor of New York, leader of the
archdiocese's 2.4 million Roman Catholics, Bush states his ``profound respect''
for the Catholic Church and says criticism of him is unfair and unfounded.
</P>
<P>
	   ``On reflection, I should have been more clear in disassociating myself from
anti-Catholic sentiments and racial prejudice,'' he said in the letter, mailed
Friday and released Sunday by his campaign. ``It was a missed opportunity
causing needless offense, which I deeply regret.''
</P>
<P>
	   The letter marked an abrupt reversal for Bush, who only last week said: ``I
don't make any apologies for what I do in the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush faced questions about the speech almost as soon as he finished
speaking. In response, he has said he opposes the school's policy on interracial
dating and the comments of its leaders, but that he did not regret the decision
to speak at the school. He also has noted that a brother and sister-in-law are
Catholic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let me make it crystal clear: I reject bigotry, I reject prejudice, I
repudiate anti-Catholicism and racism,'' Bush said last week. ``And I reject the
politics of those why try to pit one group of Americans against another, of
those who try to divide us based upon our race or based upon our faith.''
</P>
<P>
	   The appearance also was the subject of telephone calls that Republican
presidential rival Sen. John McCain acknowledged his campaign had placed to
Michigan voters. But McCain stood by past assertions that the calls did not say
Bush was a bigot.
</P>
<P>
	   In a television interview Sunday, McCain acknowledged approving the calls
before they were made in advance of the Republican primary in Michigan last
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   His staff originally denied they were being made, which McCain said was
because the questions they were asked mischaracterized the calls as labeling
Bush a bigot.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the calls ``said exactly what is fact, and that is he went to this
university.''
</P>
<P>
	   The calls were acknowledged just before the polls closed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was no charge in that transcript of those phone calls that said he
was anti-Catholic or anything else,'' he said on CBS's ``Face the Nation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Karl Rove, Bush's chief strategist, defended the Texas governor, noting that
Bush has spoken out against bigotry at the school while admitting he could have
done more.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This has been turned into a rather ugly episode in American politics.
President Ronald Reagan went there, the governor of the state of South Carolina,
a Democrat, went there, Jack Kemp went there, Dan Quayle went there, and none of
them were criticized for supposedly harboring anti-Catholic views simply because
they went there,'' Rove said on Fox News Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Authorities Probe Amish Death  </HEADLINE>

	   DORNSIFE, Pa. (AP) -- The pathologist saw blood in the brain and
hemorrhaging in one retina of the dead 4-month-old Amish girl. As a result, a
coroner ruled the death homicide due to shaken baby syndrome, stunning this tiny
town and Pennsylvania's scattered Amish communities.

<P>
	   Days later, an expert on Amish illnesses said the ruling was wrong, that
Sarah Lynn Glick died of a vitamin K deficiency and a rare liver disease.
</P>
<P>
	   Two months later, authorities still are trying to unravel the truth.
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever the eventual ruling, Sarah's death is one more example of the
sometimes blurred line between illness and child abuse, as when a rare disease
mimics the bruising, bleeding or fractures of shaken baby syndrome.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Minnesota officials took 1-year-old Wyatt Hines from his parents
for three months after finding fractures in the boy's bones. His parents
insisted he had osteogenesis imperfecta, or ``brittle bone disease,'' a
hard-to-diagnose disease that the Osteogenesis Imperfecta Foundation says may
affect 20,000 to 50,000 people in this country.
</P>
<P>
	   In another case, a newborn was taken from her parents in Denver in 1991
before doctors diagnosed her with glutaric aciduria type 1, a liver disorder. In
Nashville, an infant with the liver disease Alagille's syndrome was briefly sent
to a foster home in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors are required by law to report suspicious cases to social workers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If it's disease, the worst you have is an angry family. If it's abuse, the
other kids are in deadly danger,'' said Dr. Randall Alexander of the Center for
Child Abuse at Atlanta's Morehouse School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
	   In Sarah's case, the first to question the pathologist's conclusion of
homicide was Dr. Holmes Morton of the Clinic for Special Children in Strasburg.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When you see a child that has blood in the brain, you must think child
abuse, because unfortunately that happens in our culture, but you must also
think of other disorders that mimic it,'' said Morton. He said he was angry that
Sarah's parents remained under suspicion in the little girl's death.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Michael Kenny, the pathologist at Geisinger Medical Center where she
died, is expected to report on his review of the case next week.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither Kenny nor Tony Rosini, Northumberland County's district attorney,
returned calls for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're on hold,'' said State Police Cpl. Carey Latsha, who oversaw the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Sarah's parents, dairy farmers Liz and Samuel Glick, found her unconscious
on Dec. 21, after the infant had been vomiting for days. She died two days
later. Declaring it abuse, child services put the Glicks' other seven children
in foster care until Feb. 17.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Liz is a very quiet, calm person,'' neighbor Lisa Williard said. ``This
really has boggled my mind.''
</P>
<P>
	   Morton explained that, earlier this century, doctors frequently saw babies
with hemorrhaging caused by vitamin K deficiencies. Today, babies get vitamin K
in shots and baby formula, but Sarah, delivered by a midwife and then breast
fed, got neither. Without it, her blood did not clot properly.
</P>
<P>
	   Compounding Sarah's problem was a genetic liver defect, Morton said. Even if
she had been getting the vitamin, her body would not have been able to break it
down.
</P>
<P>
	   The illness is not widely known, but Morton still criticized the handling of
Sarah's death. Reports of similar cases involving vitamin K deficiency have
appeared in several medical journals.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The data was in the file the day she died and was never read or understood
by the people that pressed this investigation,'' Morton said. ``We haven't
discovered anything that supports a diagnosis of abuse in this child.''
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities who have dealt with similar cases say there is good reason to
thoroughly investigate claims of disease that could actually be signs of child
abuse.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You're going to err on the side of protecting the child,'' said Susan
Gaertner, a prosecutor in Minnesota. ``Would people want us to do it any other
way, when a child's safety is at risk?''

<HEADLINE> Brown: O.J. Pulling Publicity Stunt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Nicole Brown Simpson's sister says O.J. Simpson's lawsuit
against a phone company for records to prove his innocence is just a publicity
stunt.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He just wants to be out there on the news because his ego can't handle the
fact that everything's quiet, nobody's talking about him,'' Denise Brown said
Saturday on KABC-AM.
</P>
<P>
	   Simpson was acquitted of the 1994 murders of his ex-wife and her friend,
Ronald Goldman. But a jury in a civil suit ordered him to pay a $33.5 million
judgment.
</P>
<P>
	   Simpson filed the lawsuit Thursday alleging GTE Corp. violated his civil
rights by failing to release phone records he subpoenaed last year. Simpson
claims the records would prove he didn't kill his ex-wife. GTE officials had no
comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Simpson's attorney, Douglas E. McCann, challenged Brown's family to release
the records.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If Denise Brown is so upset about it, why doesn't she just ask her parents
to consent to release them? Her parents have the power here,'' McCann
said.

<HEADLINE> Russians Thwart Chechen Rebels  </HEADLINE>
   By YURI BAGROV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHIRI-YURT, Russia (AP) -- Russian forces have encircled the last major
stronghold held by Chechnya's rebels but face intense and bloody fighting to
overcome their heavy defenses, Russian officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   An estimated 2,700 rebels are concentrated around the village of Shatoi,
deep in the southern mountains, the last section of Chechnya where rebels have a
strong presence.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian forces are aiming to wipe out the rebels before spring, when rebels
can move more easily than they can in the snow and when new-leafed foliage gives
them better cover.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There will be no easy road for federals. Fierce battles are in store,'' a
Russian commander, Lt. Gen. Vladimir Bulgakov, was quoted as saying by the news
agency ITAR-Tass.
</P>
<P>
	   The remaining rebels are ``diehards who have no way out'' and their
desperation is expected to drive them to fight intensely.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian warplanes and helicopter gunships have pounded the rebels in the
mountains heavily for weeks, likely inflicting substantial damage. But as
Russian troops close in, they will not be able to count on air attacks to soften
up the strongholds, another top commander said.
</P>
<P>
	   Eventually, ``we will not be able to use aviation for fear of damaging our
own units,'' said Lt. Gen. Gennady Troshev, according to ITAR-Tass.
</P>
<P>
	   Capt. Andrei Frolov said, ``for us it is difficult, especially in Shatoi
where their defense fortifications are even better than in Grozny,'' the Chechen
capital where rebels resisted Russian ground troops for months before fleeing in
early February.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The rebels are trying to break the siege, and some are succeeding,''
Frolov said. ``In the daytime, they hide and at night appear in groups of 15-20
people and use sniper rifles and grenade launchers'' in their attempt to break
out of Shatoi.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian warplanes and helicopter gunships flew more than 120 missions over
Chechnya over the past 24 hours, bombarding the Shatoi region and suspected
rebel bases in the Argun and Vedeno gorges, the military command told the
Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia sent ground forces into Chechnya in late September to fight
separatist rebels whom it blamed for apartment bombings in Russia. The bombings
came after Chechnya-based Muslim fighters invaded the neighboring republic of
Dagestan in August and were driven out by Russian forces.
</P>
<P>
	   Many foreign governments and international human-rights groups have made
increasing calls on Russia to investigate reports of atrocities including
summary execution of civilians and torture of detainees in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   Alvaro Gil-Robles, the Council of Europe human rights commissioner, went to
the North Caucasus on Sunday to visit refugee camps in Ingushetia, the Russian
republic neighboring Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   Gil-Robles, accompanied by Vladimir Kalamanov, the presidential envoy in
charge human rights in Chechnya, was to visit Grozny on Monday.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   Diseases that sometimes mimic child abuse:
</P>
<P>
	   --Osteogenesis imperfecta, or brittle bone disease. Affects more than 20,000
people. Similar illnesses: hypophosphatasia, juvenile osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
	   --Alagille's syndrome. The liver disease can cause clotting problems and a
thin skull that cracks easily. Affects one in 100,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Madonna Worried About Song Remake  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Madonna wasn't sure if she could do justice to Don McLean's
1971 classic "American Pie."
</P>
<P>
	   She told the New York Daily News for Sunday's editions she recorded her own
version of McLean's homage to Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper for
her new movie "The Next Best Thing" at the urging of co-star Rupert Everett.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought, 'Who am I to do a cover of a pop classic?' But I was working in
the studio on other music, and it was like, 'OK, let's just try it.' And it kind
of worked, to my surprise."
</P>
<P>
	   Everett also lends his voice to the song in distant background vocals.
</P>
<P>
	   "To me, it's a real millennium song," Madonna said. "We're going through a
big change in terms of the way we view pop culture, because of the Internet. In
a way, it's like saying goodbye to music as we know it -- and to pop culture as
we know it."

<HEADLINE> Candidates on Medical Accounts  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Three days a week, The Associated Press picks an issue and asks the
presidential candidates a question about it. Today's question and the responses:
</P>
<P>
	   Medical Savings Accounts
</P>
<P>
	   Should the government let anyone set aside money in a tax-free medical
savings account to help pay for their health care?
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats:
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Bradley: ``I have made quality, affordable, accessible health insurance
for all Americans a top priority in my campaign for president. Medical savings
accounts fragment the risk pool and are the exact opposite of the purpose of
insurance -- that is, to spread the risk as broadly as possible. Health care is
a shared responsibility, which in part means that we all pay in for the day when
we have to draw upon our insurance. Medical savings accounts mean wealthier
people can opt out of the risk pool, leaving a smaller pool of poorer people who
would face higher premiums. That is inconsistent with my plans for health
care.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Al Gore: ``I am opposed to Republican proposals to broaden medical savings
accounts. These proposals have the potential to segment healthy populations from
the sick in the insurance market and therefore leave sicker populations with
higher health care costs. We already have some demonstrations on MSAs today and
should wait and see what kind of impact they have on the insurance market
forward considering a full blown proposal.''
</P>
<P>
	   Reform:
</P>
<P>
	   Pat Buchanan: No response.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans:
</P>
<P>
	   George W. Bush: ``I want a health care system that is patient-driven, not
government-run, that leaves medical decisions in the hands of physicians instead
of insurance companies, that encourages research and innovation, and that offers
more and better choices to consumers. I believe every American should have
access to quality, affordable health care by giving consumers better information
about health care plans, providing more choices such as medical savings accounts
and changing tax laws to help more people, such as the uninsured and the
self-employed, afford health insurance.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes: ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
	   John McCain: ``My tax plan immediately expands and strengthens MSAs. The
plan expands eligibility for MSAs to all Americans who have a high-deductible
health insurance plan. It eliminates the requirement that insurance coverage be
paid for by the employer. In addition, the plan lowers the minimum deductible in
the required insurance plan to $1,000 for singles and $2,000 for families and it
allows taxpayers an MSA tax deduction before taking standard or itemized
deductions. The proposal eliminates the cap on the number of MSAs permitted by
law and makes them permanent. It helps the millions of American families who do
not have long-term care insurance and are particularly vulnerable to the
enormous expenses of long-term health care.''

<HEADLINE> India Accuses Pakistan in Killings  </HEADLINE>
   By BINOO JOSHI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JAMMU, India (AP) -- India on Sunday said Pakistani soldiers slipped across
the cease-fire line and killed one Indian officer and six soldiers.
</P>
<P>
	   Those killed were manning a military post in Laam sector, nearly 100 miles
northwest of Jammu, the winter capital of Indian-held Jammu-Kashmir state, said
Maj. Gen. P.P.S. Bindra.
</P>
<P>
	   Another Indian officer and three soldiers were missing since early Sunday.
``We suspect their bodies might have been dragged by the Pakistanis to their
side,'' Bindra told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   A Pakistani army spokesman called the accusations ``baseless and false'' and
said none of its soldiers have crossed the line.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These allegations also manifest of increasing frustration and panic of the
Indian government and its army, that stems from their inability to control the
freedom movement in Indian-held Kashmir,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   India's claim came two days after Pakistan accused Indian solders of
crossing over and killing 14 civilians in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir. India has
said no such attack occurred.
</P>
<P>
	   In Lahore, a Pakistan city nearly 100 miles southwest of Jammu, a dozen
people burned the Indian flag and effigies of Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee to protest the killings.
</P>
<P>
	   A militant group, the Harakat-ul-Jehad Islami, announced on loudspeakers
Sunday that its activists staged a revenge attack on a nearby Indian border
post, killing 35 soldiers. The group said its guerrillas returned with the body
of an Indian captain and the heads of four soldiers.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistani authorities discounted the militants' account.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I wouldn't give it much credence,'' said Javed Jabbar, a special adviser
to the army chief.
</P>
<P>
	   India and Pakistan have fought three wars, two over control of Kashmir,
since they won independence from Britain in 1947. They drew a cease-fire line in
1972, but exchange artillery fire almost daily now and have had several border
incursions in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   In May, tensions in Kashmir pushed the two nuclear-armed countries to the
brink of war. India launched massive air and ground attacks to repel what it
said were Islamic guerrillas and Pakistani troops occupying mountain heights on
India's side.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan said the intruders were Islamic militants fighting a separatist war
in Indian-controlled Kashmir since 1989.

    NEW YORK (AP) -- Members of Oasis say they've abandoned their bad behavior
to concentrate on making music.
</P>
<P>
	   The group's fourth album "Standing on the Shoulder of Giants" is scheduled
to hit record stores Tuesday, and its world tour kicks off this week in Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   Singer-songwriter Noel Gallagher says the band has outgrown the excesses
that fueled its wild ways in recent years. The group was banned from Cathay
Pacific Airways in 1998 after getting rowdy on a flight from Hong Kong to
Australia.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's a phase that every band goes through, where the hedonism just
becomes all-consuming, and all of a sudden you realize that what you are in the
band for -- which is the actual music -- has become a secondary issue," he told
the New York Post for Sunday's editions.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- A woman who claims to see similarities between her own
sexual abuse as a child and the case of JonBenet Ramsey has a history of making
false reports, California officials said in Sunday's Daily Camera.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boulder newspaper reported last week that the California woman suggested
the 6-year-old beauty queen was killed accidentally when an asphyxiation
technique was used by an adult to stimulate orgasmic response.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheriff's investigators in California spent hundreds of hours looking into
the woman's claim in 1991 that she had been raped. They were unable to confirm
her claim, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She has filed a number of reports with us and most of them have been
determined to be unfounded,'' said San Louis Obispo County sheriff's Sgt. C.J.
Bell.
</P>
<P>
	   The 37-year-old woman has drawn parallels between her experiences and the
physical evidence of garroting found on JonBenet's body, the newspaper stated.
</P>
<P>
	   Boulder County District Attorney Alex Hunter initially described the
information as new evidence that needed to be thoroughly investigated. No one
answered the telephone at his office Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   JonBenet was found beaten and strangled in the basement of her family's home
on Dec. 26, 1996. The coroner also found signs of injuries in her genital area.
</P>
<P>
	   A grand jury investigated the case for 13 months, but no charges were filed.
Police have said JonBenet's parents remain suspects. The Ramseys, who have moved
to the Atlanta area, deny any involvement in her death.

<HEADLINE> Cubans Hold Rally for Expelled Envoy  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Shouting, ``Down with the lie!'' scores of teen-agers held a
pro-government rally Sunday outside the family home of a Cuban diplomat expelled
from the United States after he ignored a State Department demand that he leave
the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Jose Imperatori, 46, was taken into custody by U.S. authorities and flown
aboard a U.S. government plane to Montreal on Saturday night. He was expected to
leave Canada for Havana on Sunday, but his plans were not clear. Even
Imperatori's family said they weren't sure when he would arrive.
</P>
<P>
	   Watching the small demonstration of teen-agers waving small Cuban flags
outside her white, two-story home in Havana's Vedado neighborhood, Imperatori's
mother, Matilde Garcia, said she looked forward to her son's arrival.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are absolutely fine and we are confident that everything will turn out
well,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Imperatori's wife, Raquel Fundora, and the couple's 3-year-old son, were
also at the home after returning to Havana on Friday night before their
diplomatic immunity expired.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is incredible that a person who wants to demonstrate (his innocence)
... is not allowed to,'' Fundora said, referring to her husband's attempts to
prove he had done nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
	   Imperatori, accompanied by his lawyer, was escorted away from his suburban
Maryland apartment by FBI officials who turned up shortly after 8:30 p.m.
Saturday. The State Department said he was expelled for not voluntarily leaving
by the appointed time.
</P>
<P>
	   Late Saturday morning, Imperatori announced his plan to defy the State
Department expulsion order so he could contest allegations linking him with U.S.
immigration official Mariano Faget, who has been charged with spying for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I declare myself in a hunger strike until I have been absolutely cleared
of the accusations brought against me,'' Imperatori said several hours before
the State Department's deadline for him to depart the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban officials say that they believe the allegations are a smokescreen
erected to block the return of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Faget was arrested a few days before a scheduled court hearing on the
Gonzalez case, which was later postponed. The State Department has dismissed
such speculation as ``utter nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
	   The boy was rescued from the Florida straits in late November after his
mother and her boyfriend died, along with several other people, in an effort to
get from Cuba to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Whether Elian should be returned to Cuba or stay with relatives in Miami has
created an international furor.
</P>
<P>
	   Fernando Remirez, head of Cuba's diplomatic mission, acknowledged that
Imperatori had maintained contacts with Faget, but said they were no different
from the kinds of aboveboard relationships the mission maintains with many
Cuban-Americans and other Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday morning, Imperatori gave Remirez his resignation as consular
affairs officer, leaving him without diplomatic immunity before the 1:30 p.m.
Saturday deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Imperatori and Remirez have been adamant in their insistence that the
Cuban Interests Section does not engage in spying and is used solely for
improving relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   In their case against Faget, federal authorities said that 12 minutes after
they fed him phony information about a pending defection by a Cuban official,
they caught him passing it on to a contact with ties to the Cuban government.

<HEADLINE> 2 Die in Crash of Stolen Ambulance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- An ambulance stolen from a hospital parking lot ran a
red light at high speed and plowed into a car, killing two people, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   The woman driving the ambulance was ``apparently disoriented and obviously
not an employee of the ambulance company,'' Sgt. Joe Vargas said.
</P>
<P>
	   The ambulance had been taken from Anaheim Memorial Hospital, about a mile
from the site of Saturday's crash. The driver was wearing a hospital
identification bracelet but it was unclear whether she was a patient, Vargas
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The victims in the car, which was ripped in half, were identified as Brandon
Tran, 20, and Michael Rebaza, 21, both of Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
	   The woman driving the ambulance was taken to Western Medical Center, where a
nursing supervisor would not give her condition Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The woman was expected to be arrested and booked for investigation of grand
theft of a vehicle, Vargas said.

<HEADLINE> French PM Puzzles Israelis, Arabs  </HEADLINE>
   By SAMAR ASSAD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BIR ZEIT, West Bank (AP) -- The reactions were predictable: Israelis praised
France's prime minister for calling their enemies ``terrorists,'' while Arabs
said Lionel Jospin should have known better.
</P>
<P>
	   Less predictable -- for both sides -- was Jospin's apparent break with a
decades-old French Mideast policy that carefully courted the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
	   Jospin beat a hasty retreat from the Palestinian areas on Saturday after
students rioted during his visit at Bir Zeit University in the West Bank. He
suffered a slight head wound.
</P>
<P>
	   Jospin's description of attacks by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas
against Israeli soldiers in south Lebanon as ``terrorist'' activity sparked
anger throughout the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Jospin's statements contradict French policy announced by President
Jacques Chirac and cannot possibly serve'' Arab-French relations, said the
official Tishrin newspaper in Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   Chirac, a conservative, reprimanded Jospin, a socialist, when he returned to
Paris Saturday night, reminding him of France's delicate ``equilibrium'' in its
support of Israel and the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
	   Chirac's views are consistent with French foreign policy dating back to
1967, when President Charles de Gaulle sharply reversed what had been a
decidedly pro-Israel policy, because it had increasingly hampered France's
extensive Arab trade and military ties.
</P>
<P>
	   Jospin was careful not to break entirely with that tradition, sounding
traditional French positions that would not have appealed to his Israeli hosts:
an end to strikes at civilian targets in Lebanon, support for Palestinian
statehood, and an end to Jewish settlement in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
	   France is Lebanon's former colonial ruler and Paris has long supported
Beirut in its endeavors to get Israeli forces to withdraw from an occupied
border zone in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   Lebanese leaders also expressed dismay and summoned the French ambassador to
complain.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel has pledged to pull out by July, but violence in the south --
apparently exacerbated by last month's breakdown in peace talks with Syria --
has flared in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Hezbollah has killed seven Israeli troops, and Israeli airstrikes have
crippled Lebanese infrastructure targets and injured 20 civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheik Naim Kassem, Hezbollah's deputy chief, called on Chirac and the French
people to ``punish this premier for his mistake,'' according to comments carried
Sunday by Hezbollah's al-Noor radio station.
</P>
<P>
	   Kassem said Jospin was not welcome in Lebanon, where a 3,000-person protest
in the port city of Sidon, planned to mark the anniversary of the killing of a
local leader, turned into an anti-Jospin demonstration.
</P>
<P>
	   About 40 Palestinian students gathered outside Palestinian Authority
headquarters in Ramallah on Sunday to protest the arrest of 20 students in the
rioting a day earlier. ``Jospin said Arab blood was worthless, did you expect a
bed of roses?'' one banner read.
</P>
<P>
	   Most Palestinians condemned the rioters -- who reached Jospin's Mercedes
limousine and smashed its windshield before his entourage got away -- but said
Jospin was out of line. Some suggested he was grandstanding, with his eye on
French presidential elections in 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Hopes of reaching the Elysee Palace may be the reason for such statements,
but such statements are not in line with the French tradition,'' editorialized
the Palestinian daily, ``Al Quds.''
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, that was the Israeli take on Jospin's surprising statement -- the
Socialist premier was seeking to stake out an independent foreign policy, a must
for any potential presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The term `terrorism' ... and the violent response yesterday in Bir Zeit,
will undoubtedly be noted in the next presidential elections in France,'' the
mass circulation Yediot Ahronot wrote. It was especially important, Yediot
wrote, for Jospin to distinguish himself from the pro-Arab positions of Chirac,
who will likely run for a second term in 2002.

<HEADLINE> Pius' Legacy Mars Papal-Israel Visit  </HEADLINE>
   By DINA KRAFT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Considered a hero by the Roman Catholic church, excoriated
as a villain by many Jews, Pope Pius XII has left a legacy that is haunting next
month's papal pilgrimage to the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
	   The Vatican's top diplomat in the Holy Land says the wartime pontiff kept
silent about the Nazi genocide precisely because he wanted to save Jewish lives
-- a defense ridiculed Sunday by Holocaust historians and used as ammunition by
ultra-nationalists in Israel calling for a boycott of Pope John Paul II's visit.
</P>
<P>
	   Archbishop Pietro Sambi's nationally broadcast comments and the bitter
reaction they have drawn could overshadow hopes for reconciliation during the
landmark pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
	   Yisrael Gutman, the chief historian at Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust
memorial, said Pius' failure to condemn the Nazis was reprehensible.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Silence could of course not help,'' Gutman said. ``It could only be
interpreted as a lack of interest or as a lack of will to interfere in the Nazi
policy ... and murder.''
</P>
<P>
	   Proceedings to beatify Pius, the penultimate step before sainthood, have
further strained Jewish-Catholic relations, historically tense over persecution
and massacres of Jews by Catholics during the Inquisition and the Crusades and
accusations of Vatican-sponsored anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
	   Some ultra-nationalist Jews and some ultra-Orthodox Jews have criticized
Israel's chief rabbis for planning a meeting with the pope, saying the March
20-26 visit might spur Christian missionary activity.
</P>
<P>
	   Slogans like ``Don't meet the pope'' and ``No to blasphemy, No to meeting
the pope'' were found Sunday spray-painted on the exterior walls of the building
that houses Israel's chief rabbinate.
</P>
<P>
	   The rabbis condemned the graffiti, calling John Paul II a ``friend.''
</P>
<P>
	   There are hopes that the pontiff's historic trip here -- the first for a
pope since 1964 -- will be a watershed in Catholic-Jewish relations, capping
years of reconciliation work between the faiths.
</P>
<P>
	   John Paul II has been widely praised for his overtures to Israel that
culminated in a 1994 treaty establishing diplomatic relations between the
Vatican and the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Sambi's comments Saturday to Israel TV defending Pius XII's wartime
record reopened a painful debate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am convinced that a great strong condemnation would have increased the
persecution of Hitler against the Jews,'' Sambi said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmaker Tommy Lapid, himself a Holocaust survivor, called Sambi's
justifications of Pius' silence ``a feeble excuse, so immoral, so evasive.''
</P>
<P>
	   The historian, Gutman, also a Holocaust survivor, acknowledged that at the
very final stages of the war, Pius did attempt to save some Hungarian Jews from
the death camps and helped shelter others inside the Vatican. He said, however,
that throughout the war, Catholic institutions and individuals who put
themselves at risk to save Jewish lives did so at their own initiative, without
Vatican encouragement or backing.
</P>
<P>
	   Holocaust scholar Yehuda Bauer, in a review published in the daily Jerusalem
Post of a recent biography of Pius XII, said the pontiff's silence was a moral
failing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Had Pius XII spoken out, he might not have saved a single Jew, but he
possibly might have saved his soul,'' Bauer wrote.

<HEADLINE> Matthew Shepard Show Opens in Colo.  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL KUCHWARA AP Drama Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- An emotional audience greeted the world premiere Saturday of
``The Laramie Project,'' a unique collaboration between a New York-based theater
troupe and the people of Laramie, Wyo., about the murder of Matthew Shepard.
</P>
<P>
	   They cried and then cheered at the end of the three-act, nearly three-hour
performance attended by nearly 50 townspeople and members of the media.
</P>
<P>
	   The play about the death of the gay University of Wyoming college student
was the brainchild of Moises Kaufman, founder of the Tectonic Theater Project,
whose members collaborated on the drama now on view at the Denver Center Theater
through April 1.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To actively step back and sit and watch everything unravel is surreal,''
said Matt Galloway, bartender at the Fireside Lounge, where Shepard met the men
who killed him. ``I had so much anticipation. It is interesting to undo the
wound that you think is healed, but it hasn't.''
</P>
<P>
	   The production was a monumental effort involving 18 months of preparation,
including six trips by members of the company to Laramie for interviews with
scores of residents and friends of the 21-year-old Shepard. Their thoughts and
opinions were pieced together by the troupe, working under the guidance of
Kaufman and Leigh Fondakowski, a company member who put together the script.
</P>
<P>
	   Shepard's death in October 1998 received national attention. He was beaten,
hung on a fence in a lonely prairie field and left to die. Two young men, Aaron
McKinney and Russell Henderson, are serving life sentences for the murder.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaufman has called the murder ``a watershed event,'' one that captured what
this nation is and where it is going as a society.
</P>
<P>
	   In that respect, it echoes, Kaufman says, his best-known work, ``Gross
Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde,'' which had a long New York run, as
well as a successful engagement at the Denver Center Theater last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The play, which chronicled Wilde's downfall, was based, in part, on trial
transcripts, trials that eventually send the homosexual Wilde to prison for
``gross indecency.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The thing that shocked me about the trials of Oscar Wilde was that in
reading the transcripts, you did not only see the story of this man's downfall
but you saw exactly where Victorian society was at in terms of class, gender,
sexuality, the monarchy, imperialism, capitalism,'' Kaufman has said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``And I think that in the same way, Matthew Shepard's beating, cruel
victimization and murder, did a similar thing.''

<HEADLINE> 'Whole Nine Yards' Tops Box Office  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The hit man comedy "The Whole Nine Yards" held the top
box office spot for a second weekend with $9.6 million in ticket sales,
according to industry estimates Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The teen comedy "Snow Day" also held strong at No. 2 with $8.5 million in
its third weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   The only new movie to debut in the top five was "Reindeer Games," a
casino-heist caper starring Ben Affleck, Gary Sinise and Charlize Theron and
directed by John Frankenheimer. It overcame generally poor reviews to open in
third place with $8 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The comic drama "Hanging Up," which last weekend ran a close second to "The
Whole Nine Yards," fell to No. 4 with $7.5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The sci-fi thriller "Pitch Black" rounded out the top five with $7.1 million
in its second weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Whole Nine Yards" benefited from the box-office draw of Bruce Willis
and Matthew Perry of TV's "Friends," said Dan Fellman, head of distribution for
Warner Bros., which released the movie. Perry stars as a dentist marked for
death after a mob hit man, played by Willis, moves in next door.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is another case, like 'The Sixth Sense,' of Bruce Willis involved in a
film you didn't know would be this No. 1 hit," said Paul Dergarabedian,
president of Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., which tracks the box office.
"Anything he's in right now seems to be gold."
</P>
<P>
	   The movie also has gotten a boost from the Oscar buzz about co-star Michael
Clarke Duncan, who plays a mob buddy of Willis, Fellman said. He was nominated
for best-supporting actor for "The Green Mile."
</P>
<P>
	   Another new movie, "Wonder Boys" starring Michael Douglas, debuted in
seventh place with $5.9 million, but it played in narrower release than the
other top films and scored the best per-theater average, $4,669 per theater
compared to $3,299 for "Whole Nine Yards."
</P>
<P>
	   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North American theaters,
according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures were to be released
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   1. "The Whole Nine Yards," $9.6 million.
</P>
<P>
	   2. "Snow Day," $8.5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   3. "Reindeer Games," $8 million.
</P>
<P>
	   4. "Hanging Up," $7.5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   5. "Pitch Black," $7.1 million.
</P>
<P>
	   6. "The Tigger Movie," $6.3 million.
</P>
<P>
	   7. "Wonder Boys," $5.9 million.
</P>
<P>
	   8. "Scream 3," $5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   9. "American Beauty," $4.7 million.
</P>
<P>
	   10. "The Cider House Rules," $4.1 million.

<HEADLINE> Russian Reporter Put Under Arrest  </HEADLINE>
   By NABI ABDULAYEV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- A Russian reporter whose disappearance in
Chechnya prompted international concern was put under formal arrest Sunday, two
days after surfacing in the Russian republic of Dagestan, his lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Andrei Babitsky, a reporter for the U.S.-financed Radio Liberty, vanished in
January while in Chechnya, where his reporting from the rebels' side had angered
Russian officials. Russia later said he had been detained by federal forces and
then turned over to rebels in exchange for two captured Russian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of Babitsky's colleagues questioned a videotape showing the alleged
swap and feared he was dead. International officials had pressed Russia to clear
up the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Babitsky reappeared Friday in the custody of officials in Makhachkala, the
capital of Dagestan, which borders Chechnya to the east. How he got there is not
clear, but officials said he was carrying a forged Azerbaijani passport when
detained.
</P>
<P>
	   Babitsky was interrogated for several hours Sunday at Dagestan's Interior
Ministry. His lawyer, Alexander Zozulya, told reporters outside the ministry
that officials said that he had been put under arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   Babitsky's wife Lyudmila, who was able to talk with her husband by phone
briefly on Friday, said she was refused permission to visit him Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   In another interrogation on Saturday, parts of which were shown on state-run
RTR television, Babitsky said he used the fake passport because ``I had no other
documents and I was afraid to reveal my location.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the tape, Babitsky said that a Russian official came to see him at a
Russian detention camp in the Chechen town of Chernokozovo on Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He said that Chechen field commander Turpal Atgeriyev ... was ready to
exchange me for Russian servicemen,'' Babitsky, smoking heavily, told his
interrogator. ``I thought for 10 minutes, then agreed, since I knew Atgeriyev.''
</P>
<P>
	   The official promised that Atgeriyev would then release him, Babitsky said.
The tape was then cut off.
</P>
<P>
	   Radio Liberty correspondent Oleg Kusov said Saturday that when the exchange
took place Feb. 3, Babitsky realized he was being handed not to Atgeriyev but to
masked Chechens whom he did not know. He tried to protest but it was too late,
Kusov said.
</P>
<P>
	   Babitsky's detention added to international concern about alleged human
rights violations in Chechnya and called into doubt the government's adherence
to media freedom. Refugees from Chechnya have told human-rights groups that
detainees at the Chernokozovo camp, where Babitsky says he was held, are being
tortured.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Report Says No Saudi Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's biggest oil producer failed to reach an agreement with
Saudi Arabia to renew an oil concession set to expire early Monday, Japan's
trade minister said Sunday, according to news reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan's International Trade and Industry Minister Takashi Fukaya said
last-ditch talks held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia over the weekend between the
president of Tokyo-based Arabian Oil Co. and Saudi officials ended without a
breakthrough, Kyodo News agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know if the talks are suspended or have broken down for good, but
they're over," he told reporters after being briefed by Arabian Oil President
Keiichi Konaga, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nobody could be reached at the trade ministry for comment, and Arabian Oil
spokesman Koichi Sekikawa declined to address the report.
</P>
<P>
	   Arabian Oil's 42-year-old concession in the eastern part of Saudia Arabia,
the only remaining one held by a foreign company, was set to expire early
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiations to extend the drilling rights were bogged down by Saudi
Arabia's demand that Japan build and pay for a new railway line as a condition
for renewal.
</P>
<P>
	   The Japanese government most recently offered to pay between $600 million
and $700 million of the $2 billion railway project, according to Kyodo, citing
sources close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Arabian Oil pumps an average of 300,000 barrels of oil a day from the Kafji
oil field. Though the company has drilling rights in Kuwait, the loss is
expected to halve its sales.

<HEADLINE> Floods Strand Hundreds in Mozambique  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE COHEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAVE RIVER VALLEY, Mozambique (AP) -- Helicopters plucked more than 1,500
people to safety Sunday as swollen rivers swept away almost everything in their
paths in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
	   Many more people gripped to whatever high ground they could find as waters
continued to rise in the Save and Limpopo rivers. They have been stranded for a
week and desperately need food.
</P>
<P>
	   Groups of people huddled on tiny patches of land stretched out their arms to
plead for help from one of only two rescue helicopters in the Save area. A lone
man on the roof of a straw hut pointed his fingers to his mouth and rubbed his
stomach.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials refused to speculate how many people already have been swept away
in the vast area along the banks of the Save (pronounced sah-VEY) in central
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's massive destruction along the Save River. It's taking everything
in its path. Homes, villages. There are people stranded in trees and on homes. A
lot of people are getting killed,'' said David Schaad, a World Food Program
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   UNICEF's Ian Macleod estimated between 5,000 and 10,000 people were stranded
in the area. About 3,000 more were marooned in southern Mozambique after the
Limpopo River burst its banks.
</P>
<P>
	   The known death toll in Mozambique and neighbors South Africa and Zimbabwe
reached 200 from flooding in the last week. Police said Sunday that at least 33
people died and 20 were missing after a bus was swept off a flooded bridge two
days earlier in northeastern Zimbabwe. Twenty passengers had survived.
</P>
<P>
	   Torrential rains began drenching southern Africa three weeks ago, and then
Cyclone Eline roared through last week. As the remnants of the cyclone raced
back to the Indian Ocean, a new storm system was developing off the coast of
Mozambique and expected to hit Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Save valley, South African helicopters hoisted people aboard and
dropped them a short distance away on slightly bigger raised patches of earth.
With the nearest refueling point 125 miles away, rescues were going painfully
slowly.
</P>
<P>
	   Journalists who flew 10 miles up the river mouth saw up to 1,000 marooned
people.
</P>
<P>
	   One helicopter hoisted a woman and her baby aboard from the remains of a
hut. Pigs, goats and cattle waded through the muddy water.
</P>
<P>
	   Rescue pilot Chippy Pretorius said he had rescued 320 people, and had seen
one human body and many dead animals in the water.
</P>
<P>
	   Farther south, the five South African helicopters in the Limpopo area saved
1,200 people before stopping for the evening, said Maj. Louis Kirsten of the
South African force. The helicopters would return Monday, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The South African and Mozambican governments were wrangling Sunday about who
would pay for advanced plans to send five more helicopters and two planes, said
Lt. Col. Jaco Klopper, commander of the South African rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   Pilots were focusing on saving the children first and often had to push away
desperate people trying to get on the fully loaded helicopters, said Michele
Quintaglie of the World Food Program.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a very dangerous situation right now because people are panicking,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Floodwaters of the Limpopo submerged the town of Chokwe in just a few hours,
Quintaglie said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These people went to bed last night with no sign of water. At 5 a.m., they
woke up by hysterical screams telling them to get out,'' she said. ``By early
morning, the city was engulfed by water. By lunch, it was completely
submerged.''

<HEADLINE> Will Farrakhan Unite Muslims?  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTHA IRVINE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan was to give his
annual Saviour's Day speech before thousands on Sunday in a closely watched
event that could make or break his fledgling vow to reconcile with orthodox
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
	   Rival W. Deen Mohammed, an orthodox Muslim leader and son of late Nation of
Islam head Elijah Muhammad, also planned to attend.
</P>
<P>
	   W. Deen Mohammed has already made clear what millions of orthodox Muslims
nationwide expect: ``a different Farrakhan.''
</P>
<P>
	   Farrakhan joined with W. Deen Mohammed at traditional prayers on Friday --
the 25th anniversary of the death of Elijah Muhammad, whose legacy Farrakhan and
W. Deen Mohammed have struggled over.
</P>
<P>
	   Elijah led the Nation of Islam for decades, but after his death in 1975, his
son led the movement toward orthodoxy. In 1978, Farrakhan broke away to revive
Elijah's teachings under the old Nation of Islam name.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Nation's theology, Elijah's teacher in the 1930s, W. D. Fard of
Detroit, was given divine status and Elijah was the final prophet to mankind.
Orthodox Muslims believe the final prophet was Mohammed of Mecca, who founded
Islam in the seventh century.
</P>
<P>
	   At the prayer service Friday, Farrakhan and W. Deen Mohammed both vowed to
bury their differences and work together to unite U.S. Muslims.
</P>
<P>
	   Nation of Islam leaders, including Farrakhan's chief of staff, Leonard
Muhammad, have insisted that the move toward unification is not new.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past few years, Farrakhan has instituted the traditional Friday
prayers, observed by millions of orthodox Muslims worldwide, and the Nation of
Islam also now observes Ramadan, a period of fasting.
</P>
<P>
	   Perhaps most important to orthodox Muslims, Leonard Muhammad says that all
Nation of Islam followers now adhere to the Muslim creed: ``There is no God but
Allah and Mohammed is his messenger.''
</P>
<P>
	   That suggests Elijah wouldn't be regarded as the final prophet by Nation of
Islam members. Farrakhan could elaborate on this in Sunday's speech. More than
20,000 people were expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawrence Mamiya, a Vassar College expert on black American religions,
conservatively estimates the core membership of the Nation of Islam to be 50,000
to 100,000. He said W. Deen Mohammed's group, the Muslim American Society, has
about 200,000 core members. The overall following is thought to be much higher
for both.
</P>
<P>
	   W. Deen Mohammed, who planned to give short remarks at Sunday's gathering,
said he would carefully monitor Farrakhan's words -- in part listening to make
sure he avoids anti-white and anti-Semitic comments.
</P>
<P>
	   One Nation of Islam observer said he believes the 66-year-old Farrakhan will
continue with the calls for racial and religious unity he has made since his
``near death experience'' last year while being treated for prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's thinking about his legacy, and I don't think he wants to leave with
the idea that he was a hate monger,'' said Salim Muwakkil, a former Nation of
Islam member who is now editor of the Chicago-based political journal In These
Times.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The illness provided him with a very good excuse to be more forthright in
his alterations of the doctrine,'' Muwakkil said. ``Before, he had to do it
incrementally, as if he were taking baby steps.''
</P>
<P>
	   Also scheduled to speak Sunday was Rabbi David Weiss, a leader of the
Neturei Karta International orthodox Jewish community. Farrakhan met with
leaders of the group last fall in a move that he said was proof of his wish to
reconcile not only with Muslims but also with Jews.
</P>
<P>
	   But Jewish leaders, still seething over Farrakhan's past comments --
including calling Judaism a ``gutter religion'' -- remained cautious.
</P>
<P>
	   Chicago Rabbi Ira Youdovin said the Neturei Karta was an ``extreme, extreme
ultra orthodox wing of the Jewish community'' that opposes the current existence
of the state of Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the maximum that can be hoped for from Farrakhan is some sort of a
truce,'' said Youdovin, executive vice president of the Chicago Board of Rabbis,
a group that represents 220 rabbis throughout the Chicago area.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's no possibility of him accumulating the credibility given the
things he's said,'' Youdovin added. ``You can't just wipe the slate clean.''

<HEADLINE> Blair Wants To End Child Poverty  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Prime Minister Tony Blair marked the 100th anniversary of the
Labor Party Sunday by committing it to abolishing child poverty, achieving full
unemployment and making Britain's health service the world's best, and to assure
excellence in education for all.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can only exist as crusaders, people who see a problem and want to solve
it, see injustice and want to put it right,'' Blair told a party gathering. ``It
was our reforms that civilized the 20th century. We were the civilizing force.
Even when not in power we forced on to the agenda our ideals of decency and
justice.''
</P>
<P>
	   None of the goals was new, but the emphasis was widely seen as being aimed
at Labor's traditional supporters, at a moment when the London mayor's race has
plunged the party into a repetition of old divisions between socialists and
Blairite modernizers.
</P>
<P>
	   Blair's leadership prevailed in selecting the mayoral candidate by creating
an electoral college which chose former Health Secretary Frank Dobson despite
the greater popular support for maverick lawmaker Ken Livingstone.
</P>
<P>
	   Blair, who led the party to a spectacular election victory in 1997 after 18
years in opposition, warned against the dangers of splits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When we have won, our party organization has been rooted in our
communities, and united. When we have lost, we have been divided and out of
touch,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sunday marked the 100th anniversary of the formation of the Labor
Representation Committee to represent trade unions and socialist societies in
Parliament. Lawmakers within that group decided to call themselves the Labor
Party in 1906.
</P>
<P>
	   Including Blair, only five Labor leaders have been prime minister: Ramsay
MacDonald in 1924 and 1929-31, Clement Atlee 1945-1951, Harold Wilson 1964-1970
and 1974-76, James Callaghan 1976-79.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pastor: Racial Split Evident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton listened Sunday as his pastor said the
story of Amadou Diallo's death in New York shows that America remains racially
split.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo, a West African immigrant street vendor, was gunned down as he faced
white police officers in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building. He was
unarmed, but the officers said they thought he was pulling a weapon. On Friday,
an Albany, N.Y., jury found all four of the officers innocent.
</P>
<P>
	   In his sermon, J. Phillip Wogaman said no one should second-guess the Diallo
jury, but he said the racially charged case and its aftermath proved there
remains ``a serious racial divide in America.''
</P>
<P>
	   Wogaman is pastor of Foundry United Methodist Church, where Clinton attends
frequently.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has not commented on the Diallo verdict, although the case has been
an issue for his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, as she campaigns for a Senate
seat in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton apologized and said she misspoke when she referred to Diallo's
killing this month as a ``murder.'' The officers were charged with second-degree
murder, and the jury was asked to decide whether prosecutors proved the killing
was a crime.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton did not attend the service with her husband Sunday, although
the couple met for lunch afterward at a favorite Indian restaurant near the
White House.

<HEADLINE> Norway Makes No Oil Promise to U.S.  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUG MELLGREN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Norway made no promise to increase oil production when
U.S. Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson made his second visit to the Nordic
country to express concern about high energy prices on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Norway is the world's second-largest oil exporter. Although the nation of
4.5 million is not a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, it has joined the group's efforts to reduce supplies, causing world
prices to nearly triple.
</P>
<P>
	   "A little over a year ago, the price of oil was about $10 per barrel. Today
it is hovering around $30 a barrel," Richardson said. "This volatility, whether
from low to high, or high to low, hurts both consuming and producing nations and
could hurt the world economy."
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson has been meeting with oil-producing countries in hopes that they
will ease production restraints to bring down prices. On Sunday, he met
Norwegian Oil Minister Marit Arnstad in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
	   Norway produces about 3.2 million barrels per day, about 200,000 barrels
under projected capacity as part of OPEC's marketing effort.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have not taken any decision," said Arnstad about increasing oil flows.
"We will not take any decision until the end of March."
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson said he came to Norway to report on his talks with other oil
ministers and to present new figures on oil production and consumption.
</P>
<P>
	   "Let me be clear. I did not come to Norway to negotiate the price of oil,"
Richardson said at a joint news conference with Arnstad. He repeated the U.S.
view that market forces should determine oil prices, but said prices were now
too high.
</P>
<P>
	   In a joint statement, both expressed concern about global oil inventories
approaching 23-year lows. Arnstad said that has to be taken into consideration
by oil-exporting countries.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is a concern of Norway to create a long-term stability," she said. "I
feel both prices too low, as we saw 15 months ago, and prices too high are a
threat to stability."
</P>
<P>
	   Norway, an ally of the United States through NATO, is so dependent on oil
revenues that its need for high prices conflicts with the United State's need
for affordable oil as a major importer.
</P>
<P>
	   OPEC members are meeting in Austria next on March 27 to discuss future
production levels.

<HEADLINE> Text of Bush Letter to NY Cardinal  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Text of Gov. George W. Bush's letter to Cardinal John O'Connor:
</P>
<P>
	   Feb. 25, 2000
</P>
<P>
	   To His Eminence John Cardinal O'Connor:
</P>
<P>
	   Your Eminence:
</P>
<P>
	   A few weeks ago I visited Bob Jones University in South Carolina to address
its students and outline the reasons I am seeking the presidency. Some have
taken -- and mistaken -- this visit as a sign that I approve of the
anti-Catholic and racially divisive views associated with that school. As you
know from a long friendship with my family -- and our own meeting last year --
this criticism is unfair and unfounded. Such opinions are personally offensive
to me, and I want to erase any doubts about my views and values.
</P>
<P>
	   As a public official, I take seriously my duty to encourage tolerance and
respect for the religious views of others. As a Christian, I see Catholics as my
brothers and sisters in Christ -- sharing the same ancient creed and core
beliefs. And, as you know, my own brother and sister-in-law are both Catholics.
</P>
<P>
	   Criticism should be expected in any political campaign. What no American
should expect -- and what I will not tolerate -- is guilt by association. I
reject racial segregation -- in our laws, in our hearts and our lives. And I
reject religious intolerance -- because faith is defined by grace and hope, not
fear and division.
</P>
<P>
	   In my speech to the students, I emphasized that I am a uniter not a divider
and that Americans can work together for the good of all. On reflection, I
should have been more clear in disassociating myself from anti-Catholic
sentiments and racial prejudice. It was a missed opportunity, causing needless
offense, which I deeply regret.
</P>
<P>
	   I have profound respect for the Catholic church -- a sympathy beyond mere
tolerance. I have argued that our prosperous society must offer answers for the
poor -- and, on this issue, the Catholic Church helps shape our country's
conscience. I have proposed a broader role for churches and charities in
providing social services -- and the Catholic Church has always led our nation
in acts of justice and charity. In this campaign I am offering an approach that
is morally grounded and socially inclusive. I hope and intend that anyone
closely examining my agenda will see reflections of a much greater tradition --
a tradition of social justice defended and represented by the Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
	   This is why I am offended by any suggestion that I tolerate anti-Catholic
bigotry -- and resent any attempt to create that impression.
</P>
<P>
	   I hope that you, and all Catholics, will accept this assurance of my good
faith.
</P>
<P>
	   Respectfully,
</P>
<P>
	   George W. Bush.

<HEADLINE> In pulpits and streets, appeals for justice and change  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - New demands for social justice, law enforcement reforms
and a federal inquiry echoed from pulpits and city streets on Sunday in the
aftermath of the acquittal of four police officers in the shooting death of
Amadou Diallo.
<P>
	   About 500 people joined a peaceful prayer vigil outside the United Nations,
where activist Rev. Al Sharpton hoped to bring the Diallo case to international
attention.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting victim "could have been one of these ambassadors," said
Sharpton, who also said he would call for a "boycott" of the city.
</P>
<P>
	   "We will choose the target. We are afraid to spend money with certain people
because we are suspects," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton added that he was "calling for another jury to hear evidence" on
the policies of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. "Come November, the jury is going to
render its decision," he said, referring to Giuliani's probable run for the U.S.
Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo's father, Saikou Diallo, Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., and former
Mayor David Dinkins also spoke at the rally, where a few people wore signs
reading "Go ahead and shoot. I'm black so it must be justified."
</P>
<P>
	   In what was billed as a day of prayer, political leaders and activists
joined Sharpton in criticizing the verdict as inappropriate for a case in which
police fired 41 bullets and hit the African immigrant 19 times, only to discover
afterward that he was unarmed.
</P>
<P>
	   The four officers, acquitted of second-degree murder and lesser charges by a
jury in Albany on Friday, still face a departmental inquiry and possibly federal
charges if Attorney General Janet Reno finds evidence that Diallo's civil rights
were violated.
</P>
<P>
	   At St. Patrick's Cathedral, Auxiliary Bishop James McCarthy, filling in for
an ailing Cardinal John O'Connor, told parishioners Diallo's death should cause
people to "re-examine our own tendencies toward violence, toward fear, and
perhaps toward prejudice - racial prejudice at that."
</P>
<P>
	   Rev. Calvin Butts, pastor of Harlem's Abyssinian Baptist Church, urged his
followers to vote against Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not blaming Giuliani for pulling the trigger but for creating a climate
that's divisive," Butts said in a telephone interview. "And I'm not calling for
calm. I think black people ought to be agitated, they ought to be active."
</P>
<P>
	   City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, speaking at Harlem's Bethel AME church,
said that to make sure Diallo's death was not in vain, the police department
needed to continue to make "fundamental, meaningful change, so that people
aren't afraid that the police are going to shoot them."
</P>
<P>
	   Vallone, a Democrat, said the city council had budgeted funds for the
department for that purpose, and "even the mayor is recognizing that changes
have to be made."
</P>
<P>
	   Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union,
told 200 parishioners at a Congregational church in Queens that the Diallo case
was giving new impetus to his group's proposals for police misconduct reform.
</P>
<P>
	   Key provisions of the plan would make federal and state funding for local
police contingent on the police meeting strict performance standards in
community relations and would name a permanent special prosecutor to handle
police brutality incidents.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to seeking a criminal investigation to determine whether
Diallo's civil rights were violated, he said the NYCLU intends to sue the city
on grounds that poor training and racial stereotyping led to the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Sunday, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, seeking the Democratic
nomination for a U.S. Senate seat representing New York, urged New Yorkers not
to let the verdict divide them. She said the case underscores the need for a
police force reflective of the city's ethnic diversity and for "community
policing."
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever the result of a Justice Department inquiry, "we must reach across
those lines of mistrust and division and join to ensure that no tragedy like
this ever happens again to anyone's son or daughter," she told several hundred
people at a national conference of Dominican-Americans at City College.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton did not mention her Republican opponent, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who
has been a main target of protesters in the Diallo affair.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani's campaign spokesman, Bruce Teitelbaum, later criticized Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   "Mrs. Clinton obviously is unaware that New York City recently spent over
$10 million on a new recruiting program designed to create a more diverse police
department (and)... the new police class will be the most diverse ever,"
Teitelbaum said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Takes Delegates From Islands  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush picked up a dozen delegates to the
Republican national convention in presidential primary contests this weekend in
the U.S. territories, whose residents won't be able to vote for him come
November if he wins the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   The delegates were chosen Saturday at caucuses in Guam, American Samoa and
the Virgin Islands, each of which had four delegates at stake. Puerto Rico held
its primary Sunday, with all of the island's 14 delegates going to the winner.
</P>
<P>
	   The victories increased Bush's delegate total to 79, and narrowed the gap
between him and rival Sen. John McCain. The Arizona senator had 96 delegates
going into the weekend races; a candidate needs 1,034 delegates to win the
Republican nomination for president.
</P>
<P>
	   While Bush picked up additional delegates, he cannot count on getting votes
from the islands' residents if he wins the nomination. Residents of U.S.
territories cannot vote in the general election, but are allowed to participate
in presidential primaries and caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the contests gave island Republicans a chance to be heard on the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
	   During Saturday's contests, there was a motion to split Guam's four
delegates between Bush and McCain, but a binding motion to support only Bush
prevailed, said Fred Castro, the national committeeman-elect.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Virgin Islands, Republicans met on the Carribean islands of St.
Thomas, St. Croix and St. John, said the territory's GOP committeeman, Holland
Redfield II, who refused to give a breakdown of how participants voted during
the closed assemblies.

<HEADLINE> German Christian Democrats Lose Vote  </HEADLINE>
   By TONY CZUCZKA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- German voters rebuked the scandal-ridden Christian Democrats
in a state election Sunday, leaving the conservative party's search for a new
leader wide open in the process.
</P>
<P>
	   Voters in Schleswig-Holstein, a rural state bordering Denmark, chose a new
legislature in the first electoral test since the scandal blew up around former
Chancellor Helmut Kohl late last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Support for the Christian Democrats fell to about 35 percent from 37 percent
four years ago, according to unofficial results released by German television.
The Social Democrats won 43 percent, up from 40 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   The Christian Democrats loss in the legislature, which elects the state
governor, meant that Volker Ruehe, Kohl's former defense minister, would not
unseat two-term governor Heide Simonis. But his showing was better than polls
had predicted, giving the Christian Democrats a much-needed boost.
</P>
<P>
	   The Christian Democrats' general secretary, Angela Merkel, said the results
showed the party was bouncing back.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The CDU is out of the bottom of the valley,'' she told a news conference
in Berlin. ``It's back in step and will naturally continue to fight.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ruehe's lead in the race disappeared as the scandal unraveled in December
with Kohl's admission that he had accepted illegal cash contributions in the
1990s. The admission has led to investigations into whether government decisions
were bought.
</P>
<P>
	   Ruehe insisted his chances to become party chairman were still alive, noting
that his showing was considerably better than the party's national poll levels
of 29 percent. The party will choose a new chairman in April.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We lost because of this scandal,'' Ruehe said. ``But I'm proud that we've
been able to stabilize our voters for the federal party.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ruehe's main rival for the party leadership post is Merkel. However, the
party's right wing distrusts her liberal views and roots in former communist
East Germany. Ruehe is considered a middle-of-the-road pragmatist despite his
combative manner that has won him the nickname ``Rambo.''
</P>
<P>
	   Current leader Wolfgang Schaeuble, who faced an internal rebellion over his
handling of the scandal, announced Feb. 16 he would not seek re-election in
order to allow his party a ``new beginning.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ruehe has avoided taint in the scandal despite serving in senior positions
in 1989-98 -- a time in which Kohl allegedly hid millions in undeclared, and
therefore illegal, campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl's refusal to name the donors has fed speculation that government
decisions were bought during his 16 years in power, something Kohl has
repeatedly denied. Heightening the suspicions are charges by the Social
Democrats that chancellery files on business deals during the Kohl era have
gaps.
</P>
<P>
	   The state ballot was the first electoral success for Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder's Social Democrats after a string of losses in state votes last year
that had raised questions about the federal governing party's future.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 2.1 million people were eligible to participate in Sunday's election
for state legislators, who elect the governor. Turnout was about 70 percent --
about the same as in 1996, despite some predictions that the scandal would turn
voters off.

<HEADLINE> Labor Formalizes Home Worker Rules  </HEADLINE>
   By ALICE ANN LOVE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Labor Department has issued a promised policy
statement that says it will not hold companies responsible for the safety of
telecommuting employees' home offices.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Family-friendly, flexible and fair work arrangements, including
telecommuting, can benefit individual employees and their families, employers,
and society as a whole,'' said the written directive, sent to regional offices
Friday by the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   The directive says the government:
</P>
<P>
	   --Will not inspect employees' home offices, expect employers to inspect them
or hold companies liable for the offices' safety conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   --May pass complaints received from workers about home office safety on to
employers but will do no follow-up.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the new rules, companies can be held responsible for safety problems
with at-home jobs other than office work. That could include things such as
manufacturing piecework involving ``materials, equipment or work processes which
the employer provides or requires to be used in an employee's home.''
</P>
<P>
	   However, even those risky at-home work sites will be inspected only if the
government receives complaints.

<HEADLINE> Indian Co. Buys Tetley Tea Maker  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- The Tetley Group, maker of the second-biggest brand of
teabags in the world, announced Sunday that it has been bought by the Indian
company Tata Tea Ltd. for $433.6 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Tata Tea, part of the Tata Group, is the largest integrated tea company in
the world, with additional interests in coffee and spices. The two companies
were already working together through a joint venture, Tata Tetley, which
manufactures tea bags in India.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal is set to be completed in March.
</P>
<P>
	   "This will result in a new agenda for aggressive growth and expansion
worldwide, including new territories and product categories for both Tata Tea
Ltd. and the Tetley Group," the two companies said in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Tata Group has expressed total confidence in the Tetley management
team, which will be retained," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tetley Group was created in 1995 by a management buy-in from the
previous owners, Allied Domecq PLC.
</P>
<P>
	   Following a failed attempt to float Tetley as a separate company in 1998,
Tetley was approached by Tata and by Sara Lee Corp. about acquiring the tea
brand.
</P>
<P>
	   Tata, India's biggest plantation group, said it was keen to acquire an
international brand as a key to expanding its markets internationally and to
compete with the market leader, Unilever.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we want to remain in the tea business we have to compete with Unilever,"
S.M. Kidwai, managing director of Tata Tea, said in an interview with the
Financial Times in July.
</P>
<P>
	   "Lipton Tea is everywhere. The combined entity of Tata Tea and Tetley has a
better chance to compete with them than Tata Tea alone."

	   Highlights of Amtrak's new plan for future:
</P>
<P>
	   --The New York-to-New Orleans Crescent will split in Meridian, Miss., with
one segment going to New Orleans and the other to Fort Worth, Texas. New service
will be provided to Vicksburg, Miss., and to Monroe and Shreveport, La.

</P>
<P>
	   Two Ohio newspapers on Sunday endorsed Sen. John McCain of Arizona for the
Republican presidential nomination over his key rival, Texas Gov. George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspapers, the Dayton Daily News and the Akron Beacon Journal, split
over the two Democratic contenders, Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey. The primary elections for both parties will be March 7 in
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Though Gov. Bush is a decent, capable and unthreatening fellow, his
defenders are stretching when they say he would be a better president than Sen.
McCain,'' the Daily News said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The senator is more knowledgeable and experienced, he has a proven
willingness to lead and he's every bit as electable as Gov. Bush, maybe more
so.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``George W. Bush grasps the imperative, the need to govern for the whole,''
the Beacon Journal said. ``What McCain offers is a far clearer and confident
statement of the mission. Is he hot-headed? You would be, too, if your party had
booted so many opportunities. John McCain promises Republicans the leadership
they have missed.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the Democratic race, the Daily News endorsed Gore and the Beacon Journal
endorsed Bradley, calling him the strongest of the four leading candidates in
many ways.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You don't reach the heights of the academic world (Princeton and Oxford),
the NBA and national politics without drive,'' the newspaper said. ``Bradley
tempers his ambition with perspective. He has thought hard about where he would
like to lead the country.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Having been a very active vice president during an administration that has
set the country on a good course is an impressive qualification for the
presidency,'' the Daily News said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Vice President Al Gore has been through all the great political battles.
He knows the players and the issues. He knows how to make the White House
work.''

<HEADLINE> Amtrak To Expand Into Delivery  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ARNOLD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amtrak, hoping to spur a rail renaissance that will
solidify its shaky future, this week unveils a plan to add new passenger routes,
expand into package delivery and maintain unprofitable routes.
</P>
<P>
	   Two years in the making, the blueprint would expand or improve service in 21
states, add 11 route segments and increase train frequency on three routes. It
also would boost by 10 percent the number of station-to-station links and bring
trains to the neighborhoods of 4 million potential new passengers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is an effort to define, for the first time in our history, a national
system that is underpinned by solid economic prospects,'' Amtrak President
George Warrington said.
</P>
<P>
	   The railway expects that the changes, when fully implemented, will generate
$229 million in new annual revenue and cause a net gain of $65 million in 2003.
The timing is crucial for Amtrak. Under a reform act passed in 1997, Amtrak has
until the end of fiscal year 2002 to wean itself from federal operating
subsidies or face possible liquidation.
</P>
<P>
	   Amtrak currently operates a 22,000-mile passenger rail system that serves
more than 500 communities in 45 states.
</P>
<P>
	   The changes do not require approval by Congress. But in order to implement
them, Amtrak will have to strike deals with various freight railroads.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the plan, Amtrak trains will begin stopping in Des Moines and Iowa
City, Iowa; Rockford, Ill.; Vicksburg, Miss.; Monroe and Shreveport, La.; Lake
Geneva and Janesville, Wis.; and destinations on the Atlantic Coast of Florida
including Daytona Beach, Cape Canaveral and Fort Pierce.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, people as far north as Boston will be able to board a train and travel
to Florida without having to transfer in New York. Gamblers will find more
trains to take them to Shreveport's casinos. Riders can board in Michigan, sleep
as their train dashes through Canada and wake up in upstate New York, on the way
to New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   There are losers as well.
</P>
<P>
	   By taking a northern route through more heavily populated cities in Texas,
the Sunset Limited train will no longer stop in Del Rio, Alpine and Sanderson.
</P>
<P>
	   Similarly, the International will stop in Ann Arbor and Dearborn, Mich., but
no longer pass through five other Michigan cities -- East Lansing, Durand,
Flint, Lapeer and Port Huron.
</P>
<P>
	   Amtrak officials are to officially unveil a report on its plan for growth on
Tuesday, although some parts of the report have been disclosed in recent days.
</P>
<P>
	   Warrington said the plan reflects a hard lesson Amtrak learned in the
mid-1990s: Cuts in service bring numerous complaints and fewer financial savings
than expected.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've tried in the past to shrink, and all we've done is irritate people,
reduce service and profits and ridership. And that's no way to run a railroad,''
said Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, chairman of Amtrak's governing board. ``The
board is committed to building a national railroad system, and this is a giant
step forward to doing it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Illustrative of Amtrak's new philosophy is its treatment of the Sunset
Limited, a money-loser that threads its way along the southern United States
from Jacksonville, Fla., to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   The new analysis says that eliminating the Sunset Limited would save $8
million in costs but deprive Amtrak of $9.5 million in fares from passengers and
fees from deliveries that rely on that line to connect to other routes.
</P>
<P>
	   Adopting a philosophy commonly associated with airlines, Amtrak officials
now speak of tolerating money-losing routes as long as they bring people to a
``hub'' station where they can board a profitable, long-distance train.
</P>
<P>
	   Warrington said the report indicates that adjustments, not wholesale
changes, are needed to strengthen Amtrak, created in 1971.
</P>
<P>
	   With the exception of a luxury transcontinental route designed to link New
York and Los Angeles in 60 hours, Amtrak is proposing no new long-distance
routes. Rather, the plan calls for strategic extensions, shifting equipment
around and paying greater attention to mail and express business.
</P>
<P>
	   A case in point is the Crescent, which travels between New York and New
Orleans.
</P>
<P>
	   Plans call for the train to separate in Meridian, Miss., with one segment
heading west to Fort Worth, while the other continues south to New Orleans. This
would allow Amtrak to add service to Vicksburg, Miss., and to Monroe and
Shreveport, La., while building opportunities for mail and express deliveries
between Dallas-Fort Worth and the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
	   Expected payoff: An additional $7.7 million a year as of 2003.
</P>
<P>
	   The mail and express business is key to Amtrak's recipe for financial
recovery, as is a plan to begin hauling meat, poultry, fruit and vegetables in
refrigerated cars attached to intercity trains.
</P>
<P>
	   Sensitive to the concerns of freight railroads, Warrington stresses that he
is looking to complement what they do, not to compete, and to enter into
partnerships to make the best use of the resource they all share: Tracks.

<HEADLINE> Contentious Elections Test Senegal  </HEADLINE>
   By GLENN McKENZIE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DAKAR, Senegal (AP) -- Under cool and sunny skies, Senegal's paupers and
millionaires voted in a presidential election Sunday as rebel attacks and
political unrest threatened one of Africa's few enduring democracies.
</P>
<P>
	   The contest pitting President Abdou Diouf against seven challengers is the
country's most contentious in decades after 40 years of rule by the Socialist
Party. Results weren't expected until at least Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   If Senegal plunges into violence so soon after the December military
takeover in nearby Ivory Coast -- another traditional bastion of African
stability -- Western diplomats worry it could trigger a flight of development
aid and trade away from the continent.
</P>
<P>
	   There have been sporadic street clashes in the past week, with at least one
brawl between ruling party and opposition supporters in the capital's
Biscuiterie neighborhood during the voting.
</P>
<P>
	   Rebels fighting for independence in the Casamance region launched at least
two attacks Sunday, including a rocket assault on the town of Niayassa, near the
southern border with Guinea-Bissau, radio stations reported. Government soldiers
fought back with light weaponry.
</P>
<P>
	   Several people were injured, the private Wal Fadjri FM station said. Calm
had been restored by midday, though voting was called off at a balloting station
where some of the fighting took place.
</P>
<P>
	   At least one soldier was killed in the second attack, near the town of
Kolda, about 420 miles southeast of Dakar, another independent station, Sud FM,
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebel Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance was not immediately
available for comment. Rebel officials have denied responsibility for two
attacks earlier in the week that left at least six people dead and 20 European
tourists wounded.
</P>
<P>
	   While many African countries hold elections, very few are considered truly
free and fair. In West Africa, where votes often take place against the backdrop
of military coups and civil wars, Senegal is one of the few countries to offer
its 10 million citizens and 2.7 million registered voters regular ballots with a
choice between numerous parties.
</P>
<P>
	   Opposition candidates, however, accuse Diouf of rigging previous votes and
allowing massive corruption.
</P>
<P>
	   All eight presidential aspirants, including Diouf, were offering voters a
better life for all. Only four are seen as serious contenders. If an outright
winner fails to emerge, the top contenders will square off in a second round.
</P>
<P>
	   In a country of stark contrasts, opposition candidates have made ``Sopi!''
-- ``Change!'' in Wolof -- their battle cry.
</P>
<P>
	   While the country boasts world class music and fashion, as well as slick
millionaire entrepreneurs, there are few natural riches.
</P>
<P>
	   The majority remain desperately poor, eking out a living by fishing in
severely depleted ocean waters, growing peanuts on arid farms or begging along
the beaches where European and American tourists come for cheap holidays.
</P>
<P>
	   Six out of 10 Senegalese are illiterate. Hospitals have no medicines. And
dusty tracks serve as national highways.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want change, and I flew thousands of miles back here for it,'' said
Moammar Sow, a Senegalese native who has worked for the past eight years as a
New York taxi driver. ``Forty years in power is too long for any government.''
</P>
<P>
	   Abdoulaye Wade, Diouf's longtime rival who was briefly imprisoned in 1993 in
connection with the killing of an electoral official, has warned the country
will explode in popular revolt if the president retains power.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the fears, voting proceeded without incident in most parts of Dakar,
even though some stations opened late and others lacked sufficient election
materials.
</P>
<P>
	   Women in bright wraparound gowns and Muslim clerics clutching prayer beads
cast their ballots alongside Roman Catholic nuns and young men wearing expensive
sports gear and designer sunglasses. Threadbare peasants stood side by side with
wealthy businessmen in European-tailored suits.
</P>
<P>
	   Diouf cast his ballot in the city center, surrounded by wildly cheering
crowds who jammed into a hall to see him. Displaying little emotion, he called
on the Senegalese to ``do their duty'' and vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Retired telegraph operator Gabriel Cilla said he was voting to give the
president another seven-year term because his government has managed to pay its
employees regularly -- unlike many bankrupt African governments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have to give thanks for what we have,'' Cilla said.

<HEADLINE> Appeals for Change After Diallo Trial  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD PYLE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- New demands for social justice, law enforcement reforms and
a federal inquiry echoed from pulpits and city streets on Sunday in the
aftermath of the acquittal of four police officers in the shooting death of
Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
	   About 500 people joined a peaceful prayer vigil outside the United Nations,
where activist Rev. Al Sharpton hoped to bring the Diallo case to international
attention.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting victim ``could have been one of these ambassadors,'' said
Sharpton, who also said he was ``calling for another jury to hear evidence'' on
the policies of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Come November, the jury is going to render its decision,'' he said,
referring to Giuliani's probable run for the U.S. Senate against first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Some in the crowd wore signs reading: ``Go ahead and shoot. I'm black so it
must be justified.''
</P>
<P>
	   In what was billed as a day of prayer, political leaders and activists
joined Sharpton in criticizing the verdicts as inappropriate for a case in which
police fired 41 bullets and hit the West African immigrant 19 times, only to
discover afterward that he was unarmed.
</P>
<P>
	   The four officers, acquitted of second degree murder and lesser charges by a
jury in Albany on Friday, still face a departmental inquiry and possibly federal
charges if Attorney General Janet Reno finds evidence that Diallo's civil rights
were violated.
</P>
<P>
	   At St. Patrick's Cathedral, Auxiliary Bishop James McCarthy, filling in for
an ailing Cardinal John O'Connor, told parishioners Diallo's death should cause
people to ``re-examine our own tendencies toward violence, toward fear, and
perhaps toward prejudice -- racial prejudice at that.''
</P>
<P>
	   City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, speaking at Harlem's Bethel AME church,
said that to make sure Diallo's death was not in vain, the police department
needed to continue to make ``fundamental, meaningful change, so that people
aren't afraid that the police are going to shoot them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union,
told 200 parishioners at a Congregational church in Queens that the Diallo case
was giving new impetus to his group's proposals for police misconduct reform.
</P>
<P>
	   The key provisions of the reforms would make federal and state funding for
local police contingent upon police meeting strict performance standards in
community relations and would name a permanent special prosecutor to handle
police brutality incidents.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to seeking a criminal investigation to determine whether
Diallo's civil rights were violated, Siegel said the NYCLU intends to sue the
city on grounds that poor training and racial stereotyping led to the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Hillary Rodham Clinton urged New Yorkers not to let the verdict divide them.
She said the case underscores the need for a police force reflective of the
city's ethnic diversity and for ``community policing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever the result of a Justice Department inquiry, ``We must reach across
those lines of mistrust and division and join to ensure that no tragedy like
this ever happens again to anyone's son or daughter,'' she told several hundred
people at a national conference of Dominican-Americans at City College of New
York.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton did not mention her opponent, Giuliani, who has been a main target
of protesters in the Diallo affair. Giuliani's campaign spokesman, Bruce
Teitelbaum, later criticized Clinton as uninformed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mrs. Clinton obviously is unaware that New York City recently spent over
$10 million on a new recruiting program designed to create a more diverse police
department (and) ... the new police class will be the most diverse ever,''
Teitelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Calvin Butts, pastor of Harlem's Abyssinian Baptist Church, urged
his followers to vote against Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not blaming Giuliani for pulling the trigger but for creating a
climate that's divisive,'' Butts said in a telephone interview. ``And I'm not
calling for calm. I think black people ought to be agitated, they ought to be
active.''

<HEADLINE> Midwest Worries Over Brain Drain  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN SEEWER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) -- With unemployment unusually low, states and cities
throughout America's heartland are under pressure to keep their best and
brightest from leaving for better jobs and beachfront living.
</P>
<P>
	   Government leaders are offering scholarships to keep students at home after
graduation and tax breaks for high-tech workers who stay in their states. Cities
such as Toledo have organized groups to stop the well-educated from fleeing and
to persuade their sons and daughters to come home.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a huge task,'' said Tracy Sallah, head of Foundations for the Future,
a volunteer group fighting what some call brain drain. ``It's not something
that's going to be solved in a month or a year.''
</P>
<P>
	   Studies in the past year have shown than more than a third of Indiana
natives left the state after college graduation, and in Nebraska, more top
scorers on the ACT college entrance exam went elsewhere for college compared
with students from other states enrolled in Nebraska universities.
</P>
<P>
	   Toledo's government leaders began exploring the problem last summer after
the city's daily newspaper reported that the more education residents have, the
more likely they are to leave. Census figures show that for every two young
people who move to Toledo, three leave.
</P>
<P>
	   Areas whose economies depend on agriculture and industrial jobs are
particularly vulnerable to brain drain, said Mark Drabenstott, director of the
Center for the Study of Rural America in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When your best and brightest are your exports, it really poses a problem
for rural communities in leadership and entrepreneurship,'' Drabenstott said.
</P>
<P>
	   It will take more than a tax break to get businesses and their employees to
locate to some of the affected heartland cities, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Rural communities that don't have a mountain or lake in their backyard
probably need to appeal to an issue of family values and family amenities,''
Drabenstott said.
</P>
<P>
	   In some states, the government is getting involved.
</P>
<P>
	   Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack is pushing a plan giving tax breaks to engineers,
teachers and others who stay in the state. Last year, Montana's state
legislature voted to spend $10 million on research projects to attract more
high-tech jobs. And Wisconsin lawmakers are considering legislation providing a
tax credit for employers who pay for their workers' education.
</P>
<P>
	   Some are concerned such programs are handouts to high-earners.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It tends to put money in the pockets of those who need it least,'' said
Chuck Hassebrook, program director for the Center for Rural Affairs in Walthill,
Neb.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, states should spend more time and money educating and helping
students from families that can't afford a college education, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Toledo, Foundations for the Future is focusing on creating more jobs and
social opportunities for young people.
</P>
<P>
	   A top priority is reshaping the city's image of a tired industrial town.
Supporters say the city of 300,000 needs more downtown apartments and
nightclubs. Others say better paying jobs are the answer.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet Sallah said she understands that young people often have a need to leave
their hometown.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would encourage my own children to go out and explore the world,'' she
said. ``I think it's perfectly normal and it creates a more well-rounded
individual.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- About 1,000 ice-fishermen were stranded on drifting floes in
Europe's largest lake Sunday as local villagers set out in boats to rescue them,
the news agency ITAR-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The report, citing the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations, said a
rescue helicopter was sent to the scene at Lake Ladoga, a 6,700-sq.-mile lake
northeast of St. Petersburg. There were no immediate reports of casualties.
</P>
<P>
	   Ice-fishing is highly popular in Russia, both for sport and for sustenance.
Thousands of anglers become stranded on drifting floes every year, many of them

<HEADLINE> French PM Puzzles Israelis, Arabs  </HEADLINE>
   By SAMAR ASSAD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BIR ZEIT, West Bank (AP) -- The reactions were predictable: Israelis praised
France's prime minister for calling their enemies ``terrorists,'' while Arabs
said Lionel Jospin should have known better.
</P>
<P>
	   Less predictable -- for both sides -- was Jospin's apparent break with a
decades-old French Mideast policy that carefully courted the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
	   Jospin beat a hasty retreat from the Palestinian areas on Saturday after
students rioted during his visit at Bir Zeit University in the West Bank. He
suffered a slight head wound.
</P>
<P>
	   Jospin's description of attacks by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas
against Israeli soldiers in south Lebanon as ``terrorist'' activity sparked
anger throughout the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Jospin's statements contradict French policy announced by President
Jacques Chirac and cannot possibly serve'' Arab-French relations, said the
official Tishrin newspaper in Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   Chirac, a conservative, reprimanded Jospin, a socialist, when he returned to
Paris Saturday night, reminding him of France's delicate ``equilibrium'' in its
support of Israel and the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
	   Chirac's views are consistent with French foreign policy dating back to
1967, when President Charles de Gaulle sharply reversed what had been a
decidedly pro-Israel policy, because it had increasingly hampered France's
extensive Arab trade and military ties.
</P>
<P>
	   Jospin was careful not to break entirely with that tradition, sounding
traditional French positions that would not have appealed to his Israeli hosts:
an end to strikes at civilian targets in Lebanon, support for Palestinian
statehood, and an end to Jewish settlement in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
	   France is Lebanon's former colonial ruler and Paris has long supported
Beirut in its endeavors to get Israeli forces to withdraw from an occupied
border zone in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   Lebanese leaders also expressed dismay and summoned the French ambassador to
complain.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel has pledged to pull out by July, but violence in the south --
apparently exacerbated by last month's breakdown in peace talks with Syria --
has flared in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Hezbollah has killed seven Israeli troops, and Israeli airstrikes have
crippled Lebanese infrastructure targets and injured 20 civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheik Naim Kassem, Hezbollah's deputy chief, called on Chirac and the French
people to ``punish this premier for his mistake,'' according to comments carried
Sunday by Hezbollah's al-Noor radio station.
</P>
<P>
	   Kassem said Jospin was not welcome in Lebanon, where a 3,000-person protest
in the port city of Sidon, planned to mark the anniversary of the killing of a
local leader, turned into an anti-Jospin demonstration.
</P>
<P>
	   About 40 Palestinian students gathered outside Palestinian Authority
headquarters in Ramallah on Sunday to protest the arrest of 20 students in the
rioting a day earlier. ``Jospin said Arab blood was worthless, did you expect a
bed of roses?'' one banner read.
</P>
<P>
	   Most Palestinians condemned the rioters -- who reached Jospin's Mercedes
limousine and smashed its windshield before his entourage got away -- but said
Jospin was out of line. Some suggested he was grandstanding, with his eye on
French presidential elections in 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Hopes of reaching the Elysee Palace may be the reason for such statements,
but such statements are not in line with the French tradition,'' editorialized
the Palestinian daily, ``Al Quds.''
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, that was the Israeli take on Jospin's surprising statement -- the
Socialist premier was seeking to stake out an independent foreign policy, a must
for any potential presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The term `terrorism' ... and the violent response yesterday in Bir Zeit,
will undoubtedly be noted in the next presidential elections in France,'' the
mass circulation Yediot Ahronot wrote. It was especially important, Yediot
wrote, for Jospin to distinguish himself from the pro-Arab positions of Chirac,
who will likely run for a second term in 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine tried to minimize Chirac and Jospin's
differences on RTL radio, stressing that France ``still speaks in a single
voice.'' But he called the angry reaction to Jospin's comments
``disproportionate.''

<HEADLINE> Boeing Engineers Undeterred  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL J. MARTINEZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing engineers were back on the picket lines Sunday after
contract negotiations between the company and their union broke down and a
federal mediator left town.
</P>
<P>
	   No further talks were scheduled, and engineers and technical workers
promised to keep picketing until a new contract agreement is reached.
</P>
<P>
	   At least 17,000 workers remained on strike over the weekend. The workers
walked off the job Feb. 9.
</P>
<P>
	   The three offers Boeing has made show little movement, union officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks between The Boeing Co. and the Society for Professional Engineering
Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA) broke down Saturday, and C. Richard Barnes, the
nation's top federal mediator, left town shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
	   "We kind of figured this might happen," said Geoff Lawrey, a software
engineer and 12-year Boeing veteran picketing in front of company headquarters
Sunday. "It would've been nice (to have an agreement), but nobody seriously
thought it would happen."
</P>
<P>
	   "We felt the offer was good," Boeing spokesman Peter Conte said late
Saturday, adding it "showed substantial movement."
</P>
<P>
	   The company did not return telephone calls for comment on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   SPEEA negotiators had sought more guaranteed pay raises and bonuses similar
to those received by the larger Machinists union. Boeing has insisted on mostly
selective pay increases, reductions in life insurance benefits and increased
health insurance premiums for employees.
</P>
<P>
	   While Boeing did not offer guaranteed bonuses, it did offer employee stock
options. But the engineers on the picket line -- many of whom know fellow
technologists in Seattle's high-tech workforce -- said the options offer was
nearly meaningless.
</P>
<P>
	   The union said that Boeing's latest offer this weekend was very close to its
original offer on Nov. 11, which was near-unanimously voted down. The second
offer, which was turned down by a slim margin, was made Jan. 13.
</P>
<P>
	   SPEEA contracts cover 22,600 employees in the Seattle area, California and
Kansas, though the union has only about 64 percent of those workers as members.
</P>
<P>
	   Tim Murphy, a lead engineer with the company, now drives to picket sites
throughout the region with large urns of coffee for striking workers. Wherever
he's gone, he said workers remain willing to strike as long as it takes.
</P>
<P>
	   "You know, the longer this goes on, the more we're going to ask for when we
come back to the table," Murphy said. "We don't need to be here. There are
plenty of great jobs out there right now."
</P>
<P>
	   Striking workers may soon feel a financial squeeze. SPEEA workers missed
their first paychecks of the strike on Thursday, and must start paying for their
own health insurance on March 1.
</P>
<P>
	   The union had no strike fund when workers walked out, though donations and
fund-raising have brought in some $88,000 so far.
</P>
<P>
	   But for now, the workers remain determined to remain picketing, waving at
beeping cars passing by.

<HEADLINE> Juror: Verdict in Diallo case was clear  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A member of the jury that acquitted four white
police officers in the killing of an unarmed black man said Sunday that the
outcome was "not happy, but clear."
<P>
	   Speaking publicly for the first time since Friday's verdict in the racially
charged case, juror Helen Harder said that the jury deliberated without discord
before agreeing the law was on the side of the officers.
</P>
<P>
	   "It turned out the only way it could turn out," Harder, 71, told the
Associated Press in a brief interview in the kitchen of her Albany County home.
She also said that the facts of the case "were very clear - not happy, but
clear."
</P>
<P>
	   Added Harder: "I'm not saying it's a happy verdict. I know the cops are
happy. None of (the jurors) are very happy. But that's the way it worked out."
</P>
<P>
	   Harder - who has nine children and 17 grandchildren - described the
heartbreak of seeing Diallo's parents sitting in the front row each day of the
month-long trial.
</P>
<P>
	   The juror didn't mention race. But her husband, attorney George Harder, said
his wife told him that race was not an issue in the jury's deliberations.
</P>
<P>
	   Officers Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon, Kenneth Boss and Richard Murphy were
cleared of murder and other charges in the slaying of Diallo, a West African
immigrant.
</P>
<P>
	   The plainclothes officers claimed they fired 41 bullets at the victim on
Feb. 4, 1999 after he refused orders to halt for questioning and pulled out a
black object they thought was a small handgun. Diallo was hit 19 times in the
vestibule of his Bronx apartment before the defendants realized the object was a
wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   The death of Diallo - and now the not-guilty verdict - has flamed tensions
between police and minorities and touched off protests around the city . Because
of pre-trial publicity, an appeals court moved the murder case to Albany, where
Harder, who is white, served on a jury that also had four black women and seven
white men.
</P>
<P>
	   Jurors have mostly remained silent since the verdict, despite constant
hounding by network television, New York City newspapers and major news
organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Harder and juror Thomas Knowles said that several jurors were meeting
to consider issuing a joint statement. It was not clear when that might happen.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury's black foreperson, who once lived in the Bronx, told the New York
Post that the three-day deliberation had "nothing to do with race." She declined
further comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense case hinged on the emotional testimony of the officers. All
claimed they were convinced that they had to shoot Diallo in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge instructed jurors several times that by law if they concluded that
the officers "reasonably believed" Diallo was armed and dangerous, they must
acquit.
</P>
<P>
	   About the officers, Harder said, "I thought they were quite believable."
</P>
<P>
	   The juror also said she was "relieved that (the trial is) over, and to get
my own life back."

<HEADLINE> Ex-Pakistan Premier Lawyers Resign  </HEADLINE>
   By MUNIR AHMED Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) -- Two of the lawyers defending deposed premier Nawaz
Sharif resigned Sunday to protest a court order barring Sharif from making a
public statement at his trial.
</P>
<P>
	   An anti-terrorist court in southern Karachi last week ordered Sharif and the
other men accused of hijacking, attempted murder and other charges to submit
their statements in writing. Prosecutors worried Sharif's testimony could
jeopardize national security.
</P>
<P>
	   The charges against Sharif, his younger brother and five colleagues, stem
from an Oct. 12 incident in which Army Chief Gen. Pervez Musharraf's aircraft
was allegedly forbidden to land by Sharif. The aircraft landed with barely seven
minutes of fuel left. The military seized power the same day.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately clear how the sudden resignations would affect the
trial, or how many other lawyers represent Sharif. The next hearing is Wednesday
in Karachi.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's with a very heavy heart and acute frustration that we have decided to
withdraw from the case,'' Khawaja Sultan told a news conference. ``What's the
use of being in the court, when we cannot help our client?''
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyer Ejaz Hussain Batalvi also resigned.
</P>
<P>
	   From his jail cell, Sharif, issued a statement Sunday accusing the
military-led government of using ``brutal'' tactics to victimize his family and
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It reflects the era of barbaric society, based on revengeful thinking of
the present usurper and to victimize the politicians, my family and my party
men,'' said the statement released by Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League.

<HEADLINE> Albright Eyed As Czech President  </HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. MANN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Madeleine Albright, America's Czech-born secretary of
state, returns next week to her homeland, where there is talk she might seek the
presidency of the East European nation after her tour in Washington ends.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Czechs are speaking of her as a possible successor to President Vaclav
Havel, who must retire in 2002. Havel, a playwright-turned-politician helped
lead the ``Velvet Revolution'' that in 1989 persuaded communist rulers to
resign.
</P>
<P>
	   He has openly talked about the possibility of Albright succeeding him.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Zantovsky, former Czech ambassador to Washington, said Sunday in
Prague that he met last week with Havel and discussed, among other things, the
possibility that Albright might run to succeed Havel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I never made it a secret that I think that Madeleine Albright could, one
day in the future, play a big role in Czech politics,'' Zantovsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   He stressed that the idea is not new and that it would not dominate
Albright's agenda in the Czech Republic next week.
</P>
<P>
	   In Prague, Havel's chief policy adviser, Pavel Fischer, told Time magazine:
``It is not impossible that they will talk about this.''
</P>
<P>
	   The secretary of state has not publicly discussed her future plans. In its
new issue, Time quoted unidentified sources as saying she ``has begun to
consider the possibility of running.''
</P>
<P>
	   Albright's spokesman, James P. Rubin, would not discuss the matter Sunday.
``The secretary is completely happy serving the United States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright's March 5-8 visit coincides with the commemoration of the 150th
anniversary of the birth of national hero Tomas Masaryk, who served as the first
president of the Czechoslovak Republic after the collapse of Austria-Hungary in
1918.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright's visit will have some trappings of a political barnstorming tour.
She will receive a gold medal from Masaryk University in Brno and will go to
Masaryk's birthplace at Hodonin. She will lay a wreath at his tomb in Lany, west
of Prague, and go to the capital to unveil a Masaryk statue.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright's maiden name is Marie Korbelova. Her father was a Czech diplomat
who took his family to London as Germany took over their homeland at the start
of World War II. The family then moved to Denver in 1948 rather than serve under
a communist Czechoslovakian government.
</P>
<P>
	   In an unscientific poll, published by Lidove Noviny, the leading daily
newspaper in Prague, Albright was listed among the greatest living Czechs. Havel
was first. The poll, taken in March 1999, preceded NATO's war in Kosovo, which
was widely unpopular among Czechs.
</P>
<P>
	   Havel first brought up the presidency idea in 1998. After returning to
Prague from an official visit to the United States, he expressed regret that he
hadn't asked whether she would be available to succeed him. ``It occurred to me
on the plane on my way back home,'' Havel said, ``so I did not have the chance
to ask her.''
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Constitution bars Albright or any other alien-born citizen from the
American presidency, but there appears to be no legal bar to keep an American
from assuming the presidency of another country.
</P>
<P>
	   Other naturalized citizens have served in foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
	   Lithuania's current president, Valdas Adamkus, is a former U.S. government
bureaucrat. Yugoslavia's former prime minister, American Milan Panic, was a
California millionaire before returning to his homeland and was barred by a
technicality from running against the President Slobodan Milosevic in 1992. In
Israel, Golda Meir moved from a Milwaukee classroom to become the prime minister
who led Israel to victory in the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
	   And the Czechs already have had an American woman living in their
president's house: Masaryk's wife, Charlotte Garrigue.

<HEADLINE> Artist molds slaves in hopes of removing Confederate flag in S.C.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) - Bernard Jackson plans to lie nearly naked in
chains in a cramped, cold, dark space next to his slaves. The Maplewood artist
will display himself alongside his latest bronze sculptures in an exhibition
Tuesday evening at his Renaissance Gallery in South Orange.
<P>
	   Jackson, 38, said he wants to experience what slaves might have felt as they
traveled in ships to be sold in America.
</P>
<P>
	   But the real reason behind Jackson's Slave Series exhibition involves a
heated debate hundreds of miles of away from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson plans to send his two-foot-tall figurines to the governor of South
Carolina and other elected officials there, hoping the message they convey about
the human misery associated with slavery will help persuade the state's leaders
to remove the Confederate flag that waves above the Statehouse dome in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
	   "I grew up in Columbia and because (the flag) was so much a part of the
scenery, I never really noticed it or realized what it stood for," Jackson said
recently as he peeled away a sculpture from its sticky yellow mold.
</P>
<P>
	   The inspiration for the statues came from watching the Steven Spielberg film
"Amistad," he said. The 1997 movie depicts the trial of 53 Mende tribesmen,
kidnapped from the West African country of Sierra Leone and sold into slavery,
who rebelled aboard the Spanish ship La Amistad off the coast of Cuba, seized
the ship and killed two crewmen.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've rented the movie nine times already," said Jackson. "I was so moved
and so inspired that nothing else seemed to matter."
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson can create about 10 slave sculptures each day using the same mold.
They take about 24 hours to harden. When completed, his exhibit will have 100
slaves placed side by side in groups of 10, bound by leg and wrist chains, on a
wooden base to represent the deck of a slave ship. The wood came from an East
Orange church that was heavily damaged in a fire, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he has sold 20 statues, at $300 apiece, and has given away 40.
</P>
<P>
	   "The first slave I sold was to James Mtume of South Orange," said Jackson,
who paused to reflect on the irony of the words. "Wow, isn't that wild saying
that? 'The first slave I sold."'
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson, a formally trained painter as well as sculptor, credits his mother,
Doris, for encouraging him to follow his passion for art, and praises his wife
for financially supporting him and their two young children. His last full-time
job was nine years ago as art director for a billboard advertising agency in
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   Lynn Irby-Jackson, Jackson's wife of seven years, teaches English at the
Gladys Hillman Jones Middle School in Newark, and teaches dance at night.
</P>
<P>
	   "Oh, it's been a complete struggle," said Irby-Jackson, 32. "But I always
knew he was an artist, and I believe in his talent. If I had two jobs that I
hated, it would be very, very tough."
</P>
<P>
	   Bills have gone unpaid to support the work. His gallery, where he's
displayed his work for five years, recently had the lights and heat turned off
after about $4,000 in utility bills went unpaid.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's been so frigid in here that I saw my breath two weeks ago," Jackson
said. "I had friends here helping me and they said, 'Bernard, I'm sorry, I just
can't stay here anymore."'
</P>
<P>
	   Candles and lanterns will likely be used to illuminate the gallery on
Tuesday, but Jackson isn't concerned.
</P>
<P>
	   "This isn't the first time. Besides, it'll be that much more realistic," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Irby-Jackson remembered how moved Bernard was after seeing "Amistad."
</P>
<P>
	   "The very first time we saw it, he was very quiet coming out of the
theater," said Irby-Jackson. "When he rented it last month, I came in from work
and he was right in the middle of it. He was there transfixed in front of the
television, and I was calling, 'Bernard, Bernard,' and the kids were calling,
'Daddy, Daddy.' He still wasn't talking. He just picked up the clay right after
it was over and starting sculpting."
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not making any money out of it, but when you have a passion for
something, it keeps you going," Jackson said. "My kids can say, 'Daddy didn't
make a lot of money, but he followed his dream."'
</P>
<P>
	   ----
</P>
<P>
	   Editor's note: The Slave Series will be shown Tuesday from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m.
at the Renaissance Gallery, 61 South Orange Ave.

<HEADLINE> NSA Defends Eavesdropping Policy  </HEADLINE>
   By ALICE ANN LOVE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reacting to a spate of charges, a low-profile U.S.
government spy agency is defending to Congress controversial
information-gathering that allegedly includes eavesdropping on ordinary
Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Security Agency mailed a letter to all members of Congress last
week that says: ``We want to assure you that the NSA's activities are conducted
in accordance with the highest constitutional, legal and ethical standards, and
in compliance with statutes and regulations designed to protect the privacy
rights of U.S. persons.''
</P>
<P>
	   The letter, provided to The Associated Press, was signed by Kenneth A.
Heath, the NSA's chief of staff for legislative affairs. It noted that the CBS's
''60 Minutes'' was airing a report on Sunday that criticizes the agency's
activities.
</P>
<P>
	   The NSA is less well known by the American public than other U.S. spy
agencies, such as the CIA. A joke in the intelligence community was that NSA was
so secret that its initials stood for ``No Such Agency.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the CBS broadcast Sunday, a former Canadian intelligence agent said NSA
cooperates with Canada, Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand to run a
satellite listening operation. The eavesdropping operation, known as Echelon,
allegedly monitors phone calls, e-mails and faxes in order to sift out useful
information about foreign governments, drug trafficking and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
	   As an example, the Canadian, Mike Frost, said one woman ended up in
Echelon's database as a possible terrorist because she told a friend on the
phone that her son had ``bombed'' in a school play.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the European Parliament in a report last week accused the
United States of using Echelon for commercial spying -- a kind of industrial
espionage -- to help American companies win contracts over European competitors.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James Rubin refused in a Feb. 23 briefing to
confirm whether Echelon exists, but said the NSA ``is not authorized to provide
intelligence information to private firms,'' and operates ``in strict accordance
with American law.''
</P>
<P>
	   In its letter to Congress, the NSA said that, as a matter of policy, it does
not publicly confirm or deny specific intelligence activities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``However, we can tell you that NSA operates in strict accordance with U.S.
laws and regulations,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
	   Attached to the letter are several pages that describe legal constraints
under which the NSA does its business, including a flow chart showing how
activities are supervised by the Defense and Justice departments, as well as
House and Senate committees on intelligence.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, the papers note that Americans are entitled by law to request to see
all government records about themselves, including the NSA's.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, the American Civil Liberties Union has been requesting
congressional hearings on Echelon for nearly a year. In a letter sent to the
House Government Reform Committee in April 1999, the ACLU said: ``It is
important that Congress investigate to determine if the Echelon program is as
sweeping and intrusive as has been reported.''

	   DENVER (AP) -- They came to the theater as audience members and found
themselves on stage, part of "The Laramie Project," the play about Matthew
Shepard receiving its world premiere at the Denver Center Theater.
</P>
<P>
	   Seven residents of Laramie, Wyo. -- who appear in the drama as characters --
were in the opening night audience Saturday at the Center's 250-seat Ricketson
Theater. Some cried. Others sat quietly through the nearly three-hour evening.
In the end, they all cheered as the actors took their bows. Several quickly fled
the theater, overcome by what they had seen.
</P>
<P>
	   "To actively step back and sit and watch everything unravel is surreal,"
said Matt Galloway, a bartender at Laramie's Fireside Lounge, where Shepard met
the men who killed him. "I had so much anticipation. It is interesting to undo
the wound that you think is healed, but it hasn't."
</P>
<P>
	   Galloway was one of nearly 200 people interviewed by members of the Tectonic
Theater Project for their play about the death of the 21-year-old gay college
student and Laramie's reaction to the murder.
</P>
<P>
	   In the play, Galloway is portrayed by actor Stephen Belber. It was Belber
who interviewed him, spending six hours with the 25-year-old University of
Wyoming senior, an experience Galloway found exhausting and intense.
</P>
<P>
	   "There would be times when I would start expanding on a thought and I would
cut myself short," he recalled. "And he (Belber) would say, "No, no, go on. I
want everything."'
</P>
<P>
	   Opening night drew a parade of media, similar to the barrage Galloway faced
in October 1998 after Shepard died. He found talking to the actors much
different -- and more rewarding -- than talking to journalists.
</P>
<P>
	   "A reporter wants to know what happened -- and they (the actors) wanted to
know what did you feel -- what went on in your mind and how did it affect you,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Harry Woods, an employee in the theater department at the University of
Wyoming, has a small, affecting scene in "The Laramie Project." Woods, played by
actor John McAdams, watches a homecoming parade from his window and marvels as
he sees it swell with people marching in memory of Shepard.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of people in the play are either acquaintances or friends," said
Woods, 53. "The company has been so sensitive to the people of Laramie. I saw
eight, nine wonderfully sensitive people try to find some truth. Whether they
did or not I'm not sure -- but the people I saw portrayed in the play tonight
that I know personally were portrayed very honestly."
</P>
<P>
	   What didn't come through, said Zackie Salmon, another university employee,
was "the depth of grief that was a communal grief. I don't know if it is
possible in any way for anybody to capture that. I think they did the best they
could."
</P>
<P>
	   Laramie did make an attempt to understand, said Salmon, 52, an outspoken
lesbian who moved to Laramie four years ago from Texas. In the show, she is
portrayed by Kelli Simpkins.
</P>
<P>
	   "Laramie changed in a way that gay and lesbian people felt," Salmon said.
"Before this incident, I would never have felt this comfortable being who I am
on that campus or in that community. But after the Matthew Shepard incident
there was a push for understanding.
</P>
<P>
	   "We as a community are going to face what has happened as a community, and
we're going to change."

<HEADLINE> Bush 'Regrets' Bob Jones Flap  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- In a letter to the leader of New York's Catholics,
Gov. George W. Bush says his campaign appearance at a South Carolina school with
anti-Catholic views was a ``missed opportunity causing needless offense, which I
deeply regret.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has come under steady criticism for his Feb. 2 visit to Bob Jones
University, a Christian school whose leaders have criticized the Pope and
labeled the Catholic church a ``Satanic cult.''
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents have assailed Bush for not using the appearance to denounce those
views and the school's ban on interracial dating. Bush spoke about his
conservatism.
</P>
<P>
	   In a Feb. 25 letter to Cardinal John O'Connor of New York, leader of the
archdiocese's 2.4 million Roman Catholics, Bush stated his ``profound respect''
for the Catholic Church and said the criticism of him is unfair and unfounded.
</P>
<P>
	   ``On reflection, I should have been more clear in disassociating myself from
anti-Catholic sentiments and racial prejudice,'' Bush said in the letter, which
his campaign released Sunday. ``It was a missed opportunity causing needless
offense, which I deeply regret.''
</P>
<P>
	   The letter marked an abrupt reversal for Bush, who only last week said: ``I
don't make any apologies for what I do in the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   At a news conference before departing for Seattle, Bush said he had a change
of heart after thinking about impressions of himself as an anti-Catholic ``that
just are not true.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I regret not using the opportunity to speak out against the policies,'' he
said. ``My job is to lead the nation. My job is to convince people to follow me.
This was a missed opportunity and I regret it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush faced questions about the speech almost as soon as he finished it. In
response, he has repeatedly stated his opposition to the ban on interracial
dating and the comments of the school's leaders. Bush also has noted that a
brother and sister-in-law are Catholic.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's appearance also was the subject of telephone calls that GOP
presidential rival Sen. John McCain now acknowledges his campaign placed to
Michigan voters before the primary there last Tuesday. But McCain stood by past
assertions that the calls did not say Bush was a bigot.
</P>
<P>
	   That didn't satisfy Bush, however, who contended that McCain did not speak
the truth when he initially denied knowledge of the calls that informing voters
about the university visit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a man who says he talks the straight talk. This is a man who talks
the parsed talked,'' Bush said. ``The campaign of pitting one religion against
another has got to end. Senator McCain, when given the chance to set the record
straight on who did it, couldn't come to the truth.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a television interview Sunday, McCain acknowledged approving the calls.
He said he and members of his staff originally denied they were being made
because the questions they were asked about them mischaracterized the calls as
labeling Bush a bigot.
</P>
<P>
	   The calls ``said exactly what is fact, and that is he went to this
university,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   His campaign acknowledged the calls just before the polls closed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was no charge in that transcript of those phone calls that said he
was anti-Catholic or anything else,'' he said on CBS's ``Face the Nation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush disagreed. ``It's clearly implied that I'm an anti-Catholic bigot. They
can't hide what those calls meant,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   Karl Rove, Bush's chief strategist, said the back-and-forth over the visit
to Bob Jones University had become ``an ugly episode'' in American politics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``President Ronald Reagan went there, the governor of the state of South
Carolina, a Democrat, went there, Jack Kemp went there, Dan Quayle went there,
and none of them were criticized for supposedly harboring anti-Catholic views
simply because they went there,'' Rove said on Fox News Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Juror: Diallo Verdict Was Clear  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM HAYS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A member of the jury that acquitted four white police
officers in the killing of Amadou Diallo said Sunday that the outcome was ``not
happy, but clear.''
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking publicly for the first time since Friday's verdict in the racially
charged case, juror Helen Harder said the jury deliberated without discord
before agreeing the law was on the side of the officers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It turned out the only way it could turn out,'' Harder, 71, told the
Associated Press. She also said that the facts of the case ``were very clear --
not happy, but clear.''
</P>
<P>
	   Harder -- who has nine children and 17 grandchildren -- described the
heartbreak of seeing Diallo's parents sitting in the front row each day of the
month-long trial.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know the cops are happy. None of (the jurors) are very happy,'' she
said. ``But that's the way it worked out.''
</P>
<P>
	   Because of pretrial publicity, an appeals court moved the murder case to
Albany, where Harder, who is white, served on a jury that also had four black
women and seven white men.
</P>
<P>
	   She didn't discuss race, but her husband, attorney George Harder, said his
wife told him that race was not an issue in the jury's deliberations.
</P>
<P>
	   Officers Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon, Kenneth Boss and Richard Murphy were
cleared of second-degree murder and other charges in the slaying of Diallo, a
West African immigrant.
</P>
<P>
	   The plainclothes officers claimed they fired 41 bullets at the victim on
Feb. 4, 1999, after he refused orders to halt for questioning and pulled out a
black object they thought was a handgun. Diallo was hit 19 times in the
vestibule of his Bronx apartment before the defendants realized the object was a
wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   Jurors have mostly remained silent since the verdict, despite constant
hounding by news organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Harder and juror Thomas Knowles said several jurors were meeting to
consider issuing a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury's black foreperson, Arlene Taylor, who once lived in the Bronx,
said in Sunday's New York Post that the three-day deliberation had ``nothing to
do with race.''
</P>
<P>
	   The defense case hinged on the emotional testimony of the officers. All said
they felt they had to shoot Diallo in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I thought they were quite believable,'' Harder said of their testimony.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge instructed jurors several times that by law if they concluded that
the officers ``reasonably believed'' Diallo was armed and dangerous, they must
acquit.

<HEADLINE> In pulpits and streets, appeals for justice and change  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - New demands for social justice, law enforcement reforms
and a federal inquiry echoed from pulpits and city streets on Sunday in the
aftermath of the acquittal of four police officers in the shooting death of
Amadou Diallo.
<P>
	   About 500 people joined a peaceful prayer vigil outside the United Nations,
where activist Rev. Al Sharpton hoped to bring the Diallo case to international
attention.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting victim "could have been one of these ambassadors," said
Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that he was "calling for another jury to hear evidence" on the
policies of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. "Come November, the jury is going to render
its decision," he said, referring to Giuliani's probable run for the U.S.
Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo's father, Saikou Diallo, Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., and former
Mayor David Dinkins also spoke at the rally, where a few people wore signs
reading "Go ahead and shoot. I'm black so it must be justified."
</P>
<P>
	   In what was billed as a day of prayer, political leaders and activists
criticized the verdict as inappropriate for a case in which police fired 41
bullets and hit the African immigrant 19 times, only to discover afterward that
he was unarmed.
</P>
<P>
	   The four officers, acquitted of second-degree murder and lesser charges by a
jury in Albany on Friday, still face a departmental inquiry and possibly federal
charges if Attorney General Janet Reno finds evidence that Diallo's civil rights
were violated.
</P>
<P>
	   At St. Patrick's Cathedral, Auxiliary Bishop James McCarthy, filling in for
an ailing Cardinal John O'Connor, told parishioners Diallo's death should cause
people to "re-examine our own tendencies toward violence, toward fear, and
perhaps toward prejudice - racial prejudice at that."
</P>
<P>
	   Rev. Calvin Butts, pastor of Harlem's Abyssinian Baptist Church, urged his
followers to vote against Giuliani, saying the mayor had failed to thank him for
urging calm in the wake of the Diallo incident a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not blaming Giuliani for pulling the trigger but for creating a climate
that's divisive," Butts said in a telephone interview. "And I'm not calling for
calm. I think black people ought to be agitated, they ought to be active."
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani spokesman Bruce Teitelbaum questioned the reverend's motives,
saying he had "hugged Mayor Giuliani" at an interfaith service at St. Patrick's
soon after the shooting, and "now he is exploiting Amadou Diallo's death for
partisan political reasons."
</P>
<P>
	   City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, speaking at Harlem's Bethel AME church,
said that to make sure Diallo's death was not in vain, the police department
needed to continue making "fundamental, meaningful change, so that people aren't
afraid that the police are going to shoot them."
</P>
<P>
	   Vallone, a Democrat, said the city council had budgeted funds for that
purpose, and "even the mayor is recognizing that changes have to be made."
</P>
<P>
	   Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union,
told 200 parishioners at a Congregational church in Queens that the Diallo case
was giving new impetus to his group's proposals for police misconduct reform.
</P>
<P>
	   Key provisions of the plan would make federal and state funding for local
police contingent on the police meeting strict performance standards in
community relations and create a permanent special prosecutor to handle police
brutality incidents.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to seeking a criminal investigation to determine whether
Diallo's civil rights were violated, he said the NYCLU intends to sue the city
on grounds that poor training and racial stereotyping led to the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Sunday, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, seeking the Democratic
nomination for U.S. Senate, urged New Yorkers not to let the verdict divide
them. She said the case underscores the need for a police force reflective of
the city's ethnic diversity and for "community policing."
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever the result of a Justice Department inquiry, "we must reach across
those lines of mistrust and division and join to ensure that no tragedy like
this ever happens again to anyone's son or daughter," she told several hundred
people at a national Dominican-American conference at City College.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton did not mention her Republican foe, but Teitelbaum criticized her
stand.
</P>
<P>
	   "Mrs. Clinton obviously is unaware that New York City recently spent over
$10 million on a new recruiting program designed to create a more diverse police
department (and)... the new police class will be the most diverse ever,"
Teitelbaum said.

<HEADLINE> High-tech heists target phone equipment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) - Burglars disguised as telephone repairmen have
swiped the electronic brains out of several Bergen County business telephone
systems, and investigators are looking into similar cases in Middlesex, Morris
and Ocean counties.
<P>
	   In one case, the thieves made off with about $220,000 worth of the
specialized telephone equipment from Mercedes-Benz's North American headquarters
in Montvale.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities say the scam involves men dressed as workmen who tell office
staff they have arrived to check the telephone system. It's later discovered the
self-described technicians have walked out the door with the digital circuit
cards that control the companies' telephone systems.
</P>
<P>
	   The circuit cards are about the size of a sheet of notebook paper, can
control up to 24 telephone lines and are worth up to $5,000 each, The Record of
Hackensack reported in Sunday's editions.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said the cards are an easy target because they slide easily in
and out of slots in telephone equipment cabinets. In the Mercedes-Benz
headquarters theft, which happened last March while the building was being
renovated, 50 of the cards were taken.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of thefts surged in December, authorities said. In Rochelle Park,
four circuit cards were reported missing after two repairmen talked their way
into a data company on Dec. 14. The suspects had disappeared by the time
employees figured out their phone system was no longer working.
</P>
<P>
	   Two days later, similar heists occurred at two Paramus office buildings,
Bellomo said.
</P>
<P>
	   Other circuit board thefts prompted Paramus' community policing bureau to
circulate pamphlets warning of the scam.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators said they suspect small, upstart telecommunications companies
may have created a black market for the stolen cards.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a whole network of companies out there that sell this pre-owned
equipment," said Montvale police Detective David DiBlasi.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said there have been no arrests in connection with resale of
stolen phone equipment.
</P>
<P>
	   But two men last fall were arrested in Morris County in connection with the
theft of a case of business telephones worth more than $10,000 from a
Parsippany-Troy Hills office building. Detectives would not say if they believe
those arrests were linked to the circuit board thefts.
</P>
<P>
	   Police in other towns have made similar arrests and said the suspects
appeared to be average burglars.
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime, investigators throughout New Jersey have been sharing with
each other what they know about the thefts. Cases are under investigation in at
least 25 jurisdictions.

<HEADLINE> Justice: Incarcerations Double  </HEADLINE>
   By ANJETTA McQUEEN AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of criminals under 18 serving time in adult
prisons more than doubled between 1985 and 1997 as states prosecuted steadily
more young people as adults.
</P>
<P>
	   By 1997, 7,400 youths 17 or younger were committed to adult prisons on
conviction in either juvenile or adult courts. That's more than twice the 3,400
young people sent to the nation's state prisons in 1985, a new Justice
Department report shows.
</P>
<P>
	   Seven in 10 young offenders who received adult punishment in 1997, the
latest year state prison records were available, were convicted for violent
offenses. Of that total, 37 percent were jailed for robbery, 13 percent for
murder and 13 percent for aggravated assault, according to the report released
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers say the young inmates by no means are overrunning the prisons'
adult population of 2 million, and just 5 percent of all young offenders
punished in this country serve sentences in adult facilities. But data suggest
that today's violent young offenders are more likely to do prison time than in
years past.
</P>
<P>
	   That's partly because of an increasing number of state laws that take away
their legal status as minors and make them more accountable, researchers say.
The crackdown, fueled in part by high-profile school violence, has placed
children as young as 11 on trial in criminal courts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Many states have increased the number of provisions that allow juveniles
to be handled in the adult system,'' said report author Kevin J. Strom, a
researcher with the department's Bureau of Justice Statistics.
</P>
<P>
	   Based on state prison records reported annually to the Justice Department,
the report notes that while 37 states and the District of Columbia consider
people 18 adults for criminal purposes, most also allow ``certain categories of
offenders under 18 to be incarcerated in adult prisons and housed with older
inmates.''
</P>
<P>
	   The inmate data do not specify whether young offenders are convicted in
juvenile or adult courts, but Strom said it is known that a small percentage go
from the juvenile courts to adult incarceration.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department study comes amid debate over the merits of meting out
adult time for crimes committed by youth. Californians will vote March 7 on a
ballot proposal that would make it easier to charge juveniles as young as 14 as
adults for serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``By virtue of their rarity, school shootings have helped create a distorted
picture about who young people are and the dangers that they pose to the rest of
us,'' said Eric Sterling, president of the Washington-based Criminal Justice
Policy Foundation.
</P>
<P>
	   Historically, young offenders' fates were mostly decided by juvenile judges.
But after a spate of drug-gang violence and school shootings in the last decade,
state lawmakers decided adult prisons could more effectively deal with violent
or chronic youth offenders.
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1992, 30 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws that in
certain instances send kids directly to criminal court. Through 1998, despite a
50 percent drop in the juvenile murder arrest rate, states gave criminal
prosecutors increased power to bypass the century-old juvenile system or chipped
away at options juvenile judges had for trying youth cases.
</P>
<P>
	   Youngsters' yearly admissions to prison climbed steadily between 1986 and
1995, then leveled off, the report said. Over the years, more youths were
imprisoned relative to the number arrested. In 1997, 33 youths were sent to
prison for every 1,000 arrests for violent crimes, up from the 18 imprisoned per
1,000 in 1985.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's some justification for public frustration with the juvenile
system,'' said Vincent Schiraldi, director of the Justice Policy Institute, a
think tank opposed to mandatory sentencing. ``But sending them to the adult
system en masse is no solution. It's hardly a resounding success for the people
it's got.''

<HEADLINE> Pump Price Jumps 6 Cents  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gasoline rose 6 cents per gallon at the pump in the past
two weeks, surpassing the all-time peak recorded in November 1990, industry
analyst Trilby Lundberg said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   High crude oil prices and strong demand combined to drive up the national
average price, including all grades and taxes, to $1.4713 as of Friday. That was
an increase of 6.08 cents from Feb. 11, according to the Lundberg Survey of
10,000 stations nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   "The international oil community is speculating that key world oil producers
may increase oil production in April, which would ease oil prices and therefore
gasoline prices," Lundberg said. "But for now, gasoline prices will probably
hover around their current levels or rise even further."
</P>
<P>
	   Before now, the highest average price for a gallon of gasoline in the U.S.
was $1.46 in 1990, Lundberg said.
</P>
<P>
	   But strong demand indicates the price increase has not created a crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   "Despite this record high level for gasoline prices, unadjusted for
inflation though it may be, consumption has not flinched," Lundberg said. "This
suggests that prices are not at an emergency high level at this point."
</P>
<P>
	   Crude oil prices are up amid uncertainty over whether the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries will increase output when an agreement on lowered
production expires next month.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson met with Saudi Oil Minister
Ali Naimi to seek a Saudi pledge to raise production. He emerged without the
pledge, but obtained a commitment that Saudi Arabia will ensure oil market
stability and prevent oil price volatility.
</P>
<P>
	   Prices recorded Friday at self-service stations averaged $1.4239 per gallon
for regular unleaded gasoline, $1.5196 for mid-grade and $1.6032 for premium.
</P>
<P>
	   Full-service prices were $1.7263 per gallon for regular, $1.8098 for
mid-grade and $1.8840 for premium.

<HEADLINE> Carnival Scraps Time-Share Plans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MIAMI (AP) -- Carnival Corp.'s plummeting stock price has killed the cruise
industry leader's planned entry into the time-share market.
</P>
<P>
	   The purchase of Fairfield Communities Inc. was worth $725 million when it
was announced last month, but the stock market correction has trimmed the value
of the all-stock transaction by 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision to drop the takeover was "based on recent disruptions within
the stock market that have resulted in a negative impact on Carnival's stock,"
chairman Micky Arison said Friday in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Carnival's stock set a 52-week low last week and closed Friday at $27.63.
Fairfield's value has fallen 26 percent to $8.94.
</P>
<P>
	   Carnival had agreed to issue 0.3164 of a share of stock for each Fairfield
share and absorb $50 million in Fairfield debt.
</P>
<P>
	   "That was not the compensation they felt that would work," said Carnival
vice chairman Howard Frank. "So we agreed to back out of the deal."
</P>
<P>
	   Both companies are paying their own merger-related expenses and voiding a
breakup clause.
</P>
<P>
	   Carnival had been seeking an acquisition in the vacation industry that could
offer room for growth.
</P>
<P>
	   Orlando-based Fairfield has been selling Carnival brand cruises through its
vacation program since 1996, and Fairfield chief executive Jim Berk expects to
maintain "a long-term mutually beneficial association."
</P>
<P>
	   Carnival has been hurt by bookings below expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our stock has suffered beyond the norm because we have indicated relative
softness in bookings so far this winter," Frank said. "We have a great
opportunity to catch up. We feel we will have a strong year 2000."
</P>
<P>
	   Fairfield, one of the largest vacation ownership companies in the United
States with 278,000 property owners, offers time-share vacations at 28 locations
in 11 states and the Bahamas and is developing six resorts.

<HEADLINE> Indian Co. Buys Tetley Tea Maker  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- The Tetley Group, maker of the second-biggest brand of
teabags in the world, announced Sunday that it has been bought by the Indian
company Tata Tea Ltd. for $433.6 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Tata Tea, part of the Tata Group, is the largest integrated tea company in
the world, with additional interests in coffee and spices. The two companies
were already working together through a joint venture, Tata Tetley, which
manufactures tea bags in India.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal is set to be completed in March.
</P>
<P>
	   "This will result in a new agenda for aggressive growth and expansion
worldwide, including new territories and product categories for both Tata Tea
Ltd. and the Tetley Group," the two companies said in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Tata Group has expressed total confidence in the Tetley management
team, which will be retained," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tetley Group was created in 1995 by a management buy-in from the
previous owners, Allied Domecq PLC.
</P>
<P>
	   Following a failed attempt to float Tetley as a separate company in 1998,
Tetley was approached by Tata and by Sara Lee Corp. about acquiring the tea
brand.
</P>
<P>
	   Tata, India's biggest plantation group, said it was keen to acquire an
international brand as a key to expanding its markets internationally and to
compete with the market leader, Unilever.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we want to remain in the tea business we have to compete with Unilever,"
S.M. Kidwai, managing director of Tata Tea, said in an interview with the
Financial Times in July.
</P>
<P>
	   "Lipton Tea is everywhere. The combined entity of Tata Tea and Tetley has a
better chance to compete with them than Tata Tea alone."

<HEADLINE> Juror: Verdict in Diallo case was clear  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A member of the jury that acquitted four white
police officers in the killing of an unarmed black man said Sunday that the
outcome was "not happy, but clear."
<P>
	   Speaking publicly for the first time since Friday's verdict in the racially
charged case, juror Helen Harder said that the jury deliberated without discord
before agreeing the law was on the side of the officers.
</P>
<P>
	   "It turned out the only way it could turn out," Harder, 71, told The
Associated Press in a brief interview in the kitchen of her Albany County home.
She also said that the facts of the case "were very clear - not happy, but
clear."
</P>
<P>
	   Added Harder: "I'm not saying it's a happy verdict. I know the cops are
happy. None of (the jurors) are very happy. But that's the way it worked out."
</P>
<P>
	   Harder - who has nine children and 17 grandchildren - described the
heartbreak of seeing Diallo's parents sitting in the front row each day of the
month-long trial.
</P>
<P>
	   The juror didn't mention race. But her husband, attorney George Harder, said
his wife told him it was not an issue in the jury's deliberations.
</P>
<P>
	   Officers Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon, Kenneth Boss and Richard Murphy were
cleared of murder and other charges in the slaying of Diallo, a West African
immigrant.
</P>
<P>
	   The plainclothes officers claimed they fired 41 bullets at the victim on
Feb. 4, 1999 after he refused orders to halt for questioning and pulled out a
black object they thought was a small handgun. Diallo was hit 19 times in the
vestibule of his Bronx apartment before the defendants realized the object was a
wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   The death of Diallo - and now the not-guilty verdict - has flamed tensions
between police and minorities and touched off protests around the city. Because
of pre-trial publicity, an appeals court moved the murder case to Albany, where
Harder, who is white, served on a jury that also had four black women and seven
white men.
</P>
<P>
	   Jurors have mostly remained silent since the verdict, despite constant
hounding by network television, New York City newspapers and major news
organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Harder and juror Thomas Knowles said that several jurors were meeting
to consider issuing a joint statement. It was not clear when that might happen.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury's black foreperson, who once lived in the Bronx, told the New York
Post that the three-day deliberation had "nothing to do with race." She declined
further comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense case hinged on the emotional testimony of the officers. All
claimed they were convinced that they had to shoot Diallo in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge instructed jurors several times that by law if they concluded that
the officers "reasonably believed" Diallo was armed and dangerous, they must
acquit.
</P>
<P>
	   About the officers, Harder said, "I thought they were quite believable."
</P>
<P>
	   The juror also said she was "relieved that (the trial is) over, and to get
my own life back."

<HEADLINE> Kurds Warn Turkey on Peace Efforts  </HEADLINE>
   By SELCAN HACAOGLU Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- A senior Kurdish rebel commander warned Turkey
against blocking the peaceful political efforts undertaken by his group after 15
years of guerrilla fighting for Kurdish rights, a pro-Kurdish newspaper reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The warning by Murat Karayilan, one of the top seven commanders of Abdullah
Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, came two days after Turkey's interior
minister removed four Kurdish mayors on charges or convictions of ties to
Kurdish rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They should not direct us toward mountains,'' Karayilan told Ozgur Bakis
newspaper, hinting that the rebel movement could return to armed struggle in
Turkey's southeast. ``We say, let's solve it with democratic means.''
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels announced an end to armed insurrection for autonomy in the
southeast earlier this month, although they have not yet laid down their arms.
</P>
<P>
	   Turkey calls the rebels terrorists and says negotiating with them is out of
the question.
</P>
<P>
	   Karayilan's was the second such warning from the guerrillas in as many days.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Turkey should determinedly develop its efforts for democracy and peace,''
the presidential council of the rebel group said Saturday. ``Otherwise,
democracy and peace will be lifted from the agenda, and people inevitably will
choke one another.''
</P>
<P>
	   Karayilan, speaking to the newspaper from the Netherlands, denied any
contact with the mayors.

<HEADLINE> McCain Can Throw the Truth a Curve  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain decries ``the negative message of
fear,'' yet airs one of the Republican presidential campaign's harshest ads. He
denies ownership of a political flier that turns out to be his. Issues like
abortion and the Confederate flag tie him into rhetorical knots.
</P>
<P>
	   Even the man behind the wheel of the ``Straight Talk Express'' can throw the
truth a curve.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain is known for endless news conferences, freewheeling town meetings and
a willingness to tell audiences what they don't want to hear. Yet in the heat of
battle, particularly when his emotions get the best of him, the Arizonan can
fall short of his hard-earned reputation as a straight-talker.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nobody is above reproach in this business,'' said GOP strategist Eddie
Mahe. ``And when you're running the kind of race he has run, based on character,
your operating space is tighter than it is for most politicians.''
</P>
<P>
	   As voters streamed to the polls Tuesday in Michigan, Texas Gov. George W.
Bush alleged that McCain forces were targeting Catholics with anti-Bush
telephone calls. The Associated Press reported two days earlier that McCain
phone banks were being established to tell Catholics about Bush's visit to a
South Carolina university perceived by some as being anti-Catholic.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet McCain spokesman Howard Opinsky was told to deny that the calls were
being made. Though at least one senior adviser, Mike Murphy, knew Opinsky was
wrong, the campaign waited several hours -- until polls were nearly closed -- to
set the record straight.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain himself chose to deny one specific Bush allegation -- that callers
were labeling the Texan an anti-Catholic bigot. But McCain did not acknowledge
until the weekend that his phone banks were telling Michigan Catholics about
Bush's visit to Bob Jones University.
</P>
<P>
	   In South Carolina's primary, McCain ran two hard-hitting TV ads comparing
Bush to President Clinton but yanked them for reasons he never fully explained.
He said the decision was a matter of principle, not politics -- but advisers
privately acknowledged the ads were pulled because they were backfiring against
him.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said he made up his mind when a woman stood up at a town hall meeting
and accused the Bush campaign of smearing McCain in a telephone call to her
teen-age son.
</P>
<P>
	   The story ended there. McCain never revealed that he and his advisers met
hours after the town hall meeting to review a third negative ad harsher than the
first two. McCain liked the spot, aides said, but was talked out of using it.
</P>
<P>
	   He was still seething over a week-old transgression: Bush had shared the
stage with a veterans' advocate who questioned McCain's commitment to veterans'
causes.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, a former Vietnam prisoner of war, had watched news coverage of the
veterans' event aboard his campaign bus. As the images flashed across the TV,
his eyes narrowed and his back stiffened -- ``It was a scary look,'' one aide
said.
</P>
<P>
	   When the report ended, McCain blurted, ``I gave him a pass on the Guard, and
now this?''
</P>
<P>
	   To anyone aboard the ``Straight Talk Express'' bus, the comment was an
unmistakable reference to the fact that McCain never questioned why Bush served
in the Texas Air National Guard -- and not Vietnam -- during the war. Aides said
the veterans' event convinced McCain to go on the attack.
</P>
<P>
	   Abortion also has been a tough issue for the blunt-speaking McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Last August, he told the San Francisco Chronicle he didn't think the Supreme
Court ruling that legalized abortion should be repealed. Under fire from
conservatives, he backed off the remark.
</P>
<P>
	   In January, he answered a hypothetical question by saying his 15-year-old
daughter would make the ``final decision'' on ending a pregnancy if she were
contemplating an abortion. Knowing conservatives would be up in arms again,
McCain pulled reporters aside on his bus and polished his reply: It would be a
``family decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In his trademark town halls, where McCain tirelessly answers dozens of
questions from voters, he is not above the occasional pander. One man stood up
in a meeting outside Concord, N.H., and asked, ``Why don't you support a flat
tax, senator.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I do,'' McCain replied, quickly segueing into an explanation of his
tax-cut plan that adjusts -- but does not flatten -- the tax code.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about the exchange on his campaign bus later, McCain said he supports
a flat tax ``in concept'' but doesn't think it is viable. Why didn't he give the
man that answer?
</P>
<P>
	   ``Because,'' McCain said with an impish grin, ``that wasn't the answer he
was looking for.''
</P>
<P>
	   In South Carolina, he couldn't give everybody the answers they wanted on the
issue of the Confederate flag flying above the Capitol building. So his staff
typed up a script -- what one aide called ``a non-position paper'' -- designed
to prevent backlash in the simmering dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush also refused to take sides on the matter, but it was unusual to see
McCain pulling a piece of paper from his pocket and reading his advisers' words.
</P>
<P>
	   In their South Carolina debate, Bush brandished a piece of paper and said it
was an example of negative McCain literature and proof that McCain had broken
his pledge to run a clean campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's not by my campaign!'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   Afterward, he acknowledged the flier was produced by the campaign, but
insisted they were no longer being distributed. The flier showed up on
windshields in Columbia for days afterward.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahe said McCain's POW days inoculate him against the occasional twist in
the road aboard the ``Straight Talk Express.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``That whole time in Vietnam, the way he did what he did, that's what his
character argument is based on with people,'' Mahe said. ``And you can't change
that biography.''

<HEADLINE> Appeals for Change After Diallo Trial  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD PYLE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- New demands for social justice, law enforcement reforms and
a federal inquiry echoed from pulpits and city streets on Sunday in the
aftermath of the acquittal of four police officers in the shooting death of
Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
	   About 500 people joined a peaceful prayer vigil outside the United Nations,
where activist Rev. Al Sharpton hoped to bring the Diallo case to international
attention.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting victim ``could have been one of these ambassadors,'' said
Sharpton, who also said he was ``calling for another jury to hear evidence'' on
the policies of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Come November, the jury is going to render its decision,'' he said,
referring to Giuliani's probable run for the U.S. Senate against first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Some in the crowd wore signs reading: ``Go ahead and shoot. I'm black so it
must be justified.''
</P>
<P>
	   In what was billed as a day of prayer, political leaders and activists
joined Sharpton in criticizing the verdicts as inappropriate for a case in which
police fired 41 bullets and hit the West African immigrant 19 times, only to
discover afterward that he was unarmed.
</P>
<P>
	   The four officers, acquitted of second degree murder and lesser charges by a
jury in Albany on Friday, still face a departmental inquiry and possibly federal
charges if Attorney General Janet Reno finds evidence that Diallo's civil rights
were violated.
</P>
<P>
	   At St. Patrick's Cathedral, Auxiliary Bishop James McCarthy, filling in for
an ailing Cardinal John O'Connor, told parishioners Diallo's death should cause
people to ``re-examine our own tendencies toward violence, toward fear, and
perhaps toward prejudice -- racial prejudice at that.''
</P>
<P>
	   City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, speaking at Harlem's Bethel AME church,
said that to make sure Diallo's death was not in vain, the police department
needed to continue to make ``fundamental, meaningful change, so that people
aren't afraid that the police are going to shoot them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union,
told 200 parishioners at a Congregational church in Queens that the Diallo case
was giving new impetus to his group's proposals for police misconduct reform.
</P>
<P>
	   The key provisions of the reforms would make federal and state funding for
local police contingent upon police meeting strict performance standards in
community relations and would name a permanent special prosecutor to handle
police brutality incidents.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to seeking a criminal investigation to determine whether
Diallo's civil rights were violated, Siegel said the NYCLU intends to sue the
city on grounds that poor training and racial stereotyping led to the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Hillary Rodham Clinton urged New Yorkers not to let the verdict divide them.
She said the case underscores the need for a police force reflective of the
city's ethnic diversity and for ``community policing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever the result of a Justice Department inquiry, ``We must reach across
those lines of mistrust and division and join to ensure that no tragedy like
this ever happens again to anyone's son or daughter,'' she told several hundred
people at a national conference of Dominican-Americans at City College of New
York.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton did not mention her opponent, Giuliani, who has been a main target
of protesters in the Diallo affair. Giuliani's campaign spokesman, Bruce
Teitelbaum, later criticized Clinton as uninformed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mrs. Clinton obviously is unaware that New York City recently spent over
$10 million on a new recruiting program designed to create a more diverse police
department (and) ... the new police class will be the most diverse ever,''
Teitelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Calvin Butts, pastor of Harlem's Abyssinian Baptist Church, urged
his followers to vote against Giuliani, saying the mayor had failed to thank him
for urging calm in the wake of the Diallo incident a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not blaming Giuliani for pulling the trigger but for creating a
climate that's divisive,'' Butts said in a telephone interview. ``And I'm not
calling for calm. I think black people ought to be agitated, they ought to be
active.''
</P>
<P>
	   Teitelbaum questioned the reverend's motives, saying he had ``hugged Mayor
Giuliani'' at an interfaith service soon after the shooting, and ``now he is
exploiting Amadou Diallo's death for partisan political reasons.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Takes Delegates From Islands  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush picked up more than two dozen
delegates to the Republican national convention after sweeping presidential
primary contests this weekend in four U.S. territories, where residents won't be
able to vote for him come November if he wins the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   The delegates were chosen Saturday at caucuses in Guam, American Samoa and
the Virgin Islands, each of which had four delegates at stake. Puerto Rico held
its primary Sunday, with all 14 of its delegates going to the winner.
</P>
<P>
	   The victories increased Bush's delegate total to 93, narrowing the gap
between himself and rival Sen. John McCain. The Arizona senator had 96 delegates
going into the weekend races; a candidate needs 1,034 delegates to win the
Republican nomination for president.
</P>
<P>
	   While Bush picked up additional delegates, he cannot count on getting votes
from the islands' residents if he wins the nomination. Residents of U.S.
territories cannot vote in the general election, but are allowed to participate
in presidential primaries and caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the contests gave island Republicans a chance to be heard on the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
	   In Puerto Rico, with 89 percent of the polling stations reporting, Bush
received 77,196 votes, or 93 percent, and McCain had 4,668 votes, or about 6
percent. Former ambassador Alan Keyes and publisher Steve Forbes, who dropped
out of the GOP race earlier this month, each received less than 1 percent of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a tremendous triumph not only for Puerto Rico, but on the national
level because it is the first group of Hispanic voters that has voted solidly
with Governor Bush,'' said Jose Fuentes Agostini, the island's former Attorney
General and co-chair of the Texas governor's campaign. The campaign hopes the
win will help influence primaries in states with significant Puerto Rican
populations, such as Florida and New York.
</P>
<P>
	   During Saturday's contests, there was a motion to split Guam's four
delegates between Bush and McCain, but a binding motion to support only Bush
prevailed, said Fred Castro, the national committeeman-elect.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Virgin Islands, Republicans met on the Caribbean islands of St.
Thomas, St. Croix and St. John, said the territory's GOP committeeman, Holland
Redfield II, who refused to give a breakdown of how participants voted during
the closed assemblies.

<HEADLINE> Floods Strand Hundreds in Mozambique  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE COHEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAVE RIVER VALLEY, Mozambique (AP) -- Helicopters plucked more than 1,500
people to safety Sunday as swollen rivers swept away almost everything in their
paths in flood-ravaged Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
	   A new storm system began building off the coast Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Many more people gripped whatever high ground they could find as waters
continued to rise in the Save and Limpopo rivers of this southeast African
country, one of the poorest in the world. They have been stranded for a week and
desperately need food.
</P>
<P>
	   Without warning, the level of the Limpopo River rose rapidly early Sunday
morning, submerging the town of Chokwe and dozens of surrounding villages in
Mozambique's already flooded Gaza province in a matter of hours.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These people went to bed last night with no sign of water,'' Michele
Quintaglie of the World Food Program said of Chokwe residents. ``At 5 a.m., they
woke up by hysterical screams telling them to get out. By early morning, the
city was engulfed by water. By lunch, it was completely submerged.''
</P>
<P>
	   Groups of people huddled on tiny patches of land stretched out their arms to
plead for help from one of only two rescue helicopters in the Save area. A lone
man on the roof of a straw hut pointed his fingers to his mouth and rubbed his
stomach.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials refused to speculate how many people already have been swept away
in the vast area along the banks of the Save (pronounced sah-VEY) in central
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's massive destruction along the Save River. It's taking everything
in its path. Homes, villages. There are people stranded in trees and on homes. A
lot of people are getting killed,'' said David Schaad, a World Food Program
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   UNICEF's Ian Macleod estimated between 5,000 and 10,000 people were stranded
in the area.
</P>
<P>
	   About 3,000 more were marooned in southern Mozambique after the Limpopo
burst its banks.
</P>
<P>
	   The known death toll in Mozambique and neighboring South Africa and Zimbabwe
reached 200 from flooding in the last week. Police said Sunday that at least 33
people died and 20 were missing after a bus was swept off a flooded bridge two
days earlier in northeastern Zimbabwe. Twenty passengers had survived.
</P>
<P>
	   Torrential rains began drenching southern Africa three weeks ago, and then
Cyclone Eline roared through last week. As the remnants of the cyclone raced
back to the Indian Ocean, a new storm system was developing off the coast of
Mozambique and was expected to hit Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Save valley, South African helicopters hoisted people aboard and
dropped them a short distance away on slightly bigger raised patches of earth.
With the nearest refueling point 125 miles away, rescues were going painfully
slowly.
</P>
<P>
	   Journalists who flew 10 miles up the river mouth saw up to 1,000 marooned
people.
</P>
<P>
	   One helicopter hoisted a woman and her baby aboard from the remains of a
hut. Pigs, goats and cattle waded through the muddy water.
</P>
<P>
	   Pilot Chippy Pretorius said he had rescued 320 people, and had seen one
human body and many dead animals in the water.
</P>
<P>
	   Farther south, the five South African helicopters in the Limpopo area saved
1,200 people before stopping for the evening, said Maj. Louis Kirsten of the
South African force. The helicopters would return Monday, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The South African and Mozambican governments were wrangling Sunday about who
would pay for advanced plans to send five more helicopters and two planes, said
Lt. Col. Jaco Klopper, commander of the South African rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   Pilots were focusing on saving the children first and often had to push away
desperate people trying to get on the fully loaded helicopters, said Michele
Quintaglie of the World Food Program.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a very dangerous situation right now because people are panicking,''
she said.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Warns Rebels on Ultimatum  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) -- Sudan on Sunday said rebels will be responsible if
humanitarian relief efforts grind to a halt in the south as a result of a
rebel-issued ultimatum to international aid groups operating in the war-torn and
impoverished area.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebel ultimatum ``strips those organizations of their neutrality,'' said
a statement issued by the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
	   The ultimatum, issued Jan. 12, gives international humanitarian
organizations in southern Sudan until Tuesday to decide what role the rebels
will play in aid distribution and ensuring the security of aid workers.
</P>
<P>
	   Aid in the region, dubbed Operation Lifeline Sudan, is made up of 35 relief
organizations and 500 people delivering millions of dollars worth of food. The
operation is authorized by the rebels, the United Nations and the Sudanese
government.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. food agency and UNICEF are unaffected by the dispute because they
have a separate agreement with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   Some aid groups have already begun withdrawing their workers in anticipation
of the deadline, fearing for their security, the ministry statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This regrettable step will negatively affect the lives of thousands of
innocent civilians who will be deprived of ... food and health care,'' it said,
adding that the rebels were in violation of humanitarian agreements and ``should
be held directly responsible for ... what befalls the lives of citizens there.''
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels are leading a rebellion for autonomy for the largely Christian
southern Sudan from the predominantly Muslim north. Since 1986 at least 2
million Sudanese have died in fighting or war-related famine.

<HEADLINE> Serbs: MD's Death May Spur Exodus  </HEADLINE>
   By ELENA BECATOROS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GNJILANE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A Serb doctor who was a moderate political
representative for his dwindling community in this multiethnic, eastern Kosovo
town was buried Sunday, and locals said his killing would prompt Serbs and other
minorities to flee.
</P>
<P>
	   Josif Vasic, 38, a gynecologist, was one of only five Serb doctors remaining
in the U.S.-controlled Gnjilane region. He was also Gnjilane's representative in
the Serb National Council, which represents the province's Serbs.
</P>
<P>
	   He was shot and killed early Saturday by unknown assailants as he walked to
work through a Serb part of town, said a friend who would give his name only as
Dragan K for fear of reprisal attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Serbs in Gnjilane avoid using main roads in town for fear of attacks,
sticking to smaller alleys and paths within the Serb areas, said a medical
student who would give only his initials, M.P.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We considered it a safe route,'' he said. ``We definitely don't any
more.''
</P>
<P>
	   But mourners, many of whom arrived at the funeral by bus under the armed
protection of American peacekeepers, said Vasic was a moderate who believed in a
multiethnic Kosovo and treated both Serb and Albanian patients.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was shot because he believed the Serbs could stay in Kosovo and could
live together with the Albanians here,'' said Dragan K. ``His belief cost him
his head.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Serb National Council said Vasic's killing was part of ``the latest wave
of violence and ethnic cleansing by Kosovo Albanian extremists,'' and criticized
international peacekeepers for failing to protect the province's dwindling Serb
community.
</P>
<P>
	   NATO forces entered Kosovo in June following a 78-day bombing campaign to
halt a crackdown on ethnic Albanians, who are in the majority. Since then, more
than 100,000 Serbs have fled the province as revenge attacks by ethnic Albanians
continue.
</P>
<P>
	   There were other violent incidents over the weekend that appeared to be
ethnically motivated.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, a Serb policeman and an ethnic Albanian were killed and three
Serb police officers were wounded during an attack on a police patrol in
southern Serbia.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement carried by Serbia's official state-run new agency, Tanjug,
the police said Sunday that ``a group of Albanian terrorists'' attacked the Serb
police patrol late Saturday near the village of Konculj, 175 miles southeast of
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said the Albanian killed was a member of the Kosovo Protection Force,
which is made up of members of the officially disbanded Kosovo Liberation Army.
The KLA was created by pro-independence fighters in the Kosovo province and was
disbanded after NATO deployed in Kosovo last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Riza Halimi, an ethnic Albanian who heads Serbia's Presevo district, said
attacks on Serbian police ``have deteriorated the situation'' and that local
ethnic Albanians were beginning to form guerrilla units similar to the KLA.

<HEADLINE> Pius' Legacy Mars Papal-Israel Visit  </HEADLINE>
   By DINA KRAFT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Considered a hero by the Roman Catholic church, excoriated
as a villain by many Jews, Pope Pius XII has left a legacy that is haunting next
month's papal pilgrimage to the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
	   The Vatican's top diplomat in the Holy Land says the wartime pontiff kept
silent about the Nazi genocide precisely because he wanted to save Jewish lives
-- a defense ridiculed Sunday by Holocaust historians and used as ammunition by
ultra-nationalists in Israel calling for a boycott of Pope John Paul II's visit.
</P>
<P>
	   Archbishop Pietro Sambi's nationally broadcast comments and the bitter
reaction they have drawn could overshadow hopes for reconciliation during the
landmark pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
	   Yisrael Gutman, the chief historian at Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust
memorial, said Pius' failure to condemn the Nazis was reprehensible.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Silence could of course not help,'' Gutman said. ``It could only be
interpreted as a lack of interest or as a lack of will to interfere in the Nazi
policy ... and murder.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Vatican has said that Pius had not been informed of the extent of
Hitler's purges, which killed 6 million Jews. In defending Pius' silence, it has
cited a 1942 incident in which, after Dutch bishops spoke out against the
deportations of Jews, the Nazis sent 300 Catholic converts of Jewish families to
Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
	   Proceedings to beatify Pius, the last formal step before sainthood, have
strained Jewish-Catholic relations, historically tense over persecution and
massacres of Jews by Catholics during the Inquisition and the Crusades and
accusations of Vatican-sponsored anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
	   Some ultra-nationalist Jews and some ultra-Orthodox Jews have criticized
Israel's chief rabbis for planning a meeting with the pope, saying the March
20-26 visit might spur Christian missionary activity.
</P>
<P>
	   Slogans like ``Don't meet the pope'' and ``No to blasphemy, No to meeting
the pope'' were found Sunday spray-painted on the exterior walls of the building
that houses Israel's chief rabbinate.
</P>
<P>
	   The rabbis condemned the graffiti, calling John Paul II a ``friend.''
</P>
<P>
	   There are hopes that the pontiff's historic trip here -- the first for a
pope since 1964 -- will be a watershed in Catholic-Jewish relations, capping
years of reconciliation work between the faiths.
</P>
<P>
	   John Paul II has been widely praised for his overtures to Israel that
culminated in a 1994 treaty establishing diplomatic relations between the
Vatican and the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Sambi's comments Saturday to Israel TV defending Pius XII's wartime
record reopened a painful debate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am convinced that a great strong condemnation would have increased the
persecution of Hitler against the Jews,'' Sambi said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmaker Tommy Lapid, himself a Holocaust survivor, called Sambi's
justifications of Pius' silence ``a feeble excuse, so immoral, so evasive.''
</P>
<P>
	   The historian, Gutman, also a Holocaust survivor, acknowledged that at the
very final stages of the war, Pius did attempt to save some Hungarian Jews from
the death camps and helped shelter others inside the Vatican. He said, however,
that throughout the war, Catholic institutions and individuals who put
themselves at risk to save Jewish lives did so at their own initiative, without
Vatican encouragement or backing.
</P>
<P>
	   Holocaust scholar Yehuda Bauer, in a review published in the daily Jerusalem
Post of a recent biography of Pius XII, said the pontiff's silence was a moral
failing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Had Pius XII spoken out, he might not have saved a single Jew, but he
possibly might have saved his soul,'' Bauer wrote.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Engineers Undeterred  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL J. MARTINEZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing engineers were back on the picket lines Sunday after
contract negotiations between the company and their union broke down and a
federal mediator left town.
</P>
<P>
	   No further talks were scheduled, and engineers and technical workers
promised to keep picketing until a new contract agreement is reached.
</P>
<P>
	   At least 17,000 workers remained on strike over the weekend. The workers
walked off the job Feb. 9.
</P>
<P>
	   The three offers Boeing has made show little movement, union officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks between The Boeing Co. and the Society for Professional Engineering
Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA) broke down Saturday, and C. Richard Barnes, the
nation's top federal mediator, left town shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
	   "We kind of figured this might happen," said Geoff Lawrey, a software
engineer and 12-year Boeing veteran picketing in front of company headquarters
Sunday. "It would've been nice (to have an agreement), but nobody seriously
thought it would happen."
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing spokesman Peter Conte said Sunday: "We came to the table with what we
thought were viable alternatives. We thought SPEEA's counter-proposal was not
viable."
</P>
<P>
	   SPEEA negotiators had sought more guaranteed pay raises and bonuses similar
to those received by the larger Machinists union. Boeing has insisted on mostly
selective pay increases, reductions in life insurance benefits and increased
health insurance premiums for employees.
</P>
<P>
	   While Boeing did not offer guaranteed bonuses, it did offer employee stock
options. But the engineers on the picket line -- many of whom know fellow
technologists in Seattle's high-tech workforce -- said the options offer was
nearly meaningless.
</P>
<P>
	   The union said that Boeing's latest offer this weekend was very close to its
original offer on Nov. 11, which was near-unanimously voted down. The second
offer, which was turned down by a slim margin, was made Jan. 13.
</P>
<P>
	   SPEEA contracts cover 22,600 employees in the Seattle area, California and
Kansas, though the union has only about 64 percent of those workers as members.
</P>
<P>
	   Conte confirmed that Boeing has started to hire short-term contract workers
to take over engineering and technical functions until the strike is resolved.
He did not know how many contractor replacements have been hired.
</P>
<P>
	   The company delivered three more aircraft to customers on Friday, bringing
the total deliveries up to nine since the strike began on Feb. 9. In 1999,
Boeing delivered 47 aircraft in the month of February.
</P>
<P>
	   Tim Murphy, a lead engineer with the company, now drives to picket sites
throughout the region with large urns of coffee for striking workers. Wherever
he's gone, he said workers remain willing to strike as long as it takes.
</P>
<P>
	   "You know, the longer this goes on, the more we're going to ask for when we
come back to the table," Murphy said. "We don't need to be here. There are
plenty of great jobs out there right now."
</P>
<P>
	   Striking workers may soon feel a financial squeeze. SPEEA workers missed
their first paychecks of the strike on Thursday, and must start paying for their
own health insurance on March 1.
</P>
<P>
	   The union had no strike fund when workers walked out, though donations and
fund-raising have brought in some $88,000 so far.
</P>
<P>
	   But for now, the workers remain determined to remain picketing, waving at
beeping cars passing by.

<HEADLINE> Appeals for Change After Diallo Trial  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD PYLE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- New demands for social justice, law enforcement reforms and
a federal inquiry echoed from pulpits and city streets on Sunday in the
aftermath of the acquittal of four police officers in the shooting death of
Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
	   About 500 people joined a peaceful prayer vigil outside the United Nations,
where activist Rev. Al Sharpton hoped to bring the Diallo case to international
attention.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting victim ``could have been one of these ambassadors,'' said
Sharpton, who also said he was ``calling for another jury to hear evidence'' on
the policies of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Come November, the jury is going to render its decision,'' he said,
referring to Giuliani's probable run for the U.S. Senate against first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Some in the crowd wore signs reading: ``Go ahead and shoot. I'm black so it
must be justified.''
</P>
<P>
	   In what was billed as a day of prayer, political leaders and activists
joined Sharpton in criticizing the verdicts as inappropriate for a case in which
police fired 41 bullets and hit the West African immigrant 19 times, only to
discover afterward that he was unarmed.
</P>
<P>
	   The four officers, acquitted of second-degree murder and lesser charges by a
jury in Albany on Friday, still face a departmental inquiry and possibly federal
charges if Attorney General Janet Reno finds evidence that Diallo's civil rights
were violated.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton's National Action Network is investigating what companies
contribute money to the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, which financed the
defense of the four officers in the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Later this week, Sharpton will release names of the companies and will ask
that residents of New York City boycott the firms, said his spokeswoman, Rachel
Noerdlinger.
</P>
<P>
	   At St. Patrick's Cathedral, Auxiliary Bishop James McCarthy, filling in for
an ailing Cardinal John O'Connor, told parishioners Diallo's death should cause
people to ``re-examine our own tendencies toward violence, toward fear, and
perhaps toward prejudice -- racial prejudice at that.''
</P>
<P>
	   City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, speaking at Harlem's Bethel AME church,
said that to make sure Diallo's death was not in vain, the police department
needed to continue to make ``fundamental, meaningful change, so that people
aren't afraid that the police are going to shoot them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union,
told 200 parishioners at a Congregational church in Queens that the Diallo case
was giving new impetus to his group's proposals for police misconduct reform.
</P>
<P>
	   The key provisions of the reforms would make federal and state funding for
local police contingent upon police meeting strict performance standards in
community relations and would name a permanent special prosecutor to handle
police brutality incidents.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to seeking a criminal investigation to determine whether
Diallo's civil rights were violated, Siegel said the NYCLU intends to sue the
city on grounds that poor training and racial stereotyping led to the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Hillary Rodham Clinton urged New Yorkers not to let the verdict divide them.
She said the case underscores the need for a police force reflective of the
city's ethnic diversity and for ``community policing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever the result of a Justice Department inquiry, ``We must reach across
those lines of mistrust and division and join to ensure that no tragedy like
this ever happens again to anyone's son or daughter,'' she told several hundred
people at a national conference of Dominican-Americans at City College of New
York.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton did not mention her opponent, Giuliani, who has been a main target
of protesters in the Diallo affair. Giuliani's campaign spokesman, Bruce
Teitelbaum, later criticized Clinton as uninformed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mrs. Clinton obviously is unaware that New York City recently spent over
$10 million on a new recruiting program designed to create a more diverse police
department (and) ... the new police class will be the most diverse ever,''
Teitelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Calvin Butts, pastor of Harlem's Abyssinian Baptist Church, urged
his followers to vote against Giuliani, saying the mayor had failed to thank him
for urging calm in the wake of the Diallo incident a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not blaming Giuliani for pulling the trigger but for creating a
climate that's divisive,'' Butts said in a telephone interview. ``And I'm not
calling for calm. I think black people ought to be agitated, they ought to be
active.''
</P>
<P>
	   Teitelbaum questioned the reverend's motives, saying he had ``hugged Mayor
Giuliani'' at an interfaith service soon after the shooting, and ``now he is
exploiting Amadou Diallo's death for partisan political reasons.''

in a peaceful march. It was uncertain late Sunday where the marchers -
accompanied by a phalanx of police - were headed.

<P>
	   Sharpton also called for people to "hold their wallets," as Diallo was doing
when he was shot. The officers have said they mistook the wallet for a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're going to boycott in this city," he said. "We are afraid to spend
money with certain people because we are considered suspects. Let's hold our
wallets, let's hold our wallets."

	   Rev. Calvin Butts, pastor of Harlem's Abyssinian Baptist Church, urged his
followers to vote against Giuliani, saying the mayor had failed to thank him for
urging calm in the wake of the Diallo incident a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not blaming Giuliani for pulling the trigger but for creating a climate
that's divisive," Butts said in a telephone interview. "And I'm not calling for
calm. I think black people ought to be agitated, they ought to be active."
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani spokesman Bruce Teitelbaum questioned the reverend's motives,
saying he had "hugged Mayor Giuliani" at an interfaith service at St. Patrick's
soon after the shooting, and "now he is exploiting Amadou Diallo's death for
partisan political reasons."
</P>
<P>
	   City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, speaking at Harlem's Bethel AME church,
said that to make sure Diallo's death was not in vain, the police department
needed to continue making "fundamental, meaningful change, so that people aren't
afraid that the police are going to shoot them."
</P>
<P>
	   Vallone, a Democrat, said the city council had budgeted funds for that
purpose, and "even the mayor is recognizing that changes have to be made."
</P>
<P>
	   Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union,
told 200 parishioners at a Congregational church in Queens that the Diallo case
was giving new impetus to his group's proposals for police misconduct reform.
</P>
<P>
	   Key provisions of the plan would make federal and state funding for local
police contingent on the police meeting strict performance standards in
community relations and create a permanent special prosecutor to handle police
brutality incidents.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to seeking a criminal investigation to determine whether
Diallo's civil rights were violated, he said the NYCLU intends to sue the city
on grounds that poor training and racial stereotyping led to the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Sunday, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, seeking the Democratic
nomination for U.S. Senate, urged New Yorkers not to let the verdict divide
them. She said the case underscores the need for a police force reflective of
the city's ethnic diversity and for "community policing."
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever the result of a Justice Department inquiry, "we must reach across
those lines of mistrust and division and join to ensure that no tragedy like
this ever happens again to anyone's son or daughter," she told several hundred
people at a national Dominican-American conference at City College.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton did not mention her Republican foe, but Teitelbaum criticized her
stand.
</P>
<P>
	   "Mrs. Clinton obviously is unaware that New York City recently spent over
$10 million on a new recruiting program designed to create a more diverse police
department (and)... the new police class will be the most diverse ever,"
Teitelbaum said.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton urges reconciliation between cops and citizens  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton on Sunday urged New Yorkers to
reach across the "trust divide" in the wake of the Diallo verdict, saying there
was room for improvement on both sides in relations between communities and the
police.
<P>
	   "There are still too many people in this city who believe they are
considered guilty just because of the color of their skin, and there are also
too many police officers who believe they are mistrusted because of the color of
their uniforms," Clinton told several hundred people at a conference at City
College on the political concerns of Dominican-Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   She added: "The police must strive for a better understanding of the
communities they serve, and the communities must strive for a better
understanding of the risks that the police face in their service on behalf of us
everyday."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton noted that the U.S. Department of Justice is looking into whether
federal civil rights charges should be brought against the four white officers
who were acquitted of wrongdoing in the shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed
African immigrant.
</P>
<P>
	   She did not offer an opinion on whether she thought a federal case was
merited, but added: "No matter the outcome of that investigation, there is more
for all of us to do to respond to this tragedy. We must not allow the verdict to
divide New Yorkers. We must reach across those lines of mistrust and division
and join to ensure that no tragedy like this ever happens again."
</P>
<P>
	   She also called for an effort "to recruit and train a police force that
truly reflects the racial and ethnic diversity of this great city. We must
support efforts to expand community policing so that more police officers can
walk the beat and really know people they serve."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton is running for U.S. Senate against Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
Giuliani's spokesman, Bruce Teitelbaum, bristled at the notion that the police
force needs reforming.
</P>
<P>
	   "Mrs. Clinton is obviously unaware that New York City recently spent over
$10 million on a new recruiting program designed to create a more diverse police
department," he said. "As a result of the plan, the new police class will be the
most diverse ever and will better reflect the ethnic and racial diversity of our
city."
</P>
<P>
	   The class of 1,261 new officers, which graduated from the Police Academy on
Tuesday, is 20 percent Hispanic and 10 percent black. The police force overall
is 17 percent Hispanic and 13 percent black, while the city's population is 24
percent Hispanic and 26 percent black.

<HEADLINE> Barak May Agree to Golan Withdrawal  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE COPANS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak suggested Sunday that he
would agree to a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights -- the clearest
indication yet of his willingness to meet a key Syrian demand for peace.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak told his Cabinet that four Israeli prime ministers effectively agreed
to withdraw from the Golan if certain conditions were fulfilled, his office
said. The current Israeli government will not ignore the negotiations that have
taken place directly and through mediators since 1991, Barak told the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli officials had in the past denied that such commitments were made,
saying that previous offers for a withdrawal were hypothetical. Barak's
admission appeared designed to boost his credibility ahead of concessions to
Syria by assuring Israelis that other leaders had also agreed to return the
Golan.
</P>
<P>
	   Any withdrawal must be approved by a national referendum, and polls show
Israelis divided over the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and an aide to former Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, both from the hawkish Likud party, denied Sunday that they
had ever agreed to a full Israeli withdrawal. Netanyahu has refuted documents
published in Israeli newspapers outlining his alleged commitment, in secret
negotiations, to return the entire plateau.
</P>
<P>
	   The most recent attempt at Israeli-Syrian peace talks broke off last month
in deadlock over the heights. Syria insisted that Israel give assurances that it
would withdraw from the Golan, captured in the 1967 Mideast War, and turn over
land extending down to the Sea of Galilee.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel refused to make such a pledge and insisted that the issues of
security arrangements and normalization be spelled out first.
</P>
<P>
	   Even though Barak did not state his position on the exact borders of a
withdrawal from the Golan, Housing Minister Yitzhak Levy said it was obvious to
all those present what he meant.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's no doubt that everyone is talking about a full withdrawal from the
Golan Heights,'' Levy told Israel's Channel Two TV.
</P>
<P>
	   The only question remaining was whether Israel would agree to return land
that would give Syria access to the Sea of Galilee, Israel's main source of
drinking water, Levy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel's Channel Two TV said that Barak would condition a withdrawal on
arrangements for water use and an early warning station that would give Israel
at least 20 hours notice of an impending Syrian attack.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak also indicated in the seven-hour meeting that Israel may withdraw
troops from south Lebanon without security arrangements with Syria -- the main
power broker in Lebanon -- if the sides are unable to reach a peace accord
before Barak's self-imposed deadline of July.
</P>
<P>
	   But Barak told his ministers he would prefer to leave Lebanon with an
agreement with Syria, his office said.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel has transferred about $87 million to the army in recent days to
prepare for a withdrawal from Lebanon, Israel TV reported Sunday. The army has
been building fortifications in northern Israel designed to protect residents
from possible cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli warplanes attacked southern Lebanon on Sunday, apparently targeting
Hezbollah guerrillas who had detonated a roadside bomb that injured three
Israeli-allied militiaman, Lebanese security officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, recent remarks by Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy -- that
Israel would make Lebanon pay for guerrilla attacks ``child for child'' --
prompted Lebanese TV stations to air a commercial comparing Levy to Adolf
Hitler. Levy's remarks drew protests from throughout the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Sunday, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak held separate talks with
Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Both
sides have sought outside help in resolving the stalemate in the
Israel-Palestinian peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Tijuana Police Chief Slain  </HEADLINE>
   By BEN FOX Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) -- Assailants shot and killed Tijuana's police chief
Sunday, pumping more than 100 shots into his car as he drove along a busy
highway.
</P>
<P>
	   Alfredo de la Torre, in charge of the police force in this violent border
town since 1998, was pronounced dead at the scene, said Enrique Tellaeche, a
spokesman for the Baja California state attorney general's office in Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of investigators combed the city and interviewed witnesses, but no
one had been arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was well-known and well-liked. We didn't know he was having any
problems with anyone,'' Tellaeche said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tijuana Mayor Francisco Vega de la Madrid issued a statement expressing his
indignation and urging investigators to get to the bottom of the case. He also
appointed an interim chief, Tijuana police Commander Carlos Besneyrigoyen.
</P>
<P>
	   Torre was attacked as he drove home from Mass, unaccompanied by his
bodyguards, on a three-lane highway that runs along the northern edge of
Tijuana, Tellaeche said.
</P>
<P>
	   Riddled with bullet holes, his black Chevy Suburban with tinted windows
crashed into a palm tree on the side of the road, Tellaeche said.
</P>
<P>
	   The windshield bore more than a dozen bullet holes and the three windows on
the driver's side had been shot out, as was the front window on the passenger
side.
</P>
<P>
	   Government news agency Notimex reported that there were four assailants, but
investigators said they were unsure of the number of attackers.
</P>
<P>
	   Tijuana, a gritty metropolis of 1.2 million people in northwestern Mexico
across the border from San Diego, California, has been plagued by waves of
violence stemming from drug and arms smuggling, and involving undocumented
workers.
</P>
<P>
	   The city, home to the busiest border crossing on Earth, is one of the main
ports of entry for drugs heading into the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   De la Torre, who had a long career in law enforcement, was the former
director of the state penitentiary in Tijuana.

<HEADLINE> Albright Eyed As Czech President  </HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. MANN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Madeleine Albright, America's Czech-born secretary of
state, returns next week to her homeland, where there is talk she might seek the
presidency of the East European nation after her tour in Washington ends.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Czechs are speaking of her as a possible successor to President Vaclav
Havel, who must retire in 2002. Havel, a playwright-turned-politician helped
lead the ``Velvet Revolution'' that in 1989 persuaded communist rulers to
resign.
</P>
<P>
	   He has openly talked about the possibility of Albright succeeding him.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Zantovsky, former Czech ambassador to Washington, said Sunday in
Prague that he met last week with Havel and discussed, among other things, the
possibility that Albright might run to succeed Havel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I never made it a secret that I think that Madeleine Albright could, one
day in the future, play a big role in Czech politics,'' Zantovsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   He stressed that the idea is not new and that it would not dominate
Albright's agenda in the Czech Republic next week.
</P>
<P>
	   In Prague, Havel's chief policy adviser, Pavel Fischer, told Time magazine:
``It is not impossible that they will talk about this.''
</P>
<P>
	   The secretary of state has not publicly discussed her future plans. In its
new issue, Time quoted unidentified sources as saying she ``has begun to
consider the possibility of running.''
</P>
<P>
	   However, Albright spokesman James P. Rubin dismissed the notion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``From time to time senior Czech officials have approached the secretary
about this possibility. She has dismissed it although she is certainly flattered
that Czechs would consider her for the post of president of her native land,''
Rubin said Sunday. ``She has never given this any serious consideration.''
</P>
<P>
	   Albright's March 5-8 visit coincides with the commemoration of the 150th
anniversary of the birth of national hero Tomas Masaryk, who served as the first
president of the Czechoslovak Republic after the collapse of Austria-Hungary in
1918.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright's visit will have some trappings of a political barnstorming tour.
She will receive a gold medal from Masaryk University in Brno and will go to
Masaryk's birthplace at Hodonin. She will lay a wreath at his tomb in Lany, west
of Prague, and go to the capital to unveil a Masaryk statue.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright's maiden name is Marie Korbelova. Her father was a Czech diplomat
who took his family to London as Germany took over their homeland at the start
of World War II. The family then moved to Denver in 1948 rather than serve under
a communist Czechoslovakian government.
</P>
<P>
	   In an unscientific poll, published by Lidove Noviny, the leading daily
newspaper in Prague, Albright was listed among the greatest living Czechs. Havel
was first. The poll, taken in March 1999, preceded NATO's war in Kosovo, which
was widely unpopular among Czechs.
</P>
<P>
	   Havel first brought up the presidency idea in 1998. After returning to
Prague from an official visit to the United States, he expressed regret that he
hadn't asked whether she would be available to succeed him. ``It occurred to me
on the plane on my way back home,'' Havel said, ``so I did not have the chance
to ask her.''
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Constitution bars Albright or any other alien-born citizen from the
American presidency, but there appears to be no legal bar to keep an American
from assuming the presidency of another country.
</P>
<P>
	   Other naturalized citizens have served in foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
	   Lithuania's current president, Valdas Adamkus, is a former U.S. government
bureaucrat. Yugoslavia's former prime minister, American Milan Panic, was a
California millionaire before returning to his homeland and was barred by a
technicality from running against the President Slobodan Milosevic in 1992. In
Israel, Golda Meir moved from a Milwaukee classroom to become the prime minister
who led Israel to victory in the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
	   And the Czechs already have had an American woman living in their
president's house: Masaryk's wife, Charlotte Garrigue.

<HEADLINE> US Recalls Defective Warfare Suits  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN M. DONNELLY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon has alerted U.S. facilities around the world
that hundreds of thousands of protective suits meant to shield GIs from gas and
germ attack may have holes and other critical defects, according to military
officials and documents.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon learned about the flaws five years ago but did not consider the
problems crucial and needed the gear for U.S. peacekeeping troops in Bosnia,
criminal investigators say. Not until late last year did a second study on the
same suits judge identical flaws grave enough to warrant a global warning, the
investigators said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   On Feb. 9, the Pentagon cautioned commanders not to use any of the 778,000
suits except in training. The suits, not all of which are defective, cost the
government almost $49 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The defects included ``cuts, holes, embedded foreign matter and stitching
irregularities,'' the Pentagon inspector general said in a report being released
this week. The defects potentially could kill people wearing the trousers and
jackets in a ``chemical-biological contaminated environment,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   A bankrupt New York City-based company, which the inspector general
identified as Istratex, produced the charcoal-lined camouflage suits under two
contracts dating from 1989. Soldiers wear the suits over their regular
camouflage gear where chemical or biological weapons might be used. It was
unclear whether any of the suits were worn by troops in the 1990-91 Desert
Shield-Desert Storm operation, when Iraqi chemical attack was considered likely.
</P>
<P>
	   Last May, the Justice Department indicted various company officials on
charges including conspiracy to defraud the Pentagon, major fraud and making
false claims. They all later pleaded guilty to lessor charges.
</P>
<P>
	   In September 1999, Istratex's president and production manager each pleaded
guilty in U.S. District Court in New York to one count of making false
statements. Two other company officials pleaded guilty to making false
certificate or writing and a fifth official pleaded guilty to obstruction of
justice. Sentencings are expected in the spring.
</P>
<P>
	   Pentagon criminal investigators said they pointed out to the Defense
Logistics Agency, which manages inventories, problems with some of the
``battle-dress overgarments'' in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996, the agency's testers, at the investigators' request, studied 500 of
the suits and found defects in 174, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Defense Logistics Agency identified the problems as major but not
``safety-of-life critical defects,'' said Mitchell Schlitt, the case agent for
the inspector general's Defense Criminal Investigative Service in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So because of a need for these suits for the Bosnia action, they stated a
need to retain these in stock,'' Schlitt said.
</P>
<P>
	   Three years later, last September, the criminal investigators asked for new
tests, this time by Army designers of the suit, Schlitt said. Examining the same
suits, the new team found the defects were in fact critical.
</P>
<P>
	   By regulation, Schlitt said, a critical defect, unlike a major one, is so
severe that finding one such problem in a single suit warrants stopping use of
the whole lot.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the military standard, a critical flaw is one that ``would
result in hazardous or unsafe conditions or ... is likely to prevent performance
of the tactical function.'' By comparision, the official standard says a major
defect is not much better: It is ``likely to result in failure or to reduce
materially the usability of the ... product.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Istratex executives' guilty pleas were to prosecution allegations that
the company intentionally manufactured faulty gear, then duped government
inspectors by clandestinely switching small quantities of well-made garments for
flawed ones during inspections. Sentencing is set for April, and the executives
face jail terms and fines.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigators examined suits only from one contract for 173,000 suits.
The second contract covered the remaining approximately 605,000 suits, but the
prosecutors did not examine those. Still, the Pentagon's alert warns U.S. forces
that defective suits might be found among all 778,000 made under the two deals.
</P>
<P>
	   The Defense Logistics Agency found 334,000 suits at its depot in Albany,
Ga., that are ``potentially deficient and attributable to the manufacturer in
question,'' said Gerda Parr, an agency spokeswoman. That leaves 444,000 suits
made by Istratex.
</P>
<P>
	   James Kornides, the top auditor on the case, believes many of the suits were
deployed to far-flung places. ``That's why we wanted them to ... alert the
operational units that those suits could be defective,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   His audit found the Georgia depot, which stores much of the military's
chemical-protective gear, not only did not know if it held flawed suits but also
didn't know how many suits it had at all. In the case of one type of garment,
the depot had overstated the inventory by 31,277 suits.

<HEADLINE> Bradley, Gore stump in Washington state  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SEATTLE (AP) - A come-from-behind win in a game of pickup basketball at
a youth center Sunday gave a lift to Bill Bradley's underdog Democratic
presidential campaign.
<P>
	   His team at the Boys and Girls Club in nearby Bellevue defeated one coached
by former Seattle Sonics player Jack Sikma, 11-9.
</P>
<P>
	   "As Jack said, that was a good omen," said Bradley, himself a former NBA
player.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley has been campaigning in Washington state since Wednesday, looking
for a win in the state's presidential primary on Tuesday. The irony, though, is
that victory here will offer neither Bradley nor Vice President Al Gore a
tangible boost toward the nomination. No delegates will be Tuesday; they will be
apportioned based on party caucuses one week later.
</P>
<P>
	   "If I can do well in the primary on Tuesday, I think it will help me with
delegates a week later here in Washington and also across the country," Bradley
said on ABC's "This Week."
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, meanwhile, campaigned at Seattle's Franklin High School, where he
turned a local family into a symbol of his argument for legislation giving
patients stronger appeal rights when their HMOs deny coverage of medical
treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   The 500 or so supporters were kept waiting in the gymnasium for about an
hour while Gore met privately at his hotel with Dylan and Christine Malone from
Everett.
</P>
<P>
	   The Malones' health insurance company, Aetna, has decided to stop paying for
home nursing care for their 6-month-old son Ian, who must be fed through a
stomach tube and have his lungs suctioned hourly because of a birth trauma.
</P>
<P>
	   In his campaign speech, Gore railed at Aetna: "Don't do this. Don't cut this
child's coverage."
</P>
<P>
	   "Give 'em Hell, Al!" called out one man in the gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
	   Privately, Gore promised the Malones to contact Aetna himself. Dylan was a
volunteer for Gore's 1988 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley drew applause from a predominantly black congregation at First
African Methodist Episcopal Church in Seattle when he said the race issue was a
moral concern, not a political one.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you share my dream for America, then I want to say, "Come with me,"'
Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Afterward, he told the packed gymnasium, where he had changed into a T-shirt
and sweat pants for the ball game, that he was fighting against entrenched
power.
</P>
<P>
	   "I want to say to the kids, 'Keep working.' I want to say to all of you, 'I
need you on Tuesday."'
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley picked up newspaper endorsements Sunday from The Hartford Courant
and The Maine Sunday Telegram and was attending a rally in Vancouver before
discussing the campaign on America Online. Gore, who was heading to Denver, was
endorsed by The Sun of Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's one cutting swipe Sunday at Bradley followed a more elaborate assault
late Saturday before loyalists at a state Democratic Party chili fest. There,
Gore said he wanted a "clear and decisive" verdict from Tuesday's nonbinding
primary, and he accused Bradley of trying to sink the Democratic Party in "a
cauldron of wedge issues and phony labels."
</P>
<P>
	   In his stump speeches and advertising, Bradley has been scrutinizing Gore's
past record against abortion rights and gun control.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, Karen Cooper, head of the Washington affiliate of the National
Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, appeared with Gore at Franklin
to give him the league's "resounding endorsement."
</P>
<P>
	   Anita Dunn, a top Bradley adviser who resigned her consultancy with NARAL
when the national office endorsed Gore this month, said the affiliate's nod came
after a Saturday vote in which Bradley supporters on the local board were not
allowed to vote by proxy.
</P>
<P>
	   Cooper acknowledged that the early, primary-season nod was unprecedented and
was approved by voice vote.
</P>
<P>
	   "The people at the meeting all realized it's very important that we don't go
into the November election with people thinking Al Gore is anything but strongly
pro-choice," Cooper told a reporter.

<HEADLINE> Bradley, Gore Stump in Wash. State  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM COUR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- A come-from-behind win in a game of pickup basketball at a
youth center Sunday gave a lift to Bill Bradley's underdog Democratic
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   His team at the Boys and Girls Club in nearby Bellevue defeated one coached
by former Seattle Sonics player Jack Sikma, 11-9.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As Jack said, that was a good omen,'' said Bradley, himself a former NBA
player.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley has been campaigning in Washington state since Wednesday, looking
for a win in the state's presidential primary on Tuesday. The irony, though, is
that victory here will offer neither Bradley nor Vice President Al Gore a
tangible boost toward the nomination. No delegates will be Tuesday; they will be
apportioned based on party caucuses one week later.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If I can do well in the primary on Tuesday, I think it will help me with
delegates a week later here in Washington and also across the country,'' Bradley
said on ABC's ``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, meanwhile, campaigned at Seattle's Franklin High School, where he
turned a local family into a symbol of his argument for legislation giving
patients stronger appeal rights when their HMOs deny coverage of medical
treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   The 500 or so supporters were kept waiting in the gymnasium for about an
hour while Gore met privately at his hotel with Dylan and Christine Malone from
Everett.
</P>
<P>
	   The Malones' health insurance company, Aetna, has decided to stop paying for
home nursing care for their 6-month-old son Ian, who must be fed through a
stomach tube and have his lungs suctioned hourly because of a birth trauma.
</P>
<P>
	   In his campaign speech, Gore railed at Aetna: ``Don't do this. Don't cut
this child's coverage.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Give 'em Hell, Al!'' called out one man in the gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
	   Privately, Gore promised the Malones to contact Aetna himself. Dylan was a
volunteer for Gore's 1988 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley drew applause from a predominantly black congregation at First
African Methodist Episcopal Church in Seattle when he said the race issue was a
moral concern, not a political one.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you share my dream for America, then I want to say, ``Come with me,'''
Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Afterward, he told the packed gymnasium, where he had changed into a T-shirt
and sweat pants for the ball game, that he was fighting against entrenched
power.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to say to the kids, 'Keep working.' I want to say to all of you, 'I
need you on Tuesday.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley picked up newspaper endorsements Sunday from The Hartford Courant
and The Maine Sunday Telegram and was attending a rally in Vancouver before
discussing the campaign on America Online. Gore, who was heading to Denver, was
endorsed by The Sun of Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's one cutting swipe Sunday at Bradley followed a more elaborate assault
late Saturday before loyalists at a state Democratic Party chili fest. There,
Gore said he wanted a ``clear and decisive'' verdict from Tuesday's nonbinding
primary, and he accused Bradley of trying to sink the Democratic Party in ``a
cauldron of wedge issues and phony labels.''
</P>
<P>
	   In his stump speeches and advertising, Bradley has been scrutinizing Gore's
past record against abortion rights and gun control.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, Karen Cooper, head of the Washington affiliate of the National
Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, appeared with Gore at Franklin
to give him the league's ``resounding endorsement.''
</P>
<P>
	   Anita Dunn, a top Bradley adviser who resigned her consultancy with NARAL
when the national office endorsed Gore this month, said the affiliate's nod came
after a Saturday vote in which Bradley supporters on the local board were not
allowed to vote by proxy.
</P>
<P>
	   Cooper acknowledged that the early, primary-season nod was unprecedented and
was approved by voice vote.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The people at the meeting all realized it's very important that we don't
go into the November election with people thinking Al Gore is anything but
strongly pro-choice,'' Cooper told a reporter.

<HEADLINE> Midwest Airlines Ratifies Contract  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Midwest Express Airlines pilots on Sunday ratified a
five-year contract, the airline said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Milwaukee-based airline said in a written statement it was contacted by
the Air Line Pilots Association at 4 p.m. about the ratification of the
contract.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal gives pilots higher pay, retiree health insurance and a retirement
plan "that will protect and enhance the careers of our pilots," strike committee
chairman Karl Petersen said after the agreement was announced earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
	   No other details of the deal have been released.
</P>
<P>
	   After 19 months of talks, Midwest Express avoided a strike deadline when
both sides reached an agreement early Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm very pleased that our pilots feel the agreement formed under the
collective bargaining process is a fair one," said David Reeve, senior vice
president of operations. "Both sides have worked very hard to reach an agreement
that meets the needs of all -- our employees, our customers and our
shareholders."
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association could not be reached for
comment Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Union officials held information meetings for pilots in Milwaukee and Omaha,
Neb., last week, said Hal Myers, a spokesman for the pilots association.
</P>
<P>
	   The 16-year-old airline employs nearly 2,800 people, 80 percent of them in
Milwaukee. Midwest Express averages 130 daily flights to 31 cities, including
Boston, Los Angeles, New York and Philadelphia.

<HEADLINE> Indian Co. Buys Tetley Tea Maker  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- The Indian company Tata Tea Ltd. has bought the Tetley Group,
maker of the second-biggest brand of teabags in the world, for $433.6 million,
Tetley announced Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Tata Tea, part of the Tata Group, is the largest integrated tea company in
the world, with additional interests in coffee and spices. The two companies
were already working together through a joint venture, Tata Tetley, which
manufactures tea bags in India.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal, set to be completed in March, would be the largest overseas
acquisition undertaken by an Indian company, the Financial Times newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This will result in a new agenda for aggressive growth and expansion
worldwide, including new territories and product categories for both Tata Tea
Ltd. and the Tetley Group," the companies said in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Tata Group has expressed total confidence in the Tetley management
team, which will be retained," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tetley Group was created in 1995 by a management buy-in from the
previous owners, Allied Domecq PLC.
</P>
<P>
	   Following a failed attempt to float Tetley as a separate company in 1998,
Tetley received approaches from Tata and from Sara Lee Corp. about acquiring the
tea brand.
</P>
<P>
	   Tata, India's biggest plantation group, said it was keen to acquire an
international brand as a key to expanding its markets internationally and to
compete with the market leader, Unilever.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a daring attempt to secure global leadership for Indian tea. It
will, for the first time, bridge the historic gap between producer countries and
consuming countries," said R.K. Krishna Kumar, vice chairman of Tata Tea, in an
interview with the Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal gives Tata, which has a 23 percent share of India's tea market, a
global brand with which to penetrate markets in the Middle East, Iran, Russia
and Japan. However the most attractive market is still the United States, where
Tata said it has 24 percent of the instant tea market, the newspaper
said.

<HEADLINE> Israel To Release Eichmann Memoirs  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE COPANS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel announced Sunday that it will release the memoirs
of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann and offer them in defense of an American
professor facing a libel suit for accusing a British writer of denying the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel will give the public access to the 1,300-page, handwritten papers,
penned in an Israeli prison and kept under wraps for nearly 40 years, the
Justice Ministry said in a statement. In the memoirs, the overseer of the Nazi
death machine reportedly says the mass killing of Jews during the Holocaust was
the worst crime in human history.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel had agreed in August to publish the diary after one of Eichmann's
sons, Dieter, threatened legal action to claim the book as family property. Only
a few scholars have seen it.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli officials had originally planned to compile the papers and let a
German research institution prepare them for scholarly publication. The
publication of the uncensored, untranslated memoirs has been a key demand of
Holocaust historians.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the decision Sunday by Israeli Attorney General Elyakim
Rubinstein, the public will be allowed to obtain typed versions of the memoirs
and view the original, handwritten notes in the state archive, subject to
conditions set by archive officials.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It has been decided that there is importance, as part of the historical
commitment of the state of Israel, to let the memoirs be viewed by the public,''
read the release. The diary was expected to be released in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
	   A copy will also be given to American author Deborah Lipstadt ``in her
defense of a suit by a Holocaust denier,'' read the statement, released after a
meeting of top judges, legal officials and historians at Rubinstein's office.
</P>
<P>
	   British writer David Irving is suing Lipstadt for libel in Britain for
writing in a 1994 book that he denied the Holocaust and distorted the truth of
what happened in World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   Irving says he does not deny that Jews were killed by the Nazis, but
challenges the number and manner of Jewish concentration camp deaths.
</P>
<P>
	   Under British law, a libel claimant only needs to prove that his reputation
has been damaged. Truth is not necessarily a defense.
</P>
<P>
	   Lipstadt, a professor at Emory University in Atlanta, and her co-defendant,
Penguin Books, deny libel.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel hopes that publication of the memoirs will reveal proof of the Nazi
machine to disprove Irving's case. Irving has in the trial disputed
historically-accepted witness accounts that hundreds of thousands were gassed to
death at Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
	   Eichmann wrote the diary while in jail from 1961 to 1962, after Israeli
agents captured him in Argentina and brought him to trial in Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   In what appeared to be a first draft of the diary, 127 pages sent to Germany
after Eichmann's execution and released last year include complaints about an
unfairly strict upbringing, descriptions of his inability to disobey an order
and thoughts on the meaning of life.
</P>
<P>
	   Eichmann wrote in the final copy that the killing of the Jews was the worst
crime in the history of mankind, Israel radio reported. Scholars who have seen
the memoir say that it repeats arguments Eichmann made at his trial, insisting
that he was only a midlevel official following orders.

<HEADLINE> Will Farrakhan Unite Muslims?  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTHA IRVINE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan on Sunday reaffirmed
his pledge to reconcile his breakaway movement with orthodox Muslims, trying to
fulfill the expectations of millions of mainstream worshippers.
</P>
<P>
	   Farrakhan used the occasion of the Nation's most important annual gathering,
Saviour's Day, to embrace W. Deen Mohammed, the leader of the orthodox Muslim
American Society and the son of the late Elijah Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He and I will be together,'' Farrakhan said of Mohammed. ``Not for evil
but for love -- not for hatred, but in good.''
</P>
<P>
	   Before Sunday's rally, W. Deen Mohammed had made clear what orthodox Muslims
nationwide expected: a different Farrakhan. And Farrakhan spoke directly to the
expectation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Has Farrakhan abandoned us? Has Farrakhan changed?'' Farrakhan asked the
audience of more than 20,000. ``Yeah, I have. Everybody should be changing ...
but I haven't abandoned you.''
</P>
<P>
	   The speech was regarded as one that could make or break Farrakhan's
fledgling vow to reconcile with other orthodox Muslims.
</P>
<P>
	   Farrakhan had joined with Mohammed at traditional prayers on Friday -- the
25th anniversary of the death of Elijah, whose legacy Farrakhan and Mohammed
have struggled over.
</P>
<P>
	   Elijah led the Nation of Islam for decades, but after his death in 1975, his
son led the movement toward orthodoxy. In 1978, Farrakhan broke away to revive
Elijah's teachings under the old Nation of Islam name.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Nation's theology, Elijah's teacher in the 1930s, W. D. Fard of
Detroit, was given divine status and Elijah was the final prophet to mankind.
Orthodox Muslims believe the final prophet was Mohammed of Mecca, who founded
Islam in the seventh century.
</P>
<P>
	   At that prayer service, Farrakhan and W. Deen Mohammed both vowed to bury
their differences and work together to unite U.S. Muslims.
</P>
<P>
	   Nation of Islam leaders, including Farrakhan's chief of staff, Leonard
Muhammad, have insisted that the move toward unification is not new.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past few years, Farrakhan has instituted the traditional Friday
prayers, observed by millions of orthodox Muslims worldwide, and the Nation of
Islam also now observes Ramadan, a period of fasting.
</P>
<P>
	   Perhaps most important to orthodox Muslims, Leonard Muhammad says that all
Nation of Islam followers now adhere to the Muslim creed: ``There is no God but
Allah and Mohammed is his messenger.''
</P>
<P>
	   That suggests Elijah wouldn't be regarded as the final prophet by Nation of
Islam members -- which Farrakhan confirmed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I love prophet Mohammed,'' he said. ``I know that he is the end of the
prophets. ... But I don't think Allah would be pleased with me if I disrespected
(Elijah Muhammad).''
</P>
<P>
	   Lawrence Mamiya, a Vassar College expert on black American religions,
conservatively estimates the core membership of the Nation of Islam to be 50,000
to 100,000. He said W. Deen Mohammed's group, the Muslim American Society, has
about 200,000 core members. The overall following is thought to be much higher
for both.
</P>
<P>
	   W. Deen, who planned to give short remarks at Sunday's gathering, had said
he would carefully monitor Farrakhan's words -- in part listening to make sure
he avoids anti-white and anti-Semitic comments.
</P>
<P>
	   One Nation of Islam observer said he believes the 66-year-old Farrakhan will
continue with the calls for racial and religious unity he has made since his
``near death experience'' last year while being treated for prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's thinking about his legacy, and I don't think he wants to leave with
the idea that he was a hate monger,'' said Salim Muwakkil, a former Nation of
Islam member who is now editor of the Chicago-based political journal In These
Times.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The illness provided him with a very good excuse to be more forthright in
his alterations of the doctrine,'' Muwakkil said. ``Before, he had to do it
incrementally, as if he were taking baby steps.''
</P>
<P>
	   Also scheduled to speak Sunday was Rabbi Yisroel Dovid Weiss, a leader of
the Neturei Karta International orthodox Jewish community. Farrakhan met with
leaders of the group last fall in a move that he said was proof of his wish to
reconcile not only with Muslims but also with Jews.
</P>
<P>
	   But Jewish leaders, still seething over Farrakhan's past comments --
including calling Judaism a ``gutter religion'' -- remained cautious.
</P>
<P>
	   Chicago Rabbi Ira Youdovin said the Neturei Karta was an ``extreme, extreme
ultra orthodox wing of the Jewish community'' that opposes the current existence
of the state of Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the maximum that can be hoped for from Farrakhan is some sort of a
truce,'' said Youdovin, executive vice president of the Chicago Board of Rabbis,
a group that represents 220 rabbis throughout the Chicago area.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's no possibility of him accumulating the credibility given the
things he's said,'' Youdovin added. ``You can't just wipe the slate clean.''

<HEADLINE> In pulpits and streets, appeals for justice and change  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - New demands for social justice, law enforcement reforms
and a federal inquiry echoed from pulpits and city streets on Sunday in the
aftermath of the acquittal of four police officers in the shooting death of
Amadou Diallo.
<P>
	   More than 1,000 people joined a peaceful prayer vigil outside the United
Nations, where activist Rev. Al Sharpton hoped to bring the Diallo case to
international attention. Afterward, about 450 people - accompanied by a phalanx
of police - marched through the streets of Manhattan before ending early Sunday
evening at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
	   "We hope to express our feelings - I must see justice done," said marcher
Omar Jalloh, who carried a sign that stated "Guiliani you're a tragedy."
</P>
<P>
	   The march was similar to Saturday's protest, although it was smaller and not
nearly as tense. Police said no arrests were reported, but at least one of the
protesters was issued a summons for using a megaphone.
</P>
<P>
	   During the vigil, Sharpton said the shooting victim "could have been one of
these ambassadors."
</P>
<P>
	   He added that he was "calling for another jury to hear evidence" on the
policies of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. "Come November, the jury is going to render
its decision," he said, referring to Giuliani's probable run for the U.S.
Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton also called for people to "hold their wallets," as Diallo was doing
when he was shot. The officers have said they mistook the wallet for a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're going to boycott in this city," he said. "We are afraid to spend
money with certain people because we are considered suspects. Let's hold our
wallets, let's hold our wallets."
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Sharpton's spokeswoman, Rachel Noerdlinger, said Sharpton and his
National Action Network are investigating which companies contribute to the
Patrolmen's Benevolent Association. The PBA helped finance the defense for the
officers. Later this week, Sharpton will release the names of the companies and
ask citizens to boycott them, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo's father, Saikou Diallo, Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., and former
Mayor David Dinkins also spoke at the rally, where a few people wore signs
reading "Go ahead and shoot. I'm black so it must be justified."
</P>
<P>
	   In what was billed as a day of prayer, political leaders and activists
criticized the verdict as inappropriate for a case in which police fired 41
bullets and hit the African immigrant 19 times, only to discover afterward that
he was unarmed.
</P>
<P>
	   The four officers, acquitted of second-degree murder and lesser charges by a
jury in Albany on Friday, still face a departmental inquiry and possibly federal
charges if Attorney General Janet Reno finds evidence that Diallo's civil rights
were violated.
</P>
<P>
	   At St. Patrick's Cathedral, Auxiliary Bishop James McCarthy, filling in for
an ailing Cardinal John O'Connor, told parishioners Diallo's death should cause
people to "re-examine our own tendencies toward violence, toward fear, and
perhaps toward prejudice - racial prejudice at that."
</P>
<P>
	   Rev. Calvin Butts, pastor of Harlem's Abyssinian Baptist Church, urged his
followers to vote against Giuliani, saying the mayor had failed to thank him for
urging calm in the wake of the Diallo incident a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not blaming Giuliani for pulling the trigger but for creating a climate
that's divisive," Butts said in a telephone interview. "And I'm not calling for
calm. I think black people ought to be agitated, they ought to be active."
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani spokesman Bruce Teitelbaum questioned the reverend's motives,
saying he had "hugged Mayor Giuliani" at an interfaith service at St. Patrick's
soon after the shooting, and "now he is exploiting Amadou Diallo's death for
partisan political reasons."
</P>
<P>
	   City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, speaking at Harlem's Bethel AME church,
said that to make sure Diallo's death was not in vain, the police department
needed to continue making "fundamental, meaningful change, so that people aren't
afraid that the police are going to shoot them."
</P>
<P>
	   Vallone, a Democrat, said the city council had budgeted funds for that
purpose, and "even the mayor is recognizing that changes have to be made."
</P>
<P>
	   Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union,
told 200 parishioners at a Congregational church in Queens that the Diallo case
was giving new impetus to his group's proposals for police misconduct reform.
</P>
<P>
	   Key provisions of the plan would make federal and state funding for local
police contingent on the police meeting strict performance standards in
community relations and create a permanent special prosecutor to handle police
brutality incidents.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to seeking a criminal investigation to determine whether
Diallo's civil rights were violated, he said the NYCLU intends to sue the city
on grounds that poor training and racial stereotyping led to the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Sunday, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, seeking the Democratic
nomination for U.S. Senate, urged New Yorkers not to let the verdict divide
them. She said the case underscores the need for a police force reflective of
the city's ethnic diversity and for "community policing."
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever the result of a Justice Department inquiry, "we must reach across
those lines of mistrust and division and join to ensure that no tragedy like
this ever happens again to anyone's son or daughter," she told several hundred
people at a national Dominican-American conference at City College.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton did not mention her Republican foe, but Teitelbaum criticized her
stand.
</P>
<P>
	   "Mrs. Clinton obviously is unaware that New York City recently spent over
$10 million on a new recruiting program designed to create a more diverse police
department (and)... the new police class will be the most diverse ever,"
Teitelbaum said.

<HEADLINE> Farrakhan seeks closer ties with orthodox Muslims  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CHICAGO (AP) - Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan on Sunday
reaffirmed his pledge to reconcile his breakaway movement with orthodox Muslims,
trying to fulfill the expectations of millions of mainstream worshippers.
<P>
	   Farrakhan used the occasion of the Nation's most important annual gathering,
Saviour's Day, to embrace W. Deen Mohammed, the leader of the orthodox Muslim
American Society and the son of the late Elijah Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
	   "He and I will be together," Farrakhan said of Mohammed. "Not for evil but
for love - not for hatred, but in good."
</P>
<P>
	   Before Sunday's rally, W. Deen Mohammed had made clear what orthodox Muslims
nationwide expected: a different Farrakhan. And Farrakhan spoke directly to the
expectation.
</P>
<P>
	   "Has Farrakhan abandoned us? Has Farrakhan changed?" Farrakhan asked the
audience of more than 20,000. "Yeah, I have. Everybody should be changing ...
but I haven't abandoned you."
</P>
<P>
	   The speech was regarded as one that could make or break Farrakhan's
fledgling vow to reconcile with other orthodox Muslims.
</P>
<P>
	   Farrakhan had joined with Mohammed at traditional prayers on Friday - the
25th anniversary of the death of Elijah, whose legacy Farrakhan and Mohammed
have struggled over.
</P>
<P>
	   Elijah led the Nation of Islam for decades, but after his death in 1975, his
son led the movement toward orthodoxy. In 1978, Farrakhan broke away to revive
Elijah's teachings under the old Nation of Islam name.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Nation's theology, Elijah's teacher in the 1930s, W. D. Fard of
Detroit, was given divine status and Elijah was the final prophet to mankind.
Orthodox Muslims believe the final prophet was Mohammed of Mecca, who founded
Islam in the seventh century.
</P>
<P>
	   At that prayer service, Farrakhan and W. Deen Mohammed both vowed to bury
their differences and work together to unite U.S. Muslims.
</P>
<P>
	   Nation of Islam leaders, including Farrakhan's chief of staff, Leonard
Muhammad, have insisted that the move toward unification is not new.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past few years, Farrakhan has instituted the traditional Friday
prayers, observed by millions of orthodox Muslims worldwide, and the Nation of
Islam also now observes Ramadan, a period of fasting.
</P>
<P>
	   Perhaps most important to orthodox Muslims, Leonard Muhammad says that all
Nation of Islam followers now adhere to the Muslim creed: "There is no God but
Allah and Mohammed is his messenger."
</P>
<P>
	   That suggests Elijah wouldn't be regarded as the final prophet by Nation of
Islam members - which Farrakhan confirmed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I love prophet Mohammed," he said. "I know that he is the end of the
prophets. ... But I don't think Allah would be pleased with me if I disrespected
(Elijah Muhammad)."
</P>
<P>
	   Lawrence Mamiya, a Vassar College expert on black American religions,
conservatively estimates the core membership of the Nation of Islam to be 50,000
to 100,000. He said W. Deen Mohammed's group, the Muslim American Society, has
about 200,000 core members. The overall following is thought to be much higher
for both.
</P>
<P>
	   W. Deen, who planned to give short remarks at Sunday's gathering, had said
he would carefully monitor Farrakhan's words - in part listening to make sure he
avoids anti-white and anti-Semitic comments.
</P>
<P>
	   One Nation of Islam observer said he believes the 66-year-old Farrakhan will
continue with the calls for racial and religious unity he has made since his
"near death experience" last year while being treated for prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's thinking about his legacy, and I don't think he wants to leave with
the idea that he was a hate monger," said Salim Muwakkil, a former Nation of
Islam member who is now editor of the Chicago-based political journal In These
Times.
</P>
<P>
	   "The illness provided him with a very good excuse to be more forthright in
his alterations of the doctrine," Muwakkil said. "Before, he had to do it
incrementally, as if he were taking baby steps."
</P>
<P>
	   Also scheduled to speak Sunday was Rabbi Yisroel Dovid Weiss, a leader of
the Neturei Karta International orthodox Jewish community. Farrakhan met with
leaders of the group last fall in a move that he said was proof of his wish to
reconcile not only with Muslims but also with Jews.
</P>
<P>
	   But Jewish leaders, still seething over Farrakhan's past comments -
including calling Judaism a "gutter religion" - remained cautious.
</P>
<P>
	   Chicago Rabbi Ira Youdovin said the Neturei Karta was an "extreme, extreme
ultra orthodox wing of the Jewish community" that opposes the current existence
of the state of Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the maximum that can be hoped for from Farrakhan is some sort of a
truce," said Youdovin, executive vice president of the Chicago Board of Rabbis,
a group that represents 220 rabbis throughout the Chicago area.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no possibility of him accumulating the credibility given the things
he's said," Youdovin added. "You can't just wipe the slate clean."

<HEADLINE> SUBS 14 graf, Bradley got, to CORRECT that Baltimore Sun  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SEATTLE (AP) - Democrat presidential hopeful Bill Bradley visited a
predominantly black church and shot baskets at a youth center Sunday, continuing
a Washington campaign swing that he hopes will carry him to victory in the
state's primary.
<P>
	   Bradley's pickup team at the Boys and Girls Club in nearby Bellevue beat a
team headed by former Seattle SuperSonics center Jack Sikma in a shooting
contest, 11-9.
</P>
<P>
	   "As Jack said, that was a good omen," said Bradley, a former NBA player. "I
came from behind to win."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley has been in Washington state since Wednesday, campaigning on both
sides of the Cascade Range in advance of the state's Tuesday primary. Analysts
have said Bradley needs a victory here to stay alive after a string of primary
defeats to Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   The irony, though, is that victory here will offer neither Democrat a
tangible boost toward the nomination. No delegates will be awarded in
Washington's Democrat primary; all delegates will be apportioned based on party
caucuses one week later.
</P>
<P>
	   At the First African Methodist Episcopal Church in the city's Capitol Hill
neighborhood, Bradley dealt head-on with the issue of race, getting applause
from the congregation when he said, "To me, the issue of race is not a political
issue; it's a moral issue."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley repeated his opposition to the Confederate flag flying over the
South Carolina statehouse and said he opposed Florida's new policy banning
affirmative action in state university admissions.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you share my dream for America, then I want to say, "Come with me,' "
Bradley told the church audience.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Boys and Girls Club, Bradley donned a T-shirt and warmup pants to
shoot baskets with club members.
</P>
<P>
	   Afterward, he told a packed gymnasium, "I'm fighting that trust can be
restored in our government. I'm fighting against entrenched power.
</P>
<P>
	   "I want to say to the kids, 'Keep working.' I want to say to all of you, "I
need you on Tuesday.' "
</P>
<P>
	   Later Sunday, Bradley planned to fly to Vancouver, Wash. - across the
Columbia River from Portland, Ore. - for a rally at a middle school.
</P>
<P>
	   The former New Jersey senator has courted black voters and labor groups -
both considered loyal to Gore - during his visit here. He's visited picket lines
in Seattle and Spokane and spoken to mostly black audiences at the AME church
and at an NAACP fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley got endorsements on Sunday from The Hartford Courant. Gore, who was
heading to Denver, was endorsed by The Sun of Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
	   The Seattle Times, which endorsed him last December, editorialized in
Sunday's editions: "Bradley has the dignity and grace to resist exploiting
emotional subjects. He does not wear his religious beliefs on his sleeve and
quietly describes abortion as a legal right and a private decision between a
woman and her doctor.
</P>
<P>
	   "These values and a confident demeanor should be well received here."

<HEADLINE> Israel Shows Signs of Flexibility  </HEADLINE>
   By SARI BASHI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak showed signs of
flexibility Sunday in part of a dispute that has deadlocked Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks and kept a U.S. mediator shuttling back and forth between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians, however, said that Israel's offers were still
unsatisfactory and that U.S. envoy Dennis Ross had so far failed to bridge the
gaps.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak dropped his insistence that an additional West Bank troop pullback be
folded into a final peace treaty, his office said. Barak told his Cabinet on
Sunday in comments released by his office that he was willing to set a date for
the pullback before hammering out the treaty, slated for September.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak was optimistic, his office said, telling ministers that the government
needs to ask the Israeli people if they are willing to make painful territorial
concessions ``so as not to control another people and not to be Belfast or
Bosnia.''
</P>
<P>
	   He met with Ross late Sunday night to discuss bridging proposals to end a
dispute over the location of an overdue troop withdrawal from 6.1 percent of the
West Bank, an Israeli official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Ross has been going back and forth between the two sides since arriving last
week. He was to meet Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Monday morning to
receive answers to Israeli proposals he had relayed, U.S. embassy spokesman
Larry Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat, returning from consultations in Cairo on Sunday, told reporters that
he wanted Ross to tell him ``what took place between him and the Israeli side
... in order to break out of this impasse in the talks.''
</P>
<P>
	   But senior Palestinian negotiator Yasser Abed Rabbo said Barak was ``trying
to waste time'' and had not brought any serious proposals. The Palestinians, he
said, would not compromise on their demand to receive Jerusalem suburbs as part
of the upcoming troop pullback. Barak has offered suburbs of the West Bank
cities of Ramallah and Hebron instead.
</P>
<P>
	   The two sides have already missed a Feb. 13 deadline for a framework
agreement for a final peace treaty, to address thorny issues like borders, the
fate of Palestinian refugees and the future of contested Jerusalem. Barak wants
to set a new date for the framework agreement, while the Palestinians want to go
negotiate directly for the treaty itself.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians have accused Barak of neglecting them in favor of peace
talks with Syria, a charge Barak denies.

<HEADLINE> Cubans Hold Rally for Expelled Envoy  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Shouting, ``Down with the lie!'' scores of teen-agers held a
pro-government rally Sunday outside the family home of a Cuban diplomat expelled
from the United States after he ignored a State Department demand to leave the
country.
</P>
<P>
	   Jose Imperatori, 46, was taken into custody by U.S. authorities and flown
aboard a U.S. government plane to Montreal on Saturday night. He had been
expected to leave Canada for Havana on Sunday, but his plans were not clear.
Even Imperatori's family said they weren't sure when he would arrive.
</P>
<P>
	   Watching the small demonstration of teen-agers waving Cuban flags outside
her white, two-story home in Havana's Vedado neighborhood, Imperatori's mother,
Matilde Garcia, said she looked forward to her son's arrival.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are absolutely fine and we are confident that everything will turn out
well,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   A statement read on government television Sunday indicated Imperatori would
likely be staying -- at least for now -- in Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   The Foreign Ministry late Saturday issued instructions to its diplomats in
the Canadian capital of Ottawa to seek a visa for Imperatori ``for the time
needed to find an honorable solution to the problem that has been created,'' the
statement said. In the meantime, Imperatori will continue a hunger strike in
Ottawa, which he traveled to shortly after arriving in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
	   Canadian Foreign Affairs spokesman Patrick Hebert said Sunday night that
Imperatori was still in Ottawa and would be leaving ``shortly.'' He would not be
more specific about when Imperatori would leave and to where he would be going.
</P>
<P>
	   Imperatori's wife, Raquel Fundora, and the couple's 3-year-old son had
returned to Havana on Friday night before their diplomatic immunity expired.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is incredible that a person who wants to demonstrate (his innocence)
... is not allowed to,'' Fundora said, referring to her husband's attempts to
prove he had done nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
	   Imperatori, accompanied by his lawyer, was escorted away from his suburban
Maryland apartment by FBI officials who turned up shortly after 8:30 p.m.
Saturday. The State Department said he was expelled for not voluntarily leaving
by the appointed time.
</P>
<P>
	   Late Saturday morning, Imperatori announced his plan to defy the State
Department expulsion order so he could contest allegations linking him with U.S.
immigration official Mariano Faget, who has been charged with spying for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I declare myself in a hunger strike until I have been absolutely cleared
of the accusations brought against me,'' Imperatori said several hours before
the State Department's deadline for him to depart the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban officials say that they believe the allegations are a smokescreen
erected to block the return of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Faget was arrested a few days before a scheduled court hearing on the
Gonzalez case, which was later postponed. The State Department has dismissed
such speculation as ``utter nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
	   The boy was rescued from the Florida straits in late November after his
mother and her boyfriend died, along with several other people, in an effort to
get from Cuba to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Whether Elian should be returned to Cuba or stay with relatives in Miami has
created an international furor.
</P>
<P>
	   Fernando Remirez, head of Cuba's diplomatic mission, acknowledged that
Imperatori had maintained contacts with Faget, but said they were no different
from the kinds of aboveboard relationships the mission maintains with many
Cuban-Americans and other Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday morning, Imperatori gave Remirez his resignation as consular
affairs officer, leaving him without diplomatic immunity before the 1:30 p.m.
Saturday deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Imperatori and Remirez have been adamant in their insistence that the
Cuban Interests Section does not engage in spying and is used solely for
improving relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   In their case against Faget, federal authorities said that 12 minutes after
they fed him phony information about a pending defection by a Cuban official,
they caught him passing it on to a contact with ties to the Cuban government.

<HEADLINE> Appeals for Change After Diallo Trial  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD PYLE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- New demands for social justice, law enforcement reforms and
a federal inquiry echoed from pulpits and city streets on Sunday in the
aftermath of the acquittal of four police officers in the shooting death of
Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 1,000 people joined a peaceful prayer vigil outside the United
Nations, where activist Rev. Al Sharpton hoped to bring the Diallo case to
international attention.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting victim ``could have been one of these ambassadors,'' said
Sharpton, who also said he was ``calling for another jury to hear evidence'' on
the policies of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Come November, the jury is going to render its decision,'' he said,
referring to Giuliani's probable run for the U.S. Senate against first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Some in the crowd wore signs reading: ``Go ahead and shoot. I'm black so it
must be justified.''
</P>
<P>
	   In what was billed as a day of prayer, political leaders and activists
joined Sharpton in criticizing the verdicts as inappropriate for a case in which
police fired 41 bullets and hit the West African immigrant 19 times, only to
discover afterward that he was unarmed.
</P>
<P>
	   Afterward, about 450 people -- accompanied by a phalanx of police -- marched
through the streets of Manhattan before ending early Sunday evening at City
Hall.
</P>
<P>
	   The four officers, acquitted of second-degree murder and lesser charges by a
jury in Albany on Friday, still face a departmental inquiry and possibly federal
charges if Attorney General Janet Reno finds evidence that Diallo's civil rights
were violated.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton's National Action Network is investigating what companies
contribute money to the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, which helped finance
the defense of the four officers in the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Later this week, Sharpton will release names of the companies and will ask
citizens to boycott the firms, said his spokeswoman, Rachel Noerdlinger.
</P>
<P>
	   At St. Patrick's Cathedral, Auxiliary Bishop James McCarthy, filling in for
an ailing Cardinal John O'Connor, told parishioners Diallo's death should cause
people to ``re-examine our own tendencies toward violence, toward fear, and
perhaps toward prejudice -- racial prejudice at that.''
</P>
<P>
	   City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, speaking at Harlem's Bethel AME church,
said that to make sure Diallo's death was not in vain, the police department
needed to continue to make ``fundamental, meaningful change, so that people
aren't afraid that the police are going to shoot them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union,
told 200 parishioners at a Congregational church in Queens that the Diallo case
was giving new impetus to his group's proposals for police misconduct reform.
</P>
<P>
	   The key provisions of the reforms would make federal and state funding for
local police contingent upon police meeting strict performance standards in
community relations and would name a permanent special prosecutor to handle
police brutality incidents.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to seeking a criminal investigation to determine whether
Diallo's civil rights were violated, Siegel said the NYCLU intends to sue the
city on grounds that poor training and racial stereotyping led to the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Hillary Rodham Clinton urged New Yorkers not to let the verdict divide them.
She said the case underscores the need for a police force reflective of the
city's ethnic diversity and for ``community policing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever the result of a Justice Department inquiry, ``We must reach across
those lines of mistrust and division and join to ensure that no tragedy like
this ever happens again to anyone's son or daughter,'' she told several hundred
people at a national conference of Dominican-Americans at City College of New
York.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton did not mention her opponent, Giuliani, who has been a main target
of protesters in the Diallo affair. Giuliani's campaign spokesman, Bruce
Teitelbaum, later criticized Clinton as uninformed.	   ``Mrs. Clinton obviously
is unaware that New York City recently spent over $10 million on a new
recruiting program designed to create a more diverse police department (and) ...
the new police class will be the most diverse ever,'' Teitelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Calvin Butts, pastor of Harlem's Abyssinian Baptist Church, urged
his followers to vote against Giuliani, saying the mayor had failed to thank him
for urging calm in the wake of the Diallo incident a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not blaming Giuliani for pulling the trigger but for creating a
climate that's divisive,'' Butts said in a telephone interview. ``And I'm not
calling for calm. I think black people ought to be agitated, they ought to be
active.''
</P>
<P>
	   Teitelbaum questioned the reverend's motives, saying he had ``hugged Mayor
Giuliani'' at an interfaith service soon after the shooting, and ``now he is
exploiting Amadou Diallo's death for partisan political reasons.''

Barak May Agree to Golan Withdrawal
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak suggested Sunday that he
would agree to a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights -- the clearest
indication yet of his willingness to meet a key Syrian demand for peace. Barak
told his Cabinet that four Israeli prime ministers effectively agreed to
withdraw from the Golan if certain conditions were fulfilled, his office said.
The current Israeli government will not ignore the negotiations that have taken
place directly and through mediators since 1991, Barak told the Cabinet. Israeli
officials had in the past denied that such commitments were made, saying that
previous offers for a withdrawal were hypothetical.

	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan today reaffirmed his
pledge to reconcile his breakaway movement with orthodox Muslims, trying to

the occasion of the Nation's most important annual gathering, Saviour's Day, to
embrace W. Deen Mohammed, the leader of the orthodox Muslim American Society and

<HEADLINE> Farrakhan Reaffirms Reconcile Vow  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTHA IRVINE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan on Sunday reaffirmed
his pledge to reconcile his breakaway movement with orthodox Muslims, trying to
fulfill the expectations of millions of mainstream worshippers.
</P>
<P>
	   Farrakhan used the occasion of the Nation's most important annual gathering,
Saviour's Day, to embrace W. Deen Mohammed, the leader of the orthodox Muslim
American Society and the son of the late Elijah Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He and I will be together,'' Farrakhan said of Mohammed. ``Not for evil
but for love -- not for hatred, but in good.''
</P>
<P>
	   Before Sunday's rally, W. Deen Mohammed had made clear what orthodox Muslims
nationwide expected: a different Farrakhan. And Farrakhan spoke directly to the
expectation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Has Farrakhan abandoned us? Has Farrakhan changed?'' Farrakhan asked the
audience of more than 20,000. ``Yeah, I have. Everybody should be changing ...
but I haven't abandoned you.''
</P>
<P>
	   The speech was regarded as one that could make or break Farrakhan's
fledgling vow to reconcile with other orthodox Muslims.
</P>
<P>
	   Farrakhan had joined with Mohammed at traditional prayers on Friday -- the
25th anniversary of the death of Elijah, whose legacy Farrakhan and Mohammed
have struggled over.
</P>
<P>
	   Elijah led the Nation of Islam for decades, but after his death in 1975, his
son led the movement toward orthodoxy. In 1978, Farrakhan broke away to revive
Elijah's teachings under the old Nation of Islam name.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Nation's theology, Elijah's teacher in the 1930s, W. D. Fard of
Detroit, was given divine status and Elijah was the final prophet to mankind.
Orthodox Muslims believe the final prophet was Mohammed of Mecca, who founded
Islam in the seventh century.
</P>
<P>
	   At that prayer service, Farrakhan and W. Deen Mohammed both vowed to bury
their differences and work together to unite U.S. Muslims.
</P>
<P>
	   Nation of Islam leaders, including Farrakhan's chief of staff, Leonard
Muhammad, have insisted that the move toward unification is not new.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past few years, Farrakhan has instituted the traditional Friday
prayers, observed by millions of orthodox Muslims worldwide, and the Nation of
Islam also now observes Ramadan, a period of fasting.
</P>
<P>
	   Perhaps most important to orthodox Muslims, Leonard Muhammad says that all
Nation of Islam followers now adhere to the Muslim creed: ``There is no God but
Allah and Mohammed is his messenger.''
</P>
<P>
	   That suggests Elijah wouldn't be regarded as the final prophet by Nation of
Islam members -- which Farrakhan confirmed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I love prophet Mohammed,'' he said. ``I know that he is the end of the
prophets. ... But I don't think Allah would be pleased with me if I disrespected
(Elijah Muhammad).''
</P>
<P>
	   Lawrence Mamiya, a Vassar College expert on black American religions,
conservatively estimates the core membership of the Nation of Islam to be 50,000
to 100,000. He said W. Deen Mohammed's group, the Muslim American Society, has
about 200,000 core members. The overall following is thought to be much higher
for both.
</P>
<P>
	   W. Deen, who planned to give short remarks at Sunday's gathering, had said
he would carefully monitor Farrakhan's words -- in part listening to make sure
he avoids anti-white and anti-Semitic comments.
</P>
<P>
	   One Nation of Islam observer said he believes the 66-year-old Farrakhan will
continue with the calls for racial and religious unity he has made since his
``near death experience'' last year while being treated for prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's thinking about his legacy, and I don't think he wants to leave with
the idea that he was a hate monger,'' said Salim Muwakkil, a former Nation of
Islam member who is now editor of the Chicago-based political journal In These
Times.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The illness provided him with a very good excuse to be more forthright in
his alterations of the doctrine,'' Muwakkil said. ``Before, he had to do it
incrementally, as if he were taking baby steps.''
</P>
<P>
	   Also scheduled to speak Sunday was Rabbi Yisroel Dovid Weiss, a leader of
the Neturei Karta International orthodox Jewish community. Farrakhan met with
leaders of the group last fall in a move that he said was proof of his wish to
reconcile not only with Muslims but also with Jews.
</P>
<P>
	   But Jewish leaders, still seething over Farrakhan's past comments --
including calling Judaism a ``gutter religion'' -- remained cautious.
</P>
<P>
	   Chicago Rabbi Ira Youdovin said the Neturei Karta was an ``extreme, extreme
ultra orthodox wing of the Jewish community'' that opposes the current existence
of the state of Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the maximum that can be hoped for from Farrakhan is some sort of a
truce,'' said Youdovin, executive vice president of the Chicago Board of Rabbis,
a group that represents 220 rabbis throughout the Chicago area.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's no possibility of him accumulating the credibility given the
things he's said,'' Youdovin added. ``You can't just wipe the slate clean.''

<HEADLINE> Lakers 101, Rockets 85  </HEADLINE>
    By JOHN NADEL AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- And now, the showdown.
</P>
<P>
	   Kobe Bryant scored 18 of his 31 points in the first 10 minutes Sunday as the
Los Angeles Lakers took command early in rolling to a 101-85 victory over the
slumping Houston Rockets.
</P>
<P>
	   The win was the 11th straight for the Lakers, who travel to Portland for
their final regular-season game against the Trail Blazers on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Both teams have 45-11 records -- best in the NBA by far. Portland's 101-92
win over Utah on Sunday was its 11th straight and 16th in a row at home.
</P>
<P>
	   The 31 points equaled a season-high for Bryant, who made 13 of 18 shots and
also had four rebounds and six assists.
</P>
<P>
	   Shaquille O'Neal had 24 points, 13 rebounds, eight assists and five blocked
shots, and Glen Rice added 17 points for the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuttino Mobley scored 16 of his 29 points in the fourth quarter for the
Rockets, who have lost five straight and eight of 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Rookie Kenny Thomas added 14 points for Houston, and fellow rookie Steve
Francis was held to six points -- all in the second half. He missed his first
nine shots, wound up 2-of-11 and committed seven turnovers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lakers, who took the lead for good in the opening two minutes, went on a
10-3 run to start the second half for a 58-32 lead, and it was 73-54 entering
the fourth period.
</P>
<P>
	   Mobley scored seven straight points to cut Los Angeles' lead to 87-75 with
5:06 left, and the Rockets later cut the deficit to 10 points, but that was as
close as they would get.
</P>
<P>
	   Bryant scored seven points and assisted on a basket by Rice as the Lakers
took a 9-2 lead in the opening 3 1/2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Bryant made eight of his first nine shots including a pair from 3-point
range, and Rice was also 2-of-2 from beyond the 3-point line in the first
quarter, which ended with the Lakers leading 30-13.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neal heated up at the start of the second period, scoring the first 10 Los
Angeles points as the Lakers extended their lead to 40-18.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lakers led by as many as 23 before settling for a 48-29 halftime lead.

<HEADLINE> McCain To Miss This Week's Debate  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican John McCain won't take part in this week's GOP
presidential campaign debate, and aides say they pulled out because rival George
W. Bush was slow to agree to the California event and that sparked scheduling
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's aides denied the move represented a shift in strategy and resources
away from California toward other important states that vote on March 7, like
New York.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not going to let George Bush dictate our schedule,'' said McCain
spokesman Todd Harris. Harris said McCain remained committed to fighting hard in
California and pointed to a heavy campaign schedule in that state all week.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, who was having none of the explanation, said McCain was ducking.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's going to have to explain why he's not going to this debate,'' said
Bush, who blamed McCain for pulling out of the debate planned in California on
Thursday. ``I was led to believe earlier this week that everybody had
accepted.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain aides had a differing view. They said Bush had initially turned down
the California debate, then changed his mind only after McCain had assembled an
intense campaign schedule in New York. That schedule was impossible to alter,
said aide Lanny Wiles.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiles said aides had planned live network television appearances from the
campaign's bus, and couldn't reschedule those events.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can't change all that simply because he changes his mind at the last
minute,'' Wiles said.
</P>
<P>
	   Other McCain aides who spoke on condition of anonymity said negotiations
were under way to schedule a joint appearance on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats Al Gore and Bill Bradley have held such an appearance.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain did not address the issue in public appearances Sunday, though
staffers discussed it with reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Harris dismissed Bush's sudden focus on campaign debates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They lose a couple of primaries and all of a sudden they're born-again
debaters,'' said Harris.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain wrapped up his campaign day with a noisy rally at his suburban
Washington campaign headquarters, after collecting earlier in the day the
endorsements of the New York Post and the Sun of Baltimore.

<HEADLINE> Timberwolves 102, Spurs 98  </HEADLINE>
    By ARNIE STAPLETON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Kevin Garnett scored 29 points and the Minnesota
Timberwolves took advantage of Tim Duncan's absence to edge the San Antonio
Spurs 102-98 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Malik Rose's 3-pointer with 2.8 seconds pulled San Antonio to 100-98, but
Terrell Brandon answered with two free throws with 2.1 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   David Robinson led the Spurs with 29 points as Duncan missed his second
straight game because of a lower abdominal strain.
</P>
<P>
	   For a while it looked as though the Wolves would rout the Midwest Division
leaders. Garnett had 19 points and Brandon 16 of his 20 in the first half as the
Wolves shot 62 percent, limited the Spurs to 11 rebounds and built a 61-51
halftime lead after leading by as many as 16.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Spurs got back into it at the free-throw line, making 20-of-29 after
halftime compared to Minnesota's 7 of 8. Six of those foul shots came in the
final 24 seconds when the Spurs were forced to foul.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wolves still led by 11 when the third quarter buzzer sounded. But the
officials conferred, put four-tenths of a second back on the clock and sent
Terry Porter to the line.
</P>
<P>
	   He sank both free throws, cutting the Spurs' deficit to 83-74.
</P>
<P>
	   By the time Garnett ended the Spurs' 9-0 run, San Antonio had made a game of
it, at 83-78.
</P>
<P>
	   Duncan, who missed a game for the first time in his career Friday night at
Chicago, shot baskets and sat in a whirlpool in hopes of returning to the
lineup. But he told coach Gregg Popovich an hour before the game that he'd
better not risk it, disappointing the crowd of 19,654, the second-biggest at
Target Center this season.
</P>
<P>
	   Duncan, who is averaging 23.9 points and 12.6 rebounds, is day-to-day.

<HEADLINE> NSA Defends Eavesdropping Policy  </HEADLINE>
   By ALICE ANN LOVE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reacting to a spate of charges, a low-profile U.S.
government spy agency is defending to Congress controversial
information-gathering that allegedly includes eavesdropping on ordinary
Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Security Agency mailed a letter to all members of Congress last
week that says: ``We want to assure you that the NSA's activities are conducted
in accordance with the highest constitutional, legal and ethical standards, and
in compliance with statutes and regulations designed to protect the privacy
rights of U.S. persons.''
</P>
<P>
	   The letter, provided to The Associated Press, was signed by Kenneth A.
Heath, the NSA's chief of staff for legislative affairs. It noted that the CBS's
''60 Minutes'' was airing a report on Sunday that criticizes the agency's
activities.
</P>
<P>
	   The NSA is less well known by the American public than other U.S. spy
agencies, such as the CIA. A joke in the intelligence community was that NSA was
so secret that its initials stood for ``No Such Agency.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the CBS broadcast Sunday, a former Canadian intelligence agent said NSA
cooperates with Canada, Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand to run a
satellite listening operation. The eavesdropping operation, known as Echelon,
allegedly monitors phone calls, e-mails and faxes in order to sift out useful
information about foreign governments, drug trafficking and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
	   As an example, the Canadian, Mike Frost, said one woman ended up in
Echelon's database as a possible terrorist because she told a friend on the
phone that her son had ``bombed'' in a school play.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the European Parliament in a report last week accused the
United States of using Echelon for commercial spying -- a kind of industrial
espionage -- to help American companies win contracts over European competitors.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James Rubin refused in a Feb. 23 briefing to
confirm whether Echelon exists, but said the NSA ``is not authorized to provide
intelligence information to private firms,'' and operates ``in strict accordance
with American law.''
</P>
<P>
	   In its letter to Congress, the NSA said that, as a matter of policy, it does
not publicly confirm or deny specific intelligence activities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``However, we can tell you that NSA operates in strict accordance with U.S.
laws and regulations,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
	   Steven Aftergood, who directs the Project on Government Secrecy at the
Federation of American Scientists, said the NSA is ``probably the most secretive
agency of the U.S. government'' and usually limits its communication with
Congress to the House and Senate intelligence committees.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In this case, they have broadcast this letter to everybody seeking to
allay any anxiety from this recent attention,'' Aftergood said. ``I think it's
part of their growing concern about the NSA's public image.''
</P>
<P>
	   Attached to the letter are several pages that describe legal constraints
under which the NSA does its business, including a flow chart showing how
activities are supervised by the Defense and Justice departments, as well as
House and Senate committees on intelligence.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, the papers note that Americans are entitled by law to request to see
all government records about themselves, including the NSA's.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, the American Civil Liberties Union has been requesting
congressional hearings on Echelon for nearly a year. In a letter sent to the
House Government Reform Committee in April 1999, the ACLU said: ``It is
important that Congress investigate to determine if the Echelon program is as
sweeping and intrusive as has been reported.''

<HEADLINE> Farrakhan seeks closer ties with orthodox Muslims  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CHICAGO (AP) - Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan on Sunday
reaffirmed his pledge to reconcile his breakaway movement with orthodox U.S.
Muslims, a move aimed at healing one of America's most contentious religious
rivalries.
<P>
	   Farrakhan used the occasion of the Nation's most important annual gathering,
Saviours' Day, to embrace W. Deen Mohammed, the leader of the orthodox Muslim
American Society and the son of the late Elijah Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
	   "He and I will be together," Farrakhan said of Mohammed. "Not for evil but

<P>
	   Also scheduled to speak Sunday was Rabbi Yisroel Dovid Weiss, a leader of
the Neturei Karta International orthodox Jewish community. Farrakhan met with
leaders of the group last fall in a move that he said was proof of his wish to
reconcile not only with Muslims but also with Jews.
</P>
<P>
	   But Jewish leaders, still seething over Farrakhan's past comments -
including calling Judaism a "gutter religion" - remained cautious.
</P>
<P>
	   Chicago Rabbi Ira Youdovin said the Neturei Karta was an "extreme, extreme
ultra orthodox wing of the Jewish community" that opposes the current existence
of the state of Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the maximum that can be hoped for from Farrakhan is some sort of a
truce," said Youdovin, executive vice president of the Chicago Board of Rabbis,
a group that represents 220 rabbis throughout the Chicago area.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no possibility of him accumulating the credibility given the things
he's said," Youdovin added. "You can't just wipe the slate clean."

<HEADLINE> Farrakhan Reaffirms Reconcile Vow  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTHA IRVINE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan on Sunday reaffirmed
his pledge to reconcile his breakaway movement with orthodox U.S. Muslims, a
move aimed at healing one of America's most contentious religious rivalries.
</P>
<P>
	   Farrakhan used the occasion of the Nation's most important annual gathering,
Saviours' Day, to embrace W. Deen Mohammed, the leader of the orthodox Muslim
American Society and the son of the late Elijah Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He and I will be together,'' Farrakhan said of Mohammed. ``Not for evil
but for love -- not for hatred, but in good.''
</P>
<P>
	   Before Sunday's rally, W. Deen Mohammed had made clear what orthodox Muslims
nationwide expected: a different Farrakhan. And Farrakhan spoke directly to the
expectation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Has Farrakhan abandoned us? Has Farrakhan changed?'' Farrakhan asked the
audience of more than 20,000. ``Yeah, I have. Everybody should be changing ...
but I haven't abandoned you.''
</P>
<P>
	   The speech was regarded as one that could make or break Farrakhan's
fledgling vow to reconcile with other orthodox Muslims.
</P>
<P>
	   Farrakhan had joined with Mohammed at traditional prayers on Friday -- the
25th anniversary of the death of Elijah, whose legacy Farrakhan and Mohammed
have struggled over.
</P>
<P>
	   Elijah led the Nation of Islam for decades, but after his death in 1975, his
son led the movement toward orthodoxy. In 1978, Farrakhan broke away to revive
Elijah's teachings under the old Nation of Islam name.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Nation's theology, Elijah's teacher in the 1930s, W. D. Fard of
Detroit, was given divine status and Elijah was the final prophet to mankind.
Orthodox Muslims believe the final prophet was Mohammed of Mecca, who founded
Islam in the seventh century.
</P>
<P>
	   At that prayer service, Farrakhan and W. Deen Mohammed both vowed to bury
their differences and work together to unite U.S. Muslims.
</P>
<P>
	   Nation of Islam leaders, including Farrakhan's chief of staff, Leonard
Muhammad, have insisted that the move toward unification is not new.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past few years, Farrakhan has instituted the traditional Friday
prayers, observed by millions of orthodox Muslims worldwide, and the Nation of
Islam also now observes Ramadan, a period of fasting.
</P>
<P>
	   Perhaps most important to orthodox Muslims, Leonard Muhammad says that all
Nation of Islam followers now adhere to the Muslim creed: ``There is no God but
Allah and Mohammed is his messenger.''
</P>
<P>
	   That suggests Elijah wouldn't be regarded as the final prophet by Nation of
Islam members -- which Farrakhan confirmed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I love prophet Mohammed,'' he said. ``I know that he is the end of the
prophets. ... But I don't think Allah would be pleased with me if I disrespected
(Elijah Muhammad).''
</P>
<P>
	   Lawrence Mamiya, a Vassar College expert on black American religions,
conservatively estimates the core membership of the Nation of Islam to be 50,000
to 100,000. He said W. Deen Mohammed's group, the Muslim American Society, has
about 200,000 core members. The overall following is thought to be much higher
for both.
</P>
<P>
	   W. Deen Mohammed, who planned to give short remarks at Sunday's gathering,
had said he would carefully monitor Farrakhan's words -- in part listening to
make sure he avoids anti-white and anti-Semitic comments.
</P>
<P>
	   One Nation of Islam observer said he believes the 66-year-old Farrakhan will
continue with the calls for racial and religious unity he has made since his
``near death experience'' last year while being treated for prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's thinking about his legacy, and I don't think he wants to leave with
the idea that he was a hate monger,'' said Salim Muwakkil, a former Nation of
Islam member who is now editor of the Chicago-based political journal In These
Times.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The illness provided him with a very good excuse to be more forthright in
his alterations of the doctrine,'' Muwakkil said. ``Before, he had to do it
incrementally, as if he were taking baby steps.''
</P>
<P>
	   Also scheduled to speak Sunday was Rabbi Yisroel Dovid Weiss, a leader of
the Neturei Karta International orthodox Jewish community. Farrakhan met with
leaders of the group last fall in a move that he said was proof of his wish to
reconcile not only with Muslims but also with Jews.
</P>
<P>
	   But Jewish leaders, still seething over Farrakhan's past comments --

<HEADLINE> In pulpits and streets, appeals for justice and change  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - New demands for social justice, law enforcement reforms
and a federal inquiry echoed from pulpits and city streets on Sunday in the
aftermath of the acquittal of four police officers in the shooting death of
Amadou Diallo.
<P>
	   More than 1,000 people joined a peaceful prayer vigil outside the United
Nations, where activist Rev. Al Sharpton hoped to bring the Diallo case to
international attention. Afterward, about 450 people - accompanied by a phalanx
of police - marched through the streets of Manhattan before ending early Sunday
evening at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
	   "We hope to express our feelings - I must see justice done," said marcher
Omar Jalloh, who carried a sign that stated "Guiliani you're a tragedy."
</P>
<P>
	   The march was similar to Saturday's protest, although it was smaller and not
nearly as tense. Police said there was one arrest for disorderly conduct and one
summons issued for using a megaphone without a permit.
</P>
<P>
	   During the vigil, Sharpton said the shooting victim "could have been one of
these ambassadors."
</P>
<P>
	   He added that he was "calling for another jury to hear evidence" on the
policies of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. "Come November, the jury is going to render
its decision," he said, referring to Giuliani's probable run for the U.S.
Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton also called for people to "hold their wallets," as Diallo was doing
when he was shot. The officers have said they mistook the wallet for a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're going to boycott in this city," he said. "We are afraid to spend
money with certain people because we are considered suspects. Let's hold our
wallets, let's hold our wallets."
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Sharpton's spokeswoman, Rachel Noerdlinger, said Sharpton and his
National Action Network are investigating which companies contribute to the
Patrolmen's Benevolent Association. The PBA helped finance the defense for the
officers. Later this week, Sharpton will release the names of the companies and
ask citizens to boycott them, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo's father, Saikou Diallo, Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., and former
Mayor David Dinkins also spoke at the rally, where a few people wore signs
reading "Go ahead and shoot. I'm black so it must be justified."
</P>
<P>
	   In what was billed as a day of prayer, political leaders and activists
criticized the verdict as inappropriate for a case in which police fired 41
bullets and hit the African immigrant 19 times, only to discover afterward that
he was unarmed.
</P>
<P>
	   The four officers, acquitted of second-degree murder and lesser charges by a
jury in Albany on Friday, still face a departmental inquiry and possibly federal
charges if Attorney General Janet Reno finds evidence that Diallo's civil rights
were violated.
</P>
<P>
	   At St. Patrick's Cathedral, Auxiliary Bishop James McCarthy, filling in for
an ailing Cardinal John O'Connor, told parishioners Diallo's death should cause
people to "re-examine our own tendencies toward violence, toward fear, and
perhaps toward prejudice - racial prejudice at that."
</P>
<P>
	   Rev. Calvin Butts, pastor of Harlem's Abyssinian Baptist Church, urged his
followers to vote against Giuliani, saying the mayor had failed to thank him for
urging calm in the wake of the Diallo incident a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not blaming Giuliani for pulling the trigger but for creating a climate
that's divisive," Butts said in a telephone interview. "And I'm not calling for
calm. I think black people ought to be agitated, they ought to be active."
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani spokesman Bruce Teitelbaum questioned the reverend's motives,
saying he had "hugged Mayor Giuliani" at an interfaith service at St. Patrick's
soon after the shooting, and "now he is exploiting Amadou Diallo's death for
partisan political reasons."
</P>
<P>
	   City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, speaking at Harlem's Bethel AME church,
said that to make sure Diallo's death was not in vain, the police department
needed to continue making "fundamental, meaningful change, so that people aren't
afraid that the police are going to shoot them."
</P>
<P>
	   Vallone, a Democrat, said the city council had budgeted funds for that
purpose, and "even the mayor is recognizing that changes have to be made."
</P>
<P>
	   Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union,
told 200 parishioners at a Congregational church in Queens that the Diallo case
was giving new impetus to his group's proposals for police misconduct reform.
</P>
<P>
	   Key provisions of the plan would make federal and state funding for local
police contingent on the police meeting strict performance standards in
community relations and create a permanent special prosecutor to handle police
brutality incidents.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to seeking a criminal investigation to determine whether
Diallo's civil rights were violated, he said the NYCLU intends to sue the city
on grounds that poor training and racial stereotyping led to the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Sunday, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, seeking the Democratic
nomination for U.S. Senate, urged New Yorkers not to let the verdict divide
them. She said the case underscores the need for a police force reflective of
the city's ethnic diversity and for "community policing."
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever the result of a Justice Department inquiry, "we must reach across
those lines of mistrust and division and join to ensure that no tragedy like
this ever happens again to anyone's son or daughter," she told several hundred
people at a national Dominican-American conference at City College.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton did not mention her Republican foe, but Teitelbaum criticized her
stand.
</P>
<P>
	   "Mrs. Clinton obviously is unaware that New York City recently spent over
$10 million on a new recruiting program designed to create a more diverse police
department (and)... the new police class will be the most diverse ever,"
Teitelbaum said.

<HEADLINE> Barak Hints at Golan Withdrawal  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE COPANS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak suggested Sunday that he
would agree to a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights -- the clearest
indication yet of his willingness to meet a key Syrian demand for peace.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak told his Cabinet that four Israeli prime ministers effectively agreed
to withdraw from the Golan if certain conditions were fulfilled, his office
said. The current Israeli government will not ignore the negotiations that have
taken place directly and through mediators since 1991, Barak told the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli officials had in the past denied that such commitments were made,
saying that previous offers for a withdrawal were hypothetical. Barak's
admission appeared designed to boost his credibility ahead of concessions to
Syria by assuring Israelis that other leaders had also agreed to return the
Golan.
</P>
<P>
	   Any withdrawal must be approved by a national referendum, and polls show
Israelis divided over the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and an aide to former Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, both from the hawkish Likud party, denied Sunday that they
had ever agreed to a full Israeli withdrawal. Netanyahu has refuted documents
published in Israeli newspapers outlining his alleged commitment, in secret
negotiations, to return the entire plateau.
</P>
<P>
	   The most recent attempt at Israeli-Syrian peace talks broke off last month
in deadlock over the heights. Syria insisted that Israel give assurances that it
would withdraw from the Golan, captured in the 1967 Mideast War, and turn over
land extending down to the Sea of Galilee.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel refused to make such a pledge and insisted that the issues of
security arrangements and normalization be spelled out first.
</P>
<P>
	   Even though Barak did not state his position on the exact borders of a
withdrawal from the Golan, Housing Minister Yitzhak Levy said it was obvious to
all those present what he meant.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's no doubt that everyone is talking about a full withdrawal from the
Golan Heights,'' Levy told Israel's Channel Two TV.
</P>
<P>
	   The only question remaining was whether Israel would agree to return land
that would give Syria access to the Sea of Galilee, Israel's main source of
drinking water, Levy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel's Channel Two TV said that Barak would condition a withdrawal on
arrangements for water use and an early warning station that would give Israel
at least 20 hours notice of an impending Syrian attack.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak also indicated in the seven-hour meeting that Israel may withdraw
troops from south Lebanon without security arrangements with Syria -- the main
power broker in Lebanon -- if the sides are unable to reach a peace accord
before Barak's self-imposed deadline of July.
</P>
<P>
	   But Barak told his ministers he would prefer to leave Lebanon with an
agreement with Syria, his office said.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel has transferred about $87 million to the army in recent days to
prepare for a withdrawal from Lebanon, Israel TV reported Sunday. The army has
been building fortifications in northern Israel designed to protect residents
from possible cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli warplanes attacked southern Lebanon on Sunday, apparently targeting
Hezbollah guerrillas who had detonated a roadside bomb that injured three
Israeli-allied militiaman, Lebanese security officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, recent remarks by Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy -- that
Israel would make Lebanon pay for guerrilla attacks ``child for child'' --
prompted Lebanese TV stations to air a commercial comparing Levy to Adolf
Hitler. Levy's remarks drew protests from throughout the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Sunday, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak held separate talks with
Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Both
sides have sought outside help in resolving the stalemate in the
Israel-Palestinian peace talks.

Russians Encircle Last Chechen Stronghold
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   CHIRI-YURT, Russia (AP) -- Russian forces have encircled the last major
stronghold held by Chechnya's rebels but face intense and bloody fighting to

rebels are concentrated around the village of Shatoi, the last section of
Chechnya where rebels have a strong presence. Alvaro Gil-Robles, the Council of

with anti-Catholic views. In a Feb. 25 letter to Cardinal John O'Connor, Bush
stated his "profound respect" for the Catholic Church and called the visit a
"missed opportunity causing needless offense, which I deeply regret." The GOP
presidential contender has come under fire for his Feb. 2 visit to Bob Jones
University, a Christian school whose leaders have criticized the Pope and
labeled the Catholic church a "Satanic cult." The letter marked an abrupt
reversal for Bush, who only last week said: "I don't make any apologies for what
I do in the campaign."

<HEADLINE> Albright Eyed As Czech President  </HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. MANN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Madeleine Albright, America's Czech-born secretary of
state, returns next week to her homeland, where there is talk she might seek the
presidency of the East European nation after her tour in Washington ends.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Czechs are speaking of her as a possible successor to President Vaclav
Havel, who must retire in 2002. Havel, a playwright-turned-politician helped
lead the ``Velvet Revolution'' that in 1989 persuaded communist rulers to
resign.
</P>
<P>
	   He has openly talked about the possibility of Albright succeeding him.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Zantovsky, former Czech ambassador to Washington, said Sunday in
Prague that he met last week with Havel and discussed, among other things, the
possibility that Albright might run to succeed Havel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I never made it a secret that I think that Madeleine Albright could, one
day in the future, play a big role in Czech politics,'' Zantovsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   He stressed that the idea is not new and that it would not dominate
Albright's agenda in the Czech Republic next week.
</P>
<P>
	   In Prague, Havel's chief policy adviser, Pavel Fischer, told Time magazine:
``It is not impossible that they will talk about this.''
</P>
<P>
	   The secretary of state has not publicly discussed her future plans. In its
new issue, Time quoted unidentified sources as saying she ``has begun to
consider the possibility of running.''
</P>
<P>
	   However, Albright spokesman James P. Rubin dismissed the notion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``From time to time senior Czech officials have approached the secretary
about this possibility. She has dismissed it although she is certainly flattered
that Czechs would consider her for the post of president of her native land,''
Rubin said Sunday. ``She has never given this any serious consideration.''
</P>
<P>
	   Albright's March 5-8 visit coincides with the commemoration of the 150th
anniversary of the birth of national hero Tomas Masaryk, who served as the first
president of the Czechoslovak Republic after the collapse of Austria-Hungary in
1918.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright's visit will have some trappings of a political barnstorming tour.
She will receive a gold medal from Masaryk University in Brno and will go to
Masaryk's birthplace at Hodonin. She will lay a wreath at his tomb in Lany, west
of Prague, and go to the capital to unveil a Masaryk statue.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright's maiden name is Marie Korbelova. Her father was a Czech diplomat
who took his family to London as Germany took over their homeland at the start
of World War II. The family then moved to Denver in 1948 rather than serve under
a communist Czechoslovakian government.
</P>
<P>
	   In an unscientific poll, published by Lidove Noviny, the leading daily
newspaper in Prague, Albright was listed among the greatest living Czechs. Havel
was first. The poll, taken in March 1999, preceded NATO's war in Kosovo, which
was widely unpopular among Czechs.
</P>
<P>
	   Havel first brought up the presidency idea in 1998. After returning to
Prague from an official visit to the United States, he expressed regret that he
hadn't asked whether she would be available to succeed him. ``It occurred to me
on the plane on my way back home,'' Havel said, ``so I did not have the chance
to ask her.''
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Constitution bars Albright or any other alien-born citizen from the
American presidency, but there appears to be no legal bar to keep an American
from assuming the presidency of another country.
</P>
<P>
	   Other naturalized citizens have served in foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
	   Lithuania's current president, Valdas Adamkus, is a former U.S. government
bureaucrat. Yugoslavia's former prime minister, American Milan Panic, was a
California millionaire before returning to his homeland and was barred by a
technicality from running against the President Slobodan Milosevic in 1992. In
Israel, Golda Meir moved from a Milwaukee classroom to become the prime minister
who led Israel to victory in the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
	   And the Czechs already have had an American woman living in their
president's house: Havel's wife, Charlotte Garrigue.

<HEADLINE> Appeals for Change After Diallo Trial  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD PYLE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- New demands for social justice, law enforcement reforms and
a federal inquiry echoed from pulpits and city streets on Sunday in the
aftermath of the acquittal of four police officers in the shooting death of
Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 1,000 people joined a peaceful prayer vigil outside the United
Nations, where activist Rev. Al Sharpton hoped to bring the Diallo case to
international attention.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting victim ``could have been one of these ambassadors,'' said
Sharpton, who also said he was ``calling for another jury to hear evidence'' on
the policies of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Come November, the jury is going to render its decision,'' he said,
referring to Giuliani's probable run for the U.S. Senate against first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Some in the crowd wore signs reading: ``Go ahead and shoot. I'm black so it
must be justified.''
</P>
<P>
	   In what was billed as a day of prayer, political leaders and activists
joined Sharpton in criticizing the verdicts as inappropriate for a case in which
police fired 41 bullets and hit the West African immigrant 19 times, only to
discover afterward that he was unarmed.
</P>
<P>
	   Afterward, about 450 people -- accompanied by a phalanx of police -- marched
through the streets of Manhattan before ending early Sunday evening at City
Hall. Police said there was one arrest for disorderly conduct and one summons
issued for using a megaphone without a permit.
</P>
<P>
	   The four officers, acquitted of second-degree murder and lesser charges by a
jury in Albany on Friday, still face a departmental inquiry and possibly federal
charges if Attorney General Janet Reno finds evidence that Diallo's civil rights
were violated.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton's National Action Network is investigating what companies
contribute money to the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, which helped finance
the defense of the four officers in the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Later this week, Sharpton will release names of the companies and will ask
citizens to boycott the firms, said his spokeswoman, Rachel Noerdlinger.
</P>
<P>
	   At St. Patrick's Cathedral, Auxiliary Bishop James McCarthy, filling in for
an ailing Cardinal John O'Connor, told parishioners Diallo's death should cause
people to ``re-examine our own tendencies toward violence, toward fear, and
perhaps toward prejudice -- racial prejudice at that.''
</P>
<P>
	   City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, speaking at Harlem's Bethel AME church,
said that to make sure Diallo's death was not in vain, the police department
needed to continue to make ``fundamental, meaningful change, so that people
aren't afraid that the police are going to shoot them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union,
told 200 parishioners at a Congregational church in Queens that the Diallo case
was giving new impetus to his group's proposals for police misconduct reform.
</P>
<P>
	   The key provisions of the reforms would make federal and state funding for
local police contingent upon police meeting strict performance standards in
community relations and would name a permanent special prosecutor to handle
police brutality incidents.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to seeking a criminal investigation to determine whether
Diallo's civil rights were violated, Siegel said the NYCLU intends to sue the
city on grounds that poor training and racial stereotyping led to the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Hillary Rodham Clinton urged New Yorkers not to let the verdict divide them.
She said the case underscores the need for a police force reflective of the
city's ethnic diversity and for ``community policing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever the result of a Justice Department inquiry, ``We must reach across
those lines of mistrust and division and join to ensure that no tragedy like
this ever happens again to anyone's son or daughter,'' she told several hundred
people at a national conference of Dominican-Americans at City College of New
York.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton did not mention her opponent, Giuliani, who has been a main target
of protesters in the Diallo affair. Giuliani's campaign spokesman, Bruce
Teitelbaum, later criticized Clinton as uninformed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mrs. Clinton obviously is unaware that New York City recently spent over
$10 million on a new recruiting program designed to create a more diverse police
department (and) ... the new police class will be the most diverse ever,''
Teitelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Calvin Butts, pastor of Harlem's Abyssinian Baptist Church, urged
his followers to vote against Giuliani, saying the mayor had failed to thank him
for urging calm in the wake of the Diallo incident a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not blaming Giuliani for pulling the trigger but for creating a
climate that's divisive,'' Butts said in a telephone interview. ``And I'm not
calling for calm. I think black people ought to be agitated, they ought to be
active.''
</P>
<P>
	   Teitelbaum questioned the reverend's motives, saying he had ``hugged Mayor
Giuliani'' at an interfaith service soon after the shooting, and ``now he is
exploiting Amadou Diallo's death for partisan political reasons.''

<HEADLINE> Contentious Elections Test Senegal  </HEADLINE>
   By GLENN McKENZIE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DAKAR, Senegal (AP) -- Under cool and sunny skies, Senegal's paupers and
millionaires voted in a presidential election Sunday as rebel attacks and
political unrest threatened one of Africa's few enduring democracies.
</P>
<P>
	   The contest pitting President Abdou Diouf against seven challengers is the
country's most contentious in decades after 40 years of rule by the Socialist
Party.
</P>
<P>
	   Initially results weren't expected until at least Tuesday. But electoral
officials said late Sunday night that a provisional count could be released
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   If Senegal plunges into violence so soon after the December military
takeover in nearby Ivory Coast -- another traditional bastion of African
stability -- Western diplomats worry it could trigger a flight of development
aid and trade away from the continent.
</P>
<P>
	   There have been sporadic street clashes in the past week, with at least one
brawl between ruling party and opposition supporters in the capital's
Biscuiterie neighborhood during the voting.
</P>
<P>
	   Rebels fighting for independence in the Casamance region launched at least
two attacks Sunday, including a rocket assault on the town of Niayassa, near the
southern border with Guinea-Bissau, radio stations reported. Government soldiers
fought back with light weaponry.
</P>
<P>
	   Several people were injured, the private Wal Fadjri FM station said. Calm
had been restored by midday, though voting was called off at a balloting station
where some of the fighting took place.
</P>
<P>
	   At least one soldier was killed in the second attack, near the town of
Kolda, about 420 miles southeast of Dakar, another independent station, Sud FM,
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebel Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance was not immediately
available for comment. Rebel officials have denied responsibility for two
attacks earlier in the week that left at least six people dead and 20 European
tourists wounded.
</P>
<P>
	   While many African countries hold elections, very few are considered truly
free and fair. In West Africa, where votes often take place against the backdrop
of military coups and civil wars, Senegal is one of the few countries to offer
its 10 million citizens and 2.7 million registered voters regular ballots with a
choice between numerous parties.
</P>
<P>
	   Opposition candidates, however, accuse Diouf of rigging previous votes and
allowing massive corruption.
</P>
<P>
	   All eight presidential aspirants, including Diouf, were offering voters a
better life for all. Only four are seen as serious contenders. If an outright
winner fails to emerge, the top contenders will square off in a second round.
</P>
<P>
	   In a country of stark contrasts, opposition candidates have made ``Sopi!''
-- ``Change!'' in Wolof -- their battle cry.
</P>
<P>
	   While the country boasts world class music and fashion, as well as slick
millionaire entrepreneurs, there are few natural riches.
</P>
<P>
	   The majority remain desperately poor, eking out a living by fishing in
severely depleted ocean waters, growing peanuts on arid farms or begging along
the beaches where European and American tourists come for cheap holidays.
</P>
<P>
	   Six out of 10 Senegalese are illiterate. Hospitals have no medicines. And
dusty tracks serve as national highways.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want change, and I flew thousands of miles back here for it,'' said
Moammar Sow, a Senegalese native who has worked for the past eight years as a
New York taxi driver. ``Forty years in power is too long for any government.''
</P>
<P>
	   Abdoulaye Wade, Diouf's longtime rival who was briefly imprisoned in 1993 in
connection with the killing of an electoral official, has warned the country
will explode in popular revolt if the president retains power.
</P>
<P>
	   Police in central Dakar weren't taking chances shortly before midnight
Sunday, cordoning off at least one police station and parking five armored
vehicles in a nearby street.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the fears, voting proceeded without incident in most parts of Dakar,
even though some stations opened late and others lacked sufficient election
materials.
</P>
<P>
	   Women in bright wraparound gowns and Muslim clerics clutching prayer beads
cast their ballots alongside Roman Catholic nuns and young men wearing expensive
sports gear and designer sunglasses. Threadbare peasants stood side by side with
wealthy businessmen in European-tailored suits.
</P>
<P>
	   Diouf cast his ballot in the city center, surrounded by wildly cheering
crowds who jammed into a hall to see him. Displaying little emotion, he called
on the Senegalese to ``do their duty'' and vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Retired telegraph operator Gabriel Cilla said he was voting to give the
president another seven-year term because his government has managed to pay its
employees regularly -- unlike many bankrupt African governments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have to give thanks for what we have,'' Cilla said.

<HEADLINE> Britain Plans Pet Passports  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOVER, England (AP) -- British customs officials didn't just let Frodo
Baggins walk right into the country -- the 5-year-old black pug had to have a
passport.
</P>
<P>
	   Frodo made history Monday when he arrived on a ferry from France and was
allowed into Britain, the first animal to come in under a new program that gives
pets passports. The pilot project is aimed at replacing a 100-year-old law
requiring pets to be quarantined for six months upon their arrival in Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   As of Monday, dogs and cats from 22 European countries were eligible for a
passport, as were guide dogs from Australia and New Zealand. If successful, the
program will be extended to pets from the United States, Canada and the
Caribbean in 2001, a spokesman for the agriculture ministry said.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the program, Frodo was allowed to board the ferry late Sunday in
Calais, France, after customs officials confirmed his identity and rabies-free
status. Helen de Borchgrave, his owner, carried documents including blood test
results and proof that Frodo had been treated for ticks and tapeworms 48 hours
before departure.
</P>
<P>
	   When the project is fully operational, it is expected to aid the transit of
some 300,000 pets every year. Animals who fail the test will be required to go
into quarantine.
</P>
<P>
	   Pet passports purchased in France cost $46 dollars.

<HEADLINE> No. 3 Cincinnati 68, Louisville 59  </HEADLINE>
    By JOE KAY AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Kenyon Martin scored 24 points and set the tone in
Cincinnati's dominating first half as the second-ranked Bearcats got ahead big
and held on for a 68-59 victory Sunday over Louisville.
</P>
<P>
	   Cincinnati (26-2, 14-0 Conference USA) once again had its way with a team it
has beaten seven straight times. Louisville (17-10, 8-6) couldn't stop Martin in
the first half or in the closing minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin scored 14 points and had 10 rebounds in the first half, when
Cincinnati went ahead by 18 points. After Louisville cut it to nine points with
3:48 left, Martin scored Cincinnati's final eight points to preserve the win.
</P>
<P>
	   Nate Johnson led Louisville with 17 points and Quintin Bailey had 16.
</P>
<P>
	   The first half was a horror for Louisville, which fell behind 33-16, its
biggest halftime deficit and its fewest first-half points of the season. The
Cardinals shot only 28 percent, had 12 turnovers and barely outscored Martin as
a team.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin had 14 points -- only two fewer than the Cardinals in the half -- and
10 rebounds as Cincinnati dominated every phase with its extended man-to-man
defense.
</P>
<P>
	   That set up a plot similar to their game Jan. 27 in Louisville, when the
Bearcats got up by 18 points in the first half and never let the Cardinals get
closer than seven again. DerMarr Johnson was the leader in that game, scoring 21
in the first half while hitting his first eight shots.
</P>
<P>
	   Cincinnati once again got up by 18 points on Sunday and never let Louisville
get closer than nine the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson sat out Cincinnati's last game as an NCAA suspension for accepting
money from an AAU coach to help pay his tuition last year at a prep school. His
biggest contribution Sunday was on defense, helping the Bearcats contain
Louisville leading scorer Marques Maybin. He blocked Maybin's first two shots,
setting the tone for Louisville's lousy first half.
</P>
<P>
	   Both teams came out cold, making only 5-of-23 combined. Cincinnati took
control with a 12-point run that included a couple of fastbreak baskets by
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
	   Cincinnati pulled into its commanding lead even though it shot only 39
percent in the first half. Its defense was the difference.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bearcats' main worry was Maybin, who was coming off a career-high 28
points in a win over Saint Louis and had average 20 points in his last six
games.
</P>
<P>
	   Maybin got off only two shots in the earlier game in Louisville, making them
both for four points. He once again had trouble getting open shots and finished
with nine points on 3-of-10 shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   A 9-4 spurt capped by Maybin's driving layup cut the lead to 60-51 with 3:48
left, but Martin made consecutive three-point plays off power moves to the
backet, abruptly ending the Cardinals' comeback.

<HEADLINE> BB Player Wants Contract Voided  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A Dominican shortstop has asked a Florida
court to void his contract with Atlanta after the Braves were fined for signing
him as an underaged prospect.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilson Betemit, now 18, filed a lawsuit against the Braves Friday in Palm
Beach County, where the contract was signed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   The suit comes after baseball commissioner Bud Selig ruled Friday to fine
the Braves $100,000 for signing an underage player. The Braves also were banned
from scouting and signing players in the Dominican Republic for six months.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Selig's ruling did not mean the Braves will lose Betemit, who hit
.320 with 53 RBIs in 67 games with Danville (Va.) of the Appalachian Rookie
League last season.
</P>
<P>
	   The Braves signed Betemit on his 15th birthday in 1996, one year earlier
than baseball rules allow.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There were a whole lot of illegalities involved in Wilson's contract,''
his agent, Scott Shapiro, said Sunday. ``Wilson was taken advantage of.''
</P>
<P>
	   Shapiro said that as a minor league player, he cannot appear before the
commission's independent arbitrator. That leaves Florida courts as the only
recourse to void Betemit's contract and allow him sign with another major league
team, Shapiro said.
</P>
<P>
	   Betemit is participating in Braves spring training in Orlando under protest,
he said.

RCMP Called In To Probe Allegations of Misuse of Federal Grant
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Prime Minister Jean Chretien's office has called in the RCMP
to investigate allegations of misuse of federal funds by a group of businessmen
who received a job-creation grant in Chretien's riding of Saint-Maurice.
</P>
<P>
	   Sophie Galarneau, a spokeswoman for the prime minister, confirmed Sunday
that police were contacted after the matter was brought to the government's
attention on Feb. 2 by Andre Vallerand, a former provincial tourism minister in
Quebec.
</P>
<P>
	   The daily Le Nouvelliste of Trois-Rivieres reported on the weekend that more
than $100,000 slated for creation of the Canadian Institute of Tourism and
Electronic Commerce may have been misappropriated by some of the grant
recipients.
</P>
<P>

Department to create a job-training center in Chretien's hometown of Shawinigan,
Le Nouvelliste said.

Federal Budget Looks Back To Old ways, Say Critics
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- While Finance Department officials describe Monday's budget
as the first of a new era, critics say they expect to see nothing but the same
old thing from Paul Martin.
</P>
<P>
	   As Canada emerges from years of deficit-fighting to enjoy ballooning federal
surpluses, pressure has been escalating on the finance minister to do big things
with the extra cash.
</P>
<P>
	   Slash taxes. Boost spending on health care. Create a national
child-development program. Help the military.
</P>
<P>
	   As always, Martin is expected to try to do a bit of all those things in the
document.
</P>
<P>
	   But as usually happens when one tries to please everybody, no one will be
really satisfied.
</P>
<P>
	   The Canadian Chamber of Commerce has already warned that it's braced for
disappointment on the tax frOntario
</P>
<P>
	   The annual round of pre-budget leaks suggests Martin will dip into surpluses
that will easily exceed $100 billion in total over five years to cut personal
income taxes, increase health care spending and invest $2.5 billion in
infrastructure.

Canadian Men's Soccer Team Wins Gold Cup Title
</P>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Canada stunned the soccer world by upsetting Colombia
2-0 in the Gold Cup tournament Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Coach Holger Osieck's team had been ranked 85th in the world when the
tournament began.
</P>
<P>
	   When Carlo Corazzin blasted in a penalty kick in the 68th minute, and
goalkeeper Craig Forrest saved a Colombian penalty kick late in regulation time,
Canada assured itself of what many onlookers described as its greatest
breakthrough to date in the sport. Jason DeVos had scored late in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
	   Colombia was ranked 24th in the world. Canada had ousted 10th-ranked Mexico
earlier in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
	   The win stretched Canada's undefeated streak to 11 games, with seven wins
and four draws, lifting expectations for World Cup qualifying games that will be
played this summer.

<HEADLINE> McCain To Miss This Week's Debate  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican John McCain won't take part in this week's GOP
presidential campaign debate, and aides say they pulled out because rival George
W. Bush was slow to agree to the California event and that sparked scheduling
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's aides denied the move represented a shift in strategy and resources
away from California toward other important states that vote on March 7, like
New York.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not going to let George Bush dictate our schedule,'' said McCain
spokesman Todd Harris. Harris said McCain remained committed to fighting hard in
California and pointed to a heavy campaign schedule in that state all week.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, who was having none of the explanation, said McCain was ducking.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's going to have to explain why he's not going to this debate,'' said
Bush, who blamed McCain for pulling out of the debate planned in California on
Thursday. ``I was led to believe earlier this week that everybody had
accepted.''
</P>
<P>
	   A senior McCain aide who spoke on condition of anonymity dismissed
suggestions that the Arizona senator was focusing on states other than
California. McCain has scheduled six campaign days in the state before the
primary and is running $3 million in television commercials there, the aide
said. Officials are considering adding another day to that effort.
</P>
<P>
	   For McCain, the conflict denies him a high-profile platform in an important
state he needs to win, and gives Bush an opening to charge that McCain is
ducking debates. It's the opposite from earlier in the campaign, when McCain
repeatedly attacked Bush for ducking.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision to pull out of the debate was the subject of heated debate
within the McCain camp, with the California leadership raising strong objections
and expressing fear that not attending the event would send a signal he isn't
committed to the giant state.
</P>
<P>
	   Dissidents warned that McCain's upcoming trip to California, which ends
hours before the debate, will be dominated by questions about skipping the
event, and that it would give Bush an excuse to avoid future debates.
</P>
<P>
	   While Bush sought to cast the issue as McCain ducking, McCain aides had a
differing view.
</P>
<P>
	   They said Bush had initially turned down the California debate, then changed
his mind only after McCain had assembled an intense campaign schedule in New
York. That schedule was impossible to alter, said aide Lanny Wiles.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiles said aides had planned live network television appearances from the
campaign's bus, and couldn't reschedule those events.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can't change all that simply because he changes his mind at the last
minute,'' Wiles said.
</P>
<P>
	   Other McCain aides who spoke on condition of anonymity said negotiations
were under way to schedule a joint appearance on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats Al Gore and Bill Bradley have held such an appearance.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain did not address the issue in public appearances Sunday, though
staffers discussed it with reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Harris dismissed Bush's sudden focus on campaign debates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They lose a couple of primaries and all of a sudden they're born-again
debaters,'' said Harris.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain wrapped up his campaign day with a noisy rally at his suburban
Washington campaign headquarters, after collecting earlier in the day the
endorsements of the New York Post and the Sun of Baltimore.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Hosts Governors Minus Bush  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, who claims much of the credit for the
economic boom that coincided with his elevation from a governor to a president,
said Sunday the nation's current good fortune is a rare opportunity for all in
government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is truly a new economy,'' Clinton said as he welcomed the nation's
current crop of governors to the White House. ``It has changed not only the way
people make a living, but the way they live and relate to one another.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton meets with governors three times this week, and while he will hear
ideas about how to keep the good times going he will likely hear a few
complaints, too. Many of the 50 governors worry that the federal government will
stymie states' individual innovations in a variety of areas, including
healthcare and taxation.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah Gov. Michael Leavitt, chairman of the National Governor's Association,
said the group wants Clinton to hear its debate over governors' roles in keeping
state economies prosperous.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Much of that will reflect our desire that the federal government not
attempt to preempt our activities in that regard,'' Leavitt said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, who rose to national prominence as governor of Arkansas in the
1980s, reflected on his waning days in office as he played host Sunday night at
a formal dinner in the White House State Dining Room.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In 11 months I will be a private citizen,'' he said. ``Most of you will
still be serving. Think of that,'' and don't waste this moment of economic
prosperity, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Saxophone player Kenny G was the featured entertainment for a
smaller-than-expected crowd of 34 state governors and most of the Clinton
Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas Gov. George W. Bush was one of those who missed the menu of grilled
Arctic char and rock shrimp served on the Ronald Reagan china. Bush was
campaigning for president in Seattle. His brother Jeb Bush, who is governor of
Florida, was in Washington for the governors' conference but skipped the White
House dinner.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, the governors return to the White House for a weightier
discussion session with Clinton. The president will likely focus on the
successful economy in his annual address to the group, but will also touch on
the problem of rising oil prices, White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also planned to address Democratic governors separately on Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   The governors' four-day meeting is centered on the findings in a new
economic report prepared for the group. The report, a copy of which was sent to
the White House weeks ago, concluded that states must aggressively refashion
their governments if they want to continue to compete.

<HEADLINE> No. 3 Cincinnati 68, Louisville 59  </HEADLINE>
    By JOE KAY AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Kenyon Martin scored 24 points and set the tone in
Cincinnati's dominating first half as the third-ranked Bearcats got ahead big
and held on for a 68-59 victory Sunday over Louisville.
</P>
<P>
	   Cincinnati (26-2, 14-0 Conference USA) once again had its way with a team it
has beaten seven straight times. Louisville (17-10, 8-6) couldn't stop Martin in
the first half or in the closing minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin scored 14 points and had 10 rebounds in the first half, when
Cincinnati went ahead by 18 points. After Louisville cut it to nine points with
3:48 left, Martin scored Cincinnati's final eight points to preserve the win.
</P>
<P>
	   Nate Johnson led Louisville with 17 points and Quintin Bailey had 16.
</P>
<P>
	   The first half was a horror for Louisville, which fell behind 33-16, its
biggest halftime deficit and its fewest first-half points of the season. The
Cardinals shot only 28 percent, had 12 turnovers and barely outscored Martin as
a team.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin had 14 points -- only two fewer than the Cardinals in the half -- and
10 rebounds as Cincinnati dominated every phase with its extended man-to-man
defense.
</P>
<P>
	   That set up a plot similar to their game Jan. 27 in Louisville, when the
Bearcats got up by 18 points in the first half and never let the Cardinals get
closer than seven again. DerMarr Johnson was the leader in that game, scoring 21
in the first half while hitting his first eight shots.
</P>
<P>
	   Cincinnati once again got up by 18 points on Sunday and never let Louisville
get closer than nine the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson sat out Cincinnati's last game as an NCAA suspension for accepting
money from an AAU coach to help pay his tuition last year at a prep school. His
biggest contribution Sunday was on defense, helping the Bearcats contain
Louisville leading scorer Marques Maybin. He blocked Maybin's first two shots,
setting the tone for Louisville's lousy first half.
</P>
<P>
	   Both teams came out cold, making only 5-of-23 combined. Cincinnati took
control with a 12-point run that included a couple of fastbreak baskets by
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
	   Cincinnati pulled into its commanding lead even though it shot only 39
percent in the first half. Its defense was the difference.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bearcats' main worry was Maybin, who was coming off a career-high 28
points in a win over Saint Louis and had average 20 points in his last six
games.
</P>
<P>
	   Maybin got off only two shots in the earlier game in Louisville, making them
both for four points. He once again had trouble getting open shots and finished
with nine points on 3-of-10 shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   A 9-4 spurt capped by Maybin's driving layup cut the lead to 60-51 with 3:48
left, but Martin made consecutive three-point plays off power moves to the
basket, abruptly ending the Cardinals' comeback.

<HEADLINE> Farrakhan Reaffirms Reconcile Vow  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTHA IRVINE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan on Sunday reaffirmed
his pledge to reconcile his breakaway movement with orthodox U.S. Muslims, a
move aimed at healing one of America's most contentious religious rivalries.
</P>
<P>
	   Farrakhan used the occasion of the Nation's most important annual gathering,
Saviours' Day, to embrace W. Deen Mohammed, the leader of the orthodox Muslim
American Society and the son of the late Elijah Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He and I will be together,'' Farrakhan said of Mohammed. ``Not for evil
but for love -- not for hatred, but in good.''
</P>
<P>
	   Before Sunday's rally, W. Deen Mohammed had made clear what orthodox Muslims
nationwide expected: a different Farrakhan. And Farrakhan spoke directly to the
expectation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Has Farrakhan abandoned us? Has Farrakhan changed?'' he asked the audience
of more than 20,000 -- among them former Washington mayor Marion Barry and
Benjamin Muhammad, formerly known as Benjamin Chavis, once head of the NAACP and
now a Nation of Islam official.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yeah, I have,'' Farrakhan said. ``Everybody should be changing ... but I
haven't abandoned you.''
</P>
<P>
	   The speech was regarded as one that could make or break Farrakhan's
fledgling vow to reconcile with other orthodox Muslims.
</P>
<P>
	   Farrakhan had joined with Mohammed at traditional prayers on Friday -- the
25th anniversary of the death of Elijah, whose legacy Farrakhan and Mohammed
have struggled over.
</P>
<P>
	   Elijah led the Nation of Islam for decades, but after his death in 1975, his
son led the movement toward orthodoxy. In 1978, Farrakhan broke away to revive
Elijah's teachings under the old Nation of Islam name.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Nation's theology, Elijah's teacher in the 1930s, W. D. Fard of
Detroit, was given divine status and Elijah was the final prophet to mankind.
Orthodox Muslims believe the final prophet was Mohammed of Mecca, who founded
Islam in the seventh century.
</P>
<P>
	   At that prayer service, Farrakhan and W. Deen Mohammed both vowed to bury
their differences and work together to unite U.S. Muslims.
</P>
<P>
	   Nation of Islam leaders, including Farrakhan's chief of staff, Leonard
Muhammad, have insisted that the move toward unification is not new.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past few years, Farrakhan has instituted the traditional Friday
prayers, observed by millions of orthodox Muslims worldwide, and the Nation of
Islam also now observes Ramadan, a period of fasting.
</P>
<P>
	   Perhaps most important to orthodox Muslims, Leonard Muhammad says that all
Nation of Islam followers now adhere to the Muslim creed: ``There is no God but
Allah and Mohammed is his messenger.''
</P>
<P>
	   That suggests Elijah wouldn't be regarded as the final prophet by Nation of
Islam members -- which Farrakhan confirmed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I love prophet Mohammed,'' he said. ``I know that he is the end of the
prophets. ... But I don't think Allah would be pleased with me if I disrespected
(Elijah Muhammad).''
</P>
<P>
	   Lawrence Mamiya, a Vassar College expert on black American religions,
conservatively estimates the core membership of the Nation of Islam to be 50,000
to 100,000. He said W. Deen Mohammed's group, the Muslim American Society, has
about 200,000 core members. The overall following is thought to be much higher
for both.
</P>
<P>
	   Experts estimate there are 4 million Muslims in the U.S. -- about one
million of them black Muslims.
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout much of his speech, Farrakhan sounded as much like a Baptist
preacher as a Muslim, spending much of his time touting stronger families and
calling for an end to the separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
	   While he joked about shying away from racist comments, he did say that
American society ``is set up on the principle of white supremacy.'' Farrakhan
also accused the U.S. government of recruiting young blacks to infiltrate and
undermine the Nation of Islam during his near-fatal bout with prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   He urged the audience to make their voices heard at a ``Million Family
March'' scheduled in October in Washington that is modeled after the ``Million
Man March.''
</P>
<P>
	   Farrakhan often included Christianity and Judaism in his calls for unity.
But there were hints that he was not speaking about all Jews -- especially given
remarks made to the crowd by Rabbi Yisroel Dovid Weiss, a leader of the Neturei
Karta International orthodox Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
	   Among other things, Weiss -- whose group opposes the current existence of
the state of Israel -- told the crowd that the holocaust was punishment on the
Jewish people for allowing Israel to be established.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They stole the Jewish name ...,'' Weiss said of Jews he would call only
Zionists. ``Please know that there is a difference between Judaism and
Zionism.''
</P>
<P>
	   Assem Fadel, a Muslim who traveled from Canada to hear Farrakhan's speech,
applauded the distinction and said Farrakhan's speech provided him with
``proof'' that a Muslim unification was possible among U.S. groups.
</P>
<P>
	   But such remarks are likely to anger mainstream Jewish leaders, who are
already seething over Farrakhan's past comments -- including calling Judaism a
``gutter religion.''
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Kotzin, executive vice president of the Jewish Federation of
Metropolitan Chicago, said he was not surprised but was disappointed by the
comments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If that's who (Farrakhan) is choosing to associate with, he's scorning the
mainstream and he is associating himself with ideas that the vast majority of
Jewish people reject -- and in some cases find repugnant,'' Kotzin said Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's hardly a way to pursue reconciliation.''

<HEADLINE> 2 Die in Crash of Stolen Ambulance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- An ambulance stolen from a hospital parking lot ran a
red light at high speed and plowed into a car, killing two people, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   The woman driving the ambulance was ``apparently disoriented and obviously
not an employee of the ambulance company,'' Sgt. Joe Vargas said.
</P>
<P>
	   The ambulance had been taken from Anaheim Memorial Hospital, about a mile
from the site of Saturday's crash. The driver was wearing a hospital
identification bracelet but it was unclear whether she was a patient, Vargas
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The victims in the car, which was ripped in half, were identified as Brandon
Tran, 20, and Michael Rebaza, 21, both of Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
	   The woman driving the ambulance was taken to Western Medical Center, where a
nursing supervisor would not give her condition Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   She was arrested for investigation of grand theft of a vehicle, police said.

<HEADLINE> Red Wings 3, Lightning 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DETROIT (AP) -- Larry Murphy moved into third place for games played and Pat
Verbeek had two assists to go over 1,000 career points as the Detroit Red Wings
beat the Tampa Bay Lightning 3-1 on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Yzerman, Kris Draper and Brent Gilchrist scored for the Red Wings, who
are within three points of first-place St. Louis in the Central Division.
Detroit has won two straight and three of four after losing three of four.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Sillinger scored the lone goal for the Lightning, whose season-best
three-game winning streak was snapped.
</P>
<P>
	   Murphy played his 1,541st game, breaking a tie with Johnny Bucyk for third
place on the NHL career list. Red Wings Hall of Famers Gordie Howe and Alex
Delvecchio rank first and second with 1,767 and 1,549 games played.
</P>
<P>
	   Verbeek became the 57th player to reach 1,000 career points when he assisted
on Yzerman's goal just 40 seconds in. He also assisted on Draper's first-period
tally.
</P>
<P>
	   The win was Scotty Bowman's 300th as Red Wings coach. Bowman, who ranks
first in career wins with 1,134, trails only Jack Adams (413) and Sid Abel (340)
on the Red Wings' list.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Osgood made 23 saves for his 22nd victory.
</P>
<P>
	   Zac Bierk started in the Tampa Bay net but was lifted after giving up two
goals on six shots. Rich Parent relieved and stopped 28 of the 29 shots he
faced.
</P>
<P>
	   Yzerman scored off Verbeek's rebound in the game's first minute, then Draper
made it 2-0 less than six minutes later with a blast from outside the top of the
left circle. Bierk, pulled after the second goal, positioned himself so close to
the left goal post that Draper's shot easily beat him wide.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lightning got one back on a power play when Sillinger put Steve Guolla's
rebound past Osgood at 9:04 of the first.
</P>
<P>
	   Gilchrist made it 3-1 when he scored during a goal-mouth scramble 9:56 into
the second. He shot Verbeek's rebound off the post, but the puck stayed in the
crease under Parent and slipped just over the goal line before a defenseman
flicked it out.
</P>
<P>
	   Referee Don Van Massenhoven originally waved off the goal, but it was upheld
by video replay.

<HEADLINE> High-tech heists target phone equipment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) - Burglars disguised as telephone repairmen have
swiped the electronic brains out of several Bergen County business telephone
systems, and investigators are looking into similar cases in Middlesex, Morris
and Ocean counties.
<P>
	   In one case, the thieves made off with about $220,000 worth of the
specialized telephone equipment from Mercedes-Benz's North American headquarters
in Montvale.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities say the scam involves men dressed as workmen who tell office
staff they have arrived to check the telephone system. It's later discovered the
self-described technicians have walked out the door with the digital circuit
cards that control the companies' telephone systems.
</P>
<P>
	   The circuit cards are about the size of a sheet of notebook paper, can
control up to 24 telephone lines and are worth up to $5,000 each, The Record of
Hackensack reported in Sunday's editions.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said the cards are an easy target because they slide easily in
and out of slots in telephone equipment cabinets. In the Mercedes-Benz
headquarters theft, which happened last March while the building was being
renovated, 50 of the cards were taken.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of thefts surged in December, authorities said. In Rochelle Park,
four circuit cards were reported missing after two repairmen talked their way
into a data company on Dec. 14. The suspects had disappeared by the time
employees figured out their phone system was no longer working.
</P>
<P>
	   Two days later, similar heists occurred at two Paramus office buildings,
said Paramus Detective Phil Bellomo.
</P>
<P>
	   Other circuit board thefts prompted Paramus' community policing bureau to
circulate pamphlets warning of the scam.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators said they suspect small, upstart telecommunications companies
may have created a black market for the stolen cards.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a whole network of companies out there that sell this pre-owned
equipment," said Montvale police Detective David DiBlasi.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said there have been no arrests in connection with resale of
stolen phone equipment.
</P>
<P>
	   But two men last fall were arrested in Morris County in connection with the
theft of a case of business telephones worth more than $10,000 from a
Parsippany-Troy Hills office building. Detectives would not say if they believe
those arrests were linked to the circuit board thefts.
</P>
<P>
	   Police in other towns have made similar arrests and said the suspects
appeared to be average burglars.
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime, investigators throughout New Jersey have been sharing with
each other what they know about the thefts. Cases are under investigation in at
least 25 jurisdictions.

U.S. Recalls Defective Warfare Suits

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon has alerted U.S. facilities around the world
that hundreds of thousands of protective suits meant to shield GIs from gas and
germ attack may have holes and other critical defects, according to military
officials and documents. The Pentagon learned about the flaws five years ago but
did not consider the problems crucial and needed the gear for U.S. peacekeeping
troops in Bosnia, criminal investigators say. On Feb. 9, the Pentagon cautioned
commanders not to use any of the 778,000 suits except in training. The suits,
not all of which are defective, cost the government almost $49 million.

Indian Co. Buys Tetley Tea Maker
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- The Indian company Tata Tea Ltd. has bought the Tetley Group,
maker of the second-biggest brand of teabags in the world, for $433.6 million,
Tetley announced Sunday. Tata Tea, part of the Tata Group, is the largest
integrated tea company in the world, with additional interests in coffee and
spices. The two companies were already working together through a joint venture,
Tata Tetley, which manufactures tea bags in India. The deal, set to be completed
in March, would be the largest overseas acquisition undertaken by an Indian
company, the Financial Times newspaper said.

Clarke Defeats Woods at Match Play
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- Darren Clarke won the biggest prize of his career
by taking down Tiger Woods today, a stunning 4 and 3 victory over Woods in the
finals of Match Play Championship. It capped an incredible weekend for Clarke,
the 31-year-old from Northern Ireland who knocked off Ryder Cup star Hal Sutton,
whipped second-ranked David Duval and then handed Woods his worst loss ever in
match play. Clarke pulled off a birdie blitz that no one has been able to throw
at Woods during his domination of worldwide golf the past 10 months.

Lakers Blast Rockets 101-85
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kobe Bryant scored 18 of his 31 points in the first 10
minutes tonight as the Los Angeles Lakers took command early in rolling to a
101-85 victory over the slumping Houston Rockets. The win was the 11th straight
for the Lakers, who travel to Portland for their final regular-season game
against the Trail Blazers on Tuesday night. Both teams have 45-11 records --
best in the NBA by far. Portland's 101-92 win over Utah on Sunday was its 11th
straight and 16th in a row at home. The 31 points equaled a season-high for
Bryant, who made 13 of 18 shots and also had four rebounds and six assists.

<HEADLINE> Bradley, Gore Stump in Wash. State  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM COUR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- A come-from-behind win in a game of pickup basketball at a
youth center Sunday gave a lift to Bill Bradley's underdog Democratic
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   His team at the Boys and Girls Club in nearby Bellevue defeated one coached
by former Seattle Sonics player Jack Sikma, 11-9.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As Jack said, that was a good omen,'' said Bradley, himself a former NBA
player.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley has been campaigning in Washington state since Wednesday, looking
for a win in the state's presidential primary on Tuesday. The irony, though, is
that victory here will offer neither Bradley nor Vice President Al Gore a
tangible boost toward the nomination. No delegates will be Tuesday; they will be
apportioned based on party caucuses one week later.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If I can do well in the primary on Tuesday, I think it will help me with
delegates a week later here in Washington and also across the country,'' Bradley
said on ABC's ``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, meanwhile, campaigned at Seattle's Franklin High School, where he
turned a local family into a symbol of his argument for legislation giving
patients stronger appeal rights when their HMOs deny coverage of medical
treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   The 500 or so supporters were kept waiting in the gymnasium for about an
hour while Gore met privately at his hotel with Dylan and Christine Malone from
Everett.
</P>
<P>
	   The Malones' health insurance company, Aetna, has decided to stop paying for
home nursing care for their 6-month-old son Ian, who must be fed through a
stomach tube and have his lungs suctioned hourly because of a birth trauma.
</P>
<P>
	   In his campaign speech, Gore railed at Aetna: ``Don't do this. Don't cut
this child's coverage.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Give 'em Hell, Al!'' called out one man in the gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
	   Privately, Gore promised the Malones to contact Aetna himself. Dylan was a
volunteer for Gore's 1988 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley drew applause from a predominantly black congregation at First
African Methodist Episcopal Church in Seattle when he said the race issue was a
moral concern, not a political one.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you share my dream for America, then I want to say, ``Come with me,'''
Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Afterward, he told the packed gymnasium, where he had changed into a T-shirt
and sweat pants for the ball game, that he was fighting against entrenched
power.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to say to the kids, 'Keep working.' I want to say to all of you, 'I
need you on Tuesday.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley picked up newspaper endorsements Sunday from The Hartford Courant
and The Maine Sunday Telegram and was attending a rally in Vancouver before
discussing the campaign on America Online.
</P>
<P>
	   Adding to Gore's lopsided pile of endorsement were the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer, New York's Daily News, San Jose (Calif.) Mercury News, The
Austin-American Statesman and the Sun of Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
	   Before heading to Denver, Gore had some catch-up to play in Redmond, Wash.,
where he talked to local families on the issue of pipeline safety, something
Bradley addressed in two bills in the Senate and campaigned on here last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore sat in the living room of David and Debbie McKinney, who warily eye a
stretch of the Olympic pipeline that exploded further north last summer, killing
three people.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore was surprised when Sen. Patty Murray, a Gore supporter, told him there
had been 5,500 oil and gas pipeline accidents since 1992 when he and Bill
Clinton were elected.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The vice president throughout his entire public career has been absolutely
absent on this issue and the administration has done nothing,'' said Bradley
spokesman Mo Elleithee.
</P>
<P>
	   Asking for their votes, Gore told the McKinneys and their neighbors ``I give
you my word that I will pay close attention to this.''
</P>
<P>
	   In his stump speeches and advertising, Bradley has been scrutinizing Gore's
past record against abortion rights and gun control.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, Karen Cooper, head of the Washington affiliate of the National
Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, appeared with Gore at Franklin
to give him the league's ``resounding endorsement.''
</P>
<P>
	   Anita Dunn, a top Bradley adviser who resigned her consultancy with NARAL
when the national office endorsed Gore this month, said the affiliate's nod came
after a Saturday vote in which Bradley supporters on the local board were not
allowed to vote by proxy.
</P>
<P>
	   Cooper acknowledged that the early, primary-season nod was unprecedented and
was approved by voice vote.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The people at the meeting all realized it's very important that we don't
go into the November election with people thinking Al Gore is anything but
strongly pro-choice,'' Cooper told a reporter.

<HEADLINE> Bradley visits church, youth club in bid for votes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SEATTLE (AP) - Democrat presidential hopeful Bill Bradley visited a
predominantly black church and shot baskets at a youth center Sunday, continuing
a Washington campaign swing that he hopes will carry him to victory in the
state's primary.
<P>
	   Bradley's pickup team at the Boys and Girls Club in nearby Bellevue beat a
team headed by former Seattle SuperSonics center Jack Sikma in a shooting
contest, 11-9.
</P>
<P>
	   "As Jack said, that was a good omen," said Bradley, a former NBA player. "I
came from behind to win."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley has been in Washington state since Wednesday, campaigning on both
sides of the Cascade Range in advance of the state's Tuesday primary. Analysts
have said Bradley needs a victory here to stay alive after a string of primary
defeats to Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   The irony, though, is that victory here will offer neither Democrat a
tangible boost toward the nomination. No delegates will be awarded in
Washington's Democrat primary; all delegates will be apportioned based on party
caucuses one week later.
</P>
<P>
	   At the First African Methodist Episcopal Church in the city's Capitol Hill
neighborhood, Bradley dealt head-on with the issue of race, getting applause
from the congregation when he said, "To me, the issue of race is not a political
issue; it's a moral issue."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley repeated his opposition to the Confederate flag flying over the
South Carolina statehouse and said he opposed Florida's new policy banning
affirmative action in state university admissions.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you share my dream for America, then I want to say, "Come with me,' "
Bradley told the church audience.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Boys and Girls Club, Bradley donned a T-shirt and warmup pants to
shoot baskets with club members.
</P>
<P>
	   Afterward, he told a packed gymnasium, "I'm fighting that trust can be
restored in our government. I'm fighting against entrenched power.
</P>
<P>
	   "I want to say to the kids, 'Keep working.' I want to say to all of you, "I
need you on Tuesday.' "
</P>
<P>
	   Later Sunday, Bradley flew to Vancouver, Wash. - across the Columbia River
from Portland, Ore. - for a rally at a middle school. He reminded voters that
Tuesday's nonbinding primary is the first step of what he called "the Washington
two-step."
</P>
<P>
	   "If we do well on Tuesday, then we do well in the caucuses," he told the
crowd of over 300 people.
</P>
<P>
	   While in Vancouver, Bradley participated in a live cyberchat on America
Online.
</P>
<P>
	   "We need a clear mountain stream to run through Washington, D.C., and clean
it up, sweeping away the special interests and enthroning the people," he wrote,
drawing teasing remarks that he was waxing poetic.
</P>
<P>
	   One AOL participant - saying he could not distinguish between Bradley and
Gore's agendas - asked how Bradley would feel being Gore's running mate. That
would be "an unbeatable ticket," the participant wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley responded with a list of differences between the agendas, saying his
health care and handgun registration proposals were more inclusive than Gore's.
</P>
<P>
	   And, he wrote, "Gore doesn't hold schools accountable for the money he sends
as I do."
</P>
<P>
	   The former New Jersey senator has courted black voters and labor groups -
both considered loyal to Gore - during his visit. He's visited picket lines in
Seattle and Spokane and spoken to mostly black audiences at the AME church and
at an NAACP fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley got endorsements on Sunday from The Hartford Courant. Gore, who was
heading to Denver, was endorsed by The Sun of Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
	   The Seattle Times, which endorsed him last December, editorialized in
Sunday's editions: "Bradley has the dignity and grace to resist exploiting
emotional subjects. He does not wear his religious beliefs on his sleeve and
quietly describes abortion as a legal right and a private decision between a
woman and her doctor.
</P>
<P>
	   "These values and a confident demeanor should be well received here."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Hosts Governors Minus Bush  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, who claims much of the credit for the
economic boom that coincided with his elevation from a governor to a president,
said Sunday the nation's current good fortune is a rare opportunity for all in
government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is truly a new economy,'' Clinton said as he welcomed the nation's
current crop of governors to the White House. ``It has changed not only the way
people make a living, but the way they live and relate to one another.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton meets with governors three times this week, and while he will hear
ideas about how to keep the good times going he will likely hear a few
complaints, too. Many of the 50 governors worry that the federal government will
stymie states' individual innovations in a variety of areas, including
healthcare and taxation.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah Gov. Michael Leavitt, chairman of the National Governors' Association,
said the group wants Clinton to hear its debate over governors' roles in keeping
state economies prosperous.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Much of that will reflect our desire that the federal government not
attempt to preempt our activities in that regard,'' Leavitt said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, who rose to national prominence as governor of Arkansas in the
1980s, reflected on his waning days in office as he played host Sunday night at
a formal dinner in the White House State Dining Room.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In 11 months I will be a private citizen,'' he said. ``Most of you will
still be serving. Think of that,'' and don't waste this moment of economic
prosperity, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Saxophone player Kenny G was the featured entertainment for a
smaller-than-expected crowd of 34 state governors and most of the Clinton
Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas Gov. George W. Bush was one of those who missed the menu of grilled
Arctic char and rock shrimp served on the Ronald Reagan china. Bush was
campaigning for president in Seattle. His brother Jeb Bush, who is governor of
Florida, was in Washington for the governors' conference but skipped the White
House dinner.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, the governors return to the White House for a weightier
discussion session with Clinton. The president will likely focus on the
successful economy in his annual address to the group, but will also touch on
the problem of rising oil prices, White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also planned to address Democratic governors separately on Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   The governors' four-day meeting is centered on the findings in a new
economic report prepared for the group. The report, a copy of which was sent to
the White House weeks ago, concluded that states must aggressively refashion
their governments if they want to continue to compete.

<HEADLINE> Juror: Verdict in Diallo case was clear  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A member of the jury that acquitted four white
police officers in the killing of an unarmed black man said Sunday that the
outcome was "not happy, but clear."
<P>
	   Speaking publicly for the first time since Friday's verdict in the racially
charged case, juror Helen Harder said that the jury deliberated without discord
before agreeing the law was on the side of the officers.
</P>
<P>
	   "It turned out the only way it could turn out," Harder, 71, told The
Associated Press in a brief interview in the kitchen of her Albany County home.
She also said that the facts of the case "were very clear - not happy, but
clear."
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, seven jurors also spoke with NBC. The jurors said they were
troubled by Amadou Diallo's actions as described by the four officers.
</P>
<P>
	   "He looked at the police officers, they identified themselves, and as they
moved toward him, he turned and backed away," said juror Tom Knowles in a clip
broadcast by NBC's Nightly News on the West Coast. "Why? Why? We won't know
those answers."
</P>
<P>
	   Two other jurors said they truly believed the officers thought their lives
were in danger.
</P>
<P>
	   "The officers do have a right to defend themselves," said juror Ed Powell.
</P>
<P>
	   Jurors also said that the judge's lengthy instructions weighed heavily on
their decision.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were told to look at this from the police officers' point of view, not
from Mr. Diallo's point of view," said juror Charise Smith.
</P>
<P>
	   Like her co-jurors, Harder spoke about the difficulty of their decision:
"I'm not saying it's a happy verdict. I know the cops are happy. None of (the
jurors) are very happy. But that's the way it worked out."
</P>
<P>
	   Harder - who has nine children and 17 grandchildren - described the
heartbreak of seeing Diallo's parents sitting in the front row each day of the
month-long trial.
</P>
<P>
	   The juror didn't mention race. But her husband, attorney George Harder, said
his wife told him it was not an issue in the jury's deliberations.
</P>
<P>
	   Officers Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon, Kenneth Boss and Richard Murphy were
cleared of murder and other charges in the slaying of Diallo, a West African
immigrant.
</P>
<P>
	   The plainclothes officers claimed they fired 41 bullets at the victim on
Feb. 4, 1999 after he refused orders to halt for questioning and pulled out a
black object they thought was a small handgun. Diallo was hit 19 times in the
vestibule of his Bronx apartment before the defendants realized the object was a
wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   The death of Diallo - and now the not-guilty verdict - has flamed tensions
between police and minorities and touched off protests around the city. Because
of pre-trial publicity, an appeals court moved the murder case to Albany, where
Harder, who is white, served on a jury that also had four black women and seven
white men.
</P>
<P>
	   Jurors have mostly remained silent since the verdict, despite constant
hounding by network television, New York City newspapers and major news
organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury's black foreperson, who once lived in the Bronx, told the New York
Post that the three-day deliberation had "nothing to do with race." She declined
further comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense case hinged on the emotional testimony of the officers. All
claimed they were convinced that they had to shoot Diallo in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge instructed jurors several times that by law if they concluded that
the officers "reasonably believed" Diallo was armed and dangerous, they must
acquit.
</P>
<P>
	   About the officers, Harder said, "I thought they were quite believable."
</P>
<P>
	   The juror also said she was "relieved that (the trial is) over, and to get
my own life back."

<HEADLINE> BB Player Wants Contract Voided  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A Dominican shortstop has asked a Florida
court to void his contract with Atlanta after the Braves were fined for signing
him as an underaged prospect.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilson Betemit, now 18, filed a lawsuit against the Braves Friday in Palm
Beach County, where the contract was signed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   The suit comes after baseball commissioner Bud Selig ruled Friday to fine
the Braves $100,000 for signing an underage player. The Braves also were banned
from scouting and signing players in the Dominican Republic for six months.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Selig's ruling did not mean the Braves will lose Betemit, who hit
.320 with 53 RBIs in 67 games with Danville (Va.) of the Appalachian Rookie
League last season.
</P>
<P>
	   The Braves signed Betemit on his 15th birthday in 1996, one year earlier
than baseball rules allow.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There were a whole lot of illegalities involved in Wilson's contract,''
his agent, Scott Shapiro, said Sunday. ``Wilson was taken advantage of.''

	   Because Betemit is a minor leaguer and not a member of the players'
association, the union can't file a grievance to force the case before
arbitrator Shyam Das. That leaves courts as the only recourse to void Betemit's
contract and allow him sign with another major league team, Shapiro said.

<HEADLINE> US Issues Warfare Suit Alert  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN M. DONNELLY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon has alerted U.S. facilities around the world
that hundreds of thousands of protective suits meant to shield GIs from gas and
germ attack may have holes and other critical defects, according to military
officials and documents.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon learned about the flaws five years ago but did not consider the
problems crucial and needed the gear for U.S. peacekeeping troops in Bosnia,
criminal investigators say. Not until late last year did a second study on the
same suits judge identical flaws grave enough to warrant a global warning, the
investigators said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   On Feb. 9, the Pentagon cautioned commanders not to use any of the 778,000
suits except in training. The suits, not all of which are defective, cost the
government almost $49 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The defects included ``cuts, holes, embedded foreign matter and stitching
irregularities,'' the Pentagon inspector general said in a report being released
this week. The defects potentially could kill people wearing the trousers and
jackets in a ``chemical-biological contaminated environment,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   A bankrupt New York City-based company, which the inspector general
identified as Istratex, produced the charcoal-lined camouflage suits under two
contracts dating from 1989. Soldiers wear the suits over their regular
camouflage gear where chemical or biological weapons might be used. It was
unclear whether any of the suits were worn by troops in the 1990-91 Desert
Shield-Desert Storm operation, when Iraqi chemical attack was considered likely.
</P>
<P>
	   Last May, the Justice Department indicted various company officials on
charges including conspiracy to defraud the Pentagon, major fraud and making
false claims. They all later pleaded guilty to lessor charges.
</P>
<P>
	   In September 1999, Istratex's president and production manager each pleaded
guilty in U.S. District Court in New York to one count of making false
statements. Two other company officials pleaded guilty to making false
certificate or writing and a fifth official pleaded guilty to obstruction of
justice. Sentencings are expected in the spring.
</P>
<P>
	   Pentagon criminal investigators said they pointed out to the Defense
Logistics Agency, which manages inventories, problems with some of the
``battle-dress overgarments'' in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996, the agency's testers, at the investigators' request, studied 500 of
the suits and found defects in 174, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Defense Logistics Agency identified the problems as major but not
``safety-of-life critical defects,'' said Mitchell Schlitt, the case agent for
the inspector general's Defense Criminal Investigative Service in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So because of a need for these suits for the Bosnia action, they stated a
need to retain these in stock,'' Schlitt said.
</P>
<P>
	   Three years later, last September, the criminal investigators asked for new
tests, this time by Army designers of the suit, Schlitt said. Examining the same
suits, the new team found the defects were in fact critical.
</P>
<P>
	   By regulation, Schlitt said, a critical defect, unlike a major one, is so
severe that finding one such problem in a single suit warrants stopping use of
the whole lot.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the military standard, a critical flaw is one that ``would
result in hazardous or unsafe conditions or ... is likely to prevent performance
of the tactical function.'' By comparision, the official standard says a major
defect is not much better: It is ``likely to result in failure or to reduce
materially the usability of the ... product.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Istratex executives' guilty pleas were to prosecution allegations that
the company intentionally manufactured faulty gear, then duped government
inspectors by clandestinely switching small quantities of well-made garments for
flawed ones during inspections. Sentencing is set for April, and the executives
face jail terms and fines.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigators examined suits only from one contract for 173,000 suits.
The second contract covered the remaining approximately 605,000 suits, but the
prosecutors did not examine those. Still, the Pentagon's alert warns U.S. forces
that defective suits might be found among all 778,000 made under the two deals.
</P>
<P>
	   The Defense Logistics Agency found 334,000 suits at its depot in Albany,
Ga., that are ``potentially deficient and attributable to the manufacturer in
question,'' said Gerda Parr, an agency spokeswoman. That leaves 444,000 suits
made by Istratex.
</P>
<P>
	   James Kornides, the top auditor on the case, believes many of the suits were
deployed to far-flung places. ``That's why we wanted them to ... alert the
operational units that those suits could be defective,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   His audit found the Georgia depot, which stores much of the military's
chemical-protective gear, not only did not know if it held flawed suits but also
didn't know how many suits it had at all. In the case of one type of garment,
the depot had overstated the inventory by 31,277 suits.

<HEADLINE> Britain Pet Passport Program Begins  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOVER, England (AP) -- British customs officials didn't just let Frodo
Baggins walk right into the country -- the 5-year-old black pug had to have a
passport.
</P>
<P>
	   Frodo made history Monday when he arrived on a ferry from France and was
allowed into Britain, the first animal to come in under a new program that gives
pets passports. The pilot project is aimed at replacing a 100-year-old law
requiring pets to be quarantined for six months upon their arrival in Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   As of Monday, dogs and cats from 22 European countries were eligible for a
passport, as were guide dogs from Australia and New Zealand. If successful, the
program will be extended to pets from the United States, Canada and the
Caribbean in 2001, a spokesman for the agriculture ministry said.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the program, Frodo was allowed to board the ferry late Sunday in
Calais, France, after customs officials confirmed his identity and rabies-free
status. Helen de Borchgrave, his owner, carried documents including blood test
results and proof that Frodo had been treated for ticks and tapeworms 48 hours
before departure.
</P>
<P>
	   When the project is fully operational, it is expected to aid the transit of
some 300,000 pets every year. Animals who fail the test will be required to go
into quarantine.
</P>
<P>
	   Pet passports purchased in France cost $46 dollars.

<HEADLINE> No. 3 Cincinnati 68, Louisville 59  </HEADLINE>
    By JOE KAY AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Coach Denny Crum grabbed a pen, wiped his brow and
dissected the stat sheet that came down to one row of numbers, the ones that
belonged to Kenyon Martin.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin scored 24 points, had 12 rebounds and scored Cincinnati's biggest
baskets throughout as the third-ranked Bearcats got up big and held on for a
ragged 68-59 victory over Louisville on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Cincinnati (26-2, 14-0 Conference USA) once again led most of the way
against a team it has beaten seven straight times. Louisville (17-10, 8-6)
couldn't stop Martin in the first half or in the closing minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   "If it wasn't for Kenyon Martin, we might have gotten the upset," Crum said.
"He just dominated both ends tonight, really."
</P>
<P>
	   Martin had 14 points and 10 rebounds in the first half, when Cincinnati went
ahead by 18 points. After Louisville cut it to nine points with 3:48 left,
Martin scored Cincinnati's final eight points.
</P>
<P>
	   He hit had consecutive three-point plays on power moves to the basket and
scored inside again to prevent Louisville from getting a shot at the upset.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were struggling, so I decided to take things upon me," Martin said.
"I've been here so long, it's on me to do that."
</P>
<P>
	   Nate Johnson led Louisville with 17 points and Quintin Bailey had 16.
</P>
<P>
	   The first half was a horror for Louisville, which fell behind 33-16, its
biggest halftime deficit and its fewest first-half points of the season. The
Cardinals shot only 28 percent, had 12 turnovers and barely outscored Martin as
a team.
</P>
<P>
	   "Well, this was a tough game," Crum said. "I felt for us to have a chance to
win, we'd have to have a good first half."
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, it set up a plot similar to their game Jan. 27 in Louisville, when
the Bearcats got up by 18 points in the first half and never let the Cardinals
get closer than seven. DerMarr Johnson was the leader in that game, scoring 21
in the first half while hitting his first eight shots.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson sat out Cincinnati's last game as an NCAA suspension for accepting
money from an AAU coach to help pay his tuition last year at a prep school. His
biggest contribution Sunday was on defense, helping the Bearcats contain
Louisville leading scorer Marques Maybin. He blocked Maybin's first two shots,
setting the tone for Louisville's lousy first half.
</P>
<P>
	   Even though Louisville never got closer than nine points in the second half,
coach Bob Huggins was fuming over the way his team seemed to coast. Louisville
shot 65 percent in the second half and outscored Cincinnati 43-35.
</P>
<P>
	   "We quit playing," said Huggins, who was as unhappy after the game as he's
been all season. "Our guys are the only ones who don't understand that he (Crum)
is a great coach and he's got great players. They think they're going to roll
over in the second half, I guess. We did in the second half -- that was
atrocious."
</P>
<P>
	   Both teams came out cold, making only 5-of-23 combined. Cincinnati took
control with a 12-point run that included a couple of fastbreak baskets by
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
	   Cincinnati pulled into its commanding lead even though it shot only 39
percent in the first half. Its defense was the difference.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bearcats' main worry was Maybin, who was coming off a career-high 28
points in a victory over Saint Louis and had average 20 points in his last six
games.
</P>
<P>
	   Maybin got off only two shots in the earlier game in Louisville, making them
both for four points. He once again had trouble getting open shots and finished
with nine points on 3-of-10 shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   A 9-4 spurt capped by Maybin's driving layup cut the lead to 60-51 with 3:48
left, but Martin made consecutive three-point plays off power moves to the
basket, abruptly ending the Cardinals' comeback.

<HEADLINE> Hirschbeck To Head Umpires Union  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PHOENIX (AP) -- John Hirschbeck was elected Sunday as president of the World
Umpires Association, the new union formed to represent major league baseball's
umpires.
</P>
<P>
	   Hirschbeck, an AL umpire for 17 years, was picked at the first meeting of
the union, which was certified Thursday by the National Labor Relations Board.
</P>
<P>
	   The certification meant the end of the old union and its chief, Richie
Phillips, who tried to organize a mass resignation last season that led to 22
umpires losing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   The union also elected umpires Joe Brinkman as vice president and Tim Welke
as secretary-treasurer, as well as a six-man board of directors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to have a better working relationship with baseball,'' Hirschbeck
said. ``We want to establish a more positive image for major league umpires.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that the public, by seeing that umpires wanted this new
organization, wanted to go in a new direction, I think that that first off shows
that we're tired with the way things were and we want to change and that now
we'll continue to go about making that change.''
</P>
<P>
	   The union does not have a contract with baseball. The umpires had been
operating under their old contract, a five-year deal which expired Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   Under federal law, the terms of the expired contract had remained in place.
</P>
<P>
	   Hirschbeck said negotiations for a new contract would begin Monday in
Phoenix. He said he would be actively involved in the talks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have attorneys to advise us,'' said Hirschbeck, adding that Joel Smith
is the new union's labor lawyer. ``One of the biggest things that we said
throughout this entire campaign was that this was going to be a union run by
umpires for umpires.''
</P>
<P>
	   Phillips, a lawyer, was highly visible in his 21-year reign as union chief.
Hirschbeck had been a vocal critic of Phillips, especially last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   Phillips wanted umpires to resign in an effort to get baseball to start
negotiations for a new contract. After that failed, umpires voted 57-35 in
November to form a new union.
</P>
<P>
	   The 22 umpires who were terminated Sept. 2 are trying to regain their jobs
in a grievance filed by the old union. Arbitrator Alan Symonette has recessed
the case until late April.
</P>
<P>
	   Umpires had a salary range of $75,000 to $240,000 per season. Hirschbeck
refused to say what the new union will want out of a new contract.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Tomorrow morning we start negotiations and I'm going to make it a policy
that never we will negotiate in the paper,'' he said. ``Our first thing is to
negotiate a good contract for umpires. We want to negotiate the best possible
contract as a bargaining unit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Hopefully, baseball is looking as forward as we are to establishing a new
working relationship and getting a contract in place so that all major league
umpires can go back to trying to get calls right.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elected to the board of directors were Rocky Roe, Fieldin Culbreth, Tim
McClelland, Larry Young, Jeff Nelson and Bill Welke.

<HEADLINE> Farrakhan seeks closer ties with orthodox Muslims  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CHICAGO (AP) - Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan on Sunday
reaffirmed his pledge to reconcile his breakaway movement with orthodox U.S.
Muslims, a move aimed at healing one of America's most contentious religious
rivalries.
<P>
	   Farrakhan used the occasion of the Nation's most important annual gathering,
Saviours' Day, to embrace W. Deen Mohammed, the leader of the orthodox Muslim
American Society and the son of the late Elijah Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
	   "He and I will be together," Farrakhan said of Mohammed. "Not for evil but
for love - not for hatred, but in good."
</P>
<P>
	   Before Sunday's rally, W. Deen Mohammed had made clear what orthodox Muslims
nationwide expected: a different Farrakhan. And Farrakhan spoke directly to the
expectation.
</P>
<P>
	   "Has Farrakhan abandoned us? Has Farrakhan changed?" he asked the audience
of more than 20,000 - among them former Washington mayor Marion Barry and
Benjamin Muhammad, formerly known as Benjamin Chavis, once head of the NAACP and
now a Nation of Islam official.
</P>
<P>
	   "Yeah, I have," Farrakhan said. "Everybody should be changing ... but I
haven't abandoned you."
</P>
<P>
	   The speech was regarded as one that could make or break Farrakhan's
fledgling vow to reconcile with other orthodox Muslims.
</P>
<P>
	   Farrakhan had joined with Mohammed at traditional prayers on Friday - the
25th anniversary of the death of Elijah, whose legacy Farrakhan and Mohammed
have struggled over.
</P>
<P>
	   Elijah led the Nation of Islam for decades, but after his death in 1975, his
son led the movement toward orthodoxy. In 1978, Farrakhan broke away to revive
Elijah's teachings under the old Nation of Islam name.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Nation's theology, Elijah's teacher in the 1930s, W. D. Fard of
Detroit, was given divine status and Elijah was the final prophet to mankind.
Orthodox Muslims believe the final prophet was Mohammed of Mecca, who founded
Islam in the seventh century.
</P>
<P>
	   At that prayer service, Farrakhan and W. Deen Mohammed both vowed to bury
their differences and work together to unite U.S. Muslims.
</P>
<P>
	   Nation of Islam leaders, including Farrakhan's chief of staff, Leonard
Muhammad, have insisted that the move toward unification is not new.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past few years, Farrakhan has instituted the traditional Friday
prayers, observed by millions of orthodox Muslims worldwide, and the Nation of
Islam also now observes Ramadan, a period of fasting.
</P>
<P>
	   Perhaps most important to orthodox Muslims, Leonard Muhammad says that all
Nation of Islam followers now adhere to the Muslim creed: "There is no God but
Allah and Mohammed is his messenger."
</P>
<P>
	   That suggests Elijah wouldn't be regarded as the final prophet by Nation of
Islam members - which Farrakhan confirmed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I love prophet Mohammed," he said. "I know that he is the end of the
prophets. ... But I don't think Allah would be pleased with me if I disrespected
(Elijah Muhammad)."
</P>
<P>
	   Lawrence Mamiya, a Vassar College expert on black American religions,
conservatively estimates the core membership of the Nation of Islam to be 50,000
to 100,000. He said W. Deen Mohammed's group, the Muslim American Society, has
about 200,000 core members. The overall following is thought to be much higher
for both.
</P>
<P>
	   Experts estimate there are 4 million Muslims in the U.S. - about one million
of them black Muslims.
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout much of his speech, Farrakhan sounded as much like a Baptist
preacher as a Muslim, spending much of his time touting stronger families and
calling for an end to the separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
	   While he joked about shying away from racist comments, he did say that
American society "is set up on the principle of white supremacy." Farrakhan also
accused the U.S. government of recruiting young blacks to infiltrate and
undermine the Nation of Islam during his near-fatal bout with prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   He urged the audience to make their voices heard at a "Million Family March"
scheduled in October in Washington that is modeled after the "Million Man
March."
</P>
<P>
	   Farrakhan often included Christianity and Judaism in his calls for unity.
But there were hints that he was not speaking about all Jews - especially given
remarks made to the crowd by Rabbi Yisroel Dovid Weiss, a leader of the Neturei
Karta International orthodox Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
	   Among other things, Weiss - whose group opposes the current existence of the
state of Israel - told the crowd that the holocaust was punishment on the Jewish
people for allowing Israel to be established.
</P>
<P>
	   "They stole the Jewish name ...," Weiss said of Jews he would call only
Zionists. "Please know that there is a difference between Judaism and Zionism."
</P>
<P>
	   Assem Fadel, a Muslim who traveled from Canada to hear Farrakhan's speech,
applauded the distinction and said Farrakhan's speech provided him with "proof"
that a Muslim unification was possible among U.S. groups.
</P>
<P>
	   But such remarks are likely to anger mainstream Jewish leaders, who are
already seething over Farrakhan's past comments - including calling Judaism a
"gutter religion."
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Kotzin, executive vice president of the Jewish Federation of
Metropolitan Chicago, said he was not surprised but was disappointed by the
comments.
</P>
<P>
	   "If that's who (Farrakhan) is choosing to associate with, he's scorning the
mainstream and he is associating himself with ideas that the vast majority of
Jewish people reject - and in some cases find repugnant," Kotzin said Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's hardly a way to pursue reconciliation."

<HEADLINE> Juror: Diallo Verdict Was Clear  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM HAYS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A member of the jury that acquitted four white police
officers in the killing of Amadou Diallo said Sunday that the outcome was ``not
happy, but clear.''
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking publicly for the first time since Friday's verdict in the racially
charged case, juror Helen Harder said the jury deliberated without discord
before agreeing the law was on the side of the officers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It turned out the only way it could turn out,'' Harder, 71, told The
Associated Press. She also said that the facts of the case ``were very clear --
not happy, but clear.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, seven jurors also spoke with NBC. The jurors said they were
troubled by Diallo's actions as described by the four officers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He looked at the police officers, they identified themselves, and as they
moved toward him, he turned and backed away,'' said juror Tom Knowles in a clip
broadcast by NBC's Nightly News on the West Coast. ``Why? Why? We won't know
those answers.''
</P>
<P>
	   Two other jurors said they truly believed the officers thought their lives
were in danger.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The officers do have a right to defend themselves,'' said juror Ed Powell.
</P>
<P>
	   Harder -- who has nine children and 17 grandchildren -- described the
heartbreak of seeing Diallo's parents sitting in the front row each day of the
month-long trial.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know the cops are happy. None of (the jurors) are very happy,'' she
said. ``But that's the way it worked out.''
</P>
<P>
	   Because of pretrial publicity, an appeals court moved the murder case to
Albany, where Harder, who is white, served on a jury that also had four black
women and seven white men.
</P>
<P>
	   She didn't discuss race, but her husband, attorney George Harder, said his
wife told him that race was not an issue in the jury's deliberations.
</P>
<P>
	   Officers Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon, Kenneth Boss and Richard Murphy were
cleared of second-degree murder and other charges in the slaying of Diallo, a
West African immigrant.
</P>
<P>
	   The plainclothes officers claimed they fired 41 bullets at the victim on
Feb. 4, 1999, after he refused orders to halt for questioning and pulled out a
black object they thought was a handgun. Diallo was hit 19 times in the
vestibule of his Bronx apartment before the defendants realized the object was a
wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   Jurors have mostly remained silent since the verdict, despite constant
hounding by news organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Harder and juror Thomas Knowles said several jurors were meeting to
consider issuing a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury's black foreperson, Arlene Taylor, who once lived in the Bronx,
said in Sunday's New York Post that the three-day deliberation had ``nothing to
do with race.''
</P>
<P>
	   The defense case hinged on the emotional testimony of the officers. All said
they felt they had to shoot Diallo in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I thought they were quite believable,'' Harder said of their testimony.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge instructed jurors several times that by law if they concluded that
the officers ``reasonably believed'' Diallo was armed and dangerous, they must
acquit.

<HEADLINE> Woman's body found in abandoned home, police suspect murder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   UTICA, N.Y. (AP) - Police and prosecutors are investigating the death of
a young woman they believe was shot and killed several days ago in an abandoned
house.
<P>
	   The victim was identified Sunday night as 16-year-old Desiree Case by the
office of Oneida County Coroner Dr. Charles Brady. She had suffered at least one
gunshot wound to her chest, Brady said.
</P>
<P>
	   Oneida County District Attorney Michael Arcuri said police had not found any
weapons in the house, which had been shut down by city codes inspectors.
</P>
<P>
	   Brady said the inside of the house was littered with debris.
</P>
<P>
	   Police were led to the house by a tip from someone who knew where the body
was, but claimed not to be involved with Case's death, Brady said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Takes Delegates From Islands  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush picked up more than two dozen
delegates to the Republican national convention after sweeping presidential
primary contests this weekend in four U.S. territories, where residents won't be
able to vote for him come November if he wins the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   The delegates were chosen Saturday at caucuses in Guam, American Samoa and
the Virgin Islands, each of which had four delegates at stake. Puerto Rico held
its primary Sunday, with all 14 of its delegates going to the winner.
</P>
<P>
	   The victories increased Bush's delegate total to 93, narrowing the gap
between himself and rival Sen. John McCain. The Arizona senator had 96 delegates
going into the weekend races; a candidate needs 1,034 delegates to win the
Republican nomination for president.
</P>
<P>
	   While Bush picked up additional delegates, he cannot count on getting votes
from the islands' residents if he wins the nomination. Residents of U.S.
territories cannot vote in the general election, but are allowed to participate
in presidential primaries and caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the contests gave island Republicans a chance to be heard on the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
	   In Puerto Rico, with 99 percent of the polling stations reporting, Bush
received 89,448 votes, or 93 percent, and McCain had 5,647 votes, or about 6
percent. Former ambassador Alan Keyes and publisher Steve Forbes, who dropped
out of the GOP race earlier this month, each received less than 1 percent of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a tremendous triumph not only for Puerto Rico, but on the national
level because it is the first group of Hispanic voters that has voted solidly
with Governor Bush,'' said Jose Fuentes Agostini, the island's former Attorney
General and co-chair of the Texas governor's campaign. The campaign hopes the
win will help influence primaries in states with significant Puerto Rican
populations, such as Florida and New York.
</P>
<P>
	   During Saturday's contests, there was a motion to split Guam's four
delegates between Bush and McCain, but a binding motion to support only Bush
prevailed, said Fred Castro, the national committeeman-elect.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Virgin Islands, Republicans met on the Caribbean islands of St.
Thomas, St. Croix and St. John, said the territory's GOP committeeman, Holland
Redfield II, who refused to give a breakdown of how participants voted during
the closed assemblies.

<HEADLINE> Mighty Ducks 3, Oilers 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Marty McInnis and Fredrik Olausson scored 1:26 apart
early in the first period as the Anaheim Mighty Ducks beat the Edmonton Oilers
3-2 on Sunday to end a three-game winless streak.
</P>
<P>
	   Kevin Haller also scored for the Ducks, who killed off a four-minute power
play in the second period while ending Edmonton's three-game winning streak. The
victory was Anaheim's 20th in 34 meetings with the Oilers, the most against any
team since entering the NHL in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   They accomplished it without leading scorer Paul Kariya, out his third
straight game because of a bruised right foot.
</P>
<P>
	   Ethan Moreau and Jim Dowd scored for the Oilers, who squandered an
opportunity to go over .500 for the first time since the second game of the
season. They have lost 17 games by one goal.
</P>
<P>
	   After falling behind 2-0 in three of their previous four games, the Oilers
did it again before the game was three minutes old.
</P>
<P>
	   McInnis got his ninth goal 66 seconds after the opening faceoff when
goaltender Tommy Salo left a bad rebound on Oleg Tverdovsky's one-timer from the
high slot. Olausson then got a cross-ice pass in the left circle from Kip Miller
and put a wrist shot past right wing Bill Guerin, who tried to cover the front
of the net when Salo left his crease to challenge the unchecked Olausson.
</P>
<P>
	   Haller gave Anaheim a three-goal cushion 53 seconds before the first
intermission with a wrist shot. Moreau responded for Edmonton just nine seconds
later, backhanding his 15th goal past Guy Hebert's glove on a rebound.
</P>
<P>
	   The Northwest Division leaders trimmed Anaheim's lead to 3-2 in the second.
Guerin carried the puck down the left wing and found Dodd cruising down the slot
for his fifth goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Hebert, who returned from a two-game benching after giving up 22 goals in
his previous five starts, made 25 saves.
</P>
<P>
	   The crowd of 17,174 was only the fourth sellout for the Ducks, who
distributed little stuffed bears with Hebert's name on them to the first 5,000
fans 12 years old and younger.

Tijuana Police Chief Slain
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) -- Assailants shot and killed Tijuana's police chief
today, pumping more than 100 shots into his car as he drove along a busy
highway. Alfredo de la Torre, in charge of the police force in this violent
border town since 1998, was pronounced dead at the scene, said Enrique
Tellaeche, a spokesman for the Baja California state attorney general's office
in Tijuana. Dozens of investigators combed the city and interviewed witnesses,
but no one had been arrested. The city, home to the busiest border crossing on
Earth, is one of the main ports of entry for drugs heading into the United
States.

U.S. Issues Alert About Warfare Suits

<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon has alerted U.S. facilities around the world
that hundreds of thousands of protective suits meant to shield GIs from gas and
germ attack may have holes and other critical defects, according to military
officials and documents. The Pentagon learned about the flaws five years ago but
did not consider the problems crucial and needed the gear for U.S. peacekeeping
troops in Bosnia, criminal investigators say. On Feb. 9, the Pentagon cautioned
commanders not to use any of the 778,000 suits except in training. The suits,
not all of which are defective, cost the government almost $49 million.

Bush Cites Bob Jones 'Regret'

	   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- In a letter to Cardinal John O'Connor, the leader of
New York's Catholics, Gov. George W. Bush says his campaign appearance at a
South Carolina school with anti-Catholic views was a "missed opportunity causing
needless offense, which I deeply regret." Bush has come under steady criticism
for his Feb. 2 visit to Bob Jones University, a Christian school whose founder
has criticized the Pope and labeled the Catholic church a "Satanic cult." Bush's
opponents have assailed him for not using the appearance to speak out against
the policies of the school, which also bans interracial dating.

Justice: Youth Incarcerations Double
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of criminals under 18 serving time in adult
prisons more than doubled between 1985 and 1997 as states prosecuted more young
people as adults, a new Justice Department report shows. By 1997, 7,400 youths
17 or younger were committed to adult prisons on conviction in either juvenile
or adult courts. That's more than twice the 3,400 young people sent to the
nation's state prisons in 1985. The study comes amid debate over the merits of
meting out adult time for crimes committed by youth.

years of rule by the Socialist Party. Initially results weren't expected until
at least Tuesday. But electoral officials said late Sunday night that a

with an 89-88 victory over Philadelphia in a game the 76ers led almost from
start to finish. Larry Johnson's rebound shot tied it at 88 with 46.8 seconds to
play and then Chris Childs made 1 of 2 free throws to give New York its first
lead since early in the first quarter. Allen Iverson scored 26 points and Tyrone
Hill had 19 points and 20 rebounds for the 76ers, who led by as many as 12
points, but never were able to put the Knicks away.

<HEADLINE> Ex FBI Head Questioned Waco Tactics  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- A former top FBI official wrote in March 1993 that he was
concerned with the tactics used during the Branch Davidian siege by the FBI's
hostage rescue team commander, who also had a key role in the deadly 1992
standoff at Ruby Ridge, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dallas Morning News obtained documents that show senior FBI officials at
first were very skeptical of their on-scene commander's insistence that tear gas
was the only safe way to end the Waco standoff.
</P>
<P>
	   The memo, from the bureau's most experienced tactical expert, said hostage
rescue team commander Richard Rogers had prompted similar concerns in Ruby Ridge
standoff. In that incident, an FBI sniper under Rogers' command killed the wife
of white supremacist Randy Weaver after Rogers relaxed bureau rules of
engagement and pushed for an all-out tank and tear-gas assault on the Weavers'
cabin.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A lot of pressure is coming from Rogers,'' deputy assistant FBI director
Danny O. Coulson wrote in an internal FBI memo during the Waco siege on March
23, 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We had similar problems in Idaho with him and he argued and convinced the
SACs (local FBI special agents in charge of the incident) that Weaver would not
come out. That proved to be wrong. I believe he is a significant part of the
problem here.''
</P>
<P>
	   Coulson would not comment for the newspaper's Monday editions, and both
Rogers and Jeffrey Jamar, the FBI's special agent in charge of the Waco
operation, have declined interview requests.
</P>
<P>
	   Coulson's memo and other records The News obtained provide new details of
the FBI's internal struggles as Waco commanders pushed to use gas against the
embattled sect after a 51-day standoff.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney General Janet Reno approved a plan to gas the compound on April 19,
1993. They began with a gradual tear-gas insertion but escalated immediately to
an all-out tear gas assault after the sect began shooting at FBI tanks.
</P>
<P>
	   Six hours later, after agents increased pressure by sending tanks deep into
the building, the compound burned with sect leader David Koresh and more than 80
followers inside. Some died from fire, others from gunshots.
</P>
<P>
	   The government has maintained that the Davidians were responsible for their
own deaths. But several of the religious group's survivors and their relatives
have filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the government, claiming members of
the FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms fired into the compound.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial is set for May 14 in Waco federal court.

<TEXT>
<P>
    DALLAS (AP) -- Mike Modano's power-play goal late in the second period gave
the Dallas Stars a 1-1 tie with the Colorado Avalanche on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Stars denied Colorado goalie Patrick Roy's bid to match Jacques Plante's
434 career victories, second on the career list behind Terry Sawchuk's 447. Roy
has a career record of 433-261-102.
</P>
<P>
	   Greg De Vries had Colorado's only goal and Roy made 18 saves for the
Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
	   Dallas' best chance in the overtime came on Brett Hull's breakaway that was
turned aside by Roy with 14 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   Colorado went the other way with Milan Hejduk speeding down the right side,
but Modano tied him up and prevented a good shot with four seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Ed Belfour stopped 24 shots for the Stars.
</P>
<P>
	   Colorado took early control and scored its only goal at 9:47 of the first
period. De Vries' shot from the right circle hit off Belfour's pad and into the
net for the defenseman's second goal of the season. At that point, the Avalanche
held a 10-1 shots advantage and finished the period with a 13-2 edge in shots.
</P>
<P>
	   Dallas recovered in the second period, tying the game at 1 with 29.8 seconds
left on Modano's 29th goal. With Dallas on its fifth power play, Hull's blast
was stopped by Roy, but the puck bounced to Modano, who fired a one-timer past
Roy from the right circle.
</P>
<P>
	   Avalanche defenseman Alexei Gusarov suffered a second-period knee injury and
didn't return.

<P>
    AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Jerry Stackhouse scored 27 points in the Detroit
Pistons' 93-90 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Christian Laettner added 17 and Grant Hill 14 as Detroit won for the third
time in four games.
</P>
<P>
	   Elton Brand had 28 points and 12 rebounds in Chicago's fourth straight loss.
</P>
<P>
	   With the Pistons leading 92-89, Lindsey Hunter missed a driving layup and
Randy Brown grabbed the rebound to give Chicago a chance to tie with 14.4
seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
	   Brand missed a shot, but grabbed his own rebound and was fouled with five
seconds left. He missed the first and made the second instead of intentionally
missing, making it 92-90.
</P>
<P>
	   Chicago fouled Stackhouse, who made one of two free throws. Hunter deflected
the inbound pass, and the Bulls weren't able to get a shot off.
</P>
<P>
	   Chicago used a 10-1 run to take a 82-79 lead with seven minutes left, then
stopped their momentum by calling a timeout.
</P>
<P>
	   After Laettner tied the game with two baskets, Detroit took a 88-86 lead on
two free throws by Hunter with 2:44 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Randy Brown's short jumper tied the game with 1:25 left, but Hill hit a
short shot to put Detroit up 90-88 with 1:07 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown missed a runner and Laettner was fouled by Brand on the rebound.
Laettner missed the second free throw, but Jerome Williams grabbed the ball and
was fouled.
</P>
<P>
	   Williams also split his foul shots to put the Pistons ahead 92-88. Williams
fouled Brand, and he continued the trend by splitting his attempts, making it
92-89.
</P>
<P>
	   Detroit led by as many as 12 in the first half, but the Bulls came back
behind 14 points by Brand and 12 by Cory Carr.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bulls led 52-47 late in the second, but Detroit scored the last six of
the half to take a one-point lead into halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   Chicago took a 66-58 lead with an 11-0 run early in the third, but the
Pistons came back with an 8-0 surge to tie it at 68.
</P>
<P>
	   Stackhouse had four points and an assist during that run, and finished with
10 in the quarter as the Pistons took a 76-72 lead.

    AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Jerry Stackhouse scored 27 points in the Detroit
Pistons' 93-90 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Christian Laettner added 17 and Grant Hill 14 as Detroit won for the third
time in four games.
</P>
<P>
	   Elton Brand had 28 points and 12 rebounds in Chicago's fourth straight loss.
</P>
<P>
	   With the Pistons leading 92-89, Lindsey Hunter missed a driving layup and
Randy Brown grabbed the rebound to give Chicago a chance to tie with 14.4
seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
	   Brand missed a shot, but grabbed his own rebound and was fouled with five
seconds left. He missed the first and made the second instead of intentionally
missing, making it 92-90.
</P>
<P>
	   Chicago fouled Stackhouse, who made one of two free throws. Hunter deflected
the inbound pass, and the Bulls weren't able to get a shot off.
</P>
<P>
	   Chicago used a 10-1 run to take a 82-79 lead with seven minutes left, then
stopped their momentum by calling a timeout.
</P>
<P>
	   After Laettner tied the game with two baskets, Detroit took a 88-86 lead on
two free throws by Hunter with 2:44 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Randy Brown's short jumper tied the game with 1:25 left, but Hill hit a
short shot to put Detroit up 90-88 with 1:07 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown missed a runner and Laettner was fouled by Brand on the rebound.
Laettner missed the second free throw, but Jerome Williams grabbed the ball and
was fouled.
</P>
<P>
	   Williams also split his foul shots to put the Pistons ahead 92-88. Williams
fouled Brand, and he continued the trend by splitting his attempts, making it
92-89.
</P>
<P>
	   Detroit led by as many as 12 in the first half, but the Bulls came back
behind Brand's 14 points and 12 by Chris Carr.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bulls led 52-47 late in the second, but Detroit scored the last six of
the half to take a one-point lead into halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   Chicago took a 66-58 lead with an 11-0 run early in the third, but the
Pistons came back with an 8-0 surge to tie it at 68.
</P>
<P>
	   Stackhouse had four points and an assist during that run, and finished with
10 in the quarter as the Pistons took a 76-72 lead.

<HEADLINE> Bush 'Regrets' Bob Jones Flap  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- In a letter to the leader of New York's Catholics,
Gov. George W. Bush said he ``deeply'' regretted ``causing needless offense'' by
making a campaign appearance at a South Carolina school with anti-Catholic
views.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has come under steady criticism for his Feb. 2 visit to Bob Jones
University, a Christian school whose leaders have criticized the Pope and
labeled the Catholic church a ``Satanic cult.''
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents, including John McCain, his rival for the GOP presidential
nomination, have assailed Bush for not denouncing the school's views and its ban
on interracial dating and instead using his appearance to speak about his
conservatism.
</P>
<P>
	   In a Feb. 25 letter to Cardinal John O'Connor of New York, leader of the
archdiocese's 2.4 million Roman Catholics, Bush stated his ``profound respect''
for the Catholic Church and said the criticism of him is unfair and unfounded.
</P>
<P>
	   ``On reflection, I should have been more clear in disassociating myself from
anti-Catholic sentiments and racial prejudice,'' Bush said in the letter, which
his campaign released Sunday. ``It was a missed opportunity causing needless
offense, which I deeply regret.''
</P>
<P>
	   The letter marked an abrupt reversal for Bush, who only last week said: ``I
don't make any apologies for what I do in the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who is trying to portray Bush as a captive of the Religious Right,
planned to issue a sharp rebuke of Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson in
a speech Monday in Robertson's home base of Virginia Beach, Va.
</P>
<P>
	   A senior McCain adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, said McCain
would make the case that Robertson is putting his own personal ambition above
the interests of conservative causes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The union bosses who have subordinated the interests of working families
to their own ambitions -- to their desire to perserve their own political power
at all costs -- are mirror images of Pat Robertson,'' McCain said in an early
draft of his prepared remarks provided to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   Urging party leaders to forsake their self interest to court Democrats and
independents, McCain planned to say, ``I don't believe it is loyal to suggest
the Republican establishment is more important than to save the Republican
majority.''
</P>
<P>
	   The challenge comes just two days before the Virginia Republican primary,
and contests in Washington state and North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
	   Robertson made automated phone calls to Michigan households ahead of last
Tuesday's primary there, accusing a top McCain adviser of being ``a vicious
bigot'' who called conservative Christians ``anti-abortion zealots, homophobes
and would-be censors.'' Bush, who said Robertson made the calls on his own, lost
the primary.
</P>
<P>
	   In another development Sunday, McCain said he won't take part in this week's
GOP debate in Los Angeles because Bush was slow to agree to the California event
so McCain changed his schedule to campaign in New York instead.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's aides denied the move represented a shift in strategy and resources
away from California, where Bush leads in the polls, toward other important
states that vote on March 7, including New York, where McCain is ahead in the
polls.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush accused McCain of ducking.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's going to have to explain why he's not going to this debate,'' said
Bush, who blamed McCain for pulling out of the debate planned in California on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, campaigning in Washington state late Sunday, said he finally expressed
regret over Bob Jones racial and religious policies because ``I became very
troubled by the guilt by association and by the slandering of my good name.''
</P>
<P>
	   At a news conference before departing for Seattle, Bush said he had a change
of heart after thinking about impressions of himself as an anti-Catholic ``that
just are not true.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I regret not using the opportunity to speak out against the policies,'' he
said. ``My job is to lead the nation. My job is to convince people to follow me.
This was a missed opportunity and I regret it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush faced questions about the speech almost as soon as he finished it. In
response, he has repeatedly stated his opposition to the ban on interracial
dating and the comments of the school's leaders. Bush also has noted that a
brother and sister-in-law are Catholic.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's appearance also was the subject of telephone calls that McCain now
acknowledges his campaign placed to Michigan voters before the primary there
last Tuesday. But McCain stood by past assertions that the calls did not say
Bush was a bigot.
</P>
<P>
	   That didn't satisfy Bush, however, who contended that McCain did not speak
the truth when he initially denied knowledge of the calls that informing voters
about the university visit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a man who says he talks the straight talk. This is a man who talks
the parsed talked,'' Bush said. ``The campaign of pitting one religion against
another has got to end. Senator McCain, when given the chance to set the record
straight on who did it, couldn't come to the truth.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a television interview Sunday, McCain acknowledged approving the calls.
He said he and members of his staff originally denied they were being made
because the questions they were asked about them mischaracterized the calls as
labeling Bush a bigot.
</P>
<P>
	   The calls ``said exactly what is fact, and that is he went to this
university,'' McCain said.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Defectors Get Refugee Status  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Four Cubans who defected during last summer's Pan
American Games were quietly celebrating Sunday night after being granted refugee
status.
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy here,'' said softball coach Jose Mendez as he choked back
tears. ``This is a beautiful country. I respect the people.
</P>
<P>
	``I know we can make our future here.''
</P>
<P>
	Mendez; fencer Aristides Faure, 29; sprinter Misael Ortiz, 20; and gymnast
Yohandri Diaz, 21, are being allowed to stay in Canada.
</P>
<P>
	``I was very happy ... I had a big smile,'' Mendez, 36, said when told he could
remain in the country.
</P>
<P>
	Mendez, Ortiz and Faure met with friends to celebrate what they hope is the
first step to becoming Canadian citizens.
</P>
<P>
	They admit their first six months in a strange country were difficult -- having
to learn a new language, adapting to a new culture and getting used to the
changing weather, all without their families.
</P>
<P>
	But Mendez and Faure said the transition has been made easier with the help of
so many new friends.
</P>
<P>
	Mendez works as a cook and takes English classes at night. Faure works in a
recycling department and also takes English at night. He has resumed training
with a Canadian national fencing team coach and says his goal is to represent
Canada at the 2004 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
	Eleven people defected at the Pan Am Games. One, a Mexican, is still in
Winnipeg. It is unknown what happened to the other six, all Cubans.

<HEADLINE> Tijuana Police Chief Slain  </HEADLINE>
   By BEN FOX Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) -- Assailants shot and killed Tijuana's police chief
Sunday, pumping more than 100 shots into his car as he drove along a busy
highway.
</P>
<P>
	   Alfredo de la Torre, in charge of the police force in this violent border
town since December 1998, was pronounced dead at the scene, said Enrique
Tellaeche, a spokesman for the Baja California state attorney general's office
in Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of investigators combed the city and interviewed witnesses, but no
one had been arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was well-known and well-liked. We didn't know he was having any
problems with anyone,'' Tellaeche said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tijuana Mayor Francisco Vega de la Madrid said de la Torre had not received
any threats.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This surprised us tremendously. There were absolutely no indications that
something like this would happen,'' de la Madrid said at a news conference held
with the state attorney general and members of the Tijuana city council.
</P>
<P>
	   De la Torre, 49, was attacked as he drove home from Mass, unaccompanied by
his bodyguards, on a three-lane highway that runs along the northern edge of
Tijuana, Tellaeche said.
</P>
<P>
	   Riddled with bullet holes, de la Torre's black Chevy Suburban with tinted
windows crashed into a palm tree on the side of the road, Tellaeche said.
</P>
<P>
	   The windshield had more than a dozen bullet holes and the three windows on
the driver's side had been shot out, as was the front window on the passenger
side.
</P>
<P>
	   At the news conference, de la Madrid said the bodyguards weren't with the
chief because they were unaware that he would be leaving his home Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Government news agency Notimex reported that there were four assailants, but
investigators said they were unsure of the number of attackers.
</P>
<P>
	   Tijuana, a metropolis of 1.2 million people in northwestern Mexico across
the border from San Diego has been plagued by violence stemming from drug and
arms smuggling.
</P>
<P>
	   The city, home to the busiest border crossing on Earth, is one of the main
ports of entry for drugs heading into the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   De la Torre, who began his career as a police officer in 1976, was also the
former director of the state penitentiary in Tijuana in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   De la Madrid appointed police Commander Carlos Besneyrigoyen as interim
chief of Tijuana's 1,800-member force.
