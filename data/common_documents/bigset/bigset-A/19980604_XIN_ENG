<HEADLINE> Death Toll of German Train Crash Rises to 70 People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 3 (Xinhua) -- At least 70 people were killed and 300
others injured, most of them seriously, in Germany's worst train
accident in two decades when a high speed train crashed Wednesday
in a small northern town.
</P>
<P>
Officials in charge of the emergency operation at the scene
said the number of people killed could rise to over 100.
</P>
<P>
The accident happened when a high-speed passenger train
derailed and crashed into a road bridge at 11:10 a.m. at the small
rail station of the northeastern German town of Eschede, reports
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The InterCity-Express (ICE), the country's fastest train,
believed to have first hit a car which had plunged onto the rail
tracks from another road bridge about 100 meters away.
</P>
<P>
The car had reportedly smashed through the crash barrier of the
road bridge and plunged onto the rail tracks in front of the
oncoming train.
</P>
<P>
The train, enroute from Munich to Hamburg, crashed into the car
when traveling at about 200 kilometers per hour, derailed and
smashed into the bridge support.
</P>
<P>
The entire structure of the bridge then collapsed on the top of
the train. The train's 13 carriages were telescoped into one
another, making it difficult for the about 400 rescue workers at
the scene to retrieve those trapped in the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
According to German rail authorities, the train has seats for
759 passengers. But the number of passengers aboard the train is
still unknown.
</P>
<P>
Most of the injured people have been transported by helicopters
to hospitals. Rescue workers said they did not expect to find more
survivors in the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that most of those killed were sitting in the
first four carriages which bore the brunt of the impact.
</P>
<P>
The ICE train is Germany's fastest train with a maximum speed
of up to 280 kilometers an hour. It has never been involved in any
serious accident since being put into use in 1991.

<HEADLINE> UK Experts Calm down Fears of Long Lost Uranium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- A leading British atomic expert on
Wednesday was trying to calm down fears that a large quantity of
weapons-grade uranium disappeared from a Scottish reprocessing
plant in 1960s.
</P>
<P>
The loss of 170 kg of enriched uranium, enough to make 12
nuclear bombs, was recently disclosed in an official report. It
prompted calls from Scottish anti-nuclear campaigners for the
nuclear plant at Dounreay to be closed down.
</P>
<P>
But John McKeown, chief executive of the British Atomic Energy
Authority in charge of Dounreay, explained that although the
uranium was unaccounted for, it did not necessarily meant it had
been stolen from Dounreay, and could be due to an "accounting
uncertainty."
</P>
<P>
"Let make it clear that material did not disappear in the sense
that it went from the site," McKeown told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said in the late 1960s and early 1970s it had been difficult
to measure accurately how much irradiated material was reprocessed
-- because the plant handled a large number of small pieces from a
wide range of sources -- and how much usable material was
extracted.
</P>
<P>
The missing 170 kg is the difference between the two estimates
-- representing about one percent of the 17 tonnes of material
Dounreay reprocessed, he explained.
</P>
<P>
"Now what I'm telling you is that that was carefully assessed
by scientific experts who were satisfied that that was the cause.
It was looked into very carefully indeed," McKeown said.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Lowers Targeted Growth Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The National Development Council,
the apex body of national planning of Nepal, decided Wednesday to
lower the country's growth rate of GDP to 6.0 percent from 6.5
percent targeted in the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1997-2002).
</P>
<P>
At a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala to
review the targets of the ninth plan approach paper, the council
also decided to reduce the total investment to 372.71 billion
rupees (about 6 billion U.S. dollars) from 399.4 billion rupees
(about 6.3 billion dollars) and the total governmental expenditure
has been refixed at 189.58 billion rupees (about 3 billion
dollars) from 215.15 billion rupees (3.4 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The meeting attended by ministers, planners, economists and
representatives of various political parties, was told that the
revision was inevitable due to the internal and external changes
in the economic sector in the past one year.
</P>
<P>
Planners of the present Nepali government regard the target of
6.5 percent GDP growth as "too ambitious."
</P>
<P>
The ninth plan, which accords top priority to poverty
alleviation, should have been implemented last year, but was put
off until this year due to political uncertainty caused by
frequent change of governments.

<HEADLINE> Number of Elephants Down in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The number of elephants has been
decreasing in Nepal for the last few decades due to poaching, lack
of scientific breeding and lack of technical knowledge about the
raising of calves, Nepal Television reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The number of elephants now stands at about 138 throughout the
country, which amass at the four national parks including the
Royal National Park Chitwan, a wildlife park in the sub-tropical
Terai region of Nepal, the state-owned television said.
</P>
<P>
Efforts being made to increase the number of elephants for the
last 11 years are not very successful. The breeding center
established in 1984 at the Chitwan national park has so far raised
only five elephant calves, according to the television report.
</P>
<P>
The Himalayan kingdom of Nepal is rich in fauna and flora. But
press reports said that poaching of wildlife species has grown
over the years as the most lucrative underground profession, and
the country has become a thriving center for illegal wildlife
trade.

<HEADLINE> Lithuania Defends Plan to Join NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Lithuanian Parliament Speaker
Vytautas Landsbergis told visiting Russian lawmakers Wednesday
that Vilnius' membership in NATO "should not give rise to concern."
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency reported that Landsbergis said the
induction of Lithuania into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) would lower the danger of a potential conflict with Russia
and enhance European stability.
</P>
<P>
Russia is staunchly opposed to the Baltic states' membership in
the alliance, and has offered them security guarantees.
</P>
<P>
However, Landsbergis told a Russian State Duma delegation that
Vilnius could not accept the security guarantees because it was
not sure that Russia would follow a consistent, democratic path,
Interfax reported in a dispatch from the Lithuanian capital.
</P>
<P>
He said admission into the transatlantic military bloc remained
a foreign policy priority and was supported by all political
parties in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Russian delegation, led by the deputy chairman of the State
Duma's Committee for the Commonwealth of Independent States,
Mikhail Vakulenko, was on a two-day visit to Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will also hold meetings with senior officials in
the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry, the heads of the Lithuanian
parliamentary committees and representatives of the local Russian
community.

<HEADLINE> Finland's GNP to Grow For Five Years: Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Finland's gross national product
(GNP) is expected to grow by an average of 3.5 percent annually
for the next five years, a research institute forecast Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The figure will exceed the average of European Union countries
and the United States by one percentage point.
</P>
<P>
The growth results from a favorable international economy
environment and the country's austerity measures. Finland will
continue to cut public spending and pursue a policy of low
inflation, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
The forecast said exports will grow by an annual of 5.5 percent
and jobless rate will decline from last year's 12.6 percent to
seven percent in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, Finland has been climbing out of its worst
recession since the World War II and has achieved an average GNP
growth of 3.7 percent for the last five years. In 1997, the growth
was 5.9 percent, the highest in 20 years.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 3 (Xinhua) -- South Africa, together with
46 other countries, has again expressed concern at nuclear
testing by India and Pakistan in May.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Wednesday, the South African Department
of Foreign Affairs called on India and Pakistan to immediately
abandon the tests and to settle their differences through dialog.
</P>
<P>
J.S. Selebi, South Africa's representative to the Conference
on Disarmament, read the statement in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
He said the nuclear tests made it more imperative that the
Conference on Disarmament should actively address the issue of
nuclear disarmament and the re-emergence of a nuclear arms race.
</P>
<P>
The Conference on Disarmament is the only multilateral
disarmament negotiating forum of the international community and
plays an important role in negotiations on disarmament.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Recovers $100m From Failed Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has recovered over 10
billion Naira (about 100 million U.S. Dollars) in debts owed to
failed banks through the Failed Banks Tribunals, according to a
senior bank official.
</P>
<P>
John Ebhodaghe, Managing Director of the Nigeria Deposit
Insurance Corporation (NDIC), disclosed this Tuesday at a
workshop in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the Failed Banks Tribunals have provided the
enabling environment for the quick recovery of bad and
irrecoverable debts.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government promulgated the Decree of Failed Banks
Tribunals in 1994 for the recovery of bad debts owed to the
country's many failed banks, arising from serious corruption and
bad management.
</P>
<P>
Ebhodaghe, however, called for the amendment of the 1994
decree to enable healthy banks to have also the access to
recovering their bad debts at the tribunals.
</P>
<P>
This, he said, was made possible by the recent creation of 10
more failed banks tribunals nationwide.
</P>
<P>
He agreed that the type of debts that should be recovered in
favor of healthy banks should be limited to those debts of which
recoveries have been protracted in the ordinary court for a
period of not less than six months.
</P>
<P>
This classification, Ebhodaghe said, was necessary because a
wholesale recovery of all overdue debts owed to the healthy banks
would lead to moral hazards on the part of the banks.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes Renewing China's MFN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
proposed Wednesday the renewal of normal trade relations with
China, affirming that his policy is in the U.S. national interest.
</P>
<P>
The president said at the Rose Garden that failure to renew
China's Most-favored Nation (MFN) trade status would damage the
United States' economic and strategic relationship with that
country.
</P>
<P>
It would amount to "turning our back on a fourth of the world
at a time when our cooperation for world peace and security is
specially important in light of the recent events in South Asia,"
the president said.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the heightened tension in South Asia
following nuclear tests by India and Pakistan. Both China and the
United States have explored the nuclear explosions and worked
together to defuse the situation.
</P>
<P>
The Republican-dominant Congress has 30 days to debate over the
proposal, which was put forward amid speculations that the
president might run into a battle with the congressmen over the
Administration's China policy as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The battle is complicated by questions about the
administration's technology transfers to Beijing as well as
investigations in alleged Chinese campaign contributions. Both
China and the U.S. government have denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was joined at the announcement by Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, departing later today for Geneva for a
five-nation meeting, hosted by China, on steps to prevent an
escalation of nuclear tensions in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
"This is an important example of how our engagement with China
serves America's interests, stability in Asia, preventing the
spread of weapons of mass destruction, combating international
crime and drug trafficking, protecting the environment," Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also said that his government would continue to deal
forthrightly with China on contentious issues such as human
rights. "There have clearly been some concrete results as a
result of this engagement as well," he said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. exports to China have tripled over the last decade and now
support over 170,000 American jobs, Clinton said. "But just as
important, trade is a force for change in China, exposing China to
our ideas and our ideals and integrating China into the global
economy."
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and the chairmen of four
Senate committees, saying they were "deeply troubled by the
national security implications" of the administration's actions,
released copies of letters to Clinton and Cabinet members seeking
rafts of new documents.
</P>
<P>
The letters requested "any and all documents"in the
administration's custody pertaining to the satellite exports and
Chinese proliferation activities, including phone logs, memos,
tapes and electronic mail.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans have also called on the president to postpone
his visit to China scheduled for June. But the president rejected
the suggestion, while offering to cooperate with the
investigators.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Needs to Advertize Tourism Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
should pump more funds into advertizing its tourism attractions
overseas so as to maintain its momentum in the development of the
industry, a senior tourism official has said.
</P>
<P>
Acting Managing Director of Tanzania Tourist Board (TTB)
Edward Mbwiga said last week that although the visitors to
Tanzania in 1996 rose by 60 percent and foreign exchange earnings
grew by 168 percent over 1992's figures, the country has been
doing the least in tourism promotion compared with Kenya, South
Africa and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Limited funding for tourism promotion abroad could make it
difficult for Tanzania to realize its objective of attracting
500,000 tourists annually by the year 2000, Mbwiga said.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by Financial Times Wednesday, the TTB
acting chief said that 520,000 U.S. Dollars were allocated to the
board in fiscal year 1993/94 to promote the country's attractions
abroad, while Kenya spent 10 million U.S. Dollars for the same
purpose.
</P>
<P>
Mbwiga said that the rise of the private sector role in
tourism made the government further cut spending on tourism
during fiscal year 1995/96, while in Kenya the official
disbursement witnessed a rise.
</P>
<P>
Only 89 million Shillings (about 15,000 U.S. Dollars) were
allocated for the purpose in fiscal year 1996/97, he lamented.
</P>
<P>
The official wondered why the government is collecting money
under the Tourism Development Fund for which a 20 percent hotel
levy is being charged but with most of it being spent on other
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Last year, some 3.4 billion Shillings were collected from the
levy while funding for TTB remained at 89 million Shillings. This
indicate that the fund has a general revenue objective rather
than tourism promotion, Mbwiga said.
</P>
<P>
To attain the tourism goal by 2000, he said, it is essential
for the government to print and distribute brochures and
magazines in more than five languages.
</P>
<P>
Brochures currently in circulation are in English and French,
while an important part of the European market exists in Italy,
Spain and Germany. Therefore, tourism publications in these
languages should as well be prepared, he said.
</P>
<P>
Brochures in Japanese are also needed, he added.
</P>
<P>
The official said in 1992 the country recorded 202,000 tourist
arrivals with earnings amounting to 120 million U.S. Dollars. The
figures climbed to 323,000 arrivals with earnings of 322 million
U.S. Dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Were the country to realize the goal of attracting 500,000
visitors by the year 2000, earnings would climb up to 595 million
U.S. Dollars, he said.

<P>
He said the Tonle Sap is the heart and breath of the economy,

</P>
<P>
Its unique biodiversity and ecological characteristics, its
richness in natural resources and impressive natural beauty
deserves every effort from local, national and also international
bodies to make it a sustainable future, said Lefevre.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Varsity Closed After Student Unrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The University of Zimbabwe (UZ),
the largest higher institution in the country, has been closed
indefinitely after violent demonstrations and class boycott.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference at the UZ campus Tuesday in
Harare, Vice-Chancellor Graham Hill said since last Thursday some
students had been demonstrating in the city center peacefully but
Monday became violent, leading to the destruction of property
both in town and at the campus.
</P>
<P>
Hill was quoted by the Zimbabwe News Agency Wednesday as
saying that "this wave of destruction continued on campus last
night resulting in the damage to property and the looting of a
supermarket at the students services center."
</P>
<P>
"I am also informed and actually witnessed that students,
particularly female students, were threatened, harassed and
intimidated and that a number of them left the campus in fear,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Hill said that even after this destruction, the students
resolved to continue with the demonstrations and violence in the
city center Tuesday but the march had been circumvented by the
closure of the university."
</P>
<P>
"It is clear to me that the prevailing climate of disruption
of classes, intimidation and bullying of students and the
destruction of property are not conducive to the continued
teaching and learning operations of the university," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is in these circumstances that I took the decision to
close the university and bar students from entering the campus
until further notice," said hill.
</P>
<P>
He said that three weeks of teaching time had been lost and
all indications pointed to an escalation of violence, threat to
property and a continued boycott of classes.
</P>
<P>
"The closure of the university will enable us to work on
initiatives aimed at bringing back law and order and a return to
normalcy on campus," Hill stressed.
</P>
<P>
He added that students had advanced various reasons for the
unrest including opposition to the privatization of department of
accommodation and catering services, late disbursement of
allowances for some students and the shooting of a student by
police which resulted in a demonstration against police
brutality.

<HEADLINE> NATO Opens Disaster Response Coordination Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- NATO on Wednesday opened a special
center to coordinate the response to major natural and
technological disasters in Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council
(EAPC) member states.
</P>
<P>
The concept of the disaster response coordination center,
initiated by Russia, was endorsed by the foreign ministers of the
44-nation EAPC last Friday at their half-yearly council meeting in
Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
The Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Center
(EADRCC) will be responsible for coordinating, in close
consultation with the United Nations Office for the Coordination
of Humanitarian Affairs, the response of EAPC countries to a
disaster occurring within the EAPC geographical area, said a
senior NATO official responsible for infrastructure, logistics and
civil emergency planning.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the role of the EADRCC is to complement
the leading role of the United Nations in disaster management.
</P>
<P>
The EADRCC is coupled with a Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response
Unit to which EAPC member states voluntarily contribute qualified
personnel of rescue, equipment and materials.
</P>
<P>
Relief can be deployed upon request from the stricken country
or in support of a relevant international organization.
</P>
<P>
The EADRCC is expected to conduct regular training exercises so
as to maximize interoperability among EAPC countries.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Mining Sector Likely to Remain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's mining sector is likely
to remain depressed as the boost which was expected to come from
platinum is no longer possible due to delays in reaching full
production in Broken Hill Pty (BHP) platinum mine near Harare.
</P>
<P>
In the latest African Business quarterly released Tuesday,
Standard Chartered Bank said little growth would be realized in
the mining sector, which had been expected to recover on the back
of platinum sales this year.
</P>
<P>
"Hopes that platinum production would boost the mining sector
this year have been dashed as the start-up date for full
production at the Hartely Mine has been pushed back toward the
end of 1999," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The Hartely Platinum Mine is one of the largest platinum mine
in the world.
</P>
<P>
It added that although gold production was projected to rise
in volume, it would fall in hard currency, while asbestos, nickel
and ferrochrome were all being affected by low prices.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is the third largest gold producer in Africa after
South Africa and Ghana.
</P>
<P>
Last week Australian mining giant BHP, the joint promoters of
Zimbabwe's first platinum mine, said the mine was still
experiencing production problems and full output could only be
expected at the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Current ore output was only around 57,000 tons a month
compared with the target of 180,000 tons, while the mine was
already more than a year behind its original deadline for full
production.
</P>
<P>
However, the bank noted that business sentiment had improved
slightly following the goverment's move to revise its land reform
program and the belated launch of the second phase of economic
reforms (1996-2000).

<HEADLINE> Iran's Political Factions Urged to Speak Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Majlis (Parliament) Speaker
Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri here Wednesday called on political factions
to speak in line with principles of the Islamic revolution and
guard against those "who want to fish in the troubled water."
</P>
<P>
Addressing a Majlis open session, Nouri, a conservative who
lost last year's presidential elections to Mohammad Khatami, said
that "unity of expression is essential for revolutionary forces."
</P>
<P>
He urged all factions to avoid settling accounts with their
rivals through the Majlis tribune, and assured that there is no
fundamental disagreement among high ranking officials and heads of
the three branches of the country.
</P>
<P>
He warned that there are people in the country antagonistic to
the Islamic Revolution - they want to sow discord, and try to make
others believe that there are disputes among the leadership.
</P>
<P>
He blamed that factional struggle "encourages the enemies to go
on with their plots and schemes" and sometimes wrong performance
or analyses as well as improper statements make the enemies
hopeful.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps
Rahim Safavi also warned of the existence of "the third force" in
the country which "is at work to undo what the nation has
achieved."
</P>
<P>
The head of the elite army threatened upcoming crack-down. "We
allow them to establish groups and newspapers, but we will deal
with them at an appropriate time and we pick the fruit when it is
mellow," he was quoted as saying in a student gathering at Tehran
University.
</P>
<P>
Without specifying, the commander said the third force relies
on outsiders, aims to destroy the foundation of the religion of
the country, and is even collecting arms.
</P>
<P>
"We are fully aware of that and respond arms with arms," he
said, "when time comes we will expose foreign powers behind these
masks."
</P>
<P>
Safavi's remarks came as political struggle between the
conservatives and moderates became white-hot, with supporters of
both sides staging demonstrations that sometimes culminated in
violence and clashes.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives accuse Khatami, the moderate president who
advocates more freedom and democracy in the country, of moving
away from the values and principles of the Islamic Revolution,
which topple the late shah's regime in 1979.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that some hardliners in the conservative faction
are trying to resort to force against their rivals.
</P>
<P>
Top leaders, including the president and the supreme leader,
have called on the political factions to set aside differences and
close ranks to serve the Islamic system by "allowing different
tastes and points of view."

<HEADLINE> More Canadian Children Have No Dad at Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not only are children living through their parents' separation
at a younger and younger age, they also are over-whelmingly ending
up living with their mothers, often with intermittent or no
financial support from their fathers.
</P>
<P>
The children most likely to suffer family breakup are those
born to parents living common-law, according to figures released
Tuesday from Statistics Canada's National longitudinal Survey of
Children and Youth.
</P>
<P>
By the time they are 10 years old, 63 percent of children whose
parents lived common-law have seen their parents separate,
compared with only 14 per cent of children whose parents were
married.
</P>
<P>
The survey looks at 10-and-11-years-old children, so the latest
figures reflect those born in 1987 and 1988.
</P>
<P>
It found that one in five children now in that age group
experienced the breakup of their parents by the time they were five
years old.
</P>
<P>
Four years earlier, the one in five figure wasn't reached until
the age of six. In the early 1970s, it was age 11 and in the early
1960s it was age 16.
</P>
<P>
"Not only has separation and divorce among parents increased in
frequency over the past few decades, but it is occurring earlier
and earlier in the lives of children," the survey said.
</P>
<P>
Most children -- 86 percent -- live with their mother after
separation, the survey reported. Only 7 percent live with their
father. Six percent live in a shared-custody arrangement (going
back and forth), and one percent live in another type of custody
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
For one in three children, the separated parents do not have a
financial-support agreement.
</P>
<P>
And when there is no such agreement, the survey found, there
often isn't much contact either -- half of children whose support
isn't spelled out by court order or agreement see their
non-custodial parent less than once a month.
</P>
<P>
When there is an agreement or order, support isn't necessarily
paid -- the survey found such payment are made regularly or with
only occasional delays for just 6 out of 10 children.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Maintain Baseline Force in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 3 (Xinhua ) -- The United States has said
that it will keep a strong military presence in the Gulf region to
secure the regional stability.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Kuwait News Agency and Kuwait TV Tuesday
night, U.S. Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Thomas
Pickering said that his country has maintained a baseline force in
the Gulf for years after the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
"What we will be doing is creating a higher level of baseline
force, which will include more aircraft carriers and more missiles
in the region than ever before," Pickering said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. will maintain a rapid reinforcement
capacity in the Gulf to contain Iraq.
</P>
<P>
U.S.-led multinational forces drove Iraqi troops out of Kuwait
in the Gulf War. Since then the U.S. has maintained a military
presence in the Gulf to allegedly guarantee peace and stability in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Pickering denied that some Arab allies in the region have asked
the U.S. to reduce its armed forces in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
He said it is important to understand that American forces are
stationed in the Gulf for the common interests and common efforts
of the U.S. and Gulf Arab countries to make sure that Iraq will
not succeed in its weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official said that economic sanctions on Iraq will be
lifted until the country fully comply with the United Nations
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed the trade embargo, banning
export of oil, the main revenue earner, on Iraq in 1990 after its
invasion of Kuwait. The world organization will lift the sanctions
only after Iraq proves that it has destroyed its nuclear, chemical
and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
On the sufferings of the Iraqi people, Pickering said that the
U.S. will continue to work with the U.N. on the oil-for-food
deal and make sure the Iraqi people have food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food program reached between the U.N. and Iraq in
1996 allows Iraq to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars of oil over six
months to buy food and medicine for the Iraqi people. The U.N. has
decided to increase the amount of oil Iraq can sell to 5.2 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Pickering arrived here on Tuesday after a trip to Jordan for a
two-day visit in a Middle East tour.

<HEADLINE> Mandela, Masire Hope for Strengthened Democracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 3 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela and former Botswanan president Ketumile Masire
Wednesday expressed the hope that Zambian President Federick
Chiluba would take new measures to strengthen democracy in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a lunch with visiting Masire in Cape Town,
Mandela dismissed reports that he had played a central role in
brokering the withdrawal of coup charges against Chiluba's
predecessor, Kenneth Kaunda.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, who was arrested on Christmas Day last year on
suspicion of involvement in a coup plot, found himself a free man
on Monday after charges against him were withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Chiluba had agreed to withdraw the
charges on condition that Mandela persuaded Kaunda to quit active
politics.
</P>
<P>
"The release of (former) President Kaunda from detention is
the initiative of one man -- one man only -- and that is
President Chiluba," Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Kaunda's release was "in response to what
I've done, is not very accurate", he said, adding that Masire and
former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere had played an even
greater role in disucssing the matter with Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he hoped that Kaunda, as the father of Zamiban
independence, would be able to recognize the importance of
stepping down from party politics and "try to help Chiluba in
uniting the country".
</P>
<P>
Masire decribed the withdrawal of charges against Kaunda "as a
great thing", saying "We all feel relieved that President Chiluba
has taken this stop and we hope from now on postive things will
follow."

<HEADLINE> Economist Sees Healthy Arab Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Most Arab economies registered
healthy growth rates for the third consecutive year in 1997, an
Arab economist said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ma'Moum Hassan, director general of the Kuwait-based Arab
Institute for Investment Guarantees, said it is expected that the
economies will continue to grow due to many factors, such as
economic reform policies, growing role of the private sector and
the increasing flow of foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
According to the Kuwait News Agency, Hassan said his institute
was following key financial, economic and legislative developments
in the countries, and concluded that these factors have bolstered
investments.
</P>
<P>
Investments increased by 6.8 percent last year compared with
1996, the economist said. Good financial and monetary policies
resulting in lowering inflation have contributed to the growth, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Hassan said the gross domestic product (GDP) of eight Arab
countries out of 19 grew between 4 and 8.5 percent. However, the
GDP of Morocco fell due to a poor agriculture yield, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hassan said inflation rates in 17 countries out of 19 were
under the 10 percent margin in 1997.

UNITED NATIONS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Special Representative of
U.N. Secretary-General in Angola Alioune Blondin Bere has decided
to postpone his visit to the Headquarters of the United Nations,
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bere originally planned to come to the United Nations and brief
the Security Council on the latest situation in Angola on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Bere has postponed his visit to the Headquarters of the United

</P>
<P>
"The Security Council will consider the next steps to take
after briefed by the Special Representative," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The completion of the peace process in Angola has been stalled
mainly by delays in extension of Government authority to towns
held by the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA).
</P>

The Security Council of the United Nations has warned that it
will consider and impose additional sanctions against UNITA if it
refuses to fulfill all the obligations under the Lusaka Protocol.

<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> NATO Sends New Inspectors to Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- NATO delayed a decision on sending
allied troops to Albania but only decided on Wednesday to send
another inspection team to the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana told reporters while
inaugurating the Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination
Center that it was the only decision the weekly North Atlantic
Council meeting took.
</P>
<P>
The council is the policy maker of the 16-nation western
military alliance.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief said that the alliance had to wait for the team
to return and report on its findings before making further moves.
</P>
<P>
But Solana said that NATO is very concerned about the current
situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
NATO has sent several inspection teams to Albania in the past
few weeks, mostly to gauge the country's infrastructure for coping
with the possible influx of refugees.
</P>
<P>
NATO foreign ministers decided at their last week council
meeting to study the possibility of a preventive deployment of
between 7,000 and 23,000 troops to help guard the northern border
of Albania to fend off any spillover of the violence from
neighboring Yugoslavia's province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
NATO defense ministers are meeting in Brussels next week and
they are expected to focus on the alliance action in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Press reports claimed that thousands of refugees were moving on
the Kosovo side of the hills separating the Yugoslavia province
and Albania.
</P>
<P>
Solana said that the newly-opened Euro-Atlantic Disaster
Response Coordination Center may be of help if the refugee problem
deteriorates along the Kosovo-Albania borders.

<HEADLINE> Half Cypriot Children Face Overweight: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus on Wednesday stressed the
need to improve children's diet because an alarming number of them
are facing the health problem of overweight.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by the Cypriot ministries of health and
education showed that 53 percent of the country's children in the
11 to 12 age group have cholesterol levels above the recommended
threshold.
</P>
<P>
Tests on 11,000 children at the ages have revealed that 46
percent of the girls and 34 percent of the boys are overweight,
while 6 percent of the girls and 16 percent of the boys are obese.
</P>
<P>
Only half of the Cypriot children have the proper weight for
their height.
</P>
<P>
The survey aimed to give general health information to children
who took part, as well as individual attention attention to each
child.
</P>
<P>
Michalis Tormaritis, a specialist of Greek University of Crete,
who took part in the survey, warned that children in Cyprus
consume more calories than anywhere else in the world.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot Health Minister Christos Solomis said that children's
diet needs improvement. He called for healthy eating habits which
must filter down through the family.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Praises Chirac's Comments on Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's Muslim group Hezbollah, or
Party of God, Wednesday praised French President Jacques Chirac's
recent remarks on Israeli withdrawal proposal, saying they could
force Israel to freeze its "manoeuvre" for a while.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General of the Iranian-backed group Sheikh Hassan
Nasrallah said at a religious rally that France's new stance
which he said was initially ambiguous toward Israeli conditional
withdrawal proposal could effectively influence other European
countries and lead to the shelving of it by Israel for a while.
</P>
<P>
During his third visit in two years to Lebanon on May 29-31,
Chirac called on Israel to comply with the United Nations
Resolution 425 without any conditions.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed rejection to any attempt to amend the
resolution for a conditional withdrawal, saying that any change
would have to get the approval of Lebanon beforehand.
</P>
<P>
His remarks triggered scathing reaction from Israel. Israeli
radio quoted a senior official as saying that Israel didn't
impose any preconditions for a pullout and those conditions were
originally included in the resolution.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old resolution calls for an immediate and
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon where it set
up a 1,200-square-kilometer so-called security zone in 1985
allegely to protect its northern borders from cross border
attacks.
</P>
<P>
On April 1, Israel formally endorsed the resolution and
offered to withdraw from south Lebanon on condition that Lebanon
provides security guarantee for its north before its pullout.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon rejected the offer, saying it contradicted the
unconditional nature of the resolution.
</P>
<P>
But Israel didn't give up and wanted to go head with its
proposal by amending the resolution.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah said Israel could stop its manoeuvre for some time
but not permanently as Israel always launches a political
campaign from time to time in a bid to make more troubles.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war to drive 2,000 Israeli
troops out of south Lebanon.

ANKARA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Foreign Ministry on
Wednesday denied that Pakistan and Turkey were trying to cooperate
in developing nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Recent reports regarding the alleged Pakistani-Turkish nuclear
plan was "totally baseless," the Anatolia News Agency quoted a
written statement issued by the ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
Western media have reported that Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sherif proposed that Pakistan and Turkey jointly produce nuclear
weapons during a meeting with Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
in mid-May.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish statement described the reports as "a product of
imagination" and said "Turkey has no intention of producing any
nuclear, biological and chemical weapons."
</P>
<P>
Turkey will abide by all the agreements it has signed with the
international community in a determined manner, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It also expressed grave concern over the nuclear tests that
India and Pakistan conducted in the past weeks, saying that these
irresponsible acts might lead to a nuclear arms race in the
southern Asia.

MOSCOW, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Russia regarded the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as a major pole in the emerging
multi-polar world and will become its full partner in the
strategic dialogue, a Senior Russian official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency reported that senior officials from
Russia and the ASEAN met here and discussed strategic security
issues.

concern about the nuclear tests in India and Pakistan and said
they are closely watching the ongoing meeting of the five U.N.
permanent members who have gathered in Geneva to discuss the
situation in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
According to Karasin, the ASEAN position is that Russia, China,
the United States and Japan are the guarantors of security in the
Asian-Pacific region and should become a "political vanguard to
make the countries in the region feel secure."
</P>
<P>
Karasin said earlier today, Russia stated its intention to
expand economic cooperation with the APR countries. The Russian
Federation should not confine its ties only to the West. Russia
must advance its companies and banks to this region because
Russia's future is in the Asian-Pacific region, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Coalition Splits Over Redeployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Moderate and hawkish members of
Israeli coalition traded accusations Wednesday amid reports that
the United States would soon announce its decision on Israeli
troop redeployment on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Moderate members of the Knesset (Parliament) within the
Likud-led coalition touched off the debate by initializing a
campaign to support Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over making
the long-delayed decision on the scope of the second redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The moderates, including Likud's Zeev Boim, Yisrael Baaliya's
Roman Bronfman and Alexandre Lubostsky of the Third Way, charged
the far-rightist members for trying to torpedo Netanyahu's effort
to make the decision on the redeployment. They called for a full
coalition meeting next week to show support for the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the Knesset, Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai, widely-considered the leading dove in the coalition,
came out again for an agreement with the Palestinian side. The
minister, who held talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in
Cairo Tuesday, declared that "it's high time to decide on the
second redeployment."
</P>
<P>
The Far-right members rejected the charge and accused the
moderates of weakening the prime minister in the midst of the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Nisan Slominavsky, of the far-rightist National Religious
Party (NRP), said it was "unbelievable" that the moderates asked
Netanyahu to give up more while he was facing pressure from the
U.S. administration. "I can't understand them," he said.
</P>
<P>
The NRP faction, which owns nine of 61 coalition seats in the
Knesset, has insisted that it would topple the government if
Netanyahu agrees to withdraw from more than 9 percent of the West
Bank. If Netanyahu gave up more land, some coalition members would
"vote against him," Slominavsky said.
</P>
<P>
Tension within the coalition flared up at a time when
Netanyahu was reportedly trying to wrap up an agreement with the
Palestinians over the second withdrawal in the West
Bank. Netanyahu said that once he had a "good deal," he would
move forward regardless of opposition inside his own coalition.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the prime minister was planning to combine
the three stages of redeployment into a 15 percent pullback, and
if it was accepted by the U.S. and the Palestinians, he would
make further concessions.
</P>
<P>
But the government is likely to fall if Netanyahu fails to
convince the hawkish coalition members to support him when the
redeployment decision is put to vote in the Knesset. The
government is now holding the minimum majority of 61 seats in the
120-member Knesset.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that, if the opposition Labor Party refuses to
provide a safety net for Netanyahu on the pullback issue, the fall
of the government and the holding of new elections would be
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Edward Walker said
Wednesday that he expected a decision to be made "very soon" on
the U.S. compromise proposal for a 13 percent pullback. Speaking
after his talks with Labor leader Ehud Barak in Tel Aviv, he
stressed that a decision should be made within days, not weeks.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has threatened to make public the widely leaked but
never publicized plan and openly blame Israel for its failure to
break the impasse in the peace process if it rejects the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Previous reports said U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
had set an unofficial deadline for Netanyahu to submit Israel's
ultimate redeployment plan to Washington by the end of this week,
if not sooner.

The government has set a goal to provide free education to the
youths to enable them to contribute to the national economic

</P>
<P>
Over two decades civil war in Angola has affected greatly the
country's education facilities. Many youths in their 20s have
not received schooling of any sort. A high rate of illiteracy
has become the hindrance for the country's economic development.

Making professional education a top priority, the Angolan

<HEADLINE> Lebanon, Not Israel, Needs Security Guarantees: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri said on Wednesday that it is Lebanon, not Israel, that
needs security guarantees.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Egyptian Ahram Abdu newspaper, Hariri
said that Israel does not need security guarantees because it
possesses nuclear weapons and powerful armed forces, with which it
occupies Lebanon's territory.
</P>
<P>
Israel has never officially confirmed it has nuclear weapons,
but foreign experts estimate that it has stockpiled 200 nuclear
bombs.
</P>
<P>
Hariri was referring to an Israeli demand that the two
countries negotiate security arrangements before Israel withdraws
from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in 1985 in
south Lebanon to allegedly protect its northern areas from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese Muslim guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
On April 1, the Jewish state decided to endorse the United
Nations Security Council Resolution 425, which calls for
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But it attached its troop pullback to Lebanon's security
guarantees for its northern areas.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has rejected the offer, insisting the withdrawal be
unconditional.
</P>
<P>
Hariri called on European Union countries to pressure Israel to
carry out the relevant U.N. resolutions and adhere to its
commitments to push forward the Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> More Than 100 Bodies Recovered after German Train Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ESCHEDE, Germany, June 3 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 bodies have
been recovered from the wreckage of a German high-speed train
which derailed and crashed into a bridge Wednesday morning in the
northeastern German town of Eschede, rescue officials said.
</P>
<P>
The death toll was expected to rise further, said officials of
the emergency rescue center on the scene.
</P>
<P>
The accident, which is believed to be the most serious one in
modern German history, happened when the InterCity Express (ICE)
train derailed and crashed into a nearby road bridge at 11:10 a.m.
at the small rail station of Eschede.
</P>
<P>
Earlier media reports said the train, enroute from Munich to
Hamburg, was derailed after hitting a car which had plunged onto
the rail tracks after a road accident.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman, however, said the automobile concerned had
actually parked on the bridge and fallen onto the ground after the
bridge collapsed due to the train crash.
</P>
<P>
The first four carriages of the train were telescoped into one
another and wedged under the damaged bridge. Rescue workers are
still unable to reach two of the wagons at the moment.
</P>
<P>
According to German rail authorities, the train has seats for
759 passengers. But the actual number of passengers aboard the
train is still unknown.
</P>
<P>
A fleet of 15 helicopters have been deployed to transport the
injured to nearby hospitals. About 400 rescue workers, soldiers
and policemen are busy on the scene.
</P>
<P>
The ICE train is Germany's fastest train with a maximum speed
of up to 280 kilometers an hour. It has never been involved in any
serious accident since being put into use in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Calls on Russia to Modernize Financial System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Wednesday called on Russia to modernize its financial system as
one way to re-obtain confidence of foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with visiting Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko in the Elysee palace, Chirac said that the financial
crisis which has struck Russia is causing French concern, said
presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna.
</P>
<P>
"It seems necessary...to establish a stable financial framework
in Russia, which will improve the fiscal collection, create a
modern and transparent banking system, and a legal and fiscal
framework, to give confidence to investors," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his confidence in the "capacity of Russia to
bring to a satisfactory conclusion its policy of reforms."
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko, who arrived here Wednesday on his first visit abroad
since taking office in April, said that Russia is determined to
carry through its reform programs and implement the "emergency and
drastic measures" adopted by his government.
</P>
<P>
He thanked France and other members of the Group of Seven most
industrialized nations for their support to Russia, but described
the decision by International Monetary Fund to send 670 million
U.S. dollars of financial aid to Russia as "psychological" rather
than substantial support.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko also called for equal access to the international
market, especially the markets in the European Union countries, by
Russian products, and an elimination of "discriminatory
constraints" in trade.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Chirac also called on Russia to use its
influence on Serbia to help solve the crisis in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko will co-chair on Thursday with his French counterpart
Lionel Jospin a session of the 4th Franco-Russian Commission of
Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
French and Russian officials will discuss the establishment of
an assembly plant by the French automaker Renault in Moscow, as
well as cooperations in nuclear energy, oil, outer space
exploration and aeronautics, and agriculture and food processing
industry.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Moscow on Thursday, Kiriyenko will also meet
with French entrepreneurs to persuade them to increase investments
in Russia.
</P>
<P>
French investments in Russia stand between 200 and 400 million
U.S. dollars, according to different calculating systems of the
two countries.

<P>
MOSCOW, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Russia does not see India and
Pakistan as nuclear club members though they conducted a series of
nuclear tests, Russian Foreign Ministry stated on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency quoted the Ministry's spokesman Valery
Nesterushkin as saying that "Despite the series of nuclear tests
conducted by India and pakistan, Russia views them as states that
do not possess nuclear weapons."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said, "It is precisely in this capacity that we
urge these countries to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty."
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the treaty, a country is considered a
nuclear state if it had produced and tested a nuclear weapon or
another nuclear device by January 1, 1967, Nesterushkin said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in experts' opinion, neither Pakistan nor India has
done everything necessary to convert nuclear devices to warheads
and place them on delivery vehicles.
</P>
<P>
On the meeting of foreign ministers of the five nuclear powers
(Russia, the United States, France, Britain, and China) in Geneva
on Thursday, the spokesman said, "the basic goal of the meeting is
to coordinate positions and find approaches that would conduce
Delhi and Islamabad to stop further development of their nuclear
programs and join the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty."

<HEADLINE> Rains Slow Down ECOMOG Operation in S. Leone: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Rains are slowing down efforts by
the west African peace-keeping force ECOMOG to close in on the
remnants of the forces loyal to ousted junta leader Johnny Paul
Koromah in Sierra Leone, ECOMOG official said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking with newsmen at the Lagos airport on his way to
Abuja, ECOMOG commander Timothy Shelpidi said
Wednesday that ECOMOG troops have been unable to move as fast as
they did when they began the operation in February.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG entered Sierra Leone soon after Koromah's coup last May
and had succeeded in driving out Koromah from capital Freetown in
February, thus making its possible for elected President Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah to resume his power in March.
</P>
<P>
The peace-keeping force has since then been trying to mop up
the remnants of Koromah's forces throughout Sierra Leone
especially in the northern and eastern parts.
</P>
<P>
Shelpidi said the junta forces have run short of ammunition
and supplies and have restored to attacking innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
"The unfortunate thing about this incident is that they have
unleashed lot of atrocities on innocent villagers, seizing their
livestock, foodstuff and raping women," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shelpidi called on the international community to assist
ECOMOG to solve its logistic problems, including airlifting its
troops and provision of helicopters and vehicles.
</P>
<P>
He added that about 75 percent of the equipment used by ECOMOG
in its eight years of peace-keeping mission in Liberia have been
moved to Sierra Leone.

Center of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM), said in a
statement that a survey team of the commission is to find out the
number of the warheads.
</P>
<P>
But Carlstrom did not say how many warheads the team has
uncovered.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM is charged with overseeing the elimination of Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction, namely nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons as well as long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
Only when UNSCOM certifies that Iraq has destroyed the banned
weapons, will the U.N. Security Council lift the economic
sanctions imposed in 1990 after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, which
triggered the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Iraq says it has destroyed all the chemical and biological
warheads. But the U.N. says it will not take its words. The work
of the team, which arrived here two weeks ago and will finish its
mission by June 18, will help UNSCOM verify Iraq's claims.
</P>
<P>
Of Iraq's weapons files, the missile and nuclear files are near
closing.

<HEADLINE> Britain Says It Stands Firm with U.S. on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Defense Minister
George Robertson said Wednesday that his country stands firm with
the U.S. in maintaining a military threat and economic sanctions
on Iraq until the country's doomsday weapons are gone.
</P>
<P>
Robertson and U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen announced a
joint U.S.-British program to explore ways to counter the threat
of a chemical or biological weapon attack, including by developing
protective equipment and vaccines and by sharing intelligence
information.
</P>
<P>
"These are just some of the areas we are exploring," Cohen
said, noting that the United States and Britain have unique ties
that allow close cooperation. "We have a very strong friendship."
</P>
<P>
Robertson vowed that the United States can count on British
military support in the Gulf if Iraq begins to backslide on
agreements to allow U.N. weapons inspectors to search Saddam's
palaces and other Iraqi sites for weapons and documents.
</P>
<P>
"America is not alone politically or militarily," Robertson
said
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before meeting Cohen, Robertson said Iraq
still hasn't provided full disclosure of records to assure the
weapons have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
A tense military buildup led by U.S. forces and backed by the
British military in February forced Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
to allow U.N. inspectors full access to suspected sites of weapons
making and storage of key data on its suspected biological and
chemical weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. decided to reduce its troops in the Gulf to 20,000 in
May from the 37,000 in February. The British aircraft carrier, the
HMS Illustrious, left the Gulf in March, but Britain beefed up its
fighter-bomber force from eight to 12 to compensate.

<HEADLINE> Arafat in Oman to Push for Arab Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
arrived in Omani capital Muscat Wednesday to continue his push for
holding an Arab summit to discuss the stalled Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the airport, Arafat lashed out at Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for violating the signed
agreements with the Palestinan National Authority (PNA), according
to reports reaching here from Muscat.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said the agreements signed by the two sides were
international ones signed under the aegis of the United States and
Russia, and with mediation by the European Union, Norway, Egypt,
and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The PNA president said the Middle East peace process is
experiencing hard times due to the hardline policies adopted by
the Israeli government. "This visit comes in the middle of hard
times for the peace process because of the intransigence of
Netanyahu and his government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was referring to the 15-month deadlock in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process since March 1997 when Israel
started construction of the Har Homa settlement in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Israeli-Palestinian dispute centers on the scope
of the second phase of Israeli troop withdrawal in the West
Bank. Israel has until now rejected a U.S. proposal calling for a
13 percent pullback, which has been accepted in principle by the
PNA.
</P>
<P>
By proposing to convene an Arab summit, Arafat attempts to
increase the pressure on the Israeli government to prevent further
delay in carrying out the second redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Before his visit to Oman, Arafat had already traveled to
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. During his stay in
Oman, the Palestinian leader is expected to meet Sultan Qaboos Bin
Said to discuss latest developments of the peace process and
to coordinate the Arab stance toward Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is also expected to visit other Arab states, including
Jordan and Sudan to continue lobbying support for holding an Arab
summit.

<HEADLINE> Extra Holiday for Britons to Mark New Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LONDON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Britons will be able to take the day
off on New Year's Eve 1999 as the government granted an extra
public holiday for the Millennium.
</P>
<P>
Culture, Media and Sport Secretary Chris Smith said in a
statement to parliament that the extra holiday, which falls on
Friday, will give people the weekend and the Monday bank holiday to
recover from the New Year celebrations.
</P>
<P>
"I know that large numbers of people will welcome this
opportunity to prepare for the festivities on New Year's Eve and
New Year's Day 2000," Smith said.
</P>
<P>
The period around the end of the year already provides many
Britons with an extended midwinter break.
</P>
<P>
Christmas Day, the following day, known in Britain as Boxing
Day, and New Year's Day are already public holidays and workers
get days off in lieu if they fall at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Smith said a government consultation exercise had shown
"overwhelming support" for the extra holiday on the last day of
the second millennium.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Sharply up on Good Company Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
sustained Tusday's gains and ended sharply higher Wednesday, with
Paris hitting a new record closing high, boosted by
better-than-expected company earnings and good performance in some
stocks.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE-100 index of leading shares on the London market ended
56.1 points or nearly one percent higher at 5,898.4, only a shade
below the 5,900 level, encouraged by a strong performance in other
major European bourses.
</P>
<P>
However, volumes remained light as investors kept to the
sidelines ahead of Thursday's Bank of England interest rate
decision.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Railtrack shares rose comfortably on the
back of strong results and government plans to complete the
long-delayed high-speed rail link between London and the Chunnel
tunnel.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares closed 30.98 points or 0.55 percent
up at 5,613.76 on the DAX-30 index, due to positive interest rate
outlook and signs of improving confidence in the Russian economy,
traders said.
</P>
<P>
The market was also inspired by the better-than-expected first
quarter earnings figures released by Deutsche Telekom AG and
market optimism that Volkswagen AG would do the same at Thursday's
shareholders' meeting.
</P>
<P>
On the Paris bourse, the CAC-40 index closed at a new record
high at 4,149.37, up 62.39 points or 1.53 percent as late buying
pushed the index sharply higher.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that a scarcity of sellers in the market induced
buyers to propel prices up.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, positive sentiment in the pharmaceutical, auto and
retail sectors also gave the market strong support, but there was
also some profit-taking in some stocks.

<P>
OTTAWA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Thieves made off with nearly two
tonnes of explosives in the Canadian province of New Brunswick,
police said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The thieves broke into a storage area of a gravel pit in the
city of Moncton around May 28 and stole a large amount of dynamite
sticks and detonators.
</P>
<P>
The provincial police has made a plea for help to track down
the stolen explosives, reports said.

Police fear that the explosives could end up in the hands of
criminals groups and endanger the society.
</P>
<P>
Over the past six weeks, three explosive devices were found in
the city Saint John, about an hour's drive from Moncton.
</P>
<P>
One bomb blew up outside a provincial police station and
another two unexploded ones were discovered outside a courthouse

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Forms New Cabinet, Former FM Dumped  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Two leading members of the
ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) have been left out of
Lesotho Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The two figures are the younger brother of former prime
minister Ntsu Mokhehle, Shakhane Mokhehle, and the party's
national chairman and former foreign minister Kelebone Maope.
</P>
<P>
Among the new faces is Mokhehle's former special adviser, Tom
Thabane, who replaces Maope as foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
The radio said the new ministers were appointed by King Letsie
III, on the advice of Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili, South
African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Maope, the second most prominent figure after Mosisili in the
LCD, had been considered a challenger of Mosisili for the post of
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Mosisili has three portfolios -- prime minister, minister of
defense and minister of public service.
</P>
<P>
Two portfolios -- minister of works and transport and minister
of agriculture, cooperatives and land reclamation -- were not
filled.
</P>
<P>
There had been some restructuring of portfolios, including the
establishement of the Ministry of Environment, Women and Youth
Affairs. This will be handled by the only female member of the
cabinet, Mamoshebi Kabi.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet will be sworn in by the king at the Basutho Royal
Palace in Maseru Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
The names of Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili, and Leketekete
Ketso, minister of finance and development planning, Mopshatla
Mabitle, minister of local government and home affairs, Tom
Thabane, minister of foreign Affairs are found in the 14 members
cabinet.

<HEADLINE> India, Pakistan Incline to Talk: Iran's FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi said Wednesday that India and Pakistan have agreed in
principle to restart negotiations to reduce tension following
their nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
"In my talks with both Pakistani and Indian officials, we
arrived at a conclusion that the two sides showed interest in
waning tension in the region and also agreed in principle to
restart their negotiations," Kharrazi said on his return from a
three-day visit to Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Republic News Agency quoted him as saying that
officials of two countries desired to see that all issues,
including the Kashmir issue, would be on the agenda of the
negotiations, and no nuclear test would be conducted until results
of their talks are finalized.
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere is conducive for Indian-Pakistani serious and
comprehensive talks, Kharrazi said, adding there are also positive
signs that the two would agree to sign on to the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty.
</P>
<P>
He said he would present the results of his talks with Indian
and Pakistani officials to the disarmament conference in Geneva,
but rejected media reports that he was mediating between Islamabad
and New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Iran's stance, Kharrazi said Tehran does not
encourage the procurement and manufacturing of nuclear weapons and
it is not at all interested in doing so.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, it is a reality that Pakistan has nuclear
power capability, and it is quite natural that when an Islamic
country is in possession of nuclear capability, such a factor
would contribute to it being a deterrent to Israel which has
similar weapons.
</P>
<P>
"Iran does not have any plan absolutely for the acquisition of
nuclear weapon, but on the contrary, Iran wants to see that
nuclear disarmament program become effective," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iran believes the region should initially be a non-nuclear zone
and the world become fully free of any nuclear weapons, he added.

CAIRO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- A high-level Iranian economic
delegation is expected here next week on a five-day trade-boosting
trip to Egypt as Cairo and Tehran seek to repair long-strained
diplomatic ties, the Middle East News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 25-strong delegation comprising businessmen, investors and
members of the Iranian Chamber of Commerce, have been invited by
Chairman of the Egyptian Industries Federation Abdel Moneim Saudi.
</P>
<P>
The visit is a reply to one made by a delegation from the
Egyptian federation to Iran in March when the two sides discussed
prospects for holding an exhibition of Egyptian products in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are expected to prepare for the executive steps
for holding the exhibition in a bid to elevate bilateral economic
and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Iranian Charge d'Affaires in Cairo
Akbar Kassemi said Wednesday that Egypt and Iran are now moving
toward further boosting their relations.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian-Iranian ties have been improved following the talks
held by former Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati with
senior Egyptian officials during his visit to Cairo last year, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been trying to improve relations with its one-time foe
Egypt, which have been strained since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

ADDIS ABABA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Foreign Ministry
announced that the Ethiopian forces Wednesday repulsed Eritrea's
attacks on the Ethiopian territory in the vicinity of Zala
Ambessa, Aiga and Aliteina.
</P>
<P>
The official Ethiopian News Agency Wednesday quoted a press
statement from the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry as saying that
Eritrean troops launched "another attack Wednesday morning in the
vicinity of Zala Ambessa, Aiga and Aliteina, an effort as usual
designed to create facts on the ground which failed".
</P>
<P>
The press statement said Eritrea has made "yet another attempt
to take over additional Ethiopian localities in the past few
days, specifically the localities of Aiga and Aliteina".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Eritrean Foreign Ministry said in Asmara,
capital of Eritrea, that the Ethiopian army Wednesday "unleashed
an attack on Eritrean positions in the Ambesete Geleba area of
southern Eritrea".
</P>
<P>
The press release said, "This attack represents a new and
dangerous escalation of the crisis between Eritrea and Ethiopia."
</P>
<P>
It accused that "The Ethiopian army had launched four attacks
inside Eritrea over the past few days: on May 22, 23 and 25 in
Setit area, and on May 31 in the Aiga-Aliteina areas."
</P>
<P>
The international community has pursued mediations between the
two countries since the Ethiopian government termed an invasion
of the Ethiopian locality of Badme and part of Sheraro by
Eritrean forces on May 12, this year.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Policing Commission Members Named </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Britain named an international
commission Wednesday which is responsible for restructuring the
Northern Irish police force under the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The commission is headed by Chris Patten, the former Hong Kong
governor, and made up of seven members. They include professors,
lawyers and crime experts from Britain, Canada and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The commission has been established under a historic accord
approved by voters last month which saw policing reforms as a key
element in reducing tension in the British province.
</P>
<P>
Patten, the commission chairman, pledged in a statement that
the commission would consult widely and report by a deadline of
summer 1999.
</P>
<P>
During decades of guerrilla war and sectarian strife, policing
in Northern Ireland has been a divisive issue between majority
Protestants who owe allegiance to Britain and minority Catholics
who want to end British rule.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Ulster Constabulary, the 13,000-strong police force,
is dominated by pro-British Protestants and is viewed with
hostility by the Catholics who wish to see a united Irish island.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, the political arm of the outlawed Irish Republican
Army (IRA), and one of the signatories to the peace accord, wants
the RUC disbanded.
</P>
<P>
Britain however says there is no question of abolishing the
force, which has lost some 300 members mostly in IRA guerrilla
attacks.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister stressed Tuesday while visiting Belfast
that the Northern Ireland police force will not be disbanded.

ANKARA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministers of the Balkan
countries are due to gather Turkey's largest city of Istanbul on
June 8 to 9 to discuss regional security and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo issue and the establishment of the Southeastern
European Multinational Peace Troops will be high on the agenda, a
Turkish Foreign Ministry statement said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Romania, the Yugoslav Federation,
Greece as well as Turkey will participate in the conference.
Foreign ministers from Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia will be
present as observers.
</P>
<P>
The massive bloody clashes between the Serbian police and
ethnic Albanians living in Kosovo, Yugoslavia have caused grave
concern among the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic Albanians are seeking independence from the
Yugoslav Federation but the request has been rejected by
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Some Balkan states such as Turkey and Bulgaria have called for
the formation of a multinational peace-keeping force, whose duty
is to maintain peace and stability in the region, a hotbed of
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Besides general discussions, the ministers are also expected
to hold busy bilateral talks during the two-day session.
</P>
<P>
The Istanbul meeting is a follow-up of the Balkan summit in the

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Aiming to break the protracted
deadlock in their peace talks, Israeli and Syrian negotiators met
secretly last week in the United States, Israeli state television
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Channel I disclosed that three Israeli and three Syrian
negotiators took part in the four-day meetings in Houston for the
first time in two years. The talks were hosted by former
U.S. Secretary of State James Baker and U.S. Assistant Secretary
of State Martin Indyk, a former U.S. Ambassador to Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian side was represented by Syrian Ambassador to the
U.S. Walid Moualim, and the Israeli delegation led by Uzi Arad,
top diplomatic aide to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The report added that the Houston talks were aimed at seeking
ways to resume the peace talks between the two countries, which
came to an halt in March 1996.
</P>
<P>
Syria wants to reach a peace treaty with Israel on condition
that Israel returns the strategic Golan Heights captured by Israel
in the 1967 War.
</P>
<P>
Damascus has been demanding the Netanyahu-led government resume
the talks from the point where the talks were left off, namely on
the basis of an informal promise made by former Israeli Labor
government on a total withdrawal from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Until now, Netanyahu has publicly rejected the Syrian demand,
insisting that the talks should be resumed without any
conditions. Most parties within his right-wing coalition are
opposed to relinquishing the whole Golan heights, citing
security reasons.

defense forces and the Palestinian National Authority are
preparing for the scenarios.
</P>
<P>
As the United States has threatened to make public its proposal
calling for a 13.1 percent Israeli pullback, tensions were
mounting in the Knesset Wednesday as moderate and far-right
factions of the coalition traded accusations over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Moderate Knesset members touched off the debate by launching a
campaign to support Netanyahu, who they said is moving toward an
agreement with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
They accused rightwingers of trying to torpedo Netanyahu's
effort to take a decision on the withdrawal and called for a
cabinet meeting next week to show their support for the prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
The rightwingers rejected the charge and blamed the moderates
for weakening Netanyahu's position in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Nisan Salominavsky of the National Religious Party said it was
"unbelievable" that the moderates asked Netanyahu to give up more
lands under pressure from the United States. "I can not understand
them," he said.
</P>
<P>
What is agreed upon by the two factions is that the coalition
would fall apart over the issue of troop pullback and the
possibility of an early election is emerging.
</P>
<P>
If Netanyahu agrees to hand over more lands than the
rightwingers can tolerate to the Palestinians, some coalition
members would "vote against him," Salominavsky said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is reportedly trying to reach an agreement with the
Palestinians over Israeli withdrawal. He has said that once he has
a "good deal," he would move forward regardless of opposition
inside his own coalition.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said that Netanyahu is planning to combine the
three stages of pullback into a single-phase withdrawal from 15
percent of the West Bank, and if it is accepted by the U.S. and
the Palestinians, he might make further concessions.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Albright Outline Goal of Geneva Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said
Wednesday that the U.S. goal at a Geneva meeting is fo work out a
strategy to press India and Pakistan to stop their nuclear arms
race and to build a peaceful stable South Asia.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the remarks after he discussed the South Asian
situation with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and National
Security Adviser Sandy Berger.
</P>
<P>
Albright will leave for Geneva to attend a meeting, scheduled
for Thursday, with the foreign ministers of the five permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council to discuss how to reverse the
arms race in South Asia after India and Pakistan detonated their
nuclear explosions last month.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to forge a common strategy to move India and
Pakistan back from their nuclear arms race and to begin to build a
more peaceful stable region," Clinton told news conference at Rose
Garden following his meeting with his top foreign policy aides.
</P>
<P>
The president said the United States initiated the Geneva
conference because he believed the nuclear tests conducted by
India and Pakistan were "self-defeating, wasteful and dangerous."
</P>
<P>
They also "stand in stark contrast to the progress the world
had made over the past several years, in reducing stockpiles and
containing the spread of nuclear weapons," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton urged the Senate to quickly approve the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty, he signed at the United Nations two years ago, as
the situation in South Asia "makes it all the more important" for
the Senate to debate and vote on the CTBT without delay.
</P>
<P>
"If we're calling other nations to act responsibly, America
must set the example," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton praised China for its vital role for peace in the
region, saying, "Let me express my appreciation to China for
chairing the (Geneva) P-5 meeting to which Secretary Albright is
going."
</P>
<P>
"This is further evidence of the important role China can play
in meeting the challenges of the 21st century, and the
constructive Chinese leadership that will be essential to the
long-term resolutions of issues involving South Asia," he added.
</P>
<P>
Albright set out three concrete goals of the Geneva meeting.
The first is to send a message to India and Pakistan that "there
should be no further nuclear testing, no deployment of testing of
missiles, no more inflammatory rhetoric and no more provocative
military activity."
</P>
<P>
The second is a "longer-term goal," she said. That is to "avert
a regional arms race and to reexamine options for easing the
underlying political problems between India and pakistan,
including Kashmir."
</P>
<P>
"Finally, we will affirm our resolve to bolster the global
nonproliferation regime," Albright said. "This means taking steps
to discourage other countries from following the disastrous
example set by India and Pakistan."

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Former German President Richard Von
Wiezsaecker said here Wednesday that Europe would inevitably seek
political integration after the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Wiezsaecker said political
union would be a continuous process of development.
</P>
<P>
He said that the exclusion of some European Union (EU) member
states from the first wave of EMU would not lead to a two-speed
Europe.
</P>
<P>
The former president praised Greece for its efforts to prepare
the economy for the euro, saying that he was confident that Greece
would meet its target of joining EMU by January 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
As for the EU's enlargement, Wiezsaecker said that candidate
states should adopt certain transition measures concerning the
free movement of people.
</P>
<P>
The issue of free movement of people would influence Turkey's
demand to enter the EU, he said, adding that the German presidency
of the EU would seek a detente in Greece's relations with Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls on Youth to Push Anti-Smoking Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Wednesday reiterated his call for Congress to pass legislation to
regulate the tobacco industry and reduce teen smoking.
</P>
<P>
"Act, and act now," The Associated Press quoted him as saying
during a rally at the City Year "convention of idealism," a
service organization for people ages 17 to 21, in Cleveland, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said smoking-related illnesses kill more people every
year than AIDS, alcohol, car accidents, murder, suicide, drugs and
fires combined.
</P>
<P>
"And 90 percent of smokers started before age 18, even though
it's illegal," Clinton said. He called on the young volunteers to
press for the anti-smoking legislation as the best way to prevent
such needless death, despite "some in Congress who seem determined
to stall, stop or kill the tobacco bill."
</P>
<P>
"I hope you will join me in sending a loud message back to
Washington, D.C., to act and act now," Clinton said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mkapa Urges District Commissioners to Monitor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa has urged district commissioners to be vigilant of
prevailing misconducts of officers at grassroot levels.
</P>
<P>
Opening a seminar for district commissioners in the new
capital of Dodoma Wednesday, Mkapa said he has got reports that a
lot of innocent people have been humiliated by ward and village
executive officers and yet no action has been taken to stop this
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said it is "shocking" to hear that the officers have
joined hands with unscrupulous magistrates and the police to
humiliate common people and confiscate their property.
</P>
<P>
Whast's worse is that some of the district commissioners have
grown aware of the evil acts of their subordinates but took no
actions to stop them.
</P>
<P>
He urged the district commissioners to listen carefully to
people's problems and work out practical solutions, adding that
once the problems are reported to the President's Office, the
district commissioners would be regarded as having failed to
perform their duties.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa also advised the commissioners to hold regular
consultations with common people and exchange ideas with them on
socio-economic development.
</P>
<P>
The President required the district commissioners to conduct
correctly in front of the people they lead because they have the
a responsibility in shaping the society. He said those who are
addictive to alcoholism, use abusive language against others and
conduct promiscuity will be ousted from the government.
</P>
<P>
Responding to reports that some of the district commissioners
use working hours and vehicles for their part-time jobs, the
president warned that this would not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa also lashed out at the officials who misused people's
contributions and imposed excessive taxes on traders in the
countryside.

Hwang, 29, a Pohang Steelers forward, was stretchered off the

<HEADLINE> Audi Offers to Buy UK's Cosworth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Germany's carmaker Audi has made an
offer to buy British engine company Cosworth from its parent
company Vickers, a spokesman of Audi announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Audi, a subsidiary of Germany's largest carmaker Volkswagen,
had signed a letter of intent to buy Cosworth for 120 million
British pounds (197 million U.S. dollars), the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
However, the deal was still dependent on Volkswagen's bid to
take over the British luxury car manufacturer Rolls-Royce, which
is also owned by Vickers.
</P>
<P>
Volkswagen has pledged 430 million pounds (706 million dollars)
to buy Rolls-Royce, outbidding the 340 million pounds (558 million
dollars) offered by its German rival suitor BMW. Audi's bid for
Cosworth is meant to further strengthen Volkswagen's hand.
</P>
<P>
But a group of British and U.S. car enthusiasts are still
planning to table a last-minute bid to outgun both of the German
rivals.
</P>
<P>
Vickers is due to hold a shareholders' assembly on Friday to
vote on the three bids.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Productivity Growth Slips Slightly During </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. productivity growth
slipped to an annual rate of 1.1 percent in the first three months
of the year, the Labor Department reported here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate in the productivity of non-farm,
non-supervisory workers was considerably better than the 0.2
percent estimate issued last month, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Still, it represented a slip from the 1.4 percent rate of the
fourth quarter of last year. And it's down considerably from the
1.8 percent average through 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
Productivity measures output per hour of work and is considered
crucial to the improvement of living standards. The last time
Americans enjoyed low inflation and high growth, the 1960s and
early 1970s, productivity growth averaged a phenomenal 2.9 percent
a year.
</P>
<P>
The lapse in first-quarter productivity growth was focused in
manufacturing, which accounts for about 18 percent of U.S.
business output. It grew at just 0.7 percent rate, the worst in
nearly four years, after averaging 4.6 percent in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
For all non-farm businesses, hours worked grew faster in the
first quarter than in the fourth, a 4.8 percent rate vs. a 3.5
percent rate, reflecting strong hiring.
</P>
<P>
Output growth improved too, but not as much: a 6 percent rate
in the first quarter versus a 4.9 percent rate in the fourth. As a
result, productivity growth decelerated.
</P>
<P>
In another separate report released here today, the Commerce
Department said new orders to American factories rose 1.2 percent
in April. It was the biggest increase in five months and followed
a much more modest 0.2 percent rise in March.
</P>
<P>
However, the overall rise overstated the strength in manufacturing
because it was concentrated in new orders for aircraft, a highly
volatile category. Excluding transportation, factory orders were
up a much more modest 0.3 percent in April, little changed from a
0.4 percent advance in March.
</P>
<P>
Separately today, the Labor Department said the number of
Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits surged
unexpectedly last week to the highest level in nearly five months.
</P>
<P>
Applications jumped by 30,000 to a seasonally adjusted 339,000,
the most since the week ended on January 10. Without seasonal
adjustment, actual claims fell by 8,811 to 249,640.

<HEADLINE> Kaunda to Quit Party Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Former Zambian president Kenneth
Kaunda announced here Thursday he will quit party politics so
that he can serve the nation and the continent on a wider scope.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda said he will step down from active politics at the next
extra-ordinary national congress of his United National
Independence Party (UNIP).
</P>
<P>
"I am strongly considering the possibility of detaching myself
from party politics so that I may make my contribution to the
nation on a wider scope," he said.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of his resignation is to serve the nation and the
continent on a wide scope and above partisan politics, said
Kaunda, who had been the country's president since its
independence in 1964 until 1991, when he was defeated by current
President Frederick Chiluba in general elections.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda said he would put up a spirited fight against many
issues dogging the continent today such as poverty, civil strife,
aids and democracy.
</P>
<P>
The former president admitted that he had made a mistake by
coming back to party politics, saying he would have been more
useful to Zambia and the continent if he had served and shared
his experiences on a neutral stand with people from all walks of
life.
</P>
<P>
He criticized some UNIP leaders for having divided the party
through squabbling among themselves over what he described as
trivial and personal issues.
</P>
<P>
He directed the party's central committee to quickly hold the
extraordinary national congress.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda said he will relinquish his party presidency at the
congress so that a new leadership could take over and save the
party from going into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
He made the announcement four days after his release from
under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, 74, was detained on December 25 last year for alleged
involvement in last October 28 coup attemp.
</P>
<P>
Six days after his arrest, he was put under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
In February this year, he was formally charged with misprision
of treason.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda was set free on Monday when a Lusaka High Court judge
said the court forgave him.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government has been urging Kaunda not to be
involved in party politics but to follow former Tanzanian
President Julius Nyerere's example so that he can be respected as
father of the nation.

<HEADLINE> Fierce Fighting Erupts in Northern Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Fierce fighting has erupted in the
north of Sri Lanka between government troops and Tamil rebels
Thursday, leaving hundreds injured on both sides, informed sources
here said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the battles began just south of paranthan
Thursday morning and continued unabated late into the evening.
</P>
<P>
The fighting appears to be the result of a rebel counter attack
in response to a two-pronged advance on the rebel stronghold of
Mankulam town by the troops of operation Jaya Sikuru (Certain
Victory), the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Heavy casualties have been reported on both sides. Most of the
troops casualties are as a result of heavy mortar fire directed by
the rebels. But there is still no official confirmation, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The government troops are making every effort to keep up the
advance in the face of heavy mortar artillery fire, Said the
sources, adding that the Tamil rebels communications monitored by
the military indicate that the rebel commanders are making
desperate appeals for reinforcement.
</P>
<P>
The fierce fighting took place after the troops resumed their
advance last Wednesday to recapture the strategic Mankulam town on
its way to clear a 75-km supply route between the south and the
north launched in May last year.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels have been fighting a war for a separate state
in the north and east of the country since 1983. Over 55,000
people have been reportedly killed in the war.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Delays Visit to Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin has
decided to postpone his visit to Ukraine scheduled for late June,
but will go ahead with a tour of some Russian regions, a senior
official announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Putin, first deputy director of the presidential
office, told a news briefing that Yeltsin's decision was prompted
by the situation on the financial markets and in the transport
sector, as well as the need for the government to take some
austerity measure to cope with the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Putin said the president's visit to Ukraine for an informal
meeting with Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma was scheduled for
June 20, but Yeltsin preferred involvement in internal problems as
against international questions.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin sent a message to his Ukrainian counterpart, proposing
that the meeting be in July.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Ukraine have been at odds for years over the
division of the Soviet-era Black Sea Fleet and the status of
Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Though the two countries signed a friendship treaty last year,
Russia's parliament has repeatedly postponed ratification of the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's proposed internal tour includes Vologda, Novgorod and
the Kostroma regions, all located to the north and northwest of
Moscow, Putin said.
</P>
<P>
The president is expected to finally determine early next week
which of the regions he will visit.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sees Highest Vehicle Sales Since 1986 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The auto industry of the United
States reported that May was the best month for car and truck
sales since September 1986, the New York Times Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper reported that sales totaled 1,511,661 cars and
trucks, a 12.1 percent increase from the corresponding period last
year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, fueled by hefty price cuts, the seasonally adjusted
annual selling rate for light vehicles reached 16.3 million cars
and trucks last month, the highest level since October 1987.
</P>
<P>
Sales of both cars and trucks increased though truck sales
showed a higher rise, it said.
</P>
<P>
Car sales totaled 793,066 units, up 6.9 percent; light-truck
sales topped 718,575 units, up 18.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sales were popped up also by attractive incentive programs.
Auto makers spent as much as 1,600 U.S. dollars a vehicle on
incentives in May, up from about 1,100 U.S. dollars a year ago,
analysts said. In mid-April, G.M. sent certificates worth 500 to
1,000 U.S. dollars to previous buyers of G.M. products to purchase
50 different models, above and beyond other cash rebate and
low-interest loan incentives.
</P>
<P>
General Motors said today that it sold 484,168 cars and trucks
in May, an increase of 12.4 percent over May 1997. G.M.'s truck
sales increased 19.2 percent, to 226,114 vehicles. G.M.'s car
sales also increased, up 7 percent at 258,054 units.
</P>
<P>
Ford reported today that it sold 353,270 cars and trucks in
May, up 1.2 percent from May 1997. Car sales totaled 141,558, down
5.5 percent; truck sales were 211,712, up 6.2 percent from last
year. Chrysler said Tuesday that it had its best month ever in
May, selling 250,031 cars and trucks, a 27 percent jump.
</P>
<P>
Japanese and German car makers also reported strong sales in
the U.S. in May.

<HEADLINE> Britain's Famous Cattle Market Closes down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Banbury market, one of Britain's
most famous cattle markets, closed on Thursday due to lack of
trading caused by mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
Banbury market in Oxfordshire, northwest of London, is one of
Britain's oldest with a history stretching back as early as 11th
century.
</P>
<P>
Once the biggest in Britain, the market has occupied its
current site since the mid-1920s.
</P>
<P>
The international ban on British beef exports, imposed in March
1996 because of mad cow disease, was the main reason behind the
closure of the market.
</P>
<P>
Jim Watson, chairman of the Midland Marts in Banbury, said the
cattle market was losing between 5,000 and 10,000 pounds (16,300
U.S. dollars) a week.
</P>
<P>
Other British livestock markets were heading for closure as
more farmers switched to crops from cattle because of falling beef
prices, he added.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 people will lose their jobs and the decision to
close has been partly blamed on delays in getting government
authorization for a new market.
</P>
<P>
Incomes fell along with a regional decline in cattle numbers
and livestock prices. Some livestock farmers had also been rushing
into producer clubs, which supply the best quality cattle directly
to supermarkets.

<HEADLINE> Mealie Meal Prices Set to Rise in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Millers Association of Zimbabwe
and the Small Scale Millers Association said Thursday mealie meal
prices will rise by between 15 and 18 percent due to the recent
hike in the prices of maize from the state-owned Grain Marketing
Board (GMB).
</P>
<P>
"In order to avoid losses and food shortages, our members will
have no alternative but to increase maize meal prices," the two
associations said in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, following violent food riots, the
millers agreed to hold back maize meal price increases until the
1998 crop was in.
</P>
<P>
However, the maize producer price doubled from 1,200
Zimbabwean Dollars (66.6 U.S. Dollars) to 2,400 Zimbabwean
Dollars (133.2 U.S. Dollars) per ton for the 1998 crop, while the
GMB selling price has now risen to 2,800 Zimbabwean Dollars
(155.5 U.S. Dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
The associations noted that alternative maize procurement
prices from other sources had also risen.
</P>
<P>
"General inflation had increased most of the inputs from
suppliers of other goods and services relating to overall
operating costs," they said.

<HEADLINE> China Supports Cooperation in APEC Telecom, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 4 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Chinese minister
has said that China supports the strengthened cooperation among
APEC member economies to realize the common development and
prosperity of the telecommunication and information sector in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Minister of Information Industry Wu Jichuan made the
remark in his speech at a plenary session Thursday of the Third
APEC Ministerial Meeting on the Telecommunication and Information
Industry, which began Wednesday with an aim to rally joint efforts
to realize the goal of creating an Asia-Pacific Information
Society.
</P>
<P>
It will be of strategic significance for the member economies
to further strengthen international cooperation and make full use
of the achievement in rapidly developing telecommunication and
information technologies while adopting their respective
development policies and objectives and relying mainly on their
own efforts, he said.
</P>
<P>
In order to meet the advent of the information society, he
said, the APEC ministers responsible for telecommunications and
information industry should closely follow the development trend
of information technology in the 21st century in the region,
formulate strategies and solve the problems brought about by
technological progress.
</P>
<P>
He proposed to encourage and support APEC members in their
joint efforts to develop technical and service standards for
broadband multi-media communications, to work together to develop
international standards and coordinated policies in the area of
E-commerce, and to carry out studies on equitable, mutually
beneficial, and cost-based tariff and settlement arrangements,
including those involved in Internet service provision.
</P>
<P>
He also told the session that China has mapped out the
development objectives for telecommunications and information
industry for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, he said, in the year 2000 China will have a
high-rate chessboard-structured broadband fiber-optic cable
network across the whole country and the annual sales in the
information and software industries will hit 54 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Third APEC Ministerial Meeting on the Telecommunications
and Information Industry will end on Friday.

<HEADLINE> African Ministers Meet for OAU Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Ministers from all over Africa
gathered here Thursday for a 3-day meeting to prepare for the
forthcoming summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),
which will map out a blueprint for Africa to go toward the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
All the issues to be discussed at the 68th ordinary session of
the OAU council of ministers would be of crucial importance to
the destiny of Africa and Africans, said Prime Minister of
Burkina Faso Desire Ouedraogo, who declared the session open.
</P>
<P>
According to him, African countries have, since the last OAU
summit a year ago, made encouraging progress in handling crises,
democratization and economic development across the continent.
</P>
<P>
However, Ouedraogo admitted that Africa still remains backward
and beset with serious social problems concerning food, health
and education, among other things.
</P>
<P>
The Burkinabe prime minister thus called on the OAU member
states to redouble their efforts in promoting peace and security,
economic development and democracy in accordance with the
realities of various countries.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Ouedraogo said, a number of agreements have
been reached by leaders of all member states during OAU meetings
at various levels.
</P>
<P>
Concerted efforts should be made to implement these documents
for more effective development.
</P>
<P>
In a keynote speech at the opening ceremony, OAU
Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim stressed the need to
establish a more peaceful and stable Africa for further progress.
</P>
<P>
Describing the ousting of Sierra Leone's coupists as "a major
victory to Africa in its efforts to engender democratic rule,"
Salim warned the military confrontation between Ethiopia and
Eritrea would only produce losers all over the continent.
</P>
<P>
"We need, therefore, to take more seriously our continental
mechanism for promoting peace through the prevention, management
and resolution of conflicts and to extend to it the necessary
political and financial support to enable it function
adequately," said Salim.
</P>
<P>
On the economic front, the OAU chief said, "We are encouraged
by the performance of the continent as most of our countries have
registered significant and sustained growth over the last years."
</P>
<P>
However, he also called for concerted efforts to be deployed
toward alleviating poverty and solving other serious
socio-economic problems, including basic infrastructure and
transport and communication facilities in African countries.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 of the 53 OAU member states attended the opening
session alongside delegates from international organizations,
including the United Nations and other countries.

<HEADLINE> Ousting of S. Leone Junta A Victory for Africa: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The successful ousting of the
illegal military junta in Sierra Leone was described as a major
victory to Africa at the 68th ordinary session of the council of
ministers of the Organization of African Unity which opened here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement delivered to the opening ceremony of the
council session Thursday morning, OAU Secretary-General Salim
Ahmed Salim said that Africa displayed remarkable cohesion and
decisiveness in dealing with the crisis that erupt in Sierra
Leone following the coup d'etat by a military junta in May last
year.
</P>
<P>
"This swift, decisive and unequivocal reaction by our
continental organization against the coup and the crucial role
played subsequently by ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African
States) and ECOMOG (west African peace keeping force), on behalf
of the continent, led to the early restoration of the
democratically elected government of Sierra Leone," he said.
</P>
<P>
This strengthened Africa's will and commitment to stand in
defense of democracy in the continent, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The position of principle which Africa took in the case of
Sierra Leone marked the continued determination of the continent
to ensure that democracy gains root in the continent," he said,
adding that more needs to be done to ensure that the people's
rights are guaranteed, promoted and protected.
</P>
<P>
The experience of Sierra Leone has clearly demonstrated that
there are real prospects for success in overcoming crisis
situations, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is especially pertinent as we are still confronted with
the daunting challenge of seeking durable peace in various parts
of the continent," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> World Insurance Executives to Meet on Climate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Over 100 insurance executives and
financing experts worldwide will meet in Cologne, Germany on June
9 over the strong increase in claims of damage caused by climate
changes, the U.N. Environment Program (UNEP) announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The international insurance industry has suffered from a
series of "billion-Dollar" storms since 1987, leading to a jump
in claims. Thus it reduced availability of insurance coverage and
higher premiums, said the Nairobi-based UNEP in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The experts from more than 15 countries will discuss at the
two-day conference strategies to deal with the problem, and in
particular how to improve environmental reporting standards, said
the statement.
</P>
<P>
"A better understanding of environmental risks is of key
importance to insurance companies," Dr. Walter Jakobi, Managing
Director of Gerling Global Re which is one of the world's leading
reinsurance companies, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We can only tackle this issue if better and more specific
information is made available to us. That's why environmental
reporting is a crucial issue for our industry," he said. His
company is UNEP's co-sponsor of the conference.
</P>
<P>
Also high on the agenda in Cologne is follow-up to last year's
U.N. climate change meeting in Kyoto, Japan.
</P>
<P>
A "Corporate Global Warming Indicator" will be launched at the
conference as a tool for all companies across all sectors on how
to measure their contribution to global warming.
</P>
<P>
The indicator will allow investors to identify impacts of the
Kyoto Protocol on the financial performance of companies.
</P>
<P>
"The insurance industry has become a powerful and credible
lobby to push the environmental agenda forward," said UNEP chief
Klaus Topfer in the statement.
</P>
<P>
"Governments need to recognize that insurance companies have
much to offer when it comes to providing technical expertise and
financial resources in support of their sustainable development
policies," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There are many voices on the environmental side that continue
to say that business remains an obstacle to progress," Topfer
added.
</P>
<P>
"Instead of confrontation, we need to build partnerships, like
the one UNEP has with the insurance sector, and find solutions
together," he noted.
</P>
<P>
UNEP's alliance with the insurance industry was launched in
1995 when the first insurance companies signed on to the "UNEP
Statement of Environmental Commitment by the Insurance Industry."
</P>
<P>
Currently, more than 70 insurance firms from 25 countries have
signed the statement and have committed themselves to
incorporating environmental considerations into their operations.

<HEADLINE> Weizman Expresses Cautious Optimism over Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
Thursday expressed cautious optimism over the peace process after
meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but refrained from
congratulating him on the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Briefed by Netanyahu on the issue of further redeployment in
the West Bank, Weizman said he was "a little more optimistic" over
the peace process. But he said since he had been disappointed in
the past, he preferred not to extend congratulations at this time.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the president voiced his concern over Israeli
cabinet's failure to make a decision on the scope of next Israeli
troop pullback at its weekly meeting Monday. "I view this with
great concern and I regret it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I think that the longer we drag this out, the more we are
liable to bring about unpleasant situations," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Likud ministers Wednesday, Netanyahu said he
believes the second redeployment would be approved by the Knesset
(Parliament), although he did not say when such an agreement would
be finalized.
</P>
<P>
He has been quoted by the media as saying that once he had "a
good deal," he would move forward regardless of opposition inside
his own coalition, which is splitting over the redeployment amid
pressure from the United States for an early decision.
</P>
<P>
The latest draft of the U.S. proposal was published for the
first time on Israeli newspaper Haaretz Thursday. Under the plan,
Israel will carry out a three-stage further redeployment over a
period of 12 weeks.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported Thursday that U.S. peace envoy Dennis
Ross, who presented the plan to both the Israeli and Palestinian
sides last Wednesday, was holding talks in London with Mahmoud
Abbas (Abu Mazen), Palestinian National Authority deputy head, and
Palestinian Legislative Council Speaker Ahmed Qureia (Abu Ala) on
the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Weizman also met with an Israeli peace group Peace Now
delegation before he left for Cairo, Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Canada Subsidizes U.S. Athletes for Pan-American Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Canada is subsidizing the travel of
athletes from the United States, the world's richest nation, to
attend a major international sporting event in the country.
</P>
<P>
As host of next year's Pan-American Games, Canada is helping
pay the bills of U.S. athletes out of a 3.5-million-U.S.-dollar
fund that will be spread among all competing nations, reports said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On average, each athlete, coach and official participating in
the Games will get nearly 500 dollars for travel to Canada,
accommodation and food.
</P>
<P>
Though major sports event organizers usually provide subsidized
accommodation, this is the first time that the travel of non-Third
World athletes has been subsidized, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is expected to send 1,200 athletes, coaches and
supporting staff to the event, which will be held in Manitoba
provincial capital of Winnipeg from July 24 to August 8 next year.
</P>
<P>
The Games, which will attract 8,500 athletes, coaches and
official from 42 countries, are overwhelmingly funded by Canadian
taxpayers, with 76 million dollars from the federal, provincial
and municipal governments.

<HEADLINE> Officials Claim Testosterone in De Bruin's Urine Sample </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Traces of artificially-produced
testosterone have been found in the urine of Michelle de Bruin,
the triple Olympic swimming champion, sports officials said on
Thursday at Seville, Spain.
</P>
<P>
The world swimming ruling body FINA announced last month that
evidence of tampering was showed in both samples of a random urine
test on De Bruin
</P>
<P>
A laboratory in Barcelona used a new test to look for
artificial evidence of the banned hormone, which is also produced
naturally in the body, after the Irish swimmer provided a urine
sample in January, said International Olympic Committee medical
chief Prince Alexandre de Merode.
</P>
<P>
De Merode refused to offer the result of the analysis but two
sport officials confirmed independently that traces of artificial
testosterone had been found in De Bruin's sample.
</P>
<P>
"That is correct. The lab did find that," one said. "But there
has been no big noise made about it."
</P>
<P>
De Bruin, who has denied manipulation, could not be punished if
the result was confirmed, because the test has not been recognised
officially as a method for catching drug-taking competitors.
</P>
<P>
Manipulating a urine sample is regarded as being just a serious
offence as providing a positive test and the swimmer faces a
lengthy ban from the sport which threatens to bring a premature
end to her career.

<HEADLINE> Seas Protection Highlighted on World Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 4 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
will highlight in Russian capital Moscow the protection of seas
as the theme of the annual World Environment Day celebrations set
for Friday.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 countries are to commemorate World Environment
Day Friday in an effort to raise public awareness and act on
environment which is generally degrading worldwide, the
Nairobi-based U.N. Environment Program announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 Environment Day, with the theme "For Life on Earth:
Save Our Seas," honors the U.N. International Year of the Ocean.
</P>
<P>
"The theme... is an appeal to each and every one of us to
protect and focus our attention on one of our planet's most
valuable resources: the oceans," Annan said in a statement
reaching here to mark the day.
</P>
<P>
"With changing land patterns due to the pressures of an
ever-increasing population, with the development of industries,
with the massive use of agro-chemicals, the oceans have reached
the limits of their capacity to assimilate the waste generated by
human activities," he warned.
</P>
<P>
"Our self-centered approach has damaged human health,
ecosystems and economic productivity," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
"Any approach to meaningful and effective protection of the
marine environment must factor in the full complexity of modern
life -- from politics to technology, from science to the law," he
noted in his message.
</P>
<P>
Oceans comprise more than 70 percent of the Earth's surface.
Nearly two-thirds of the global population -- some 3.5 billion
people -- inhabit coastal areas and depend on coastal and marine
environments for their livehood.
</P>
<P>
Twenty years from now, this population is expected to have
reached seven billion, according to Annan's message.
</P>
<P>
UNEP chief Klaus Topfer said in a statement available Thursday
that the "World Environment Day provides a unique opportunity to
raise environmental awareness and mobilize action."
</P>
<P>
The main event to be held in Moscow Friday will culminate with
the presentation of UNEP's Global 500 Awards to 23 individuals
and organizations from 19 countries who have made outstanding
contributions to the protection of the environment.
</P>
<P>
World Environment Day, established by the U.N. General
Assembly in 1972, is a people's event with governments,
individuals and community groups organizing countless activities
to improve their environment.

PARIS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Arantxa Sanchez Vicario moved into
the women's singles final at the French Open for the sixth time in
12 visits here on Thursday after she outplayed second-seeded
Lindsay Davenport of the United States 6-3, 7-6 (7/5) in one hour
and 33 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The Spaniard, who won her titles at Roland Garros in 1989 and
1994, now plays either world No. one Martina Hingis or three-time
champion Monica Seles.
</P>
<P>
Davenport failed to hold serve throughout a nervous,
error-filled first set as Sanchez Vicario battled back whatever
the big American sent down.
</P>
<P>
Sanchez Vicario, who had 19 break points, broke Davenport eight
times while Davenport broke the third seed seven times after
earning 13 break points.
</P>
<P>
The American, who was bidding for a place in her first Grand
Slam final, made a better start to the second-set as she broke her
opponent to a 2-0 lead before Sanchez Vicario came back to the
match.
</P>
<P>
Davenport continued to go for big winners and although guilty
of over-hitting, she managed to climb back to 4-4 and then forced
a tie-break where Sanchez Vicario recovered from 3-5 to edge
home.

"He can suspend any member of staff and prohibit students from
attending class, but the actual closing of the university is not
provided for in the act," Chihota said.
</P>
<P>
He said punishing all the students, including those who never
participated in the demonstration, was uncalled for.
</P>
<P>
Hill closed down the university Tuesday followin the
destruction of property by students demonstrating against alleged
corruption in government and demanding increased grants and
loans.

In the demonstrations between Thursday, last week and Monday,

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Calls for Political Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 4 (Xinhua) -- When political struggle intensifies
in Iran, supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei Thursday called for
unity under the Islamic banner.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a huge crowd here to mark the 9th anniversary of
his predecessor Ayatollah Khomeini's demise, Khamenei underlined
the importance that the hearts of the government and the nation
"beat for Islam."
</P>
<P>
Khamenei's statement came at a time when the open-mined
policies by President Mohammad Khatami's government are fiercely
challenged by the influential conservatives. Some military
commanders even threatened to crack down on those trying to
destroy the foundation of the Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei stressed the need that the Iranian nation
whole-heartedly maintains its loyalty to the ideals of the founder
of the Islamic Republic, Imam Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that it was the masses' support for the Islamic
revolution that "has brought the Islamic Republic (of Iran) a
special respect and status in the eyes of the world."
</P>
<P>
The people should "not go astray in understanding his
(Khomeini's) ideals," Khamenei said.
</P>
<P>
He stated that as long as Islam and the unity is prevalent, the
U.S. and Israel would not be able to harm this nation.

<HEADLINE> Holland Requires Doctors to Report Euthanasia Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- From next November 1, Dutch
doctors will have to report cases of euthanasia and assisted
suicide to regional committees in Holland.
</P>
<P>
The requirement was spelled out by a letter addressed to the
Dutch lower house of parliament by Dutch Health Minister Els Borst
and Justice Minister Winnie Sorgdrager.
</P>
<P>
The ministers claim the notification procedure is designed to
boost the confidence of doctors in the legal notification system,
and to increase their willingness to report cases where they have
helped in the ending of life.
</P>
<P>
The doctors are required to report to one of the five regional
committees, each of which is manned by an ethics expert, a medical
and a legal expert.
</P>
<P>
The committees will be established to test notified cases of
euthanasia and assisted suicide to assess whether criteria of due
care and consideration have been met. These include incurable and
unbearable suffering, repeated and well-considered requests,
consultation with an independent second physician and thorough
reporting and notification to the municipal coroner.
</P>
<P>
The committees will send their opinions to the public
prosecutions office within six weeks of notification and also to
the regional health inspector's office.
</P>
<P>
The doctor concerned will also be notified of the committee's
findings.
</P>
<P>
If the doctor has acted with due care and consideration in the
opinion of the committee, the public prosecutions office will not
instigate legal proceedings unless the Dutch Association of
Prosecutors General feels there are strong grounds for doing so.
</P>
<P>
The letter also announced that a study will be conducted to
provide greater clarity of the way in which the role of nurses and
care-workers play in the treatment process in cases involving the
ending of life.

<HEADLINE> China Ready to Quash 2000 Computer Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- China is quietly wiping out
problems with time keepers in all kinds of computers so as to
insulate its fledging huge electronic information network from
major losses when entering the new century.
</P>
<P>
As time ticks by, calls for solution of the 2000 bug problem
become increasingly louder both in China and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Chinese companies have been quicker to act than the outside
world thought.
</P>
<P>
Founder, one of the largest personal computer manufacturers in
China, has already cleansed its products of the 2000 bug.
</P>
<P>
A Founder official said that the company has used four digits
instead of two to mark years in its computers since it began
production at the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
He said that since most of the major Chinese PC manufacturers
are new companies that have experienced substantial growth in the
past few years, they have adopted state-of-art technology in their
products. Therefore, most of their products do not have the bugs.
</P>
<P>
Founder has assigned resources and personnel to help its users
deal with potential problems.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is fully aware of the urgency of solving
the 2000 bug problem.
</P>
<P>
China now has more than nine million computers, including
products of almost all major manufacturers in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of the Information Industry (MII) is to conclude a
nationwide investigation into the 2000 bug problem this month. It
is expected to report its findings to the State Council and
propose solutions, including setting up a national coordination
institute consisting of representatives from MII, the State
Development Planning Commission and the Chinese Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Local finance, banking, telecommunications and transport
sectors have already set up task forces and timetables for solving
the 2000 bug problem.
</P>
<P>
China Telecom will complete a survey of its telecommunications
network all over the country so as to spot potential problems
caused by the 2000 bug this month. It will upgrade or replace all
equipment found to have 2000 bugs by July 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
An official from China Telecom said that the areas potentially
affected by the 2000 bug are in the business reporting and
equipment maintenance system.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of China is to complete the upgrading of its mainframe
computers by the end of this year. It is planning to install a new
software system in all its provincial branches and most of its
local branches before 2000. It is also upgrading its application
software.
</P>
<P>
An official from the bank said that it will spend hundreds of
millions of yuan in solving the 2000 bug problem this year.
</P>
<P>
"We will give priority to solving problems that may affect the
interests of our customers. We will do everything to secure a
smooth transition of our business system into the new century," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Govt Firm on UNITA's Implementation of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government will take up
a hard-line stance to force the opposition National Union for
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) to carry out the 1994 Lusaka
Peace Accord.
</P>
<P>
Higino Carneiro, Angolan government spokesman in the joint
committee of the peace process, revealed the decision Wednesday
evening at the airport before leaving for the U.N Security
Council meeting on Angola.
</P>
<P>
If the UNITA continues to obstruct the development of the
peace process, he said, the government will take up measures
which include the closure of UNITA headquarters in Luanda and
decide whether UNITA MPs will remain in the national assembly.
</P>
<P>
A crisis appeared in the peace process due to UNITA's refusal
to hand over the four "sensitive" regions it occupied including
Bailundo and Andulo. The recent disclosure by the U.N. envoy in
Angola, Blondin Beye, that UNITA still keeps some army units made
the crisis further deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
Under Beye's plan, local government authority should be
restored in the four cities before the end of May. But UNITA has
postponed its deadline to the end of June citing lack of
security.
</P>
<P>
It is illegal for a political party to keep its own army and
continue occupying part of the country's territory, Carneiro
noted, adding he will state to the Security Council that the
Angolan government firmly refuses UNITA's plan and demands that
the Council take up relevant measures in accordance with the
current development.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman admitted that his government might suspend the
joint committee of peace process on the pretext that UNITA failed
to implement the Lusaka peace deal.
</P>
<P>
On the military front, Carneiro said, the situation is still
unstable around the country. On Wednesday the organization
doctors without frontiers were attacked in central Angola. In
the 273 UNITA-occupied regions where local authority was resumed,
at least 40 have been snatched back by the UNITA, including five
cities.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the Security Council meeting on
Angola might come up with a resolution to impose a third batch of
sanctions on the former rebel movement.

<HEADLINE> Arafat in Yemen for Preparation of Arab Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser Arafat
arrived here Thursday to brief Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh
on his current regional tour for pushing the convocation of an
Arab summit aimed at reviving the deadlocked peace process.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival from Omani capital Muscat, Arafat told the
Yemeni news agency that he would keep Saleh informed about the
developments of the peace process and the obstacles facing it. He
said he would listen to Saleh's advices.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's visit to Yemen comes within the framework of the
Palestinian drive to call for an expanded Arab summit.
</P>
<P>
He has visited Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, the United Arab
Emirates and Oman and held talks with leaders of the Arab
countries on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian Cabinet Secretary Tayeb Abdel Rahim has
disclosed that Arafat will visit Jordan for talks with Jordanian
King Hussein in the same context.
</P>
<P>
For several months, the Palestinians have been urging holding
an Arab summit to rally support for their stance in the peace
negotiations with Israel and to secure a common strategy to
confront the intransigent policies of the Israeli government.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The South Asian Development Fund
(SADF) has completed the study of 13 projects in the seven member
countries of South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation
(SAARC), Nepal's official RSS news agency said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed at a three-day meeting of the governing
board of SADF, which began Thursday in Pokhara, about 200
kilometers northwest of Kathmandu, the RSS said.
</P>
<P>
The projects include the 30-megawatt Chameliya hydro-power
project in Darchula district of far-western Nepal. The other
projects are not known yet, the RSS said.
</P>
<P>
S.A. Chaudhary, chairman of SADF and managing director of

<HEADLINE> Karachi Stock Exchange Index Goes Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Karachi Stock Exchange
(KSE)-100 Index went down Thursday on renewed violence in the city
and fears of a harsh austerity plan to be announced soon by the
government.
</P>
<P>
Six people died Wednesday in violence in the southern port city
and a further two were killed Thursday, which sparked fears among
brokers of a wave of violence as rival political groups clash.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, analysts predicted that an austerity plan to be
unveiled shortly by the government would be especially harsh on
imports, thereby hurting the sales of various listed companies
which depend on imported raw material.
</P>
<P>
The austerity plan is being unveiled by the government in the
face of sanctions being imposed against the country over its
nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
The KSE-100 Index dropped 2.89 points Thursday to close at
1,056.50 against Wednesday's close of 1,059.39 points.
</P>
<P>
A total volume of 80.99 million shares were traded Thursday
against 71.11 million shares traded the previous trading day.
</P>
<P>
There were 51 gainers and 56 losers while share prices of 29
companies remained unchanged Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Traders expect the market to further consolidate its position
on Friday.

<HEADLINE> El Nino Indicators Ease Dramatically: Meteorologist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- An Australian meteorologist said
the El Nino phenomenon, blamed for poor rainfalls over the past
year, is ending and "we can hope for a few years' breather."
</P>
<P>
The indicators of El Nino, including the warming of waters in
the Pacific Ocean and changes in atmospheric pressures, have eased
dramatically in the past month, the Australian Associated Press
Thursday quoted meteorologist Robert Fawcett from the National
Climate Center as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"It has declined to a point that we're prepared to say that
it's over," Fawcett said.
</P>
<P>
"There are prospects of above-average rainfall across much of
Australia at the moment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Parts of eastern Queensland and New South Wales (NSW) already
had experienced recently above-average rainfalls, but Victoria and
south-east NSW were still in urgent need of rain, he said.
</P>
<P>
It could not be predicted when El Nino, which strikes
irregularly and is blamed for a variety of planetary climate
changes, would return. However, "We can hope for a few years'
breather," he said.
</P>
<P>
The current El Nino was the second strongest since 1950,
following the 1982-83 event, he said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Tea Yield Poises for Record Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's output of tea, a key
export earner, is poised to hit a new high this year thanks to
improved weather, better husbandry and strong global prices.
</P>
<P>
"The cumulative figure (for the year to April) now stands at
113.26 million kgs, an increase of 58.29 million kgs or 106.04
percent over the previous year," according to a statement from
the Mombasa-based Africa Tea Brokers (ATB).
</P>
<P>
"The crop figure for the month of April 1998 has been
announced at 26,760,103 kgs, showing an increase of 15,840,943 kg
or 145.07 percent over the same month in 1997," ATB was quoted by
a report reaching here Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains between October and January, followed by generous
spells of sunshine in February and March, were seen behind the
jump in production.
</P>
<P>
"The generous rains now point to a bumper tea crop," said
Agriculture Minister Musalia Mudavadi earlier.
</P>
<P>
The heavy rains, blamed on the El Nino weather phenomenon,
ruined Kenya's roads and were initially seen as a threat to
production of tea and other crops. Roads from farms to markets
are still hazardous, farmers say.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture ministry officials said favorable global prices
last year, on the back of a world shortage, have encouraged
farmers to increase the area under tea. They said farmers have
also tended their crop better to improve yields.
</P>
<P>
"High earnings always inspire better crop husbandry in Kenya.
It has been noted that the quality of tea coming out is pretty
high and production is much higher than all previous
projections," a senior agriculture ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, we are talking of a national record," ATB said,
adding that cold and often wet conditions in all tea-growing
areas have recently inhibited growth, and leaf intake was showing
a progressive decline.
</P>
<P>
But ATB and other brokers said any spells of sunshine in the
coming months would put production on course for an all-time
record.
</P>
<P>
Weather experts have spoken of a dry spell in June after
sporadic, heavy rains in May.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is one of the world's leading producers of black tea,
with a record output of 257 million kgs reached in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Brokers point out that 1998 statistics so far show a sharp
rise in production compared to the same period in 1996.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Thursday:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The F.D.A. gave a California company, Vaxgen, approval to
conduct the world's first full-scale test of a vaccine to prevent
infection with the virus that causes AIDS. The vaccine was found
to be safe in previous testing and induced the production of
anti-bodies in more than 99 percent of the vaccinated
participants, the company said. The major question the new tests
aim to answer is how effective the vaccine will be in protecting
people exposed to H.I.V. because of high-risk sexual practices or
drug use.
</P>
<P>
-- Mexico told the United States that it would prosecute
American Customs agents and informers who carried out an
undercover money-operation on Mexican soil, and that it would seek
the agents' extradition to face criminal trial in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton defied critics in Congress Thursday by
renewing trade privileges for China and pressing for quick
ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, linking both
issues to his struggle to defuse a nuclear arms race in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
-- Nearly 15 years after he was first hunted by U.S. law
enforcement, a Palestinian alleged to have been among the most
skillful Middle East terrorists of the 1980s was secretly bundled
out of Egypt and flown to the United States yesterday to face
charges in a federal court.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Intel's shares fell 4.8 percent amid new worries about the
strength of the PC market. Some analysts cut earnings estimates
and rumors spread that Intel would warn second-quarter earnings
will be lower than expected. Intel also is expected to cut prices
on its Pentium II chips this weekend. Separately, the
Semiconductor Industry Association predicted chip-industry revenue
will shrink 1.8 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
USA Today:
</P>
<P>
-- Civil rights groups on the losing end of a California ballot
initiative scrapping bilingual education sued in federal court
Wednesday to overturn the voters' decision.

<HEADLINE> China's Central Bank Resumes Bond Repurchasing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China (PBOC),
China's central bank, announced today that it has resumed the
business of repurchasing bonds from the money market in a bid to
meet commercial banks' demand for capital and accelerate the
extension of loans.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the PBOC said that this is one of a series of
measures the central bank has adopted over the past few months to
ensure the fulfilment of this year's macro-economic control
objectives, which include an eight percent economic growth, a
less than three percent rise in retail prices and stable Renminbi
exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
In April 1996 the PBOC initiated the open market bond business
in a bid to improve the central bank's macro-economic control
function.
</P>
<P>
However, only a small amount of bond repurchasing business was
done due to the subsequent condition of supply exceeding demand in
the foreign exchange market. In early 1997, the repurchasing
business was actually suspended.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that on May 26, the PBOC resumed its bond
repurchasing business in a bid to manage the base money with more
flexibility and efficiency. The trade partners are 25 first-grade
dealers in the open market, including major commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Starting June 3, the PBOC has begun to publish regularly the
central bank's bond repurchasing rates and other related
information to members of the national interbank loan market.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few months, the PBOC lifted the ceiling on
commercial banks' loans, reformed the deposit reserve system and
lowered interest rates in accordance with new changes in the
economic and financial operation. These policy measures enhanced
financial institutions' ability to extend loans and helped
increase the money supply, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Breaks out in S. Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Heavy clashes have renewed in
the troubled Bay region in southern Somalia since Wednesday,
between forces from the Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA) and those
loyal to Hussein Mohamed Aidid in and outside the town of Baidoa.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Ali Aden Qalinle, official spokesman for the RRA in
Mogadishu told reporters here Thursday that the armed
confrontations were prompted by serious armed robbery and looting
carried out by Aidid's militiamen who still control the town since
September 1995.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that his forces launched the attack Wednesday on
the militia positions of Aidid in the town, and that his forces
had lost 10 of their fighters while 15 others have sustained
gunshot wounds during the fighting before returning to their
original bases outside the town.
</P>
<P>
The RRA spokesman claimed that his forces have killed 26 of
Hussein Aidid's men and wounded more than a dozen others.
</P>
<P>
Qalinle also claimed that his forces had destroyed two battle
wagons mounted with heavy machine guns and a four-wheel-drive
pick-up truck belonging to Aidid's men in the town of Baidoa.
However, there are no independent confirmations regarding the RRA
claims.
</P>
<P>
Heavy fighting still continues Thursday between the checkpoint
of the town and a former military base, 6 km south of Baidoa,
said Qalinle, adding that his forces are now determined to
continue fighting until Aidid's men pull out of the town
unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
The faction led by Aidid did not comment on the current
fighting over the control of Baidoa where the supposedly
forthcoming national reconciliation conference is due to be held
in three months time, as declared by a statement issued
collectively by Hussein Aidid and Ali Mahdi Mohamed on April 16.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, travelers reaching here in Mogadishu also speak
about the intensity of the fighting outside the town of Baidoa
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides last fought in the town of Baidoa on April 1.
The RRA forces whose armed capability is weaker than the
overwhelming fire power of Hussein Aidid's men usually culminate
their operations in a hit-and-run attack which is even more
difficult for Hussein Aidid's men to control.

<HEADLINE>   Wheat Production Second Highest on Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The forecast for world wheat
production in 1998 is unchanged at 592 million tons, which could
be second only to the 1997 record of 610 million tons, the
International Grains Council (IGC) announced here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Due mainly to unfavorable weather, estimates have been reduced
for Russia, Brazil and Morocco. But those for China and the United
States are higher, the IGC said.
</P>
<P>
The outlook for the world wheat trade has declined since April,
largely as a result of improved production prospects in China,
very successful procurements from India's harvest and increased
uncertainties about sales to Indonesia, it added.
</P>
<P>
Global shipments are forecast at 96 million tons, compared with
a preliminary projection of 98 million to 97 million tons in
1997-1998.
</P>
<P>
Early indications are that world wheat consumption will exceed
last season's 587 million tons, to reach 599 million tons. Most of
the increase will reflect continued growth in food use.
</P>
<P>
The IGC said, the eventual volume would depend to a large
extent on the pace of economic recovery in Pacific and South Asia,
which accounts for 40 percent of total world use for all purposes.
</P>
<P>
As for world wheat stocks, the IGC believed that higher global
requirements would necessitate a small decrease in stocks, which
were expected to decline by seven million tons, to 127 million
tons, but would still be the second highest since 1993 and
1994.

<HEADLINE> Interbank Trading Rate Rises in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The average interest on the
Shanghai-based interbank money market rose in May as a result of
short supply of funds, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate on interbank lending and borrowing averaged
7.63 percent in May, up from 6.92 percent in April, the
Shanghai Foreign Exchange Trading System announced today.
</P>
<P>
The two major trading varieties have durations of 20 days and
60 days, respectively. They accounted for 30.3 percent and 34.7
percent of total transactions in May, which were valued at 2.27
billion yuan. All borrowing and lending deals were made among the
head offices of the commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics also indicate that interbank trading in
spot bonds totaled 34 million yuan last month while trading in
bond repurchasement hit 5.18 billion yuan. The average interest
for bonds was 6.95 percent in May, 0.14 percentage points higher
than in April.

<HEADLINE> Pak Shelves Plan to Export Sugar to India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has dropped the idea of
undertaking by-road export of sugar to India due to the fresh
tension between the two countries after nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
India's nuclear tests followed by threats of aggression against
Pakistan soured relations between the two countries, which forced
the Pakistani government to give up the plan of by-road trade of
the commodity, sources from the Foreign Office said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the Foreign Office earlier proposed
by-road export of sugar on the request of the Commerce Ministry,
which was expected to facilitate trade of sugar to the neighboring
country.
</P>
<P>
By mid-May, about 200,000 tons of sugar had been sold abroad
through railway wagons and by sea, of which more than a half had
been dispatched to India, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
However, the export has decelerated because of mounting tension
between the two countries since India conducted its nuclear tests
on May 11 and 13, they said.
</P>
<P>
The sources also said that the private sector now is looking
for alternative markets in Afghanistan, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and
Malaysia. The target of sugar export for the current financial
year (July 1, 1997 to June 30, 1998) is 300,000 tons.

<HEADLINE> Indian Minister Sees Improvement of India-China Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Indian Minister of State for
External Affairs Vasundhara Raje said Thursday that there have
been steady improvement in India-China relations in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In a written reply to the Upper House of Parliament here, she
said that exchanges at government and people-to-people levels
between the two countries have been taking place with a view to
finding a mutually-acceptable solution to all outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
These exchanges were also meant to promote mutual understanding
and build confidence, she said.
</P>
<P>
Of late the Indian government asserted that its recent nuclear
tests were mainly due to the "threat" from China and Pakistan, yet
many opposition parties and politicians in the country do not
share the government's view. They said that the past one decade
has witnessed improvement of India-China relations and that the
Sino-Indian borders have been peaceful and quiet. They have time
and again asked the government to explain its real compulsions for
the nuclear tests on May 11 and 13.
</P>
<P>
Raje said that India was committed to the development of
friendly, good-neighborly and mutually beneficial relations with
China.
</P>
<P>
India and China were committed to working towards a fair,
reasonable and mutually-acceptable settlement of their boundary
issue, she said.

<HEADLINE> NPC Chairman Meets With Luxembourg PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), met with Prime
Minister Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg and his party here
today.
</P>
<P>
Li and Juncker said that they were delighted to meet again
three months after Li's visit to Luxembourg last February.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China had witnessed new changes after Juncker's
previous China visit. "In the two decades since its reform and
opening-up drive, China has made achievements in socio-economic
development with marked improvements in the people's life and
enhanced national strength," Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the experience of China's progress can be summed
up as the proper handling of the relationship between reform,
development and stability.
</P>
<P>
"Without stability, China, a country with a population of 1.2
billion, could not do anything. Stability is the prerequisite for
refrom and development. And only under stable conditions can the
state be engaged in development and people live in peace and work
in contentment," Li noted.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China now has three tasks ahead. "The first is to
retain the development momentum for China's national economy; the
second is to strengthen reform; and the third to enhance
democratic and legal construction," he said, adding that China is
confident and capable of tackling all difficulties and problems
occurring in the development process.
</P>
<P>
Li told guests that China chooses the system of people's
congresses and the system of multi-party cooperation and political
consultation under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party
(CPC). Both are suited to China's national conditions. Based on
the general principle put forward at the 15th CPC National
Congress to govern the country according to law, NPC will play its
due role in strengthening the law-making and relevant supervision
efforts so as to ensure the building of a socialist country ruled
by law, and guarantee and promote the smooth development of the
reform and opening-up drive.
</P>
<P>
Li highly evaluated the improved ties between China and the
European Union (EU). China highly values the role played by the EU
in global and regional affairs, and its unremitting efforts to
advance Sino-Europe relations, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
"In an increasingly multi-polarized world, China and Europe
have more common points in bilateral and multilateral fields," Li
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, the NPC has already formed regular contacts
and dialogue channels with the European parliament. Li said that
he hoped that such exchanges can be expanded and also expressed
particular appreciation for the contribution made by Juncker for
furthering Sino-EU ties.
</P>
<P>
Juncker told Li that his visit to Luxembourg early this year
played an important role in furthering Sino-Luxembourg and Sino-EU
ties. He said that his state will, as usual, made efforts to
enhance such ties. He said it can be predicted that a more
enlarged and unified EU and a more powerful China will see new
bilateral cooperation at a new phase.

<HEADLINE> Rescue Work Continues as Crash Toll Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Rescue workers continued an overnight
Wednesday-Thursday operation in the German town of Eschede, to try
to find more survivors or bodies from Wednesday's train crash.
</P>
<P>
The latest official reports say a total of 91 people are known
to have died so far, including two injured who died in hospital
last night. The final death toll is expected to exceed 100.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of rescue workers using five heavy cranes are working
carefully at the moment to try to lift huge chunks of a collapsed
bridge from two carriages still buried under the debris.
</P>
<P>
Police said the rescue operation could still take several hours
because any shifting of the damaged structure could bring great
danger to possible survivors and the rescuers.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has cut short of a visit to Italy
and was due to visit the accident site later Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile hundreds of people are gathering at Red Cross
stations across the country to donate blood.
</P>
<P>
The exact cause for the accident is still unclear. According to
rescue workers and railroad officials, the front engine of the
train along with two coaches behind became detached as the rest of
the train spun out of control and slammed into the road bridge
near the Eschede rail station.
</P>
<P>
The crash at Eschede, a northeastern town, was the worst rail
accident in Germany in half a century.

<HEADLINE> Handicapped Woman Helps 105 Dropouts Return To School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Fang Jinmei, a handicapped woman
in Shanghai, has helped 105 poor dropouts in east China's Anhui
Province to return to school, with assistance from her husband
and other people.
</P>
<P>
Fang, who suffers from cancer and partial paralysis, has been
bedridden for the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Her care for primary school pupils in the Gudui Hui Nationality
Autonomous Township, Changfeng County, began in 1996, when she
spent several months making 100 school-bags for the students. The
couple traveled to the township by train to deliver their gifts
personally.
</P>
<P>
In April 1997, Fang launched her own "Seeking Good-Hearted
Persons" campaign, in order to find donors to finance poor
students in the township.
</P>
<P>
Her call for donations received a warm response from this
largest industrial city of the country. A dozen individuals,
including schoolmates of her daughter at Fudan University and
other institutions have joined Fang to help these students.
</P>
<P>
So far, the number of students financed by Fang's program
has reached 105, exceeding her expectation of 100. All the money
has been sent to Gudui via "Project Hope," a national scheme for
assisting students from poverty-stricken families in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The beneficiaries sent New Year's cards to her. One of the
pupils wrote, "When I grow up, I want to be a skillful doctor to
cure your painful illness, so that you can stand up again."
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the city's "Project Hope" office,
since 1994 Shanghai residents have donated over 76 million yuan to
the project, which has resulted in the setting-up of 600 "Hope"
schools and helped over 33,000 dropouts to return to school.

BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao met with
Yung-ching Wang, a noted Taiwan entrepreneur, today.
</P>
<P>
Wen, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and a member of
CPC's Central Committee Secretariat, welcomed Wang's visit. He
said, "It is our consistent principle to expand economic
exchanges and cooperation across the Taiwan Straits in a bid to
promote common prosperity and further the relationship between
the the mainland and Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
He said to implement such a principle, the mainland has adopted
a series of measures and formulated relevant laws and regulations
to encourage investment from Taiwan compatriots and protect their
lawful rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
According to the vice-premier, it is in the fundamental
interests of people on both sides of the strait to develop economic
cooperation, adding that such activities are beneficial to the
Chinese nation as a whole.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to adhere to the basic principle of 'peaceful
reunification and one country, two systems,' and the Eight-Point
Proposal put forward by President Jiang Zemin on China's peaceful
reunification and development of across-Strait ties," he pointed
out.

<HEADLINE> Australian Central Bank Reported to Support Failing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of Australia
(RBA) was forced to intervene to support the Australian dollar
Thursday as it continued to overshoot good domestic economic
fundamentals and tunneled below 61.00 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Although the central bank itself would not confirm the buying
intervention, the foreign exchange market was awash with talk that
it had placed orders in the market at the 60.80-U.S.-cent level.
</P>
<P>
With all the traders contacted by AAP reiterating the talk, and
a number confirming the RBA's presence, the purported action only
managed to elevate the unit by a little less than half a U.S. cent
to 61.28.
</P>
<P>
A dealer from the Commonwealth Bank said he had seen the
central bank in the market this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Another foreign exchange dealer said the RBA had been buying
the Australian dollar at 60.80 U.S. cents in the broker market.
</P>
<P>
"It has caused the market to jump up to 61.25 pretty quickly,"
the dealer said.
</P>
<P>
But the move-up proved short-lived, and by the end of the
session the Australian dollar was again nudging 61 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
It finished the day at 61.10 U.S. cents, compared to 60.93 at
the start of local trading and 61.66 here late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Battered by international investors' concern over the economic
crisis in Asia and weak commodity prices, the Australian dollar
has fallen more than one U.S. cent since the start of the week.
</P>
<P>
ABN Amro treasury strategist Peter Clay said that over the next
few days the risk remains on the downside.
</P>
<P>
"Asia continues to put pressure on the currency, commodity
prices, interest rate differentials, sentiment, it all adds up to
further pressure on the downside," Clay said.
</P>
<P>
On the cross-rates, the battered local unit was trading at
84.45 from 84.90 against the Japanese yen and at 1.0792 from
1.0947 against the German mark.

<HEADLINE> Intellectual Property Services Center Launched in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Intellectual Property
Services Center (IPSC) was launched here Thursday to help Hong
Kong companies and individuals capitalize on their invention
through patent registration.
</P>
<P>
The center was set up by the Hong Kong Productivity Council
(HKPC), responding to the objective set out by Chief Executive
Tung Chee Hwa in his 1997 Policy Address to develop Hong Kong into
an innovation center.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the center's opening ceremony, HKPC Executive
Director Thomas Tang said: "The ISPC will provide a comprehensive
range of services in patent search and patent registration. This
one-stop service will enable companies to shorten the
time-to-market for new products, enhancing their competitiveness."
</P>
<P>
Services offered range from patent search to assistance in
application of patents, industrial designs, trademarks and
copyright protection.
</P>
<P>
"In developing new products, industrialists often need to know
if such products or aspects of them have been developed or
patented by other manufacturers, locally or overseas. By having
on-line access to major databases worldwide on patents and other
intellectual property information, the center is well-positioned
to provide this service," Tang noted.
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. W. C. Keung, HKPC director in charge of the
Information Technology and Services Branch, to enhance efficiency,
the center also has a Consultation clinic to help assess the
potential of a product or technology in obtaining patent
registration before commencing application procedures.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the center is in line with HKPC's overall
initiative to promote invention, innovation, information and
industrialization. The council is a statutory body established in
1967 to promote productivity excellence in industries.
</P>
<P>
The council's efforts to promote innovation and invention
included the recent establishment of the Product Development and
Innovation Institute and the upcoming Chinese International
Invention Expo '98 to be held in late November.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Exports Decline in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's exports notched 674
million U.S. Dollars in 1997, a 14 percent fall from the 786
million U.S. Dollars recorded in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Maize exports dropped from 79 million kg to 20 million kg and
fish exports fell by half down to 17 million U.S. Dollars due to
a European Union (EU) ban, a report issued by the Uganda Export
Promotion Board (UEPB0 shows.
</P>
<P>
The fall in international coffee prices from 1.56 U.S. Dollars
per kg in 1995/96 to 1.40 U.S. Dollars in 1996/97 also caused a
drop in coffee receipts despite a high record of coffee volumes
of 4.2 million bags exported in 1996/97.
</P>
<P>
A combination of the prolonged drought and the El-Nino
torrential rains are mainly blamed for the sharp drop of
production and marketing of produce for both domestic consumption
and export.
</P>
<P>
The worst hit were beans, maize, soybean, sesame seeds, and
groundnuts.
</P>
<P>
The EU is still the major outlet of Uganda's exports,
accounting for 33 percent, followed by COMESA (27 percent), the
rest of Africa (17 percent), Far East (3 percent) and the rest of
the world (20 percent).
</P>
<P>
Regional markets, UEPB said, are becoming increasingly
important to Uganda's products, especially such low-value food
crops as maize, beans, bananas and milk.

BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese scientist said here today
that China plans to send a solar telescope developed jointly by
Chinese and German scientists into space around 2003.
</P>
<P>
The space solar telescope will be the most advanced one in the
world, said Ai Guoxiang, head of the Beijing Observatory under the
Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and an academician of CAS.
</P>
<P>
He said the telescope will consist of six major components and
weigh two tons, with its three dimensions measuring five, five and
two meters. Designed to work in space for three years, it will
help with researches on solar magnetic field.
</P>
<P>
As a chief scientist in charge of the project, Ai Guoxiang said
that total investment for the project is 500 million yuan (about
60.2 million US dollars), 80 percent of which is to be funded by
China.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists will be responsible for developing the main
optical telescope with a calibre of one meter and two other
components.
</P>
<P>
Most of the current space solar telescopes launched by other
countries have calibres of only a dozen centimeters, the scientist
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is of great significance to study the impact of
solar activity on earth disasters and human telecommunications
facilities.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, June 4 (Xinhua) -- A major development zone in Qingdao,
a coastal city of east China's Shandong Province, reported a
significant increase in the amount of overseas investment in the
first four months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Qingdao Economic and Technology Development Zone approved

percent over the corresponding period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics also show that contracted and paid-in
overseas investment in the zone rocketed 182 and 52 percent,
respectively, from a year ago. An analysis indicates that
investment from Europe and the Americas jumped more than 60

</P>
<P>
The lingering Asian financial crisis has produced some negative
impacts on Shandong's economy and trade, but investment in the
Qingdao zone by overseas consortiums has continued to rise, a zone
official said.

<P>
Currently, companies from 44 countries and regions have come to

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Wants Two-Way Communications With US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has said it will not accept
a proposed visit by high-level U.S. officials because Washington
has been sending envoys to Nigeria while banning Nigerian
officials from visiting the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the Lagos airport Wednesday, Foreign
Minister Tom Ikimi said that the U.S. should lift its sanctions
against Nigeria so that the two countries can interact.
</P>
<P>
According to Ikimi, U.S. President Bill Clinton has sent many
envoys to Nigeria, such as Reverend Jackson and former president
Jimmy Carter, but until now, Nigeria is still "awaiting responses
from the U.S. government so that discussions and decisions could
be reached on how to remove all restrictions and sanctions
between the countries."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. should remove its sanctions, the Nigerian foreign
minister said, "so when Clinton sends his envoys here, after they
have discussed, our own Head of State can also send his own
envoys."
</P>
<P>
Ikimi said that the Nigeria has forwarded a list of
delegations to visit the U.S, but is still waiting for response
from the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. imposed sanctions on Nigeria after the execution of
Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other minority activists by the Nigerian
government on convictions of murder.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions imposed by the U.S. government include the
banning of arms sales and military exchanges and non-issue of
visas to top Nigerian government officials.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said the U.S. government, through its embassy in
Nigeria, has requested to send a high-level delegation for
discussions on Nigeria's transition to civil rule program.
</P>
<P>
But Ikimi said the request will not be "considered and
processed" unless there is a response from the U.S.

SHENZHEN, June 4 (Xinhua) -- China's prosperous coastal city
Shenzhen spent 2.08 billion yuan (about 260 million US dollars) on

commitment to sustainable economic development.
</P>
<P>
With the investment, the city, China's first of the five
special economic zones, has completed a series projects for waste
water and solid wastes treatment, which enables the city to have

1996.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 98.4 percent of industrial waste water can meet the
state discharge standards, according to an environmental report
released here today by the local environmental protection bureau.
</P>
<P>
Noise pollution in the city proper and traffic arteries have
been reduced by 3.08 decibel and 1.9 decibel, respectively, while
the coverage of green areas has reached 44 percent, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The city has also increased its law enforcement efforts. Last
year, it suspended production of 11 polluting enterprises and
imposed penalties on 443 enterprises and private businesses that
violated environmental protection laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> 3 Nordic States May Host Rwanda Genocide Convicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Three European countries
have expressed willingness to accommodate convicts of the
International Criminal Tribunal of Rwanda (ICTR), media reports
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Denmark, Norway and Sweden, have agreed in principle to host
convicts of the tribunal, ICTR President Judge Laity Kama said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
African countries are reluctant to host the convicts because
few of their prisons match with international standards, Judge
Kama told reporters in Dar es Salaam Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Judge Kama said that ICTR convicts will only be jailed in
prisons which meet United Nations standards.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal is aware that it is inconceivable to ask African
countries to allocate funds to build prisons with international
standards because of their tight budgets. Many of them could not
even construct adequate schools and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Judge Kama said the tribunal is also negotiating with donor
countries to help any African state that agrees to host the
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four people are currently held by the tribunal. Another
11 have been indicted by the court, but are still in exile or
being held by third countries awaiting extradition.
</P>
<P>
Judge Kama and other ICTR officials arrived in Dar es Salaam
Wednesday and paid a courtesy call on President B. Mkapa. Judge
Kama presented to the president a report on the achievements of
the tribunal since its establishment in 1994.
</P>
<P>
ICTR, based in northern Tanzania's farming town of Arusha, was
established by the United Nations to try the chief suspects of
Rwanda's 1994 genocide.
</P>
<P>
Over 500,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed by Hutu
extremists in a three-month slaughter which ended with the
Tutsi-dominated Rwanda Patriotic Front seizing power.
</P>
<P>
Two cases have been completed by the tribunal. The first one
is that of Paul Akayesu, a former mayor, and the second is former
Rwanda Prime Minister Jean Kambanda who on May 1 pleaded guilty
to six counts of crimes.

its first Corporate Plan which sets out the ways to meet new
challenges as it heads for the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
The Corporate Plan for 1998/99 was tabled at the HA Annual

"Through the Corporate Plan, we are communicating our vision
and mission to the community and accounting for our performance,"

<P>
The new challenges faced by the HA include strong demand for
public housing, growing aspirations for home ownership, high
expectations of services, the call for close partnership with the
private sector and the need to achieve optimal cost-effectiveness
and operational efficiency within the Housing Department.
</P>
<P>

wide range of organizational goals, which includes lifting flat
production, reducing waiting time, enhancing home ownership and

PARIS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The French Minister of Industry,
Finance and Economy Dominique Strauss-Kahn said on Thursday that
the chairman and chief executive officer of Air France Jean-Cyril
Spinetta has the entire support from the government.
</P>
<P>
He also called on Air France to continue talks with the
striking pilots "under the best conditions" while reaffirming his
support to the air company's readjustment programs.
</P>
<P>
The pilots are on the fourth day of strike on Thursday in a
dispute with the air company's plan to reduce their salaries by 15
percent in exchange for its shares. They also want the scrapping
of a double system in pays between older and younger pilots.
</P>
<P>
Air France said that like Wednesday, 83 percent of the
long-haul flights from Paris will be cancelled on Thursday, while
from 60 to 70 percent of short and medium-haul planes will remain
stranded.
</P>
<P>
The unions of pilots and the management will continue talks in
an effort to put an end to the strike.
</P>
<P>
The company's management estimated that the strike is costing
Air France 100 million francs (16.7 million U.S. dollars) each day.
</P>
<P>
The strike, which was staged 10 days from the opening of the
Football World Cup finals, is widely criticized by nearly all
French political leaders.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Warns Foreign Investors Not to Be Racists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Racist and abusive investors in
Zambia will have their licenses withdrawn, Zambian Tourism
Minister Katele Kalumba has warned.
</P>
<P>
Kalumba sounded the warning when he toured Lufupa Safari Camp
in Eastern Province recently where some workers complained of
severe hunger and racial remarks by the proprietor, Yusuf Patel,
an Indian, according to Zambia Daily Mail.
</P>
<P>
The workers, who get 35,000 Kwacha (less than 20 U.S. Dollars)
a month, told the minister that Patel has not paid them in seven
months and that he calls them "male baboons".
</P>
<P>
They said that when they complain about how meager their
salaries are, Patel tells them to quit, but when they try to go,
he threatens them verbally by using racist remarks.
</P>
<P>
Kalumba said, "We need serious and considerate investors who
will not abuse the Zambian hospitality, financially or verbally."
</P>
<P>
Last week, a British national was deported by Zambia for
hurling racist insults at bar-men and using derogatory remarks
about Zambian President Frederick Chiluba's portrait in a
restaurant in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, tour operators in the Eastern Province complained
to Kalumba that poor government advertizing of tourist
attractions and bad roads have dogged their business.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Caltex, one of the three major
players in the Philippine oil industry, will raise the prices of
unleaded, premium and diesel products midnight Thursday,
Philippine News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Caltex dealers as saying that unleaded
gasoline, premium gasoline and diesel will go up by an average of
40 centavos to 11.69 pesos (0.3 U.S. dollars), 12.04 pesos (0.31
dollars) and 8.35 pesos (0.21 dollars) a liter.
</P>
<P>
Unioil and Flying V, two of the new entrants in the retail oil
marketing, have also adjusted their new prices Thursday after
Shell Philippines raised its prices Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources believed that the recent hike in crude cost
and the depreciation of the peso against the dollar caused the
increases in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate between the peso and the dollar weakened by
about 1.7 percent to 39.098 pesos per dollar from the April
average of 38.43 pesos a dollar.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Over 4,000 Ethiopian refugees
have returned home from Sudan over the past six months, the
Ethiopian News Agency reported here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Mengesha Jatu, representative of the North
Gondar refugee affairs of the Organization for Relief and
Development in Amhara region, as saying that these refugees have
been reintegrated with their respective communities in Amhara,
Tigray and Oromia regions.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation was made possible following the agreement
between Ethiopia and Sudan through the mediation of the United
Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), said the report.
</P>
<P>
War and famine during the past three decades forced Ethiopian
refugees to stream across the border to Sudan. Since 1991, the
number of Ethiopian refugees who returned from various asylum
countries has exceeded 900,000.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNHCR, there are still some 14,000 Ethiopians
living in different refugee camps and towns in Sudan. By the end
of 1997, 38,857 of the projected 50,000 Ethiopian refugees had
voluntarily returned from Sudan since the operation resumed in
December 1995.
</P>
<P>
Another 1,189 Ethiopian refugees have been repatriated as of
mid-April 1998, bringing the total to 40,046.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Denies Behind Move to Overturn Imelda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine president-elect Joseph
Estrada Thursday denounced speculations that he could have had a
hand in the move by the solicitor general to ask the Supreme Court
to overturn an earlier conviction on former first lady Imelda
Marcos.
</P>
<P>
Solicitor General Romeo dela Cruz was reportedly planning to
file a motion to the Supreme Court to overturn its earlier
decision sentencing the former first lady on graft charges filed
against her.
</P>
<P>
"I do not know anything about that," said Estrada, belying
speculations that the move may have been the quid pro quo
arrangement reached for her early withdrawal in the presidential
race.
</P>
<P>
Imelda, who had filed her certificate of candidacy for the
presidency in the May 11 elections, withdrew from the race just
days before the polls opened and asked her supporters to cast
their votes instead for Estrada.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he could not have ordered anyone to intercede for
Imelda, saying he has not even named an appointee to the Office of
Solicitor General.
</P>
<P>
However, Estrada had earlier been quoted as saying that dela
Cruz was among the officials of the outgoing Ramos government who
was being considered to stay on.
</P>
<P>
Cuevas Serafin, who served as justice in the Supreme Court,
recalled that normally, the High Tribunal gives weight to a motion
filed by the solicitor general, should he intercede in a case
already decided by the body.
</P>
<P>
"In cases like this, the Supreme Court ordinarily approves,"
Cuevas said, although he recalled on a specific case in the High
Tribunal during his time, when the justices reviewed the merits of
the case and decided against the solicitor general.

CANBERRA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Sydney 2000 Olympics will offer
individual and team gold medals in a record 296 events, games
organisers said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Australian Olympic Committee president John Coates said 28
different sports had been incorporated into the program and the
total of medal events was 25 more than at the 1996 Atlanta
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the gold medals increase to the
introduction of new sports and disciplines which include women
events in sports such as modern pentathlon, water polo and
weightlifting.
</P>

Sydney organising committee president Michael Knight said 11
different sports at least would be contested on each of the 16
days of competition, with a maxium of 25 on the second and fourth

<P>
NANJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province, one
of the country's most developed provinces, today launched a
poverty-relief program participated in by young volunteers.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, 20 young volunteers will set out for
northwest China's under-developed Shaanxi Province in August to
aid the local anti-poverty effort.
</P>
<P>
The program is part of a national endeavor to invigorate China
through science and education, and to eradicate absolute poverty
by the end of this century. The volunteers will work in the fields
of education, science, medical care and culture in poverty-ridden
areas for one to two years.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu will select 20 volunteers in the next two months
and train them before they leave for Yan'an and Xianyang in
Shaanxi in August. Yan'an was one of China's most important
revolutionary bases. The volunteers will work in the two places
for one year, and then be replaced by another group.
</P>
<P>
The local Jiangsu Lukui Group Company donated 200,000 yuan
(about 20,000 US dollars) in support of the program at a ceremony
this afternoon to mark its official launching.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Shift Health Focus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has decided
to shift its health focus from curative treatment of diseases to
preventive health services.
</P>
<P>
State Minister for Health Phillip Byaruhanga was quoted by New
Vision daily as saying that the government has introduced a state
minister for primary health care to cater for the new priority.
</P>
<P>
He said: "since independence the budget has been tilted toward
curative services. We must tilt the balance toward primary health
care."
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the primary health care can help reduce
Uganda's unacceptably high mortality rates, HIV infection and
fertility rates, adolescent pregnancies and stunted growth, he
added.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the successful implementation of the program, a work
plan has been drawn up.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is in acute shortage of doctors. It has about one
doctor for every 25,000 people, compared to one to 1,800 in
developed countries.
</P>
<P>
However, some doctors in this east African country are jobless
due to the civil service ban on recruitment.
</P>
<P>
An official of the medical association said, "we cannot afford
to have qualified medical workers redundant. Even if the tax
revenue remains low, it is no excuse to forgo the basic medical
services."
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to exempt doctors from the ban and
called on parliament to join in the struggle to repeal
unpalatable laws which stand in the way of provision of health
services.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Arms Race to Get Out of Control: Iranian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The nuclear arms race could be "out
of control" because India and Pakistan would not yield or even
bend under international pressure, said Iranian Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharazi here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The race shifts into high-gear and tends to get out of
control," Kharazi told a session of the 61-nation Conference on
Disarmament (CD). "Tension is bound to escalate."
</P>
<P>
"We must act first to freeze things where they stand and then
to initiate a reversal," said Kharazi, who visited Pakistan and
India respectively early this week.
</P>
<P>
He said that his impression was that "removing restrictions on
peaceful nuclear material might be a key toward accession to" the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) by India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister will go to New York to talk with
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan later.
</P>
<P>
Saying that Iran has no intention to mediate, Kharazi said
that he will have further exchanges with India and Pakistan
following his discussions with Annan and some foreign ministers
present in New York.

AMMAN -- Jordan will lay a 270-kilometer offshore pipeline with
the financing of a U.S. firm to transport gas from the Nile Delta
to its major industrial cities, the semi-official Jordan Times
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline, with a cost of 400 million U.S. dollars, will
first reach Jordan's Red Sea port city of Aqaba and then go on to
Amman and Zarqa to feed the thermal power plants and other heavy

BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- A report issued today by the
Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau shows that the
city's environmental standards were basically stable in 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the pollution indices of the city's
atmosphere increased slightly in 1997 over the previous
year. Pollution was more serious in downtown areas and in the winter
heating season than that in suburban areas and non-heating seasons.
</P>
<P>
Due to less precipitation, the pollution indices of some rivers
rose slightly. However, the quality of drinking water sources,
namely, the Miyun Reservoir and the Huairou Reservoir, was good.
</P>
<P>
Noise pollution was reduced, and garbage from daily life
increased by 1.7 percent in 1997 to 4.6 million tons, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 the city spent 3.94 billion yuan (about 474.7 million
US dollars) on greening, supplying gas for fuel, and treating
sewage and garbage.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 2.3 million households, accounting for 94 percent of the
total, were using gas at the end of 1997. And more households were
covered by the urban centralized heating system.

COLOMBO, June 4 (Xinhua) -- A substation was bombed in Western
Province of Sri Lanka Thursday morning, according to police here.
</P>
<P>
The destruction of the transformers by an unidentified person

Thursday's blasts occurred around 4:00 a.m., a senior police
official said.

Ceylon (Sri Lankan) Electricity Board officials estimated the
damage at around 500,000 U.S. dollars.

There was an indication that the substation blasts were similar

<P>
There had been five bomb attacks at telephone exchanges in
Chenkaladi, Dehiwela, Kaliyapitiya, Kulitara and Nochchiyagama in

<HEADLINE> French Historian Calls Napoleon "Disaster of France" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- French historian Roger Caratini said
in his newest book on Napoleon Bonaparte that the rising to power
of the former French emperor was a disaster for the nation, rather
than a glory as was stated by all historians in the past.
</P>
<P>
"Why Napoleon, whose role in history of France ended by the
apocalyptic withdrawal from Russia, by the diplomatic failure at
the Conference of Vienna, by the definitive defeat in Waterloo,
can still have the admirers, if not fanatics?" questioned Caratini
in his book "Napoleon, An Impostor."
</P>
<P>
He said that the outcome of the Napoleon era was terrible --
France lost 1.8 million men because of the Napoleonic wars, its
economy was ruined, its territory was occupied by one million
soldiers from enemy countries and it lost its natural frontier.
</P>
<P>
"Occupied, supervised, indebted, France was banished by Europe
and found itself shunned by the industrial revolution of which the
primary beneficiaries were Germany and Britain," he said. Napoleon
Bonaparte ruled France from 1801 to 1815 with an iron fist at home
and endless wars of aggression abroad.

<HEADLINE> China's Shipping Market Opens Wider Still </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 4 (Xinhua) -- China has scored great progress in
the process of opening its shipping market, according to sources
at a seminar closed here recently.
</P>
<P>
China has had more than 130 ports open to outside world and 120
foreign-funded shipping firms by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The country's large potential market has attracted the
world-renowned shipping firms. Forty percent of the 2,300-plus
ships leaving domestic ports every month are currently operated by
overseas shipping firms.
</P>
<P>
China has also provided the same equal treatment for overseas
firms joining the Chinese shipping market as their domestic
counterparts. For example, it allows foreign firms to operate
domestic shipping business and charges them same unloading fees
and port-using fees.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has used loans from the World Bank, the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) and from foreign governments since the
early 1980s to build a batch of ports at the ports of Qinhuangdao,
Tianjin, Lianyungang, Qingdao, Shanghai and Guangzhou, which have
increased the country's total handling capacity by 85 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Chinese mainland has made breakthrough concerning the
shipping across the Taiwan Straits, and the "direct shipping at an
experimental basis" was launched last year. So far, ten ships that
belong to the ten shipping firms have actually put into service.

<HEADLINE> German Economic Growth Hit Eight-Year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Germany's economy grew at an annual
rate of 3.8 percent in the first quarter of 1998, the strongest
expansion since the German reunification in 1990, the German
Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics office, the strong growth was
attributable to both the continued export boom as well as a strong
upsurge in domestic capital goods investment.
</P>
<P>
Despite the Asian crisis, Germany's exports soared 13.4 percent
in the first quarter of 1998 from the same period of last year,
while capital goods investment rose 10.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The office, however, cautioned that the growth figures was
exaggerated by seasonal factors, including mild weather, extra
purchases made ahead of a rise in value-added tax (VAT) in April,
as well as the inclusion of two more working days compared with
last year.
</P>
<P>
Germany's largest commercial bank, the Deutsche Bank, also said
Thursday that the special factors for the first quarter would work
in the reverse direction in the second quarter and could lead to
"clearly weaker growth dynamic" in the following months.
</P>
<P>
For the year as a whole, Germany's economy was expected to grow
at a rate of slightly over 2.5 percent, the Deutsche Bank said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Macao is to cut the fees on using the

<HEADLINE> OAU Establishes Int'l Panel on Rwanda Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity (OAU) has announced the establishment of an international
panel of eminent personalities to investigate the 1994 genocide
in Rwanda and the surrounding events.
</P>
<P>
According to a press statement issued here Wednesday by the
OAU, the chairman of the panel is Ketumile Masire, former
President of the Republic of Botswana.
</P>
<P>
Six other members of the team are former Head of State of Mali
General Amadou Toumani Toure, Judge Mohamed Bedjaoui of Algeria,
Mrs. Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia, Ms. Lisbet Palme of
Sweden, Justice Begwati of India and Ambassador Steven Lewis of
Canada.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the panel followed the proposal made by
the Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi in November 1997 to the
seventh ordinary session of the central organ of the OAU
mechanism for conflict prevention, management and resolution at
ministerial level.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was endorsed by the central organ and also
subsequently by the sixth-seventh ordinary session of the OAU
Council of Ministers which met in Addis Ababa in February, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The OAU statement said in announcing the composition of the
panel, Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim indicated that the
investigation would address, among other things, issues such as
the root causes of the genocide in Rwanda, the circumstances in
which that genocide took place and its consequences in Rwanda and
the Great Lakes region, including the roles of states and
non-state actors before, during and after the genocide.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general also announced the establishment of a
special trust fund to support the work of the panel and ensure
its independence.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, he appealed to OAU member states and the rest
of the international community to contribute generously to the
special trust fund, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The panel to be inaugurated in September 1998, is to have its
secretariat in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, according to the statement.

BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese side stands resolutely

stop its arms sales to Taiwan and not to sell the above-mentioned

KUALA LUMPUR, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim announced here Thursday that the proposed
Asset Management Company (AMC) will initially source 10 billion
ringgit (about 2.551 billion U.S. dollars) from local and
international bond markets.
</P>
<P>
The AMC, to be set up within two week's time, will acquire some
of the non-performing loans (NPLs) in local financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the details of the AMC at a news conference, Anwar
who is also Finance Minister said the AMC will issue bonds valued
between 1 billion U.S. dollars and 2 billion U.S. dollars with
government guarantee.
</P>
<P>
The AMC, once in operation, must be independent, Anwar said,
adding that it would be subject to external audit.
</P>
<P>
Its establishment will allow financial institutions saddled
with NPLs to unwind them and work towards "cleaning up" their
balance sheets.
</P>
<P>
The move is expected to help spur greater business activity and
speed up the country's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Up to March this year, the rate of NPLs stood at 9.3 percent of
total loans in the country.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Newspaper Publicizes Revised U.S. Pullback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 4 (Xinhua)-- An Israeli newspaper Thursday
publicized the details of the revised U.S. proposal which demands
Israel carry out a three-stage further redeployment within 12
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan published on the Hebrew daily Haaretz, 1
percent of Israeli controlled territory Area C will go to
Palestinian controlled Area A; 12 percent of Area C will go to the
jointly controlled Area B; an additional 14.2 percent of Area B
will go to Area A.
</P>
<P>
A joint Israeli-Palestinian committee will be established for
the third phase of the further redeployment, according to the plan.
</P>
<P>
The plan, presented to both Israeli and Palestinian sides last
Wednesday by U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross, demanded that the
permanent status negotiations should start when Israel begins
carrying out the pullbacks.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft, Israel should refrain from building
new settlements, limit expansion of existing settlements and land
confiscation, and stop the planned demolition of 1,800 Palestinian
homes.
</P>
<P>
For its part, the Palestine Liberation Organization's Executive
Committee should ratify the changes to the clauses in the
Palestinian Charter, which call for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
The plan also said that Israel and the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA), as well as the U.S., would strengthen their
cooperation on security issues. Haaretz said Israel had succeeded
in inserting a clause in the draft calling for creating a
"systematic program" by the PNA to confiscate illegal weapons.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported Thursday that Ross is holding talks in
London with Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), deputy to PNA President
Yasser Arafat, and Palestinian Legislative Council Speaker Ahmed
Qureia (Abu Ala) to discuss the revised U.S. plan. Abu Mazen is to
report the result of the talks to Arafat later Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not said publicly
if he would accept the revised plan. But he said Wednesday that he
believed the agreement on redeployment would be approved by the
Knesset (Parliament).
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has been making tremendous efforts for the past nine
months in solving the Israeli-Palestinian dispute over the size of
further Israeli redeployment in the West Bank, but achieving
little progress so far.
</P>
<P>
While denying the U.S. had given Israel a deadline to accept
its proposal, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Edward Walker said
Wednesday the U.S. could announce the new initiative in days.
</P>
<P>
This was a clear indication that Washington is getting
increasingly impatient with the lack of progress in its mediation
and the continued deadlock in the peace process, that threatens to
spark widespread violence in the region.

WUHAN, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Hi-tech industry has become an
economic growth point in central China's Hubei Province. Revenue
from hi-tech industry zones in the province amounted to 16.1
billion yuan (1.94 billion US dollars) last year, an increase of
54 percent over 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Hubei provincial government worked out a series of
preferential policies for the growth of hi-tech industry. The
province appropriated 20 million yuan of working funds (2.4
million US dollars) for ten high-tech industry projects in 1997,
and 50 million yuan (6 million US dollars) the following year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that Hubei now has 785 hi-tech enterprises,
with 46 having sales revenue of over 100 million yuan (12 million
US dollars), five others over 500 million yuan (60 million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
In 1997, among the top ten enterprises with reported biggest
profits, four are high-tech enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The province increased investment in such high-tech industries
like electronics information, biology technology, new medicine and
new materials, which has formed the scales to some extent.

<HEADLINE> PNA Minister Stresses Need for Holding Arab Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority Higher
Education Minister Hanan Ashrawi Thursday reiterated the need to
hold an emergency Arab summit to come up with a firm stance
against Israel's intransigence in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Cairo-based Voice of Arabs Radio over
telephone from Gaza, Ashrawi said the current Israeli government
insists on going ahead with its policy, reneging the agreements
signed with the Palestinian side despite all initiatives and
efforts exerted to revive the peace drive.
</P>
<P>
A just and overall peace is the only way to bring about
security for all the parties concerned, she stressed.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi said she has no confidence in achieving any progress in
the peacemaking as long as the present Israeli government remains
in office.
</P>
<P>
For several months, the Palestinians have been urging for an
Arab summit to rally support for their position in the peace
negotiations and to secure a common strategy to confront the
intransigent policies of the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest issue of Egypt's English-language Al
Ahram weekly, the Palestinians want the meeting to take a step in
the direction of the last 1996 Cairo summit that produced an
agreement that substantially slowed down the pace of normalization
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
They also expect the Arab leaders to discuss lowering their
countries' diplomatic representation in Israel and using their
economic clout to serve the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arab leaders are engaged in intensive consultations in
convening a restricted or expanded summit as the stalemate in the
Palestinian-Israeli peace-making has lingered for 15 months.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., whose latest peace initiative is resisted by Israel,
has asked the Arabs to put the summit on hold for a while as it is
pressing Israel to accept the package.

<HEADLINE> Poor Conditions Drive Animals Out of Kruger Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The growing number of large
wild animals escaping from the Kruger National Park into farmland
in Mpumalanga Province, northeast South Africa, are causing
extensive damage to crops and posing serious health risks.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists have said that the sudden surge in animal
escapes stemmed from growing overpopulation within the park,
following a moratorium on elephant culling, and the dilapidated
condition of the southern boundary fence.
</P>
<P>
In addition, late summer rains in the park also contributed to
large animals foraging outside the park and the situation was
expected to become worse during the winter months.
</P>
<P>
Escaping animals could spread serious disease to cattle and
other domesticated animals, Ertjies Rohm of the Mpumalanga Parks
Board said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The unhindered movement of the animals poses a health risk,
with the possible spread of foot and mouth disease and bovine
tuberculosis," Rohm said.
</P>
<P>
Farmers living in the area have suffered thousands of Rand
(one U.S. Dollar equals to about five Rand) in damage after
elephants and hippos trampled on their sugarcane and citrus
crops, African Eye News Service reported.
</P>
<P>
Roughly the size of British Wales or the state of
Massachusetts of the United States, the Kruger National Park
which occupies nearly two million hectares, is 350 km long from
north to south with a maximum width of 90km.

<P>
FUZHOU, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in Fujian Province, east
China, will build an environmental protection town that combines
economic development with a sound ecological system.
</P>
<P>
Pengkou Town covers 209 sq km and has 27,000 people. It has
been chosen by the Ministry of Agriculture as a "green food
production center".
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has decided to turn the town into an
environmental protection model, because of its forestry,
water, and agricultural resources.
</P>
<P>
The town will mainly be involved in the production of flowers,
fruit, vegetables, aquatic products and animal husbandry.
</P>
<P>
Only environment-friendly companies will be set up in the
town.
</P>
<P>
Construction is underway on some key projects like a forest
park and a 1,200-square-meter fairground.

<HEADLINE> US President's Decision on China's MFN Status is Wise: FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman
Zhu Bangzao said that US President Clinton has made a "wise
decision" when he informed the US Congress of renewing China's MFN
(most-favored- nation) status.
</P>
<P>
Asked to make the comment at a routine press conference here
today, Zhu noted that the mutual granting of MFN status between
China and the US is the basis of China-US economic relations and
trade, and it will facilitate the bilateral cooperation and
exchanges in the economic and trade field and bring about tangible
benefit to the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
It is therefore in the fundamental interest of the Chinese and
American peoples, added Zhu.
</P>
<P>
"What needs to be pointed out is that the annual review of
China's MFN status by the US side does not conduce to the
development of longterm, stable and normal economic relations and
trade between the two sides. We hope that the US side will abandon
this outmoded practice as soon as possible," Zhu said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The relief operations in
earthquake-hit northern Afghanistan have been slowed by heavy
rains, reports reaching here from Kabul said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains after the quake in Badakhshan and Takhar provinces
made it difficult and dangerous for planes to land, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Only a few helicopters made sorties to evaluate the extent of
damage and evacuate the injured on Wednesday, according to the
reports.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake measuring 7.1 on the Richter Scale occurred last
Saturday, in which at least 3,000 people were killed and about 50
villages destroyed.
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to assess the extent of casualties because
nobody has an exact figure for the total population of the
villages, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Coordinator for Afghanistan, Alfredo Witschi Cestari,
said Wednesday that aid agencies urgently need more cargo
helicopters and fuel to transport desperately needed relief goods
to Afghanistan's quake victims.
</P>
<P>
"We called upon everyone and anyone who can provide us with
helicopters to do so now," he said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Fights Back Opposition Criticism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
fought back criticism by the opposition conservatives, accusing
them of trying to dictate the president in the name of supreme
leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Tehran Radio reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Khatami made the remark at the ceremony held Wednesday night in
the mausoleum of the late Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Musavi
Khomeini to mark the 9th anniversary of his demise, the radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said that all the people should obey country's
constitution. "It is not necessary that someone comes to tell the
president what to do or what to say," he said, "Does the president
have no ability to explain his stance?"
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president said that Khamenei would announce his
stance himself and no one had the right to air views in the name
of the supreme leader.
</P>
<P>
Once again, Khatami stressed the importance of the rule of law,
saying that every one in the society has the right to announce his
views within the framework of the constitution and the government
would defend his right.
</P>
<P>
He urged unity among different political factions and
tolerance of opinion differences.
</P>
<P>
Khatami's strong-worded speech was believed to be a response
to the criticism by Ayatollah Ali Khazali, a member of the
conservative Guardians Council which supervises the implementation
of the constitution. Khazali said last Thursday that Khatami
should "publicly and unequivocally" confess and correct his
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
Khazali blamed Khatami, a moderate advocate of reforms and
social changes in Iran, for his presence and speech at the
cheerful rally held by his supporters on May 23 to mark his
landslide victory in the presidential elections a year ago.
</P>
<P>
In the rally, Khatami's supporters demanded for the ouster of
the conservative leading judiciary figures and Commander of the
Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Rahim Safavi. They also called
for reforms in some important state organs, such as the state-run
radio, television and the police.
</P>
<P>
Khatami's call for respecting the rule of law in his speech to
the rally was interpreted as a strong attack on the
conservatives, who were accused by the moderates of blocking the
reforms by the government.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Banks Cut Mortgage Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- All the major money banks in New

Zealand have announced cuts to their floating mortgage rates in
response
to the falling interest rates on the money market.
</P>
<P>
ASB Bank, ANZ-Postbank, Countrywide Bank, Bank of New Zealand
(BNZ),
the National Bank and the WestpackTrust Bank cut their floating
interest
rate by three quarter of a percentage point to 10.5 percent from
11.25
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, one of the banks, BNZ has warned that the lower rate
may not
last long in view of the volatile exchange rates of the Kiwi
dollar
because of fear of the Asian crisis impact.
</P>
<P>
The banks have been under pressure from politicians and the
Consumer
Institute who charged that the banks set a too high profit margin
between
their mortgage rates and the interest rates on the money market.
</P>
<P>
The banks borrow from the money market and set their lending
rates in
accordance with the 90-day bill rate, which is usually 1 to 1.5
percentage points lower than the mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
With the fall in the exchange rates of the New Zealand dollar,
the 90-
day bill rate has come down from over 9 percent one month ago to
the
present 8.5 percent. But the banks did not adjust their lending
rates
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
The banks argued that they could have lowered their mortgage
rates
last week, but the New Zealand dollar had not stabilized and the
volatility on the money market had prevented them from doing so.

of China's Most-Favored Nation (MFN) trade status for another
year. He said that it is vital for the United States to maintain
normal trade relationship with that Asian country.

<P>
The MFN status allows goods to be sold in the U.S. with normal
tariffs. It is extended to most nations and was first granted to
China in 1979. The annual renewal of China's MFN has become an
opportunity to debate the U.S. China policy, a controversial issue
in the United States for years. (US-China-MFN)

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Holds Talks with PNG PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
on Thursday held talks here with visiting Papua New Guinean (PNG)
Prime Minister Bill Skate, discussing bilateral and international
issues.
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters after the talks, Skate said he held
successful and wonderful discussions with the president. They
discussed among other things the economic, cultural and defense
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, who arrived here Wednesday afternoon for a
three-day visit, expressed support for the Indonesian government
during their difficult times. He felt confident that the
Indonesian government will find a solution to their difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Skate expressed the hope that the two countries will work close
together in the future.
</P>
<P>
Skate is the first head of government to visit Indonesia since
Habibie assumed the presidency on May 21.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a state dinner hosted by Habibie on Wednesday
night, Skate said that mutual respect is vital not only to
relations between Indonesia and PNG, but to the peaceful and
mutually productive conduct of international relations generally,
including regional, inter-regional and global cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the two governments have already achieved an
impressive record of cooperation at the United Nations and other
forums.

Habibie said in his speech that trade volume between the two
countries was still too small and should be increased.
</P>
<P>
He briefed his guest on the monetary and economic turmoil
Indonesia has been experiencing since mid 1997. He said the
Indonesian government hoped that its efforts to cope with the
problems would be successful as the country received assistance
from other countries and international institutions.
</P>
<P>
Skate is scheduled to visit a state aircraft manufacturer in
Bandung, West Java, and a state ship-builder in Surabaya, East
Java.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving Indonesia, Skate will visit the industrialized
island of Batam near Singapore, as Papua New Guinea is planning to
establish an area similar to Batam.

<HEADLINE> Grain Producer in Northeast China Involved in Animal Husbandry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Heilongjiang Province, a leading
grain producer in northeast China, has expanded its animal
husbandry so that it accounted for 32.9 percent of the province's
1997 agricultural output value.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the provincial government decided to expand the animal
husbandry business to solve the grain oversupply and marketing
problem. Last year, animal husbandry in the province consumed 8.5
billion kg of grain, but generated 4.25 billion yuan in added
value goods, while grain output went up to 31 billion kg.
</P>
<P>
The province produced 1.93 million tons of meat, 1.95 million
tons of dairy products, 1.12 million tons of eggs in 1997, all of
them registering significant increases over the 1994 figures.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, the province had a 10
percent increase in meat, egg, and milk output.
</P>
<P>
There are 603,000 households involved in livestock business
and 10,700 breeding centers in the province.
</P>
<P>
Some large companies processing livestock products and large
markets have helped the sector. As a result, the province no
longer consumes all its livestock products but also sells them
in other provinces.
</P>
<P>
About 1.5 million rural laborers are working in the production,
processing, and selling of livestock products in Heilongjiang,
accounting for a fourth of the province's rural work force.

<HEADLINE> One of World's Oldest Men Dies in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 4 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese man, who boasted that
death had "forgotten" about him, died Wednesday, at the age of 136
according to his memory, the Daily Star reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ali bin Mohammed Hussein, also known as Ali Zelem, who claimed
himself to be the oldest man in the world, had a heart attack and
passed away quietly at his home in Qinieh village in central
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
His death deprived his village of a walking history book that
stretched back to the days of the Ottoman rule, the newspaper
report said.
</P>
<P>
The man, also popular in the village for composing verses of
zajal, or traditional sung poetry in the Lebanese dialect, was
survived by 93 children, grandchildren and great grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
A great regret for Zelem was that The Guinnes Book Of Records
refused to proclaim him as the world's oldest living human being
as he was unable to provide a document to prove his age.
</P>
<P>
He argued that he had been born several decades before the
identity card system was first introduced in the new, independent
Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique: Grain Purchase to Rise in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican government has
predicted that the purchase of grain in the whole country this
year will reach 439,000 tons, 11 percent up against last year's
397,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The Director of the National Bureau of Internal Commerce, Jose
Paulo, disclosed this here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Among the purchase grain, maize will remain the number one, up
by 14 percent against last year's to reach 264,000 tons,
Thursday's Noticias newspaper quoted Paulo as saying.
</P>
<P>
The maize growing areas are mainly in central and northern
Mozambique. The purchase volumes of maize in central provinces of
Zambezia and Manica will be 60,000 tons and 50,000 tons
respectively while the northern Nampula Province will collect
60,000 tons of maize from the growers.
</P>
<P>
Cassava will rank the second with 55,000 tons getting in,
followed by beans (36,700 tons) and copra (36,500 tons), Paulo
said, adding that the purchase of rice will be some 19,000 tons
this year. Rice is one of the staples in southern Mozambique, the
capital city of Maputo in particular.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the total grain yield in Mozambique this
year will top 1.6 million tons compared with 1.5 million tons last
year.

<HEADLINE> Last Of A Breed Of Tibetan Hunters Lays Down His Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Sixty-two-year-old Daden, who lives
in the village of Qionglin in the Tibet Autonomous Region,
recently put away his guns and bows and arrows, the last hunter of
the Lhoba people.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to his grandsons, he says, "They're all studying in
school, and it seems they'll only need pens, and not arrows."
</P>
<P>
The Lhoba, who number fewer than 3,000, are one of the smallest
of China's 55 ethnic minorities. Before Tibet's
democratic reforms in 1955, the Lhoba lived in wooden huts in the vast
forests and mainly hunted for a living.
</P>
<P>
A Lhoba man used to be armed with a bow and arrows, hunting
dogs, and three knifes to help him make his way through the bush,
kill animals, and cut the meat up.
</P>
<P>
It was Lhoba tradition to share whatever they caught among all
tribe members, with the exception of the fur, bear's gall, and
deer's musk, which had to be sold to the local government.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes we
had to eat wild plants, when we couldn't get enough animals,"
Daden says.
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, the Lhoba began to move to valleys and the
plains, where they had access to roads and electricity, and with
the the government's help, the ethnic group began to make bamboo
items, use charcoal, and cultivate grain. Sometimes they still
hunted because of a lack of grain.
</P>
<P>
"Now my family no longer needs me to hunt, because my children
have better ways of making money," he explains. His family of
eleven grow grain on more than one hectare of farmland and raise 30 head of
cattle, and produce more than 5,000 kg of grain every year.
</P>
<P>
Daden now also owns a truck, a bulldozer, and four saws, and
the family have got involved in forestry and construction work.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the family earned more than 50,000 yuan and become one
of the richest families in the village. In their leisure time,
Daden and his family members enjoy the programs on color TV, and
listen to music and watch films on their video equipment.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Eyes Markets in C. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Trade Promotion Agency,
ZIMTRADE, is working to open up export markets in Congo
(Brazzaville), Gabon, the Central African Republic and the Great
Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
In its latest quarterly magazine, ZimTrader, released in
Harare Thursday, the organization said that it would carry out
market surveys in these countries to identify specific
opportunities for Zimbabwean products.
</P>
<P>
"Desk research for these markets so far indicates that there
are opportunities in pharmaceuticals, building and construction
materials, processed foods, leather goods, fresh fruits and
vegetables, corned beef and others," ZIMTRADE said.
</P>
<P>
"Local companies are advised to start looking at these
potentially lucrative markets and liaise with ZIMTRADE," it
added.
</P>
<P>
While Gabon, Congo (Brazzaville) and the Central African
Republic are small markets in terms of population with a combined
total of 5.7 million people, ZIMTRADE said, but they have high
purchasing powers.
</P>
<P>
Gabon whose major source of wealth is oil, has a per capita
income of 2,750 U.S. Dollars, and is the second richest country
in terms of per capita income in Africa after Mauritius.
</P>
<P>
Potential exports to the tiny, ethnic-conflict-prone nations
of Rwanda and Burundi include fresh, frozen and canned beef,
fresh fruits and vegetables, pork and pork products, and hardware
fixtures and fittings.
</P>
<P>
The trade promotion body said although recently rocked by
civil war, Congo (Brazzaville) would soon be calm and its economy
is financed by offshore oil fields.
</P>
<P>
"All the markets under consideration are wholly
import-dependent, giving Zimbabwe the room to develop export
relations with the importers," it said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Beef Exports Decrease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe lost more than 11 million
U.S. Dollars in exports in the last two years by failing to meet
the European Union beef quota.
</P>
<P>
Because of this failure, the country earned 29 million U.S.
Dollars in 1996 and 23 million U.S. Dollars last year, bringing
the total earnings in the last two years to about 53 million U.S.
Dollars, the Herald daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
If it had fulfilled the obligation, Zimbabwe could have earned
over 62 million U.S. Dollars, the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
In an interview Wednesday, Chairman of the Cattle Producers
Association Les Mallett said that the shortage of slaughter stock
had came about because cattle producers were rebuilding their
herds which had dwindled significantly following recent droughts
and subsequent poor seasons.
</P>
<P>
The failure to meet the EU annual beef quota in the last two
years had not only affected foreign currency earnings but dashed
the country's hopes of having the quota increased to 13,000 tons,
he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 the country failed to fulfill the quota by 2,500 tons
while last year it failed by 1,550 tons.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has only exceeded the quota twice, in 1993 when it
exported 9,740 tons and in 1995 when it exported 11,654 tons.

by the neighbourhood committee for the job.
</P>
<P>
Many of the pictures are now of guests and Li. She says
happily, "I have friends all across the globe."
</P>
<P>
The community where Li lives is one of the 15 in Shanghai that
are open to foreign tourists and started inviting foreign guests
as early as in the 1950s. However, it was in recent years that a
large number of foreign tourists began visiting her community,
mostly after China's reforms and opening-up in 1978, Li explains.
</P>
<P>
Her community -- Caoyang New Village -- has 50,000 residents,
100 of whom are "civilian diplomats" who played host to 8,600
foreign tourists in 1997 alone.
</P>
<P>
In order to better communicate with foreign guests, youngsters
in the village have set up their own English Corner where they can
meet periodically to practice oral English. The old ladies,
however, organized a chorus and learned to sing songs in English,
Japanese, and French and often give joint performances with the
guests.

BEIRUT, June 4 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli solider was seriously
wounded Wednesday night when his armored personnel carrier hit a
roadside bomb in south Lebanon, Voice of the People radio here
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The explosion took place near the village of Bint Jubiel in the
central part of the Israeli occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli artillery troops Thursday morning pounded
Iqlim Toufah area, a stronghold for the Iranian-backed Hezbollah,

</P>
<P>
Hezbollah responded with heavy machineguns and rockets,
targeting Israeli posts in the mountainous area of the village of
Sujud, on the edge of the occupied zone.

Israel has been occupying a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip
in south Lebanon since 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting
its northern areas from Lebanese guerrillas cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's anti-occupation forces spearheaded by
Hezbollah have been fighting a guerrilla war trying to drive

<P>
KAMPALA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- A special pay unit has been
established in the Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF) to curb
corruption and fraud in the army.
</P>
<P>
The team, appointed recently by President Yoweri Museveni, has
25 members who has been deployed in five army divisions
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
As a replacement of the pay-masters, the team is mainly made
up of university graduates and it is supposed to investigate
suspected fraud areas.
</P>
<P>
"The pay team was also given special powers to supervise
acquisition of supplies and procurement of goods in the force
which in the past was greatly abused," a military source was
quoted by the New Vision newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The situation has improved a lot since the team took over, the

</P>
<P>
When addressing officers and men of the UPDF at the 17th Army
Day celebrations at Bombo barracks on February 6, Museveni
decried the rampant corruption in the army.
</P>

million U.S. Dollars annually due to fraud in salaries and food
allowances in the Fourth Division alone.

FUZHOU, June 4 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province is
taking steps to make the Minjiang River safer near Fuzhou, the
provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
In the past, two branches of the Minjiang took the load of
flood waters, but since the 1990s, the Beigang River's banks have
collapsed because of excessive digging for sand, while the Nangang
has silted up and has no flow.
</P>
<P>
So, the local government spent 30 million yuan to re-inforce 33
dangerous sections of dykes, and now, the first and second phases of
the project have been completed and the third phase is
underway.
</P>
<P>
And, it set up a special team to study the changes of
the river course on the lower reaches.

<HEADLINE> Iran Keen to Expand Relations With Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran has lashed out at the United
States for allegations of Iran's interference in Bahrain's
internal affairs, saying that it is keen to expand relations with
the Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
It is the interfering policies of the United States which have
always created tensions and crises among other countries, Iran's
official news agency IRNA Thursday quoted Foreign Ministry
spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi as saying on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During the recent visit of Bahraini Emir Sheikh Isa bin Sulman
al-Khalifa to Washington, some U.S. officials blamed Iran for
interfering in Bahrain's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
During the past years, Manama accused Tehran of supporting
Bahrain's Shiite Muslims against the government. But Tehran has
always rejected such accusations.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that Iran is keen to expand relations with the
neighboring countries, particularly the Persian Gulf states based
on mutual respect and good proximity, arguing that Iran has never
interfered in the internal affairs of other countries.
</P>
<P>
He noted that objectives behind the U.S. vain charges against
the regional independent nations are to explain its illegitimate
presence in the Persian Gulf and prevent proximity among the
regional nations.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also expressed the hope that relations between
Iran and other Gulf states will further develop in the light of
mutual cooperation and understandings.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- John Stockton scored seven of
Utah's nine points in overtime as Jazz edged the Chicago Bulls
88-85 in Game 1 of the NBA Finals in Salt Lake City on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Stockton, 36, who hopes to win the championship for the first
time with a career of 14 years in NBA, displayed a brilliant play,
scoring 24 points for Jazz. His final shot in the last second
sealed the tough-fight victory.
</P>
<P>
Karl Malone, who had a 10-day layoff with the team after
winning the Western Conference finals, looked rusty most of the
time when the tough guy missed 10 mid-range jumpers and was on 4
of 19 shots in the first 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
But he came back strongly in the final two minutes of the
regular time, hooking a pair of jumpers to force a 79-79 tie.
Malone contributed 21 points plus 14 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
Michael Jordan led a game high 33 points, and Scottie Pippen
added 21 for the Bulls, who came to Jazz's home-court tired after
beating the Indiana Pacers 4-3 in the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
The halftime wound up 45-40 in favor of Utah. Jordan scored 20
points in the first two quarters, but Malone only got nine.
</P>
<P>
Entering the third quarter, the Jazz led a 8-0 run to widen the
gap to 53-45 and managed to keep the lead until 2:30 left in
regular time.
</P>
<P>
Jordan shot two jumpers before Pippen scored a three-pointer to
tie 75-all.
</P>
<P>
In the overtime, the Jazz quickly ran ahead to lead 84-79,
leaving the Bulls struggling in their wake during the rest of time.
</P>
<P>
With 43 seconds left and the ball in Chicago's control, it blew
up by Luc Longley, perhaps the worst center of all the NBA teams.
He tried to force his path to the hoop but lost the ball
again. The score then stood at 82-86.
</P>
<P>
With 3.5 seconds remaining and 85-88 trailing, Pippen got a
pass but missed the tying 3-pointer at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
Stockton wrapped up the game with a 9-for-12 free shooting,
eight assists and two steals.
</P>
<P>
"They just kept coming back. We're going to have to play better
than that if we're going to win this thing," Stockton said.
</P>
<P>
"Stock's got the ice water in his veins," Russell said. "You
know he wants that ring. Stock took over that game."
</P>
<P>
The second game is slated for Friday, also in Salt Lake City.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Okays 500M Dollar Container Terminal Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has okayed
the 500 million U.S. dollar Chittagong port container terminal
project, a daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The government had given a go-ahead to the U.S. container port
operator, Stevedoring Services of America (SSA), to set up an
international container terminal near the country's biggest port
city of Chittagong at a cost of about 500 million dollars, the
Daily Star quoted Shipping Ministry sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The project, the largest single foreign investment project in
this South Asian country and to be implemented in the form of
build-own-operate (BOO), would also have an inland container
terminal to be built near the capital city of Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
The terminal near Chittagong Port would be partially
operational in one and a half years' time, and the whole project
would be ready by the year 2001 when it could handle 600,000
containers annually, according to SSA officials.
</P>
<P>
The SSA officials hoped that it would help Chittagong Port
become a South Asian shipping hub, catering to local, regional and
international trade.
</P>
<P>
The inland container terminal would be built on the other bank
of Buriganga River at Pagla near Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
Both terminals would be fully computerized and help ease
congestion at Chittagong Port and at the same time help boost
local trade.
</P>
<P>
Congestion at Chittagong Port had reached a choking point as it
could handle about 300,000 containers annually, far above its
capacity, delaying loading and unloading.
</P>
<P>
The government had formed a project implementation committee to
help its speedy implementation. Preliminary work had already
started and work would begin in full swing from October this year,
the report said.

The Central Election Management Commission was predicting the
turn-out would be less than 60 percent of the 32.53 million
eligible voters, compared to 68.4 percent in the first local
government elections in 1995.

Voters will choose a total of nine governors, seven big city
mayors, 232 heads of small cities and counties, and 4,180

On Wednesday, Commission Chairman Choi Jong-young urged the
public to vote at the 16,161 balloting stations across the country
and candidates made a last ditch bid for votes by conducting

</P>
<P>
Election observers said the lack of voter interest could be
blamed on the effects of the continuing economic crisis caused by
corporate collapses and bad loans by financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Regional political differences are expected to be highlighted
in the elections with candidates of the ruling coalition of the
National Congress for New Politics and the United Liberal
Democrats reportedly tightening their political stronghold on
Cholla and Chungchong provinces. Those from the major opposition
Grand National Party are ahead in its political power bases of
Pusan, Taegu, Ulsan and Kyongsang provinces.

<HEADLINE> Thai Financial Authorities Plan Bank Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's financial authorities
are considering merging Radanasin Bank with financial company
Krungthai Thanakit Plc (KTT) and combining three nationalized
banks into a single entity, the Nation reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The move is to conserve bank licenses for the next few years,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Thailand Governor Chatumongol Sonakul revealed
Wednesday after meeting Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda
that the authorities have decided not to seek foreign partners for
Radanasin Bank.
</P>
<P>
Chatumongol said the decision was made because Radanasin has no
need to bid for the assets of the 56 closed finance companies to
be auctioned by the Financial Sector Restructuring Authority
(FRA).
</P>
<P>
"The second (FRA) decree that protects asset buyers after the
auctions should draw more bidders. Thus, the bank need not join
the bidding. It would be left doing business as usual and in the
future it would be merged with KTT if necessary," the newspaper
quoted the central bank governor as saying.
</P>
<P>
Radanasin Bank, which is capitalized at 4 billion baht (100
million U.S. dollars), was initially to bid for the assets of the
56 shut down finance companies.
</P>
<P>
KTT is to merge with seven ailing finance companies, which had
been taken over by the government.
</P>
<P>
If Radanasin Bank and KTT merge, the authorities can save one
banking license.
</P>
<P>
The Thai authorities have issued 16 banking licenses, including
three to nationalized banks -- Siam City Bank, First Bangkok City
Bank and Bangkok Metropolitan Bank.
</P>
<P>
Chatumongol said the three banks need to forge partnerships
with foreign investors. If the three are merged into a single
entity, two licenses will be returned to the Bank of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Chatumongol said Wednesday that the central bank will sell only
one license this year to ensure the government receives a fair
price for it.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government Urged to Focus on Micro Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 4 (Xinhua) -- It is time for the Thai government
to turn its economic policy around to focus on micro instead of
macro economy, an economist said.
</P>
<P>
Teerana Pongmakapat, an economist of Chulalongkorn University's
economic faculty, was quoted Thursday by the Bangkok Post as
saying that the country's macroeconomy has been stabilized to a
certain extent, so the government should shift its concentration
to micro policies.
</P>
<P>
He particularly urged the government to inject liquidity to the
market.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government maintained its policy of high interest
rates in a bid to stabilize the currency. However, many local
businesses could not afford the high interest rates and suffered
from liquidity crunch.
</P>
<P>
Teerana said if the local economy contracted too much, it would
also affect the baht's value.
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks, the government had been strongly
criticized for its policies focusing on stabilizing the
macroeconomy, and ignoring the poor and the real estate sector.
</P>
<P>
In view of this, the government has agreed to implement both
fiscal and monetary measures to help the real estate sector and
reinvigorate the sagging economy.
</P>
<P>
The objective of these measures is to inject liquidity into the
market, according to top government officials.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came after Tuesday's cabinet meeting between
government officials, led by Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, Deputy
Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi and Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanhaeminda, and senior members of the Thailand Development
Research Institute (TDRI), led by chairman Anand Panyarachun.
</P>
<P>
The government agreed with TDRI's recommendation that it give
more weight to short-term monetary measures.
</P>
<P>
Among the measures to be implemented shortly are tax incentives
to encourage loan restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The government agreed that if business corporations and their
bankers could settle their loan-restructuring schemes, more
liquidity would be available in the money market.

<HEADLINE> Laos Agrees to Allow Thai Vehicles into Vientiane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Laos agreed to allow
Thai-registered vehicles to enter its capital Vientiane, the
Nation Thursday quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Kobsak Chutikul
as saying.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman did not say when the new measure would become
effective.
</P>
<P>
Kobsak said Wednesday that the agreement was reached Wednesday
at a meeting between Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan and his
Lao counterpart Somsavat Lengsavad during the former's three-day
official visit to Vientiane.
</P>
<P>
The vehicles entering Vientiane needed insurance that covered
accidents in foreign countries, Kobsak said.
</P>
<P>
Laos has refused to allow Thai vehicles into the capital for
fear of traffic congestion. Thai vehicles had to park at the foot
of the Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge, which links the Lao capital
with Nongkhai province in northeastern Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Thai Interior Ministry also agreed to allow
vehicles from Laos to enter Thailand's northeastern province of
Udon Thani.
</P>
<P>
At present, vehicles from Laos can go only to Nongkhai
province.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Surin also proposed a new framework of
Thai-Lao relations called interdependence partnership towards 2003
and aimed at greater bilateral prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Thailand and Laos plan to sign four bilateral agreements
covering extradition, finance and cross-border transport when Lao
prime minister visits Bangkok later this year, Surin revealed.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh, U.S. Sign Investment Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh and the United States of
America have signed an investment incentive agreement to
facilitate U.S. private investment in Bangladesh, The New Nation
daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Overseas Private Investment
Corporation (OPIC) of the U.S. might provide political risk
insurance and debt financing to American companies making
long-term investment in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The agreement paved the way for the OPIC's financial support to
U.S. investors working in Bangladesh, including 375 million U.S.
dollars in financial support for U.S. company Unocal's proposed
Western Region Integrated Project.
</P>
<P>
The OPIC previously announced that it would provide 175 million
dollars in loan guarantees and 200 million dollars in political
risk insurance for the project.
</P>
<P>
Since 1971, the OPIC had supported 107.8 billion dollars worth
of investments in developing countries, and the Unocal had already
invested over 5 billion dollars in energy projects in Asia and had
implemented projects including resource development,
transportation facilities and power production, the report said.

JAKARTA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Over 1,100 people died in rioting
in Jakarta and other parts of Indonesia from May 12 to 25,
newspapers Thursday quoted the National Commission on Human Rights
as saying.

The commission did not provide a breakdown of the death toll in
rioting that led to the resignation of president Soeharto, but it
said it was based on reports in various parts of the country.

<HEADLINE> Moody's Freezes Thailand's Near-term Rating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Despite the positive moves made by
the Thai government to address the economic problems, Moody's
investors service said it would not change Thailand's credit
rating in the near term.
</P>
<P>
Julia Turner, managing director for Asia Pacific corporate
ratings, said Wednesday that political stability, which is
essential as structural reforms continue, remains an uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
The policies and steps taken by the government are promising,
but the support for the government may diminish due to the pain
involved in implementation of these policies, Thursday's Bangkok
Post quoted her as saying.
</P>
<P>
Turner praised the government's efforts to encourage
transparency, reform the financial sector and attract capital
inflows.
</P>
<P>
But Thailand could take up to seven years to achieve
sustainable growth, she said, citing poor export performance,
regional instability and the worsening economies in Asia as the
reasons.
</P>
<P>
Moody's currently assigns Thailand a Ba1 rating, one step below
investment grade.
</P>
<P>
Investors closely monitor credit ratings in pricing new debt
issues, with poorly-rated issuers forced to pay higher interest
for borrowings in the international market.
</P>
<P>
Thai Finance Ministry is expected to issue up to 5 billion U.S.
dollars in global bonds over the next few years, with the first
lot scheduled over the next few months.
</P>
<P>
Analysts expect the new bonds to be priced 300 to 350 basis
points or about 9 to 9.5 percent over U.S. treasuries.

<HEADLINE> S. Asia Shouldn't Waste Money on Arms Race: Hasina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina Wednesday said countries of poverty-stricken South Asia
"should not waste money in an arms race creating a tense situation
in the region", according to press reports Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We don't believe in arms race, we want peace... We are deeply
concerned over the situation created in the region," she said
while addressing army officers Wednesday at Bandarban Cantonment,
about 260 kilometers southeast of here.
</P>
<P>
The recent nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan had
created anxiety in Bangladesh because of her geographical
location, she told the army officers.
</P>
<P>
She asked members of the armed forces to remain alert, saying
"if needed, the defense system should be further consolidated and
our strategy should be changed in a changed situation."
</P>
<P>
"What is the justification of the arms race when the whole
world is striving for peace?" Hasina asked.
</P>
<P>
"The two countries (India and Pakistan) can solve all the
problems through negotiation," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government would try not to let the situation
aggravate further in the region, Hasina said. "If needed, I will
visit the countries for the sake of peace."
</P>
<P>
The money spent in the arms race could be spend for the poor
people of the region, she said. "This will help improve the
condition of the distressed people."

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Economic Solution Depends on Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The solution to Indonesia's
economic crisis depends largely on a solution to the political
uncertainty, an independent think tank was quoted by local press
Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
In a discussion here Wednesday, the Econit Advisory Group said
that unless Indonesia elects a new credible government, the
country's economy would soon collapse.
</P>
<P>
Plunging foreign exchange reserves, the ballooning budget
deficit and the severe lack of capital inflow are all serious
threats to the economy's ability to survive the economic crisis,
Econit said.
</P>
<P>
"We must have a government which is credible both domestically
and internationally," said the group's senior economist Rizal
Ramli.
</P>
<P>
Econit expects the country's economy to contract 10 percent
this year against an average growth rate of 7 percent before the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"This would cause additional unemployment of around 20
million," Rizal said.
</P>
<P>
President Habibie, who has promised a general election sometime
next year, seems to have started gaining international confidence.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the World Bank said Wednesday that it had
resumed a 225 million U.S. dollars loan to reduce poverty in
Indonesia.
</P>

Hubert Neiss has also said that Indonesia had an impressive

JAKARTA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's ruling Golkar will hold
an extraordinary congress in July to make several adjustments
within the party in line with demands for reform in all fields,
press reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The decision to hold the congress was reached at a meeting of

Golkar Chairman Harmoko said the agenda of the extraordinary
conference would include amendments to the party's articles of

</P>
<P>
The congress aimed to strengthen the ruling party's identity
and to materialize its ideals, he added.
</P>
<P>
He refused to say whether he would resign to meet his critics'
demands that this was the only way to save the organization from
crumbling as it was losing people's confidence.
</P>

COLOMBO, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The main emphasis will be on
economic issues at the forthcoming South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Summit to be held in Colombo, Sri
Lanka, in July this year, according to Foreign Ministry sources
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the 10th SAARC Summit will address and review
a host of issues taken up during the SAARC meetings in the recent
past and will also discuss regional and international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Other important issues such as environment, information
technology and commerce will be discussed at the secretarial and
ministerial levels during the summit.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Sri Lanka faced certain disadvantages
regarding tariff concessions in the region as it was caught
between lesser developed countries who are entitled to special
concessions and larger South Asian countries where non-tariff
barriers remain firmly in place.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka hoped for more cooperation among regional states,
especially the bigger states such as India when these issues will
be taken up at the summit, the sources noted.

All participants including India and Pakistan have confirmed
their participation at the summit, the sources added.

CARACAS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The 34 member countries of the
Organization of American States (OAS) Wednesday expressed their
determination to close ranks in the fight against drug, terrorism,
corruption and poverty.
</P>
<P>
The Caracas Statement, issued at the conclusion of the 28th OAS
annual meeting, calls on all members to enhance regional
cooperation, particularly on preventing the consumption,
production and transportation of drugs.
</P>
<P>
Mutual respect, dialogue and regional cooperation are the basis
of drug-fighting, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers or their representatives attending the
three-day meeting have also agreed that regional poverty is the
biggest obstacle to peace and development, and that education is
the precondition for eradicating poverty and improving regional
politics, economy and culture.
</P>
<P>
The statement also puts forth an action plan for prevention and
eradication of terrorism and corruption. "Corruption hurts our
public institutions, degrades moral values and hinder social
progress."
</P>
<P>
These efforts will pave the way for regional integration and
protection of democracy.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also passed a resolution condemning India and
Pakistan for their nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
Several issues divided the delegates, including a recent
U.S. drug sting in Mexico and a threat by Trinidad and Tobago to
withdraw from the Inter-American Convention on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Mexico conflicted on Operation Casablanca, a drug
sting carried out partially on Mexican soil. Mexico has launched a
formal protest with Washington after the operation was made public.

CARACAS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Organization of
American States (OAS) Wednesday urged India and Pakistan to
conduct no more nuclear tests similar to those they carried out
last month.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution passed at the 28th OAS annual meeting, foreign
ministers or their representatives from the 34 member states
unanimously condemned the nuclear tests conducted by India and
Pakistan last month.
</P>
<P>
The resolution said that the tests not only violated the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) but also threatened peace
and stability in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
It urged India and Pakistan to sign immediately and
unconditionally the NPT and seek peaceful means to settle their
differences.
</P>
<P>
The resolution called for utmost restraint and renouncement of
any new nuclear testing plan on the part of the South Asian
countries in question.
</P>
<P>
It also stressed the importance for all countries in the world
to sign the NPT and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, as the two
pacts are basic factors in preventing nuclear proliferation
and promoting nuclear disarmament.

<HEADLINE> New U.S. Census Board Members Take Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Members of the new board formed
to monitor "Census 2000" in the United States took office
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The eight-member group will observe the effort to conduct a
national head count and help resolve potential disputes over how
that can best be done.
</P>
<P>
"Accuracy is a surprisingly complicated issue," said David W.
Murray of the Statistical Assessment Service, a Washington-based
think tank.
</P>
<P>
Murray, a republican-appointed board member, called the 2000
effort "a census at risk."
</P>
<P>
An estimated four million people were missed in the 1990
census. In an effort to reduce that error, statisticians
recommended using a system called "sampling" to improve the count
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The first 90 percent of people would be counted by traditional
methods and the sampling would be used to help account for the
remaining 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
That plan has become a highly controversial issue.
</P>
<P>
Most of those missed in 1990 were minorities and residents in
large cities, groups that usually vote democratic.
</P>
<P>
Since census figures are used to distribute seats in the House
of Representatives and redistrict political boundaries,
republicans fear the result would be losing republican seats in
the Congress and state and local governing bodies. They contend
that sampling is little more than unconstitutional guessing.
</P>
<P>
Democrats, meanwhile, insist sampling is the best way to get an
accurate count of people who often do not want to cooperate with
government.
</P>
<P>
Murray said the census must be done efficiently, but not in a
way that abandons the U.S. Constitution's mandate for accuracy.
</P>
<P>
Everett Ehrlich, a former undersecretary of commerce and a
democratic appointee to the board, responded that the country
needs an "accurate count, not just of those who can be found or
who answered the mail that day ... but of all Americans."
</P>
<P>
The choice, Ehrlich said, is between a census where most people
are counted one by one and the rest estimated, even if that last
group is considered "fuzzy." Or a census where most are counted
and the rest are simply not counted.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Researchers Link Unusual Dementia to Gene Flaw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Scientists from Seattle, the
U.S., have identified a gene associated with a disease that is
similar to Alzheimers.
</P>
<P>
Symptoms of the disease typically begin in the early 50s.
Sometimes the symptoms result in difficult behavior and at other
times it causes problems with muscle control.
</P>
<P>
It is not an Alzheimer's gene, but it has implications for
Alzheimer's disease and other disorders.
</P>
<P>
Reporting their findings in the June edition of the Annals of
Neurology, the researchers claim the gene is yet another link to
Alzheimers and may help further understanding of several other
diseases.
</P>
<P>
It is the second Alzheimer's linked gene found in recent years
by researchers at the Seattle-based Veterans Affairs Medical
Center and the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
In the new research, the scientists have found that patients'
brain cells with the unusual dementia are filled with abnormal
tangles of protein filaments. Yet they lacked the amyloid protein
plaque that clogs the brains of Alzheimer's patients.
</P>
<P>
Analyzing the DNA of 21 patients from two families, the
researchers discovered that the villain is a defect in a gene on
chromosome 17 called Tau.
</P>
<P>
The research opens a new path for exploration of possible drug
treatment, not only for Alzheimers but for several other illnesses.
</P>
<P>
Some patients with the gene flaw have schizophrenic-like
delusions early in the disease. Or they may become argumentative
and short-tempered, often talking loudly and swearing in public.
</P>
<P>
Others have some symptoms of Parkinson's disease, including
muscle rigidity and slow movements. Or they have severe muscle
loss and weakness, similar to patients with amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease). After several years, many lose
the ability to speak.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Army Chief Urges Nation to Give </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI)
Commander Gen. Wiranto Wednesday once again called on the nation
to give the government the chance to resolve the economic crisis,
press reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto reiterated his support for President B.J. Habibie and
for the Reform and Development Cabinet which faces daunting tasks
to overcome the crisis and lead the reformation movement.
</P>
<P>
"ABRI has always supported the legitimate and constitutional
government recognized by the people. So, let's all together give
the government the chance to take various positive steps to solve
the problems facing this nation," said Wiranto, who is also
minister of defense and security.
</P>
<P>
His statement came amid calls for an extraordinary session of
the People's Consultative Assembly to elect a new leadership.
</P>
<P>
Habibie, who assumed the presidential office on May 21 after
the resignation of former president Soeharto, has promised fresh
elections next year to form a new assembly which will elect a new
president and a new vice president by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto said demand for political reform must be tempered by
restraint, warning that radical demands could delay the country's
economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
"ABRI realizes that reform is not without limits. Reform cannot
steamroller the limits set by Pancasila ideology, the 1945
Constitution, nationalism and national unity and cohesion." he
said.
</P>
<P>
Pancasila is the five basic principles of the Republic of
Indonesia, which include belief in God, just and civilized
humanity, the unity of Indonesia, democracy guided by the wisdom
of representative deliberation, social justice for all
Indonesians.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto warned that activities that exceed the limits and get
out of control will obstruct the reform progress, "and they will
certainly have to face ABRI".
</P>
<P>
Referring to demands for an investigation into the source of
the former president Soeharto's family wealth, Wiranto called on
people to acknowledge Soeharto's achievements over the past three
decades and praised his wisdom in resignation when he did without
using the military to hold on to power.

successful.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Yunnan to Invest More in Highway Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan Province
will significantly increase its investment in highway construction
this year.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan's total investment in highway construction this year has
been budgeted at more than seven billion yuan, about twice the
combined figure for the previous two years.
</P>
<P>
A provincial official has said that Yunnan will spend a total
of more than 26 billion yuan in highway construction in the
1996-2000 period, as against 9.6 billion yuan for the 40 years
prior to 1995.
</P>
<P>
Abundant in natural resources, Yunnan has remained
underdeveloped partly because of backward transportation
conditions.
</P>
<P>
However, as China's economy reform deepens, Yunnan has steadily
and significantly increased its input into road construction. Its
highway construction spending totaled 7.6 billion yuan in the
1996-1997 period, as compared to 7.1 billion yuan for the five
years from 1991 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year Yunnan had built highways totalling
73,800 km in length, in addition to another 30,000 km of rural
highways.
</P>
<P>
In the remaining years of this century, Yunnan will mainly
invest in construction of expressways and other high-grade
highways, including one linking this provincial capital
with Bangkok, the provincial official said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Yunnan has applied for loans from overseas banks
and international financial institutions to help fund its highway
construction program.
</P>
<P>
Funds will also be raised through leasing the operation right
of highways to overseas enterprises, the official added.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan will have completed the construction of a complete
highway network linking it with neighboring provinces and
countries by the end of this century, he said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Threatens to Withdraw Peace Force From Abkhazia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian First Deputy Foreign
Minister Boris Pastukhov warned the Georgian government and the
Abkhazian authorities that Russia may withdraw its peace-keeping
force from Abkhazia.
</P>
<P>
If there is no progress in negotiating the conflict between the
two sides, and if they continue to spread rumors about the Russian
peace-keeping force, Russia will withdraw its forces from
Abkhazia, said Pastukhov at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
In response to accusations and rumors about the Russian peace
force, Pastukhov said a potentially large-scale war was prevented
recently because of the presence of Russian peace-keeping troops.
</P>
<P>
The troops prevented the transport of heavy weapons and a large
number of troops to Abkhazia, he said. And the Russian camps have
been used as safe havens for civilians during the conflict.
</P>
<P>
On June 2, six Abkhazian police were killed by land mines in
the Ghali region. Pastukhov said that President Eduard
Shevardnarzde and Abkhazian leader Vladislav Ardzinba believed the
incident was intended to undermine the peace agreement signed on
May 25.
</P>
<P>
Some people do not want to see a settlement of the conflict and
thy want to intensify the situation, Pastukhov added.
</P>
<P>
The conflict between the Georgian government force and the
Abkhazian militias began in July, 1992, when Abkhazia proclaimed
itself as an independent state.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, several thousand Russian troops went into Abkhazia to
keep the peace. The mandate for the peace-keeping force expires on
July 31, 1998.

GUANGZHOU, June 4 (Xinhua) -- This capital of south China's
Guangdong Province is to auction land for the first time for
commercial housing development.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and overseas companies, enterprises and other
organizations, as well as individuals, are eligible to bid for
five pieces of land along Gongye and Jichang roads. The

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Delighted by Grain Circulation System Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Following three years of straight
grain price declines, once-disheartened Chinese farmers have
eventually begun to smile again.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, grain prices across China have shown handsome rises
since the start of this month. In east China's Zhejiang, central
China's Hubei and many other provinces, price hikes have ranged
from five to 10 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Grain officials said they expect grain prices to go up further
in the remaining months of this year, and the overall increase rate
to exceed 10 percent on a year-on-year basis.
</P>
<P>
The encouraging price rises have come directly from China's
grain circulation reform, officially launched in May to raise
farmers' incomes and stabilize grain prices, experts note.
</P>
<P>
China has posted continuous bumper grain harvests since 1995,
with output hitting 490 million tons in 1997, a figure that has
enabled China to meet the target of 400 kg of grain per capita
each year.
</P>
<P>
However, grain surpluses have occurred in many parts of China
due to irrational distribution structures as low and
mediocre-quality grain makes up the bulk of the country's total
grain production.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, many major grain-producing areas have encountered
great difficulties in selling their grain and seen prices decline
steadily year by year. The situation has been further compounded by
hostile price cuts among competitive marketers.

MANILA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Philippine newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Manila Bulletin:
</P>
<P>
-- President-elect Joseph Estrada Wednesday urged government
officials to heed the call of President Ramos to voluntarily step
down in order to give him a free hand to set in place a new
generation of leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Star:
</P>
<P>
-- The Office of the Solicitor General, in a dramatic
turnaround, asked the Supreme Court Wednesday to acquit former
First Lady Imelda Marcos of her 12 year jail sentence for
corruption handed down in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Business World:
</P>
<P>
-- As the economy grapples with the effects of the Asian
financial turmoil, the National Economic and Development Authority
sees growth in investments slowing this year to 22.6 percent from
the year-ago 23.9 percent.
</P>
<P>

denounced the government action urging the Supreme Court to
overturn the conviction of former First Lady Imelda Marcos for
graft.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Delighted by Grain Circulation System Reform (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To solve the problem, the Chinese State Council decided to
overhaul its grain circulation system in late April. The nucleus
of the reform package is to protect farmers' enthusiasm to grow
rice by procuring grain at profitable prices and make grain firms
more market-oriented and economically accountable.
</P>
<P>
In just two months, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong,
Guangxi and many other provinces, municipalities and autonomous
regions have beefed up their efforts to regulate and standardize
the grain market.
</P>
<P>
Wang Chunzheng, deputy minister of the State Development
Planning Commission, said that different regions should set grain
prices on the basis of balancing the interests of both grain
producers and consumers.
</P>
<P>
In Hubei, Hunan and Jiangxi consumers have reacted calmly to
grain price increases averaging nearly 10 percent so far this
year. Official figures indicate that urban Chinese residents spend
an average of 40 yuan (about five US dollars) on grain consumption
each month.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zhuping, governor of Hubei Province, said that the
state-owned grain enterprises represent the hardest nuts to crack
in China's grain system reform. The 250,000 workers in Hubei's
state-owned grain enterprises, for example, sell an average of
only 20,000 km of grain each per year.
</P>
<P>
At least half of these workers must be diverted to other jobs
over the next three years, Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> Sino-U.S. Mutual Respect Is Growing, Says Former U.S. National </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Although United States headlines
imply there is friction in the Sino-U.S. relationship, the truth
is that there is growing mutual respect between both the leaders
of the two countries and among the people at the grass roots
level, says former U.S. National Security Adviser Robert
C. McFarlane.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to the United States last
fall was a "watershed event" which has led to a steady improvement
in Sino-U.S. relations, said McFarlane, who was President Ronald
Reagan's national security adviser between 1983 and 1985.
</P>
<P>
The agreement between Jiang and U.S. President Bill Clinton to
establish a "constructive strategic partnership," represents U.S.
recognition that as great powers, China and the United States both
share important responsibilities to consult with each other on how
together they can help solve problems which could upset stability
in any part of the world, McFarlane said in response to a written
question by Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
At this moment for example, McFarlane said, "it will be
important for them to focus during their talks on the situation in
South Asia with a view towards reaching agreement on measures they
can take together to restore stability."
</P>
<P>
President Clinton is scheduled to make his reciprocal visit to
China later this month.
</P>
<P>
McFarlane said that already the two countries have cooperated in
moderating the damage from the recent currency turmoil in Asia.
"China's restraint in not devaluing its currency has helped to
stabilize the situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, he said, the greatest potential for an early
demonstration of the importance and potential of
Sino-U.S. cooperation would be for the two leaders to agree during
their meetings to focus on how together they can contribute to the
restoration of stability in South Asia, and then to organizing the
necessary investment funds to stimulate growth in the economies of
the region so as to relieve the root of turmoil.
</P>
<P>
"As globalization gathers momentum, it will be more and more
important for China and the United States to coordinate their
economic policies so as to reduce the potential for turmoil in
trading relationships, and to avoid a spiral of competitive
devaluations in Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is also potential for China and the U.S. to cooperate in
the development of the Russian energy resources in Siberia so as
to prevent any ultimate competition for energy between Japan and
China," he added.

CANBERRA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Australian newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister John Howard and his senior ministers
unleashed a concerted attack on Pauline Hanson Wednesday as
Coalition MPs quaked before the specter of One Nation Party's
rising power in the Queensland election campaign. Discarding his
long-standing refusal to make personal attack on Hanson, Howard
said Hanson's speech to parliament was fanning racism.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- Pauline Hanson said Wednesday that her One Nation Party
would support a minority Coalition government in Queensland, but
would expect in return its backing for looser gun laws and the
abolition of native title.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- It was a decade in which Australians on average became 18
percent richer. Yet the wealth became more unevenly distributed.
Taxes were cut for the rich but raised for the poor, and profit
growth easily outpaced growth in wages.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- The Australian economy grew by a solid 1.3 percent in the
March quarter, but there were ominous signs of a sharp slowdown
over coming months in national accounts figures released
Wednesday.

BRUSSELS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Host Belgium beat Colombia 2-0 on
Wednesday in a soccer friendly that served as a tune-up for both
teams for the coming World Cup tournament.
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Danny Boffin put the host side on the scoreboard in
the 16th minute when Marc Wilmots diverted a pass from within the
penalty area to the right where Luis Oliveira crossed the ball
back to the front of the Colombian goalmouth to set Boffin up for
his scoring header.
</P>
<P>
The Colombians could have equalized four minutes later when
Belgian goalkeeper Filip de Wilde misjudged a clearance kick on
the front line of his own area.
</P>
<P>
The scooped-up lob fell to waiting striker Faustino Asprilla
who headed the ball toward the unguarded goal but only wide.
</P>
<P>
The Belgians went two up in the 31st minute as Wilmots went it
alone with a 25-meter drive that just beat the fingertips of the
Colombian goalkeeper.
</P>
<P>
Asprilla had another chance early in the second half when there
was only the Belgian goalkeeper in between him and the opposing
goal. But he only saw his effort first blocked and then grabbed
by de Wilde.
</P>

Belgium next plays Paraguay on Saturday before leaving for
France where it plays the Netherlands, Mexico and South Korea in

PARIS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The world auto racing ruling body FIA
Wednesday dropped the Rally of Indonesia from the 1998 race
calendar.
</P>
<P>
The FIA said in a statement it had withdrawn the September
rally from the schedule because of "the current situation in
Indonesia and difficulties with transportation of material for
competing teams."
</P>
<P>
The FIA said the schedule would be reduced from 14 to 13
events. It said it was too late to substitute a rally in China,
which was tentatively set for June 19-22.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia could return to the calendar in 1999, the FIA said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Syrian Officials Meet in Houston </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Syrian officials
have made three-day informal discussions on long-stalled peace
talks this week at Rice University in Houston, Texas, an official
at the university said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in two years that the two countries have
had high-level contacts about the peace process. But the meetings,
which began Monday, were not described as "direct negotiations."
</P>
<P>
"I want to underscore that these deliberations did not
constitute negotiations between the parties, but we had this
unique gathering of individuals to discuss it with a view toward
getting some policy formulations to decision makers," said Edward
Djerejian, director of the university's James Baker Institute for
Public Policy.
</P>
<P>
Djerejian, who initiated the meetings, said about 20 of "the
very top people" in the Mideast policy world attended the
sessions, including Syria's ambassador to Washington Walid Mualem,
and Uzi Arad, foreign policy adviser to Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu. U.S Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk
and former Secretary of State James Baker also attended the
sessions.

<HEADLINE> FAO Puts Global Fish Business at 250 Bln Dlrs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- World fish business is
estimated at over 250 billion U.S. dollars a year, according to
the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
</P>
<P>
The figure obtained here Wednesday includes fish production
valued at 120 billion dollars, plus trade and value-addition on
the way to the consumer, FAO said in a study released at the
on-going meeting on fish trade in Bremen, Germany, on June 3-6.
</P>
<P>
Fish is an important food product exported by developing
countries, coming well before coffee, banana and tea, the study
quoted FAO fisheries expert Erhard Ruckes as saying.
</P>
<P>
Fish exports by developing countries rose to 17.2 billion
dollars in 1996 from 5.2 billion dollars in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Developed countries account for more than 80 percent of total
fish imports, with Japan topping the list, followed by the United
States and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The study sees recent changes by importers in quality control
measures on fishery products as a new challenge to the developing
world.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the changes, countries like India, Bangladesh,
Madagascar, Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique and Uganda have been
facing difficulties in exporting their fish products since 1997,
according to FAO.
</P>
<P>
Because of eco-labeling, which requires that fish produce
from a sustainably managed resource, small-scale fishermen in the
developing countries could be disadvantageous as it is difficult
for them to certify their fish production, FAO added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Iraq Has Much Progress to Make to Get </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- If Iraq wants sanctions to
be lifted, it has a lot of progress to make, Bill Richardson, the
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Richardson made the remarks after the morning session of a
special Security Council briefing given by Butler Richard,
executive chairman of the United Nations Special Commission
(UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
"UNSCOM has dealt a devastating blow to Iraq's credibility. I
think Iraq has had a bad day here," Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
According U.N. sources, Butler Richard, in his briefing, had
demonstrated a pattern of concealment of missile production and
showed how, in 1991, Iraq said it had destroyed its ballistic
missiles but surveillance photos showed no activity at the site.
</P>
<P>
"There is some disturbing information about propellants that
lead us to believe that in the missile program this is serious,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Richardson said UNSCOM had produced documents, charts and
photos that catalogue the gap and inconsistencies of Iraq's
disarmament claims.
</P>
<P>
Iraq needs a clean bill of health from UNSCOM and the
International Atomic Energy Agency before the Security Council can
consider lifting the sanctions in force since Iraq invaded Kuwait
in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Albright: U.S. to Make New Initiative for Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said Wednesday that the United States would make a new
initiative to try to break the current dilemma in the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
She was answering a question at a news conference about a
statement Wednesday by U.S. ambassador to Israel Edward Walker
that Washington would decide within days whether to press ahead
with a peace initiative that has faltered because of Israel's
objection to a U.S. proposal on Israeli troops' withdrawal from
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the United States would continue talks on the
peace process so long as they were "constructive." But she said
when she felt that was not the case, she would be "the first one
that is going to declare that they are not."
</P>
<P>
"I will make that determination at the time. I'm not going to
give it a specific time frame, but soon," she added. "This is not
something that's going to go on much longer."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister Jawad al-Anani
disclosed in Amman that U.S. Undersecretary of State Thomas
Pickering had asked Arab states to delay announcement of a
proposed summit to give the U.S. initiative more time to succeed.
</P>
<P>
"The Americans estimate the period between one week to 10
days," Anani said.
</P>
<P>
Albright and her aides have repeatedly said that if current
peace efforts stalled completely, they would announce the end of
the U.S. initiative in its present form.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced
Wednesday the approval of a 5 million U.S. dollar equivalent
interest-free credit to the government of Mongolia for a fiscal
technical assistance project.
</P>
<P>
The overall objective of this project is long-term
capacity-building and institutional development, and
sustainability is at the heart of the project. The project will
finance advisory services and training in government accounting,
treasury debt and cash management, auditing, management skills,
and related disciplines.
</P>
<P>
The credit will be provided by the International Development
Association (IDA), the World Bank's concessional lending arm for
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
This project is, in part, a follow-up to the first IDA
technical assistance credit, which financed specialist advisory
assistance and training in macroeconomic management and related
disciplines for staff of six core Mongolian economic agencies.
</P>
<P>
The IDA has provided technical assistance for development of
the government's macroeconomic management capability since 1992
and is currently supporting structural reforms in the banking and
enterprise sectors.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Chamber Urges China's MFN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Chamber of Commerce
Wednesday said the Clinton administration's effort to extend
normal trade relations to China is the right step for business and
consumers, and urged Congress to support the president's decision.
</P>
<P>
"The evidence is clear -- a stable U.S.-China commercial
framework will open markets for U.S. exports and generate more jobs
for American workers," said Willard Workman, chamber vice president
for international.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton proposed earlier Wednesday the renewal
of China's Most-Favored Nation (MFN) trade status for another
year. He said that it is vital for the United States to maintain
normal trade relationship with that Asian country.
</P>
<P>
Workman said, "The United States needs to maintain bipartisan
support for a clear, credible and consistent long-term China
policy. That's why Congress should support the president's
decision."
</P>
<P>
He warned that if MFN is not renewed, U.S. exports to China and
corresponding American business and jobs will be at risk. "We
cannot allow that to happen."
</P>
<P>
The MFN status allows goods to be sold in the U.S. with normal
tariffs. It is extended to most nations and was first granted to
China in 1979. The annual renewal of China's MFN has become an
opportunity to debate the U.S. China policy, a controversial issue
in the United States for years.
</P>
<P>
Although Congress has gone along with the Administration for
extending the trade status to China, the heated debate would
usually pick up the issues of human rights and proliferation.
</P>
<P>
"A policy of engagement with China is our national interests,"
said Workman. "And this policy has worked. It promotes American
interests on issues of vital importance, including security,
non-proliferation, the rule of law, and human rights as well as
trade."
</P>
<P>
He noted that American companies and workers have a huge stake
in U.S.-China trade relations. In 1997, the United States exported
approximately 12.8 billion U.S. dollars in goods and services to
China. These exports support hundreds of thousands of high-wage
American jobs.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is the world's largest business
federation representing more than 3 million businesses and
organizations of every size, sector and region.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Urges Public to Prepare for Disasters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States government
Wednesday called for local communities' preparations for disasters
before they strike.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) asked cities,
towns and counties across the country to form partnerships among
local business and civic leaders to prepare for disaster.
</P>
<P>
"I have seen too much devastation in the last five years; I
have seen too many lives lost and too many dreams destroyed,"
James Lee Witt, director of the FEMA, told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to change the way we deal with disaster," he
said. "We must put an end to the repetitive cycle of damage and
repair, damage and repair. We cannot continue to do the same
things over and over again."
</P>
<P>
Witt said natural disasters are becoming more severe, more
damaging and more costly. The government paid out 2.8 billion U.S.
dollars from 1978 to 1998 to deal with recurring flood losses
alone. In the same 20-year period, the agency has spent 20 billion
dollars overall on disaster recovery efforts, much of it toward
the end of the period.
</P>
<P>
He said natural disasters have killed 181 people this year
alone.
</P>
<P>
Under the disaster preparedness proposal, dubbed Project
Impact, Witt said, 30 million U.S. dollars in seed money is
earmarked for the effort this year, with 50 million dollars
requested for the fiscal year starting next October.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American Development
Bank Wednesday announced the approval of an 80 million U.S. dollar
loan to the province of Mendoza, Argentina, to support its reform
program in the state.
</P>
<P>
The program includes public sector modernization and measures
to balance public revenue and expenditure. Steps will be taken to
improve spending efficiency and tax administration and to
modernize priority areas of the executive, legislative and
judicial branches.
</P>
<P>
About two thirds of the total resources for the project will be
dedicated to social development and reform of the health sector,
benefiting low income groups and increasing the coverage and
quality of basic services.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the IDB loan, local counterpart funds total 80
million dollars for the project.
</P>
<P>
The loan is the second made by the IDB directly to a province
in Argentina for the purpose of extending reforms already
undertaken at the national level. The first loan of this type was
provided to the province of Buenos Aires in December 1996.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Arrests Former PLO Officer for Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States has arrested a
former Palestine Liberation Organization officer who has been
convicted for the bombing of a Hawaii-bound U.S. airliner in 1982,
Justice Department officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
They said Mohammad Rashid was scheduled to have an initial
appearance late in the day in U.S. District Court in Washington,
D.C..
</P>
<P>
Rashid was found involved in the 1982 bombing of a Pan American
airliner which exploded over Hawaii, killing a Japanese teenager
and injuring 15 other passengers. The plan managed to land safely.
</P>
<P>
He had been tracked around the world by the United States and
was arrested on an American tip-off at Athens international
airport in 1988. Greece put him on trial after rejecting an
extradition request from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Rashid was sentenced by a Greek court to 18 years in prison,
but was released at the end of 1996 by Greece for his "good
behavior." The move, however, enraged the United States, which had
been continuing its tracking.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department officials declined to give details of
how Rashid was captured.
</P>
<P>
Rashid steadfastly has denied involvement in the bombing and
said he was the victim of mistaken identity.

<HEADLINE> German Train Crash Still a Puzzle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ESCHEDE, Germany, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The reason for the
worst-ever German train crash which occurred Wednesday morning
still remains unclear after the driver of the high-speed train was
uninjured and only knew of the crash afterwards.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 people were killed and 300 others injured when
the InterCity Express (ICE) derailed and slammed into a road
bridge near a small rail station of the northeastern German town
of Eschede at 11:10 a.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Investigators told reporters that the front engine of the train
had become detained from its 14 carriages and went on at high
speed towards the rail station. The driver only knew of the
accident after he felt a slight jerk and exercised the emergency
brake to stop the engine.
</P>
<P>
Earlier media reports said the train, en route from Munich to
Hamburg, was derailed after hitting a car which had plunged onto
the rail tracks after a road accident on the bridge. But this
scenario cannot explain why the engine remains intact.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said later the automobile concerned had
actually parked on the bridge and fallen onto the ground after the
bridge collapsed due to the train crash.
</P>
<P>
German rail authorities said that there were still no signs of
a technical defect on the train or on the track.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 1,000 rescue workers are still busy on the
scene to try to retrieve bodies and possible survivors trapped
under the train wreckage. With evening setting in, they are still
unable to reach two of the coaches wedged under the remains of the
bridge.
</P>
<P>
According to government officials, German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl has broken off a German-Italian summit in the Italian city of
Bologna and will return to Germany later in the evening.
</P>
<P>
German President Roman Herzog and British Prime Minister Tony
Blair meanwhile have sent condolences to the victims.

ATHENS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Greek Parliament President Apostolos
Kaklamanis Wednesday urged Germany to resolve the issue of Greek
claims of wartime reparations from Germany as well as clarify its
stance over the repayment of a wartime loan taken out by the Nazis
during the World War II occupation of Greece.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a delegation from the Bundestag's Legal Committee,
Kaklamanis said that Germany should reconsider the issue of
reparations and the loan so as not to cause problems to the good
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a court in the central Greek city of Livadeia
ordered Germany to pay 32 million U.S. dollars in reparations to
the village of Distomo, where 214 residents were killed by Nazi
soldiers on June 10, 1944, but the German government refused to
comply with the Greek ruling.
</P>
<P>
The German delegation, currently in Greece for talks on legal
and European policy issues, is also expected to meet with Greek
Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos, Public Order Minister George
Romeos and other Greek government officials.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- More than half a foot of snow
fell on mountainous areas in western South Dakota Wednesday
morning, but heat struck the southern part of the United States a
day earlier.
</P>
<P>
The thunderstorms-led cold air across the Plains brought up to
seven inches of snow to the western part of the state, the
second-latest snowfall ever recorded in Rapid City in the Black
Hills. The previous snow was recorded on June 13, 1969, the
Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Up to three inches of snow also fell on the adjacent Plains and
in the eastern end of the state.
</P>
<P>
In Rapid City, temperature fell to a record low of 32 degrees
(zero degree centigrade), knocking one degree off the former
record for the date, set in 1951. Parts of northern Nebraska also
had lows in the low 30s.
</P>
<P>
However, heat records fell across western Texas Tuesday. At
Wichita Falls, Texas, it was 109 degrees (42.7 degree centigrade),
surpassing the previous high reading of 101 (38 degree centigrade)
on the day in 1993.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Condemns Terrorist Attacks in Tehran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States condemns
terrorist attacks in Tehran, the State Department said Wednesday
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that the outlawed Iranian opposition group
the Mujahedeen Khalq claimed responsibility for a blast Tuesday in
Tehran, that killed at least three people and injured six.
</P>
<P>
"The United States government strongly condemns the terrorist
attacks in Tehran.... We offer our condolences to the victims,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The United States government reiterates its strong
condemnation of any and all terrorist attacks wherever they
occur," it added.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say Washington's public condemnation against
Mujahedeen shows the Clinton administration intended to open
dialogue with the Iranian government. Behind the scenes, the
Mujahedeen's allies continue to run offices in Washington.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Seek Common Ground to Defuse Nuclear Tensions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. administration
official said Wednesday that Washington will seek common ground at
a Geneva meeting to reverse the deteriorating situation in South
Asia following nuclear tests by India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, the United States will not press other permanent
members of the Security Council to impose sanctions on the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Karl Inderfurth, assistant secretary of state for South Asian
affairs, told a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee hearting
that the Geneva meeting, scheduled on Thursday, was seeking to
"defuse the current tensions in South Asia following last
month's nuclear test by India and Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
He said the United States would not press other permanent
members of the Security Council -- Britain, China, France and
Russia, who will attend the Geneva meeting, -- to impose sanctions
on the two countries, which he said would not be productive.
</P>
<P>
Inderfurth told the panel that the United States would "firmly
reject" any move to bring India and Pakistan into the existing
club of the existing five nuclear powers, spelled out in the
nonproliferation treaty.
</P>
<P>
"There is no disposition to reward any nation for blasting its
way into the nuclear-state category," he said.
</P>
<P>
Inderfurth also said both India and Pakistan may have
overstated the number of nuclear tests they conducted, and the
variety of devices they tested.
</P>
<P>
India has claimed five tests, Pakistan six. But Inderfurth said
the two countries likely exploded "less than they said" and that
the precise number was still being determined by scrutinizing
seismic and other data.

<HEADLINE> German Train Crash Still a Puzzle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ESCHEDE, Germany, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The reason for the
worst-ever German train crash which occurred Wednesday morning
still remains unclear after the driver of the high-speed train was
uninjured and only knew of the crash afterwards.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 people were killed and 300 others injured when
the InterCity Express (ICE) derailed and slammed into a road
bridge near a small rail station of the northeastern German town
of Eschede at 11:10 a.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Investigators told reporters that the front engine of the train
had become detached from its 14 carriages and went on at high
speed towards the rail station. The driver only knew of the
accident after he felt a slight jerk and exercised the emergency
brake to stop the engine.
</P>
<P>
Earlier media reports said the train, en route from Munich to
Hamburg, was derailed after hitting a car which had plunged onto
the rail tracks after a road accident on the bridge. But this
scenario cannot explain why the engine remains intact.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said later the automobile concerned had
actually parked on the bridge and fallen onto the ground after the
bridge collapsed due to the train crash.
</P>
<P>
German rail authorities said that there were still no signs of
a technical defect on the train or on the track.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 1,000 rescue workers are still busy on the
scene to try to retrieve bodies and possible survivors trapped
under the train wreckage. With evening setting in, they are still
unable to reach two of the coaches wedged under the remains of the
bridge.
</P>
<P>
According to government officials, German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl has broken off a German-Italian summit in the Italian city of
Bologna and will return to Germany later in the evening.
</P>
<P>
German President Roman Herzog and British Prime Minister Tony
Blair meanwhile have sent condolences to the victims.
